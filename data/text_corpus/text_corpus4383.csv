21915,this study addresses subsea search applications where an autonomous underwater vehicle auv is tasked with finding the target density in a given search region within finite time we assume that auv is equipped with a side scan sonar sensor that detects the targets at the sampled location we consider that sensor performance is dependent on local environmental conditions e g clutter density sediment type that vary throughout the search region and we presume that environmental conditions are unknown or partially known due to uncertain and varying environmental conditions resulting search performance is also uncertain and it varies by location this paper specifically considers the cases where environmental information can be acquired either by a separate vehicle or by the same vehicle that performs the search task our main contribution is to formally derive a decision theoretic cost function to compute the locations where the environmental information should be acquired so that the performance of the search task can be improved for the cases where computing the optimal locations to sample the environment is computationally expensive we offer an approximation approach that yields provable near optimal paths we show that our decision theoretic cost function outperforms the information maximization approach which is often employed in similar applications msc 90b40 68t37 68t40

unknown number of objects in a bounded search environment and within limited time we assume that the environment affects sensor performance and local environmental conditions vary by location that is in some locations the search sensor is expected to perform better than in other locations yetkin et al 2015 shows how guidance algorithms for search missions can incorporate stochastic knowledge of the environment to improve search performance in this study we specifically consider the cases where environmental information can be acquired as part of the overall search task the principal contributions of this study show where environmental information should be acquired in order to improve overall search performance we address two cases 1 environmental characterization is performed prior to a search mission by a separate asset than the search vehicle and 2 environmental characterization is performed at the same time as search by the same vehicle that performs the search task in this study we extend our findings in our prior work yetkin et al 2015 2016 we use a decision theoretic value function that is associated with the accuracy of our estimate of the number of objects in the environment because search performance is dependent on the environment knowledge of the environment can improve search performance due to better search plans for example one may choose to avoid searching areas that are known to contain excessive clutter and many false positives in favor of environments with few false positives in situations where the environment is poorly known efforts to acquire environmental information may lead to improved search effectiveness we address the case that stochastic knowledge of the environment can be acquired and we describe where the environment should be surveyed in order to improve overall search performance one approach for selecting where to acquire environmental information is simply to characterize locations that yield the greatest reduction of uncertainty about the environment in other words one might seek to maximize reduction in entropy of the distribution that describe the environment which is often employed in similar applications see for example coleman and block 2007 elfes 1992 papadimitriou et al 2000 in contrast we show that reducing uncertainty in the environment is not the best approach a primary contribution of this work is to show that environmental information should be acquired at the locations where the greatest reduction of uncertainty in anticipated search performance will occur where we define search performance as the probability that the estimate for the number of objects in the environment is correct computing the optimal locations to acquire the environment information can be computationally expensive when the planning horizon is large to address the computational challenge of our approach we show an approximation approach that yields provably near optimal paths the remainder of this paper is organized as follows an overview of search theory and the benefit of acquiring environmental information in some search missions is provided in section 2 in section 3 we formulate the search problem and define the observation model in section 4 we define the objective function that maximizes the estimation accuracy in section 5 and section 6 we describe our proposed cost function to compute the locations where environmental characterization should be performed section 7 provides the numerical results that illustrate our approach 2 related work 2 1 search theory search theory is concerned with finding an optimal allocation of available search effort to locate a lost or hidden target such that a reward specified as a measure of search effectiveness is maximized bernard koopman offered one of the first systematic approaches to the search problem koopman 1957 his work laid the foundations of the problem and since then the search problem received a lot of attention mainly from the operations research community some notable examples include chung and burdick 2012a kadane 1971 kimeldorf and smith 1979 kress et al 2008 richardson 1988 and stone et al 1972 in a real world search application sensor measurements can be noisy due to false negatives i e failing to detect a target that is present and false positives i e falsely detecting a target when the target is not present at the location local environmental conditions can also affect the number of false positives and false negatives the sensor observes and deterministic knowledge on environmental conditions is often unavailable however existing literature in search theory rarely addresses the requirements of real world search applications for instance the existence of false positives is mostly ignored in existing works exceptions include chung and burdick 2012b dobbie 1973 kress et al 2008 kriheli et al 2016 pollock 1964 and stone et al 1972 where the effect of environmental conditions on sensor performance is not accounted for to best of our knowledge there is no work in the literature that addresses both the existence of false positives and multiple targets our work builds upon prior work by accounting for multiple targets false alarms non zero cost of moving to another search location and uncertainty in the environment to best of our knowledge this is the first study to account for all these factors together we do not address coverage problems as in choset 2001 or exhaustive search rather we consider applications where there is a time or distance constraint and we seek solutions where we achieve the best search performance within a time or distance constraint due to this constraint optimal search paths may not visit every location indeed in some scenarios it is possible that some locations are visited more than once while other locations are never visited at all 2 2 effect of environment information we consider that the local environmental conditions affect the sensor performance and that the environment varies throughout the search region hence the sensor performs better in some locations than in others the environment at a location may not be known with certainty and we may only have a probabilistic knowledge on the environment when possible acquiring information about the local environmental conditions can significantly improve the results of a follow on search mission the question is where to sample the environment so that the most improvement in search performance can be obtained this is the fundamental question we seek to answer in this study and we show that a new approach is needed to address the cases where the limited planning horizon of the mission does not allow exhaustive search of the environment the effect of the environment on search performance is well known de guenin is the first to account for the effect of environmental conditions on search performance de guenin 1961 he illustrated the intuitive effect of environmental conditions on detection probability with a simple example of visual search where the detection probability depends upon the atmospheric conditions that may not be uniform and thus for the same search effort the detection probability will be higher in clear areas than in overcast areas in subsea applications where sonar is used for search variations in the seabed induce significant variation in probability of detection and probability of false alarm elmore et al 2007 zare and cobb 2013 similarly in terrestrial applications using ground penetrating radar background clutter and soil properties have significant effect on search results gader et al 2001 takahashi et al 2011a b for the cases where the search environment is unknown or partially known reducing the uncertainty in the environment can greatly improve search performance for the particular trial in harris et al 2005 the experimental results show that the mine hunting mission takes 40 less time when the environment is known compared to when there is no prior environmental information in our prior work yetkin et al 2015 we also show that uncertainty in the environment leads to uncertainty in search performance which can result in terminating the search mission too early and thus obtaining poor search performance we note that the existing literature on robotic exploration see bourgault et al 2002 carrillo et al 2015 makarenko et al 2002 yamauchi 1997 among many examples provides little insight to the applications we address robotic exploration addresses the challenge of building a map in contrast we seek to characterize a subset of the environment with respect to search sensor performance for the goal of improving search effectiveness 3 problem formulation search and environmental characterization are accomplished using different sensors that can be mounted on different vehicles or on the same vehicle when the sensors are placed on different vehicles the vehicle that possesses the search sensor is called the search vehicle and the vehicle that possesses the environmental characterization sensor is called the environmental characterization vehicle when the search and environmental characterization sensors operate simultaneously on a single vehicle we informally refer to the vehicle as the search environmental characterization vehicle in this section we provide the notation and the formal definition of the search problem a list of variables is provided in table c 1 in appendix 3 1 preliminaries a search grid g r 2 is partitioned into k disjoint cells and each cell in the search grid is associated with random variables x and e random variable x represents the number of objects and random variable e represents the environmental conditions in the cell we consider that the number of objects and the environmental conditions in each is independent throughout the search grid that is for cells i and j x i is independent of x j and e i is independent of e j the objective of the search mission is to estimate x 1 x k by using a sensor to detect objects in each cell we assume that deterministic knowledge of the environmental conditions is unavailable but the finite set of environments w 1 w 2 w m in the search grid is known and a probabilistic knowledge on these environments is available for each cell for instance the environment probability distribution for cell i is expressed p 1 i p 2 i p m i where p j i p e i w j is the probability that the actual environment in cell i is w j we note that in practice clustering of different types of environmental conditions can be carried out by using a previously acquired environment dataset in the search domain see for example mcmahon et al 2017 3 2 sequential bayesian update for the search vehicle when the search vehicle samples from a location it observes the number of objects in that location and an imperfect measurement z z of the actual number of objects in the location is acquired we denote by z both the set of possible search measurements i e z z and the random variable associated with a search measurement in a cell i e z i z i we note that the acquired measurement z includes both false positives and false negatives the sensor model that we choose for the numerical illustrations in section 7 is 1 p z x w j k 0 min x z x k d j k 1 d j x k 1 f j f j z k which is the likelihood of observing z objects when x is the true number of objects at the location and the environment is w j in 1 0 f j 1 denotes the probability of one or more false alarms and 0 d j 1 denotes the probability of detection note that both f j and d j are assumed to vary as functions of the environment type w j the details of the search sensor model is described in prior work shende et al 2012 yetkin et al 2015 and omitted here for brevity we note that other expressions for the sensor model are also possible and our results do not depend on this specific sensor model except for numerical illustrations upon acquiring a search measurement z we use bayesian update law to update the distribution p x z w j 2 p x x z w j p z x w j p x x x p z x x w j p x x 3 3 sequential bayesian update for the environmental characterization vehicle when the environment characterization vehicle samples from a location it observes the environmental conditions in that location and an imperfect measurement y y of the true environment at the location is acquired we denote by y both the set of possible environment measurements i e y y and the random variable associated with an environment measurement at a cell i e y i y i we assume the likelihood of observing an environment measurement y when the true environment is w j is known we use bayesian update law to compute the posterior distribution of the environment after observing y 3 p e w j y y p y e w j p e w j j p y e w j p e w j 3 4 sequential bayesian update for the search environmental characterization vehicle when the search sensor and the environmental characterization sensor operate simultaneously on a single vehicle the noisy observations z and y are acquired simultaneously given z and y measurements acquired at a location we represent the updated probability distribution of the number of objects unconditioned on the environment 4 p x x z y j p x x z w j p e w j y where the posterior distributions p x x z w j and p e w j y y follow from 2 and 3 respectively 4 path planning for the search vehicle we perform environmental characterization to improve the results of a search mission to better understand the value of acquiring an environment measurement at a location we seek to quantify the effect of the acquired environment measurements on search results thus in this section we briefly present the value of searching a location and the objective function to compute the optimal search paths for more details on path planning for the search vehicle we refer the reader to our prior work yetkin et al 2015 the search objective is to accurately estimate the number of objects in each cell however due to imperfect sensor measurements our estimate of the number of objects in a cell can be different than the true number of objects hence we define that the goal of searching a location is to maximize the accuracy of our estimate of the number of objects at that location that is we seek to maximize the probability that our estimate of the number of objects after searching a location will be correct we use a zero one utility function to compute the value of forming an estimate δ x z of the true number of objects x after acquiring search measurement z 5 u x δ x z 1 if x δ x z 0 if x δ x z we believe the zero one utility function in 5 adequately assesses the value of forming an estimate for the applications where an incorrect estimate may have severe consequences e g subsea mine hunting missions for the applications where incorrect estimates are also valued one can use a linear loss function to assess the value to forming an estimate of the number of objects see for example mcmahon et al 2017 given that the acquired measurement is z and the environment is w j bayes estimator is 6 δ x z arg max δ x z e u x δ x z z w j that maximizes the expected values of the zero one utility function in 5 the value of searching a location is 7 e u x δ x z j 1 m p e w j e u x δ x z w j and we call this the anticipated estimation accuracy let γ q 1 q n be a candidate search path that traverses the cells q 1 q n g and let c γ be the budget constraint on the search mission due to limited time distance the vehicle can traverse we define c γ to denote the cost for traversing a path γ note that when the traversal cost for moving from one location to another is unity c γ is simply the number of cells traversed by γ when the vehicle makes multiple visits to a cell we acquire a set of independent search measurements we denote by z both a single search measurement and a set of search measurements when a cell is visited multiple times by γ then the expected utility of traversing γ is 8 e u x δ x z γ q i γ e u x q i δ x z q i i g γ max x i p x i x i where g γ denotes the remaining cells in the search grid that are not traversed by γ and max x i p x i x i is the certainty in the number of objects in cell i prior to acquiring new measurements let ω γ denote the finite collection of feasible search paths then the optimal search path is 9 γ arg max γ ω γ e u x δ x z γ subject to 10 c γ c γ 5 path planning for the environmental characterization vehicle the primary objective of environmental characterization is to improve search performance with additional information about the environment at a few locations it might be possible to avoid searching locations where the sensor performs poorly in favor of places where the sensor performs well we consider the case where environmental characterization is performed prior to search and we assume that both environmental characterization and search cannot be performed exhaustively due to limited resources 5 1 entropy change maximization when environment information can be acquired only in some locations due to limited resources the question is to determine where to optimally sample the environment one approach that is often used in similar applications is to maximize the change in entropy due to acquired environment measurements coleman and block 2007 elfes 1992 papadimitriou et al 2000 we briefly describe a typical entropy approach for selecting where to sample the environment so that we can compare it to our proposed approach let h e w j denote the prior entropy of the probability distribution p e w j and let h e w j y y be the posterior entropy after acquiring the environment measurement y the expected amount of change in the entropy for a future environment measurement y can be computed by j e h e w j y h e w j y y let η be a candidate path for the environment characterization vehicle ω η be the finite collection of feasible paths and c η be the budget constraint on the environment characterization mission then the best path to characterize the environment based on the entropy change maximization method is 11 η arg max η ω η j η e subject to c η c η however we note that the purpose of environmental characterization in this study is not to explore the environment but to improve the performance of a follow on search mission we show in section 7 via numerical studies that maximizing change in entropy does not maximize the performance of follow on search missions 5 2 environmental loss function in order to improve the performance of a follow on search mission by exploring the environment we first address how the uncertainty in the environment affects the search performance when we compute the value of searching a location in 7 we average the search value over all possible environments with respect to the prior environment probability distribution which can result in a different search value than the true search value given true environment at the location that is uncertainty in the environment results in deviations from actual search results and degrades search performance after a mission let e be the true environment and v w j denote the value of searching a location with environment w j 12 v w j e u x δ x z e w j in order to penalize the deviations from actual search performance we define a linear loss function 13 l v e δ e y c 1 v e v δ e y if δ e y e c 2 v δ e y v e if δ e y e where c 1 c 2 0 are the relative costs of over and underestimating search performance and δ e y is an estimate of the environment after environment measurement y is acquired the notation and represent a preference ordering among the environments when v w i v w j for environments w i and w j we say w i w j and when v w i v w j we say w i w j throughout this paper we consider a distinct and ordered set of environments so that w 1 w 2 w m when our environment estimate is worse than the true environment δ e y e too much search effort can be allocated to the same location since the available search effort we can apply to search the region is limited allocating unnecessary search effort to the same location may degrade the overall search performance on the other hand when our environment estimate is greater than the true environment δ e y e we exaggerate the value of searching a location which may result in poorly allocated search effort and exaggerated search performance after a mission in the numerical illustrations in section 7 we choose c 1 c 2 so that overestimation is more penalized than underestimation after observing environment measurement y at a location we compute the posterior probability distribution of the environments p w j y in 3 we then compute the expected loss of forming environment estimate δ e y with respect to the posterior distribution p w j y 14 e l v e δ e y y y j 1 m p w j y l v w j δ e y and we choose the bayes estimator δ e y that minimizes the expected loss in 14 15 δ e y arg min δ e y e l v e δ e y y let f e y w n be such that 16 f e y w n p e w n y j 1 n p e w j y for n 1 2 m where 16 follows since w 1 w 2 w m then the bayes estimator 15 with respect to the linear loss function in 13 is 17 δ e y w l 1 where 18 l arg max n n 1 2 m 1 f e y w n c 1 c 1 c 2 we note that the proof for 17 can be found in any standard book on statistical decisions see for example berger 2013 5 3 path planning a benefit of environmental surveys is to reduce the error in anticipated search performance due to uncertainty in the environment when a location is not visited by the search vehicle during a search mission acquiring an environment measurement at that location will not affect search performance from the loss function in 13 computing the estimate 15 of the environment after acquiring environment measurement y yields the conditional expected loss 19 e l v e δ e y y j 1 m p e w j y l v w j δ e y that quantifies the amount of uncertainty in anticipated estimation accuracy after acquiring y informally speaking the prior loss before acquiring an environment measurement represents the prior uncertainty and the conditional expected loss in 19 represents the posterior uncertainty in search performance for notational convenience we define r y to denote the reduction of uncertainty in anticipated estimation accuracy due to environment measurement y r y e l v e δ e e l v e δ e y y y then the gain of acquiring an environment measurement y i in cell i is the reduction of uncertainty in anticipated estimation accuracy given that cell i is visited by the search vehicle 20 g y i i i γ y i r y i where the notation γ y denote the best path for the search vehicle when the probability distribution of the environment is updated with the acquired measurement y and the indicator function i i γ y i y i c 1 is defined 21 i i γ y i 1 i γ y i c i γ y i where 0 c 1 is a parameter to determine the relative gain of sampling the environment at locations that will not be searched without loss of generality we consider that c 0 let η q 1 q 2 q m be a candidate path for the environment characterization vehicle and recall that ω η is the finite collection of feasible characterization paths we denote by y both a single environment measurement and a set of independent environment measurements when a cell is visited multiple times by η then the expected characterization gain of traversing η is 22 e g η y η p y η y η q i η i i γ y i r y q i and the optimal path is 23 η arg max η ω η e g η subject to 24 c η c η 5 4 approximating the characterization gain of a path computing the optimal path for the environment characterization vehicle in 23 can be computationally very expensive this is mainly due to large computational requirements of computing the optimal search path for each set of environment measurements along a candidate path η thus we also propose an approximate method that reduces the computational complexity of the solution in 23 our approximate solution yields provably near optimal paths let ω η be the set of environment characterization paths such that c η c η let denote the size of a set or an array and let s denote the computational complexity of computing the optimal search paths then the solution in 23 has a computational complexity of o ω η m η s where m is the number of environments in the search domain this shows that the exponential increase in the computational complexity is dominated by the large planning horizon for the characterization vehicle one approach to reduce this computational complexity is to use a receding horizon strategy where we compute the paths for a shorter horizon while receding horizon approach may require less computational power compared to computing the paths for the entire planning horizon it may still be infeasible unless the considered planning horizon is sufficiently small in which case the resulting performance will be poor instead our approach to reduce the complexity of the solution in 23 aims to approximate the characterization gain of traversing a path we start with re arranging the terms in 22 by partitioning a path η into two parts a cell q i η and the other cells in the path 25 e g η y η p y η y η q i η i q i γ y η r y q i q i η y q i r y q i y η q i i q i γ y η p y η y η where η q i denotes the set of cells in η except cell q i the terms up to the third summation in 25 denote the characterization gain of acquiring the environment measurement y from cell q i η and the other terms that start with the third summation denote how likely it is that sampling cell q i will improve the performance of a follow on search mission that is it represents the chances that cell q i will be visited during a follow on search mission based on the environment measurements that we may acquire along the path η note that since η q 1 q 2 q m the joint probability p y η y η in 25 can be expressed 26 p y η y η p y q 1 y q 1 p y q m y q m thus we can re write 25 27 e g η q i η y q i p y q i y q i r y q i p η q i where p η q i is the total probability of every possible sets of the environment measurements y q 1 y q 2 y q i 1 y q i 1 y q m such that the optimal search path associated with the updated environment distributions visits cell q i 29 p η q i y η q i i q i γ y η p y η q i y η q i y η q i q i γ y η p y η q i y η q i indeed the computational cost of 27 is dominated by p η q i in 29 thus we use a sample based method to compute an empirical estimate of p η q i which results in a significant speed up in computing the characterization path for each cell q i η and for every environment measurement y q i y we perform n trials where in each trial we randomly sample an environment measurement from the probability distribution p y q j y q j for all q j η such that j i then with the updated environment distributions we compute the optimal search path and see whether the corresponding path visits cell q i or not we simply count the number of times cell q i is being visited by the resulting search path out of n trials and we denote this number by k since this is repeated for every other cell in the path we may sample the same environment measurement y q i from cell q i during a trial of another cell let n y q i be the number of times y q i is sampled in cell q i during the trials of the other cells in path η and let k y q i be the number of times cell q i is contained in the corresponding search path out of these n y q i trials then the empirical estimate of p η q i is 30 p ˆ η q i k k y q i n n y q i obtaining a close estimate of p η q i is important to compute a near optimal characterization path we show that a bound on the distance between p η q i and p ˆ η q i can be computed we first note that after each trial for a cell that cell is either contained in the follow on search path or it is not contained thus we can cast each trial as a bernoulli trial where the result of the trial is either 1 if the cell is contained in the search path or it is 0 if the cell is not contained then we use hoeffding s inequality 15 to obtain a probabilistic bound on the difference between p η q i and p ˆ η q i 31 p p η q i p ˆ η q i ϵ n 1 2 exp 2 ϵ 2 n where n n n y q i and ϵ 0 replacing p η q i with its estimate p ˆ η q i in 27 approximates the characterization gain of a path we denote the approximate characterization gain of a path η by e g ˆ η 32 e g ˆ η q i η y q i k k y q i n n y q i p y q i y q i r y q i finally we select the path that maximizes the approximate characterization gain in 32 subject to the budget constraint in 24 33 η ˆ arg max η ω η e g ˆ η now we define the following theorem and the corollary where we first bound the difference between the characterization gain and the approximate characterization gain for a path and we then bound the difference between the optimal characterization gain and the approximately optimal characterization gain proofs for both the theorem and the corollary are provided in appendix theorem 1 the probability of the difference between the characterization gain 27 and its estimate 32 for a path η satisfying a specific bound is expressed 34 p e g η e g ˆ η ϵ n η 1 2 exp 2 ϵ 2 n corollary 1 for the optimal characterization path η in 23 and the approximate path η ˆ in 33 the difference in expected characterization gain satisfies 35 p e g η e g η ˆ 2 ϵ n η 1 2 exp 2 ϵ 2 n the proposed approximation approach yields a provably near optimal path for the environment characterization vehicle the computational complexity of the solution is reduced from o ω η m η s to o ω η η m n s in general choosing a larger value for n is likely to reduce the approximation error however our preliminary results show that a small value for n is often sufficient to obtain a close approximation 5 5 approximating the characterization gain of a cell in this section we introduce an alternative approach to approximate the optimal characterization gain our alternative approach assumes that the search paths are composed of sequences of parallel straight lines this assumption arises often in subsea applications that rely on side scan imaging sonar see for example hayes and gough 2009 houston et al 2002 unlike the proposed approach in section 5 4 our approach in this section can only apply to certain classes of mapping problems suppose the search area g consists of a set of parallel straight lines a line is either a row or a column l 1 l 2 l n l when each line corresponds to a row n l n r and when each line corresponds to a column n l n c suppose that the j th line traverses the cells q j 1 q j 2 q j k thus when the vehicle traverses line l j it samples from cells q j 1 q j 2 q j k let η be a candidate path for the environment characterization vehicle that consists of lines l 1 l 2 l k and consider that cell i η is contained in l j we claim that the value of characterizing cell i along path η can be closely approximated by the value of characterizing cell i along line l j that is 36 e g q i η y q i p y q i y q i r y q i p η q i 37 y q i p y q i y q i r y q i p l j q i where 38 p l j q i y l j q i q i γ y l j p y l j q i y l j q i due to 37 we can compute the value of characterizing a particular cell by only looking at the cells in the associated line a row or a column by doing so we can compute the characterization gain for each cell individually then the characterization gain of a path is simply the summation of the characterization gain of each cell in that path we note that we do not have a formal guarantee of how closely 37 approximates 36 however our initial tests as well as the intuition suggest that 36 can be well approximated by 37 since computing p l j q i in 38 can be very expensive when the length of a line is large we instead compute an empirical estimate of p l j q i as described in section 5 4 for each cell in the search grid we perform n trials to compute an empirical estimate of p l j q i where in each trial we sample environment measurements from the remaining cells in line l j after approximating the characterization gain for each cell individually we apply an exact branch and bound method similar to our prior work in mcmahon et al 2017 to compute the near optimal path for the characterization vehicle suppose that the complexity of computing the characterization path when cell wise characterization gains are known is similar to that of the search path then this approximation approach yields a o r m n 1 s complexity of computing the near optimal characterization paths 6 path planning for the search environmental characterization vehicle we lastly consider the case that a single vehicle is equipped with an environmental characterization sensor and a search sensor and that both sensors can operate simultaneously we again seek to maximize estimation accuracy unlike section 4 where the search vehicle aims to maximize the estimation accuracy with only the search measurements we now acquire both a search measurement z and an environmental measurement y when the vehicle visits a location thus the path strategy in section 4 that do not address the acquisition of environmental measurements do not apply to this case the results of this section partially follow from prior work yetkin et al 2016 and presented here for completeness let w 1 w 2 w m be a set of environments and let w w j denote estimation accuracy conditioned on the environment w j after acquiring search measurement z 39 w w j max x p x x z w j note w w j in 39 is the accuracy of the estimate of the number of objects at a location while v w j in 12 is the expected accuracy when a measurement z has not yet been acquired suppose the environments w 1 w m are distinct and ordered with respect to the estimation accuracy w w j that is w w 1 w w 2 w w m implies w 1 w 2 w m let e be the true environment in a cell and let δ e y be an estimate of the environment based on the environment measurement y when the true environment is e the loss due to the estimate δ e y is defined 40 l w e δ e y c 1 w δ e y w e if δ e y e c 2 w e w δ e y if δ e y e where c 1 c 2 0 are again the relative costs of over and underestimation then the posterior expected loss of computing the environment estimate δ e y and the corresponding bayes estimator δ e y are 41 e l w e δ e y z y j 1 m p w j y l w w j δ e y 42 δ e y arg min δ e y e l w e δ e y z y given search measurement z and the estimate δ e y after acquiring environment measurement y the probability that the estimate of the number of objects at a location is correct is computed from 43 e u x δ x z z δ e y max x p x x z δ e y in order to assess the benefit of visiting a location we compute the estimated estimation accuracy in 43 for each possible set of observations z z y y then the expected estimation accuracy before visiting a location can be computed 44 e w δ e y z y p z y max x p x x z δ e y where 45 p z y x w j p z x w j p y w j p x p w j we again consider the candidate search path γ the finite collection of feasible search paths ω γ and the budget constraint c γ on the vehicle let y q i be the set of independent environment measurements acquired at q i th cell the expected estimation accuracy for traversing γ is 46 e w δ e y γ q i γ e w δ e y γ i s γ max x i p x i and the optimal path is 47 γ arg max γ ω γ e w δ e y γ subject to 48 c γ c γ 7 numerical results this section presents simulation results and elaborates on the performance of the proposed search and environmental characterization strategies our numerical illustrations are inspired by subsea mine hunting missions however we note that our proposed approaches also apply to other subsea search applications we present numerical illustrations for two scenarios in one case search and environmental characterization sensors are on different vehicles and environmental characterization is performed prior to search in the other case search and environmental characterization sensors are on the same vehicle and both activities occur simultaneously when each sensor operates on separate vehicles our proposed approach maximizes the reduction of uncertainty in search performance 22 thus our approach should on average display less anticipated estimation accuracy error than other approaches the search region g is partitioned into a grid with 10 10 non intersecting cells it is assumed that there is no prior information on the number of objects for any cell but an upper bound l 0 on the number of objects that can reside in a cell is known that is for cell i 49 x i l and p x i 0 p x i 1 p x i l with known upper bound l there are three candidate environments in the search region and the distinct and ordered set of environments is w 1 w 2 w 3 the likelihood of observing a particular search measurement follows from 1 the probability of detection d and the probability of at least one false alarm α for each environment are d 0 65 and α 0 4 for environment w 1 d 0 8 and α 0 3 for environment w 2 and d 0 95 and α 0 05 for environment w 3 note that the information about the number of objects revealed after searching a cell increases with increasing probability of detection and decreases with increasing probability of false alarm thus environment w 1 is the least and environment w 3 is the most informative we consider that the sensor model for environment characterization is 50 a i j p y w i e w j for all i j 1 2 3 where a i i is the probability of observing the true environment w i for the numerical illustrations we use the characterization sensor model with a 11 0 9 a 22 0 92 a 33 0 94 that is for example there is 0 9 probability of acquiring environment measurement w 1 when w 1 is the true environment at the location the noisy environment observations are due to nonzero probabilities of observing environment w i when true environment is w j denoted by a i j for i j we assume the probability of acquiring incorrect environment measurement is the same for all possible environments other than the true environment for example when the true environment at a location is w 1 since a 11 0 9 the probability of acquiring environment measurement w 2 and probability of acquiring environment measurement w 3 are a 21 a 31 0 05 we consider that the search vehicle is equipped with a side scan sonar as is typically the case in subsea search applications the quality of the data side scan sonar observes can be very poor when the vehicle turns thus in order to account for this limitation of the sensor on the vehicle s motion we consider that the vehicle travels in parallel straight lines only and it transits between different lines only outside of the search region we implicitly assume that the cells are sufficiently large so that any sequence of cells that correspond to go straight turn right or turn left corresponds to a connected and dynamically feasible path passing through cells that are outside the search region requires time but does not improve search performance since no measurements are acquired for the numerical illustrations we consider a unit cost for moving from a cell to an adjacent cell thus the total cost of a mission is the length of the planning horizon which we refer to as the mission length 7 1 numerical illustrations fig 1 shows a search area that is partitioned into regions a1 through a5 for each region the corresponding probability distribution π p 1 p 2 p 3 is given where p j is the probability that the environment is w j for example for the cells labeled a2 there is 0 15 probability that the environment is w 1 0 2 probability that the environment is w 2 and 0 65 probability that the environment is w 3 the relative costs of over and underestimating the environmental conditions are c 1 1 and c 2 3 so that overestimation is penalized more than underestimation we consider that the mission length is 60 for the search and search environmental characterization vehicles and 35 for the characterization vehicle we selected the search path length to be 60 steps and the environmental characterization length to be 35 steps because for this specific illustrative problem these values best illustrated the advantage of our rigorously derived approach over a more naive approach based on entropy maximization for other values applied to this specific problem the advantage is smaller we adopt a best first branch and bound approach to compute the optimal paths wah and yu 1985 we consider two scenarios in one scenario the search and the environmental characterization sensors operate on the same vehicle and in the other scenario they operate on separate vehicles when the sensors operate on separate vehicles the objective of the search vehicle is to maximize anticipated estimation accuracy in 9 and the objective of the characterization vehicle is to maximize the expected gain of characterization in 22 however due to large computational requirements of computing 22 we instead approximate the solution of 22 as described in section 5 5 when both sensors operate on the same vehicle the objective of the vehicle is to maximize expected estimation accuracy in 46 we define the error in search performance after a mission as the difference between the actual estimation accuracy when the true environment is known and the anticipated estimation accuracy when the environment is uncertain we use the error in search performance as a measure to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approaches in each scenario and show that the proposed approach yields smaller search performance error which is predicted by our selection of cost function we also show that search performance probability of correct estimate increases modestly although our approach does not directly seek to increase estimation accuracy when the sensors are on separate vehicles and characterization precedes search we compare the proposed approximate approach in section 5 5 with the entropy change maximization method described in section 5 1 fig 2 e shows the trajectory for the environmental characterization vehicle when using our proposed approximate approach in section 5 5 and fig 2 f shows the trajectory when using the entropy change approach in section 5 1 when using the proposed approximate approach we choose n the number of trials to approximate p in 29 to be 100 we note that choosing n 100 suffices to compute a good approximation of the term p and it yields computationally feasible results neither environmental characterization path visits a1 because the environments in those locations are completely known we note that the environmental characterization path in fig 2 e that was selected using our approach does not visit the most uncertain environments we find in practice that it tends to visit environments that are both uncertain and likely to be where follow on search missions will occur when both sensors operate on the same vehicle we compare the proposed approach in 47 with entropy change maximization method and with a mowing the lawn approach the latter arises often in subsea applications such as mine hunting we note that the entropy change maximization method described in section 5 1 accounts only for the entropy change of the environmental distributions however when both sensors are placed on the same vehicle the vehicle acquires environmental measurement and search measurement simultaneously thus we modify 11 as 51 γ arg max γ ω γ j γ x β j γ e where j x denotes the entropy change in p x the number of objects and β is the relative weight of the entropy change in p e compared to the entropy change in p x since the objective is to reduce the uncertainty in the number of objects we choose 0 β 1 fig 2 c shows the mowing the lawn trajectory where the vehicle travels through the search area back and forth without planning the path until the mission length is met fig 2 a shows the trajectory for the proposed approach and fig 2 b shows the trajectory for the entropy change maximization method with β 0 5 we also compute the optimal search trajectory when there is no environmental characterization to show the value of acquiring environmental information the corresponding trajectory for this case is shown in fig 2 d we note that due to sonar sensor generated paths in fig 2 are parallel straight lines only however our results apply to other domains where there is no such constraint on vehicle motion search performance after a mission depends on the acquired observations during the mission thus we conduct monte carlo simulations to assess the effects due to random nature of observations for each cell in the search area we randomly generate the true environment e from the environmental distributions in fig 1 and the true number of objects x from a uniform distribution assuming that a cell can be visited by a vehicle at most k times we randomly generate the set of search measurements z and the set of environmental measurements y from the sensor models p z x e and p y e given true environment e and true number of objects x when a vehicle visits a location it acquires randomly generated observation s for each test we compute the anticipated search performance and the actual search performance note that the actual search performance can be computed since the true environment is assumed to be known we then compute the error in search performance which is the difference between the anticipated search performance and the actual search performance we show that the error in search performance is significantly reduced when our proposed approach is employed both sensors operating simultaneously on a single vehicle fig 3 shows the results after 10000 iterations for the case both sensors operate on the same vehicle fig 3 a on the left is the percent of occurrences of the error in search performance and fig 3 b on the right is the percent of occurrences of the actual search performance for convenience we compute the actual search performance after traversing an optimal path γ and acquiring the search measurements z γ as 52 log i g max x i p x i log i γ max x i p x i z i e i i g γ max x i p x i where e i is the actual environment in cell i that is the actual search performance is the difference between the prior certainty in the number of objects before acquiring any measurement and the posterior certainty in the number of objects after acquiring the search measurements along the path loosely speaking the actual search performance plotted in fig 3 b represents the amount of information we acquire on the number of objects after traversing the corresponding optimal search path thus smaller values for fig 3 a imply less error in search performance and larger values for fig 3 b imply better search performance the displayed results are the negative log of the computed search performance the subplots from top to bottom are the results when 1 our proposed approach is employed 2 the entropy change maximization method is employed 3 the mowing the lawn approach is employed and 4 environmental information is not available so that the vehicle acquires only the search measurements the average value of results for each test is also shown in the plots the simulations show that the proposed approach yields smaller error in search performance compared to the entropy change maximization and mowing the lawn with respect to the case where there is no environment information in fig 3 a 4 our proposed approach achieves 85 error reduction while entropy change maximization achieves 56 and mowing the lawn achieves 60 on average in addition the actual search performance when using our approach is no worse than the actual search performance when using the other methods fig 3 a 1 shows that in many of the iterations the error in search performance is very close to zero this implies that in these trials we correctly estimate the environmental conditions in each visited cell we note that this is also due to the sensor model we choose in 50 for environment characterization the average error for the mowing the lawn approach is smaller than the average error for entropy change maximization method this is because mowing the lawn approach visits a1 that has no uncertainty in the environment while the entropy change maximization method visits a3 where the environmental uncertainty is greatest however as the environment in a1 is the least informative the average actual search performance for mowing the lawn approach is the worst among all methods note that fig 3 b 1 and fig 3 b 4 are identical this is because the search locations selected by the proposed approach in fig 2 a are the same locations selected when environment information is not available in fig 2 d for given search area characteristics however the anticipated search performances for these two cases are different indeed comparing fig 3 a 1 with fig 3 a 4 shows that the anticipated search performance when environment information is available is significantly more accurate than the anticipated search performance when there is no environment information hence a benefit of characterizing the environment is to better anticipate the true search performance each sensor on separate vehicles the results when search and environmental characterization tasks are performed on separate vehicles are shown in fig 4 again the left plot is the percent of occurrences of the error in search performance and the right plot is the percent of occurrences of actual search performance the subplots from top to bottom are the results when 1 the locations that yield the greatest reduction of uncertainty in search performance are characterized 2 the locations that maximize the entropy change are characterized and 3 there is no environmental characterization and the search vehicle plans its path by using the prior environmental distributions we note that fig 4 a 3 and fig 4 b 3 are the same plots given in fig 3 a 4 and fig 3 b 4 and we show them here for convenience of comparison it is seen that the average error is significantly smaller when environmental characterization is performed at the locations selected by our proposed approach with respect to the case where there is no environment information in fig 4 a 3 our proposed approach achieves 60 error reduction while entropy change maximization achieves only 16 on average note that the distribution in fig 4 a 2 is very similar to the distribution in fig 4 a 3 this is because entropy change maximization fails to improve the performance of a follow on search mission since it leads the vehicle to explore the parts of the search area that are less likely to be searched the average error when the sensors are on different vehicles is higher than when both sensors operate on the same vehicle since the search vehicle may search the locations that are not characterized on the other hand this results in average actual search performance to be better since the search vehicle can skip the locations that are characterized and found to be uninteresting for search the results of monte carlo simulations show that our proposed approaches to select the characterization locations outperform the other strategies that frequently exist in the literature 8 conclusions in this paper we address the case where environmental information can be acquired to improve the performance of a search mission we consider different scenarios where the search sensor and the environmental characterization sensor can be placed on the same auv or on separate auvs for each scenario we derive a decision theoretic cost function to compute the locations where environmental information should be acquired we show that when the search sensor and the environmental characterization sensor are placed on separate auvs environmental information should be acquired at the locations where the greatest reduction of the uncertainty in anticipated estimation accuracy will occur for the case where the search sensor and the environmental characterization sensor are placed on the same auv we show that the expected estimation accuracy should be maximized the results of the numerical illustrations show that for each scenario our proposed approaches yield smaller error in search performance credit authorship contribution statement harun yetkin conceptualization

21915,this study addresses subsea search applications where an autonomous underwater vehicle auv is tasked with finding the target density in a given search region within finite time we assume that auv is equipped with a side scan sonar sensor that detects the targets at the sampled location we consider that sensor performance is dependent on local environmental conditions e g clutter density sediment type that vary throughout the search region and we presume that environmental conditions are unknown or partially known due to uncertain and varying environmental conditions resulting search performance is also uncertain and it varies by location this paper specifically considers the cases where environmental information can be acquired either by a separate vehicle or by the same vehicle that performs the search task our main contribution is to formally derive a decision theoretic cost function to compute the locations where the environmental information should be acquired so that the performance of the search task can be improved for the cases where computing the optimal locations to sample the environment is computationally expensive we offer an approximation approach that yields provable near optimal paths we show that our decision theoretic cost function outperforms the information maximization approach which is often employed in similar applications msc 90b40 68t37 68t40 93c85 keywords search theory path planning environmental information subsea search autonomous underwater vehicles 1 introduction we address subsea search applications where an auv is to find an unknown number of objects in a bounded search environment and within limited time we assume that the environment affects sensor performance and local environmental conditions vary by location that is in some locations the search sensor is expected to perform better than in other locations yetkin et al 2015 shows how guidance algorithms for search missions can incorporate stochastic knowledge of the environment to improve search performance in this study we specifically consider the cases where environmental information can be acquired as part of the overall search task the principal contributions of this study show where environmental information should be acquired in order to improve overall search performance we address two cases 1 environmental characterization is performed prior to a search mission by a separate asset than the search vehicle and 2 environmental characterization is performed at the same time as search by the same vehicle that performs the search task in this study we extend our findings in our prior work yetkin et al 2015 2016 we use a decision theoretic value function that is associated with the accuracy of our estimate of the number of objects in the environment because search performance is dependent on the environment knowledge of the environment can improve search performance due to better search plans for example one may choose to avoid searching areas that are known to contain excessive clutter and many false positives in favor of environments with few false positives in situations where the environment is poorly known efforts to acquire environmental information may lead to improved search effectiveness we address the case that stochastic knowledge of the environment can be acquired and we describe where the environment should be surveyed in order to improve overall search performance one approach for selecting where to acquire environmental information is simply to characterize locations that yield the greatest reduction of uncertainty about the environment in other words one might seek to maximize reduction in entropy of the distribution that describe the environment which is often employed in similar applications see for example coleman and block 2007 elfes 1992 papadimitriou et al 2000 in contrast we show that reducing uncertainty in the environment is not the best approach a primary contribution of this work is to show that environmental information should be acquired at the locations where the greatest reduction of uncertainty in anticipated search performance will occur where we define search performance as the probability that the estimate for the number of objects in the environment is correct computing the optimal locations to acquire the environment information can be computationally expensive when the planning horizon is large to address the computational challenge of our approach we show an approximation approach that yields provably near optimal paths the remainder of this paper is organized as follows an overview of search theory and the benefit of acquiring environmental information in some search missions is provided in section 2 in section 3 we formulate the search problem and define the observation model in section 4 we define the objective function that maximizes the estimation accuracy in section 5 and section 6 we describe our proposed cost function to compute the locations where environmental characterization should be performed section 7 provides the numerical results that illustrate our approach 2 related work 2 1 search theory search theory is concerned with finding an optimal allocation of available search effort to locate a lost or hidden target such that a reward specified as a measure of search effectiveness is maximized bernard koopman offered one of the first systematic approaches to the search problem koopman 1957 his work laid the foundations of the problem and since then the search problem received a lot of attention mainly from the operations research community some notable examples include chung and burdick 2012a kadane 1971 kimeldorf and smith 1979 kress et al 2008 richardson 1988 and stone et al 1972 in a real world search application sensor measurements can be noisy due to false negatives i e failing to detect a target that is present and false positives i e falsely detecting a target when the target is not present at the location local environmental conditions can also affect the number of false positives and false negatives the sensor observes and deterministic knowledge on environmental conditions is often unavailable however existing literature in search theory rarely addresses the requirements of real world search applications for instance the existence of false positives is mostly ignored in existing works exceptions include chung and burdick 2012b dobbie 1973 kress et al 2008 kriheli et al 2016 pollock 1964 and stone et al 1972 where the effect of environmental conditions on sensor performance is not accounted for to best of our knowledge there is no work in the literature that addresses both the existence of false positives and multiple targets our work builds upon prior work by accounting for multiple targets false alarms non zero cost of moving to another search location and uncertainty in the environment to best of our knowledge this is the first study to account for all these factors together we do not address coverage problems as in choset 2001 or exhaustive search rather we consider applications where there is a time or distance constraint and we seek solutions where we achieve the best search performance within a time or distance constraint due to this constraint optimal search paths may not visit every location indeed in some scenarios it is possible that some locations are visited more than once while other locations are never visited at all 2 2 effect of environment information we consider that the local environmental conditions affect the sensor performance and that the environment varies throughout the search region hence the sensor performs better in some locations than in others the environment at a location may not be known with certainty and we may only have a probabilistic knowledge on the environment when possible acquiring information about the local environmental conditions can significantly improve the results of a follow on search mission the question is where to sample the environment so that the most improvement in search performance can be obtained this is the fundamental question we seek to answer in this study and we show that a new approach is needed to address the cases where the limited planning horizon of the mission does not allow exhaustive search of the environment the effect of the environment on search performance is well known de guenin is the first to account for the effect of environmental conditions on search performance de guenin 1961 he illustrated the intuitive effect of environmental conditions on detection probability with a simple example of visual search where the detection probability depends upon the atmospheric conditions that may not be uniform and thus for the same search effort the detection probability will be higher in clear areas than in overcast areas in subsea applications where sonar is used for search variations in the seabed induce significant variation in probability of detection and probability of false alarm elmore et al 2007 zare and cobb 2013 similarly in terrestrial applications using ground penetrating radar background clutter and soil properties have significant effect on search results gader et al 2001 takahashi et al 2011a b for the cases where the search environment is unknown or partially known reducing the uncertainty in the environment can greatly improve search performance for the particular trial in harris et al 2005 the experimental results show that the mine hunting mission takes 40 less time when the environment is known compared to when there is no prior environmental information in our prior work yetkin et al 2015 we also show that uncertainty in the environment leads to uncertainty in search performance which can result in terminating the search mission too early and thus obtaining poor search performance we note that the existing literature on robotic exploration see bourgault et al 2002 carrillo et al 2015 makarenko et al 2002 yamauchi 1997 among many examples provides little insight to the applications we address robotic exploration addresses the challenge of building a map in contrast we seek to characterize a subset of the environment with respect to search sensor performance for the goal of improving search effectiveness 3 problem formulation search and environmental characterization are accomplished using different sensors that can be mounted on different vehicles or on the same vehicle when the sensors are placed on different vehicles the vehicle that possesses the search sensor is called the search vehicle and the vehicle that possesses the environmental characterization sensor is called the environmental characterization vehicle when the search and environmental characterization sensors operate simultaneously on a single vehicle we informally refer to the vehicle as the search environmental characterization vehicle in this section we provide the notation and the formal definition of the search problem a list of variables is provided in table c 1 in appendix 3 1 preliminaries a search grid g r 2 is partitioned into k disjoint cells and each cell in the search grid is associated with random variables x and e random variable x represents the number of objects and random variable e represents the environmental conditions in the cell we consider that the number of objects and the environmental conditions in each is independent throughout the search grid that is for cells i and j x i is independent of x j and e i is independent of e j the objective of the search mission is to estimate x 1 x k by using a sensor to detect objects in each cell we assume that deterministic knowledge of the environmental conditions is unavailable but the finite set of environments w 1 w 2 w m in the search grid is known and a probabilistic knowledge on these environments is available for each cell for instance the environment probability distribution for cell i is expressed p 1 i p 2 i p m i where p j i p e i w j is the probability that the actual environment in cell i is w j we note that in practice clustering of different types of environmental conditions can be carried out by using a previously acquired environment dataset in the search domain see for example mcmahon et al 2017 3 2 sequential bayesian update for the search vehicle when the search vehicle samples from a location it observes the number of objects in that location and an imperfect measurement z z of the actual number of objects in the location is acquired we denote by z both the set of possible search measurements i e z z and the random variable associated with a search measurement in a cell i e z i z i we note that the acquired measurement z includes both false positives and false negatives the sensor model that we choose for the numerical illustrations in section 7 is 1 p z x w j k 0 min x z x k d j k 1 d j x k 1 f j f j z k which is the likelihood of observing z objects when x is the true number of objects at the location and the environment is w j in 1 0 f j 1 denotes the probability of one or more false alarms and 0 d j 1 denotes the probability of detection note that both f j and d j are assumed to vary as functions of the environment type w j the details of the search sensor model is described in prior work shende et al 2012 yetkin et al 2015 and omitted here for brevity we note that other expressions for the sensor model are also possible and our results do not depend on this specific sensor model except for numerical illustrations upon acquiring a search measurement z we use bayesian update law to update the distribution p x z w j 2 p x x z w j p z x w j p x x x p z x x w j p x x 3 3 sequential bayesian update for the environmental characterization vehicle when the environment characterization vehicle samples from a location it observes the environmental conditions in that location and an imperfect measurement y y of the true environment at the location is acquired we denote by y both the set of possible environment measurements i e y y and the random variable associated with an environment measurement at a cell i e y i y i we assume the likelihood of observing an environment measurement y when the true environment is w j is known we use bayesian update law to compute the posterior distribution of the environment after observing y 3 p e w j y y p y e w j p e w j j p y e w j p e w j 3 4 sequential bayesian update for the search environmental characterization vehicle when the search sensor and the environmental characterization sensor operate simultaneously on a single vehicle the noisy observations z and y are acquired simultaneously given z and y measurements acquired at a location we represent the updated probability distribution of the number of objects unconditioned on the environment 4 p x x z y j p x x z w j p e w j y where the posterior distributions p x x z w j and p e w j y y follow from 2 and 3 respectively 4 path planning for the search vehicle we perform environmental characterization to improve the results of a search mission to better understand the value of acquiring an environment measurement at a location we seek to quantify the effect of the acquired environment measurements on search results thus in this section we briefly present the value of searching a location and the objective function to compute the optimal search paths for more details on path planning for the search vehicle we refer the reader to our prior work yetkin et al 2015 the search objective is to accurately estimate the number of objects in each cell however due to imperfect sensor measurements our estimate of the number of objects in a cell can be different than the true number of objects hence we define that the goal of searching a location is to maximize the accuracy of our estimate of the number of objects at that location that is we seek to maximize the probability that our estimate of the number of objects after searching a location will be correct we use a zero one utility function to compute the value of forming an estimate δ x z of the true number of objects x after acquiring search measurement z 5 u x δ x z 1 if x δ x z 0 if x δ x z we believe the zero one utility function in 5 adequately assesses the value of forming an estimate for the applications where an incorrect estimate may have severe consequences e g subsea mine hunting missions for the applications where incorrect estimates are also valued one can use a linear loss function to assess the value to forming an estimate of the number of objects see for example mcmahon et al 2017 given that the acquired measurement is z and the environment is w j bayes estimator is 6 δ x z arg max δ x z e u x δ x z z w j that maximizes the expected values of the zero one utility function in 5 the value of searching a location is 7 e u x δ x z j 1 m p e w j e u x δ x z w j and we call this the anticipated estimation accuracy let γ q 1 q n be a candidate search path that traverses the cells q 1 q n g and let c γ be the budget constraint on the search mission due to limited time distance the vehicle can traverse we define c γ to denote the cost for traversing a path γ note that when the traversal cost for moving from one location to another is unity c γ is simply the number of cells traversed by γ when the vehicle makes multiple visits to a cell we acquire a set of independent search measurements we denote by z both a single search measurement and a set of search measurements when a cell is visited multiple times by γ then the expected utility of traversing γ is 8 e u x δ x z γ q i γ e u x q i δ x z q i i g γ max x i p x i x i where g γ denotes the remaining cells in the search grid that are not traversed by γ and max x i p x i x i is the certainty in the number of objects in cell i prior to acquiring new measurements let ω γ denote the finite collection of feasible search paths then the optimal search path is 9 γ arg max γ ω γ e u x δ x z γ subject to 10 c γ c γ 5 path planning for the environmental characterization vehicle the primary objective of environmental characterization is to improve search performance with additional information about the environment at a few locations it might be possible to avoid searching locations where the sensor performs poorly in favor of places where the sensor performs well we consider the case where environmental characterization is performed prior to search and we assume that both environmental characterization and search cannot be performed exhaustively due to limited resources 5 1 entropy change maximization when environment information can be acquired only in some locations due to limited resources the question is to determine where to optimally sample the environment one approach that is often used in similar applications is to maximize the change in entropy due to acquired environment measurements coleman and block 2007 elfes 1992 papadimitriou et al 2000 we briefly describe a typical entropy approach for selecting where to sample the environment so that we can compare it to our proposed approach let h e w j denote the prior entropy of the probability distribution p e w j and let h e w j y y be the posterior entropy after acquiring the environment measurement y the expected amount of change in the entropy for a future environment measurement y can be computed by j e h e w j y h e w j y y let η be a candidate path for the environment characterization vehicle ω η be the finite collection of feasible paths and c η be the budget constraint on the environment characterization mission then the best path to characterize the environment based on the entropy change maximization method is 11 η arg max η ω η j η e subject to c η c η however we note that the purpose of environmental characterization in this study is not to explore the environment but to improve the performance of a follow on search mission we show in section 7 via numerical studies that maximizing change in entropy does not maximize the performance of follow on search missions 5 2 environmental loss function in order to improve the performance of a follow on search mission by exploring the environment we first address how the uncertainty in the environment affects the search performance when we compute the value of searching a location in 7 we average the search value over all possible environments with respect to the prior environment probability distribution which can result in a different search value than the true search value given true environment at the location that is uncertainty in the environment results in deviations from actual search results and degrades search performance after a mission let e be the true environment and v w j denote the value of searching a location with environment w j 12 v w j e u x δ x z e w j in order to penalize the deviations from actual search performance we define a linear loss function 13 l v e δ e y c 1 v e v δ e y if δ e y e c 2 v δ e y v e if δ e y e where c 1 c 2 0 are the relative costs of over and underestimating search performance and δ e y is an estimate of the environment after environment measurement y is acquired the notation and represent a preference ordering among the environments when v w i v w j for environments w i and w j we say w i w j and when v w i v w j we say w i w j throughout this paper we consider a distinct and ordered set of environments so that w 1 w 2 w m when our environment estimate is worse than the true environment δ e y e too much search effort can be allocated to the same location since the available search effort we can apply to search the region is limited allocating unnecessary search effort to the same location may degrade the overall search performance on the other hand when our environment estimate is greater than the true environment δ e y e we exaggerate the value of searching a location which may result in poorly allocated search effort and exaggerated search performance after a mission in the numerical illustrations in section 7 we choose c 1 c 2 so that overestimation is more penalized than underestimation after observing environment measurement y at a location we compute the posterior probability distribution of the environments p w j y in 3 we then compute the expected loss of forming environment estimate δ e y with respect to the posterior distribution p w j y 14 e l v e δ e y y y j 1 m p w

note that the proof for 17 can be found in any standard book on statistical decisions see for example berger 2013 5 3 path planning a benefit of environmental surveys is to reduce the error in anticipated search performance due to uncertainty in the environment when a location is not visited by the search vehicle during a search mission acquiring an environment measurement at that location will not affect search performance from the loss function in 13 computing the estimate 15 of the environment after acquiring environment measurement y yields the conditional expected loss 19 e l v e δ e y y j 1 m p e w j y l v w j δ e y that quantifies the amount of uncertainty in anticipated estimation accuracy after acquiring y informally speaking the prior loss before acquiring an environment measurement represents the prior uncertainty and the conditional expected loss in 19 represents the posterior uncertainty in search performance for notational convenience we define r y to denote the reduction of uncertainty in anticipated estimation accuracy due to environment measurement y r y e l v e δ e e l v e δ e y y y then the gain of acquiring an environment measurement y i in cell i is the reduction of uncertainty in anticipated estimation accuracy given that cell i is visited by the search vehicle 20 g y i i i γ y i r y i where the notation γ y denote the best path for the search vehicle when the probability distribution of the environment is updated with the acquired measurement y and the indicator function i i γ y i y i c 1 is defined 21 i i γ y i 1 i γ y i c i γ y i where 0 c 1 is a parameter to determine the relative gain of sampling the environment at locations that will not be searched without loss of generality we consider that c 0 let η q 1 q 2 q m be a candidate path for the environment characterization vehicle and recall that ω η is the finite collection of feasible characterization paths we denote by y both a single environment measurement and a set of independent environment measurements when a cell is visited multiple times by η then the expected characterization gain of traversing η is 22 e g η y η p y η y η q i η i i γ y i r y q i and the optimal path is 23 η arg max η ω η e g η subject to 24 c η c η 5 4 approximating the characterization gain of a path computing the optimal path for the environment characterization vehicle in 23 can be computationally very expensive this is mainly due to large computational requirements of computing the optimal search path for each set of environment measurements along a candidate path η thus we also propose an approximate method that reduces the computational complexity of the solution in 23 our approximate solution yields provably near optimal paths let ω η be the set of environment characterization paths such that c η c η let denote the size of a set or an array and let s denote the computational complexity of computing the optimal search paths then the solution in 23 has a computational complexity of o ω η m η s where m is the number of environments in the search domain this shows that the exponential increase in the computational complexity is dominated by the large planning horizon for the characterization vehicle one approach to reduce this computational complexity is to use a receding horizon strategy where we compute the paths for a shorter horizon while receding horizon approach may require less computational power compared to computing the paths for the entire planning horizon it may still be infeasible unless the considered planning horizon is sufficiently small in which case the resulting performance will be poor instead our approach to reduce the complexity of the solution in 23 aims to approximate the characterization gain of traversing a path we start with re arranging the terms in 22 by partitioning a path η into two parts a cell q i η and the other cells in the path 25 e g η y η p y η y η q i η i q i γ y η r y q i q i η y q i r y q i y η q i i q i γ y η p y η y η where η q i denotes the set of cells in η except cell q i the terms up to the third summation in 25 denote the characterization gain of acquiring the environment measurement y from cell q i η and the other terms that start with the third summation denote how likely it is that sampling cell q i will improve the performance of a follow on search mission that is it represents the chances that cell q i will be visited during a follow on search mission based on the environment measurements that we may acquire along the path η note that since η q 1 q 2 q m the joint probability p y η y η in 25 can be expressed 26 p y η y η p y q 1 y q 1 p y q m y q m thus we can re write 25 27 e g η q i η y q i p y q i y q i r y q i p η q i where p η q i is the total probability of every possible sets of the environment measurements y q 1 y q 2 y q i 1 y q i 1 y q m such that the optimal search path associated with the updated environment distributions visits cell q i 29 p η q i y η q i i q i γ y η p y η q i y η q i y η q i q i γ y η p y η q i y η q i indeed the computational cost of 27 is dominated by p η q i in 29 thus we use a sample based method to compute an empirical estimate of p η q i which results in a significant speed up in computing the characterization path for each cell q i η and for every environment measurement y q i y we perform n trials where in each trial we randomly sample an environment measurement from the probability distribution p y q j y q j for all q j η such that j i then with the updated environment distributions we compute the optimal search path and see whether the corresponding path visits cell q i or not we simply count the number of times cell q i is being visited by the resulting search path out of n trials and we denote this number by k since this is repeated for every other cell in the path we may sample the same environment measurement y q i from cell q i during a trial of another cell let n y q i be the number of times y q i is sampled in cell q i during the trials of the other cells in path η and let k y q i be the number of times cell q i is contained in the corresponding search path out of these n y q i trials then the empirical estimate of p η q i is 30 p ˆ η q i k k y q i n n y q i obtaining a close estimate of p η q i is important to compute a near optimal characterization path we show that a bound on the distance between p η q i and p ˆ η q i can be computed we first note that after each trial for a cell that cell is either contained in the follow on search path or it is not contained thus we can cast each trial as a bernoulli trial where the result of the trial is either 1 if the cell is contained in the search path or it is 0 if the cell is not contained then we use hoeffding s inequality 15 to obtain a probabilistic bound on the difference between p η q i and p ˆ η q i 31 p p η q i p ˆ η q i ϵ n 1 2 exp 2 ϵ 2 n where n n n y q i and ϵ 0 replacing p η q i with its estimate p ˆ η q i in 27 approximates the characterization gain of a path we denote the approximate characterization gain of a path η by e g ˆ η 32 e g ˆ η q i η y q i k k y q i n n y q i p y q i y q i r y q i finally we select the path that maximizes the approximate characterization gain in 32 subject to the budget constraint in 24 33 η ˆ arg max η ω η e g ˆ η now we define the following theorem and the corollary where we first bound the difference between the characterization gain and the approximate characterization gain for a path and we then bound the difference between the optimal characterization gain and the approximately optimal characterization gain proofs for both the theorem and the corollary are provided in appendix theorem 1 the probability of the difference between the characterization gain 27 and its estimate 32 for a path η satisfying a specific bound is expressed 34 p e g η e g ˆ η ϵ n η 1 2 exp 2 ϵ 2 n corollary 1 for the optimal characterization path η in 23 and the approximate path η ˆ in 33 the difference in expected characterization gain satisfies 35 p e g η e g η ˆ 2 ϵ n η 1 2 exp 2 ϵ 2 n the proposed approximation approach yields a provably near optimal path for the environment characterization vehicle the computational complexity of the solution is reduced from o ω η m η s to o ω η η m n s in general choosing a larger value for n is likely to reduce the approximation error however our preliminary results show that a small value for n is often sufficient to obtain a close approximation 5 5 approximating the characterization gain of a cell in this section we introduce an alternative approach to approximate the optimal characterization gain our alternative approach assumes that the search paths are composed of sequences of parallel straight lines this assumption arises often in subsea applications that rely on side scan imaging sonar see for example hayes and gough 2009 houston et al 2002 unlike the proposed approach in section 5 4 our approach in this section can only apply to certain classes of mapping problems suppose the search area g consists of a set of parallel straight lines a line is either a row or a column l 1 l 2 l n l when each line corresponds to a row n l n r and when each line corresponds to a column n l n c suppose that the j th line traverses the cells q j 1 q j 2 q j k thus when the vehicle traverses line l j it samples from cells q j 1 q j 2 q j k let η be a candidate path for the environment characterization vehicle that consists of lines l 1 l 2 l k and consider that cell i η is contained in l j we claim that the value of characterizing cell i along path η can be closely approximated by the value of characterizing cell i along line l j that is 36 e g q i η y q i p y q i y q i r y q i p η q i 37 y q i p y q i y q i r y q i p l j q i where 38 p l j q i y l j q i q i γ y l j p y l j q i y l j q i due to 37 we can compute the value of characterizing a particular cell by only looking at the cells in the associated line a row or a column by doing so we can compute the characterization gain for each cell individually then the characterization gain of a path is simply the summation of the characterization gain of each cell in that path we note that we do not have a formal guarantee of how closely 37 approximates 36 however our initial tests as well as the intuition suggest that 36 can be well approximated by 37 since computing p l j q i in 38 can be very expensive when the length of a line is large we instead compute an empirical estimate of p l j q i as described in section 5 4 for each cell in the search grid we perform n trials to compute an empirical estimate of p l j q i where in each trial we sample environment measurements from the remaining cells in line l j after approximating the characterization gain for each cell individually we apply an exact branch and bound method similar to our prior work in mcmahon et al 2017 to compute the near optimal path for the characterization vehicle suppose that the complexity of computing the characterization path when cell wise characterization gains are known is similar to that of the search path then this approximation approach yields a o r m n 1 s complexity of computing the near optimal characterization paths 6 path planning for the search environmental characterization vehicle we lastly consider the case that a single vehicle is equipped with an environmental characterization sensor and a search sensor and that both sensors can operate simultaneously we again seek to maximize estimation accuracy unlike section 4 where the search vehicle aims to maximize the estimation accuracy with only the search measurements we now acquire both a search measurement z and an environmental measurement y when the vehicle visits a location thus the path strategy in section 4 that do not address the acquisition of environmental measurements do not apply to this case the results of this section partially follow from prior work yetkin et al 2016 and presented here for completeness let w 1 w 2 w m be a set of environments and let w w j denote estimation accuracy conditioned on the environment w j after acquiring search measurement z 39 w w j max x p x x z w j note w w j in 39 is the accuracy of the estimate of the number of objects at a location while v w j in 12 is the expected accuracy when a measurement z has not yet been acquired suppose the environments w 1 w m are distinct and ordered with respect to the estimation accuracy w w j that is w w 1 w w 2 w w m implies w 1 w 2 w m let e be the true environment in a cell and let δ e y be an estimate of the environment based on the environment measurement y when the true environment is e the loss due to the estimate δ e y is defined 40 l w e δ e y c 1 w δ e y w e if δ e y e c 2 w e w δ e y if δ e y e where c 1 c 2 0 are again the relative costs of over and underestimation then the posterior expected loss of computing the environment estimate δ e y and the corresponding bayes estimator δ e y are 41 e l w e δ e y z y j 1 m p w j y l w w j δ e y 42 δ e y arg min δ e y e l w e δ e y z y given search measurement z and the estimate δ e y after acquiring environment measurement y the probability that the estimate of the number of objects at a location is correct is computed from 43 e u x δ x z z δ e y max x p x x z δ e y in order to assess the benefit of visiting a location we compute the estimated estimation accuracy in 43 for each possible set of observations z z y y then the expected estimation accuracy before visiting a location can be computed 44 e w δ e y z y p z y max x p x x z δ e y where 45 p z y x w j p z x w j p y w j p x p w j we again consider the candidate search path γ the finite collection of feasible search paths ω γ and the budget constraint c γ on the vehicle let y q i be the set of independent environment measurements acquired at q i th cell the expected estimation accuracy for traversing γ is 46 e w δ e y γ q i γ e w δ e y γ i s γ max x i p x i and the optimal path is 47 γ arg max γ ω γ e w δ e y γ subject to 48 c γ c γ 7 numerical results this section presents simulation results and elaborates on the performance of the proposed search and environmental characterization strategies our numerical illustrations are inspired by subsea mine hunting missions however we note that our proposed approaches also apply to other subsea search applications we present numerical illustrations for two scenarios in one case search and environmental characterization sensors are on different vehicles and environmental characterization is performed prior to search in the other case search and environmental characterization sensors are on the same vehicle and both activities occur simultaneously when each sensor operates on separate vehicles our proposed approach maximizes the reduction of uncertainty in search performance 22 thus our approach should on average display less anticipated estimation accuracy error than other approaches the search region g is partitioned into a grid with 10 10 non intersecting cells it is assumed that there is no prior information on the number of objects for any cell but an upper bound l 0 on the number of objects that can reside in a cell is known that is for cell i 49 x i l and p x i 0 p x i 1 p x i l with known upper bound l there are three candidate environments in the search region and the distinct and ordered set of environments is w 1 w 2 w 3 the likelihood of observing a particular search measurement follows from 1 the probability of detection d and the probability of at least one false alarm α for each environment are d 0 65 and α 0 4 for environment w 1 d 0 8 and α 0 3 for environment w 2 and d 0 95 and α 0 05 for environment w 3 note that the information about the number of objects revealed after searching a cell increases with increasing probability of detection and decreases with increasing probability of false alarm thus environment w 1 is the least and environment w 3 is the most informative we consider that the sensor model for environment characterization is 50 a i j p y w i e w j for all i j 1 2 3 where a i i is the probability of observing the true environment w i for the numerical illustrations we use the characterization sensor model with a 11 0 9 a 22 0 92 a 33 0 94 that is for example there is 0 9 probability of acquiring environment measurement w 1 when w 1 is the true environment at the location the noisy environment observations are due to nonzero probabilities of observing environment w i when true environment is w j denoted by a i j for i j we assume the probability of acquiring incorrect environment measurement is the same for all possible environments other than the true environment for example when the true environment at a location is w 1 since a 11 0 9 the probability of acquiring environment measurement w 2 and probability of acquiring environment measurement w 3 are a 21 a 31 0 05 we consider that the search vehicle is equipped with a side scan sonar as is typically the case in subsea search applications the quality of the data side scan sonar observes can be very poor when the vehicle turns thus in order to account for this limitation of the sensor on the vehicle s motion we consider that the vehicle travels in parallel straight lines only and it transits between different lines only outside of the search region we implicitly assume that the cells are sufficiently large so that any sequence of cells that correspond to go straight turn right or turn left corresponds to a connected and dynamically feasible path passing through cells that are outside the search region requires time but does not improve search performance since no measurements are acquired for the numerical illustrations we consider a unit cost for moving from a cell to an adjacent cell thus the total cost of a mission is the length of the planning horizon which we refer to as the mission length 7 1 numerical illustrations fig 1 shows a search area that is partitioned into regions a1 through a5 for each region the corresponding probability distribution π p 1 p 2 p 3 is given where p j is the probability that the environment is w j for example for the cells labeled a2 there is 0 15 probability that the environment is w 1 0 2 probability that the environment is w 2 and 0 65 probability that the environment is w 3 the relative costs of over and underestimating the environmental conditions are c 1 1 and c 2 3 so that overestimation is penalized more than underestimation we consider that the mission length is 60 for the search and search environmental characterization vehicles and 35 for the characterization vehicle we selected the search path length to be 60 steps and the environmental characterization length to be 35 steps because for this specific illustrative problem these values best illustrated the advantage of our rigorously derived approach over a more naive approach based on entropy maximization for other values applied to this specific problem the advantage is smaller we adopt a best first branch and bound approach to compute the optimal paths wah and yu 1985 we consider two scenarios in one scenario the search and the environmental characterization sensors operate on the same vehicle and in the other scenario they operate on separate vehicles when the sensors operate on separate vehicles the objective of the search vehicle is to maximize anticipated estimation accuracy in 9 and the objective of the characterization vehicle is to maximize the expected gain of characterization in 22 however due to large computational requirements of computing 22 we instead approximate the solution of 22 as described in section 5 5 when both sensors operate on the same vehicle the objective of the vehicle is to maximize expected estimation accuracy in 46 we define the error in search performance after a mission as the difference between the actual estimation accuracy when the true environment is known and the anticipated estimation accuracy when the environment is uncertain we use the error in search performance as a measure to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approaches in each scenario and show that the proposed approach yields smaller search performance error which is predicted by our selection of cost function we also show that search performance probability of correct estimate increases modestly although our approach does not directly seek to increase estimation accuracy when the sensors are on separate vehicles and characterization precedes search we compare the proposed approximate approach in section 5 5 with the entropy change maximization method described in section 5 1 fig 2 e shows the trajectory for the environmental characterization vehicle when using our proposed approximate approach in section 5 5 and fig 2 f shows the trajectory when using the entropy change approach in section 5 1 when using the proposed approximate approach we choose n the number of trials to approximate p in 29 to be 100 we note that choosing n 100 suffices to compute a good approximation of the term p and it yields computationally feasible results neither environmental characterization path visits a1 because the environments in those locations are completely known we note that the environmental characterization path in fig 2 e that was selected using our approach does not visit the most uncertain environments we find in practice that it tends to visit environments that are both uncertain and likely to be where follow on search missions will occur when both sensors operate on the same vehicle we compare the proposed approach in 47 with entropy change maximization method and with a mowing the lawn approach the latter arises often in subsea applications such as mine hunting we note that the entropy change maximization method described in section 5 1 accounts only for the entropy change of the environmental distributions however when both sensors are placed on the same vehicle the vehicle acquires environmental measurement and search measurement simultaneously thus we modify 11 as 51 γ arg max γ ω γ j γ x β j γ e where j x denotes the entropy change in p x the number of objects and β is the relative weight of the entropy change in p e compared to the entropy change in p x since the objective is to reduce the uncertainty in the number of objects we choose 0 β 1 fig 2 c shows the mowing the lawn trajectory where the vehicle travels through the search area back and forth without planning the path until the mission length is met fig 2 a shows the trajectory for the proposed approach and fig 2 b shows the trajectory for the entropy change maximization method with β 0 5 we also compute the optimal search trajectory when there is no environmental characterization to show the value of acquiring environmental information the corresponding trajectory for this case is shown in fig 2 d we note that due to sonar sensor generated paths in fig 2 are parallel straight lines only however our results apply to other domains where there is no such constraint on vehicle motion search performance after a mission depends on the acquired observations during the mission thus we conduct monte carlo simulations to assess the effects due to random nature of observations for each cell in the search area we randomly generate the true environment e from the environmental distributions in fig 1 and the true number of objects x from a uniform distribution assuming that a cell can be visited by a vehicle at most k times we randomly generate the set of search measurements z and the set of environmental measurements y from the sensor models p z x e and p y e given true environment e and true number of objects x when a vehicle visits a location it acquires randomly generated observation s for each test we compute the anticipated search performance and the actual search performance note that the actual search performance can be computed since the true environment is assumed to be known we then compute the error in search performance which is the difference between the anticipated search performance and the actual search performance we show that the error in search performance is significantly reduced when our proposed approach is employed both sensors operating simultaneously on a single vehicle fig 3 shows the results after 10000 iterations for the case both sensors operate on the same vehicle fig 3 a on the left is the percent of occurrences of the error in search performance and fig 3 b on the right is the percent of occurrences of the actual search performance for convenience we compute the actual search performance after traversing an optimal path γ and acquiring the search measurements z γ as 52 log i g max x i p x i log i γ max x i p x i z i e i i g γ max x i p x i where e i is the actual environment in cell i that is the actual search performance is the difference between the prior certainty in the number of objects before acquiring any measurement and the posterior certainty in the number of objects after acquiring the search measurements along the path loosely speaking the actual search performance plotted in fig 3 b represents the amount of information we acquire on the number of objects after traversing the corresponding optimal search path thus smaller values for fig 3 a imply less error in search performance and larger values for fig 3 b imply better search performance the displayed results are the negative log of the computed search performance the subplots from top to bottom are the results when 1 our proposed approach is employed 2 the entropy change maximization method is employed 3 the mowing the lawn approach is employed and 4 environmental information is not available so that the vehicle acquires only the search measurements the average value of results for each test is also shown in the plots the simulations show that the proposed approach yields smaller error in search performance compared to the entropy change maximization and mowing the lawn with respect to the case where there is no environment information in fig 3 a 4 our proposed approach achieves 85 error reduction while entropy change maximization achieves 56 and mowing the lawn achieves 60 on average in addition the actual search performance when using our approach is no worse than the actual search performance when using the other methods fig 3 a 1 shows that in many of the iterations the error in search performance is very close to zero this implies that in these trials we correctly estimate the environmental conditions in each visited cell we note that this is also due to the sensor model we choose in 50 for environment characterization the average error for the mowing the lawn approach is smaller than the average error for entropy change maximization method this is because mowing the lawn approach visits a1 that has no uncertainty in the environment while the entropy change maximization method visits a3 where the environmental uncertainty is greatest however as the environment in a1 is the least informative the average actual search performance for mowing the lawn approach is the worst among all methods note that fig 3 b 1 and fig 3 b 4 are identical this is because the search locations selected by the proposed approach in fig 2 a are the same locations selected when environment information is not available in fig 2 d for given search area characteristics however the anticipated search performances for these two cases are different indeed comparing fig 3 a 1 with fig 3 a 4 shows that the anticipated search performance when environment information is available is significantly more accurate than the anticipated search performance when there is no environment information hence a benefit of characterizing the environment is to better anticipate the true search performance each sensor on separate vehicles the results when search and environmental characterization tasks are performed on separate vehicles are shown in fig 4 again the left plot is the percent of occurrences of the error in search performance and the right plot is the percent of occurrences of actual search performance the subplots from top to bottom are the results when 1 the locations that yield the greatest reduction of uncertainty in search performance are characterized 2 the locations that maximize the entropy change are characterized and 3 there is no environmental characterization and the search vehicle plans its path by using the prior environmental distributions we note that fig 4 a 3 and fig 4 b 3 are the same plots given in fig 3 a 4 and fig 3 b 4 and we show them here for convenience of comparison it is seen that the average error is significantly smaller when environmental characterization is performed at the locations selected by our proposed approach with respect to the case where there is no environment information in fig 4 a 3 our proposed approach achieves 60 error reduction while entropy change maximization achieves only 16 on average note that the distribution in fig 4 a 2 is very similar to the distribution in fig 4 a 3 this is because entropy change maximization fails to improve the performance of a follow on search mission since it leads the vehicle to explore the parts of the search area that are less likely to be searched the average error when the sensors are on different vehicles is higher than when both sensors operate on the same vehicle since the search vehicle may search the locations that are not characterized on the other hand this results in average actual search performance to be better since the search vehicle can skip the locations that are characterized and found to be uninteresting for search the results of monte carlo simulations show that our proposed approaches to select the characterization locations outperform the other strategies that frequently exist in the literature 8 conclusions in this paper we address the case where environmental information can be acquired to improve the performance of a search mission we consider different scenarios where the search sensor and the environmental characterization sensor can be placed on the same auv or on separate auvs for each scenario we derive a decision theoretic cost function to compute the locations where environmental information should be acquired we show that when the search sensor and the environmental characterization sensor are placed on separate auvs environmental information should be acquired at the locations where the greatest reduction of the uncertainty in anticipated estimation accuracy will occur for the case where the search sensor and the environmental characterization sensor are placed on the same auv we show that the expected estimation accuracy should be maximized the results of the numerical illustrations show that for each scenario our proposed approaches yield smaller error in search performance credit authorship contribution statement harun yetkin conceptualization

double frequency wave radiation force on a surging heaving truncated cylinder is developed the proposed solution achieves an obvious advantage in that the calculation of the singular terms owing to the singularity of the fluid velocity at a sharp corner is avoided after examining the convergence and validity of the proposed model numerical studies are conducted numerical results reveal that the force component associated with the body surface forcing term predominates among the various force components of the total double frequency wave radiation force in addition the force component from the quadratic products of the first order quantities is in general out of phase with the one associated with the body surface forcing term keywords second order wave radiation truncated cylinder surge motion heave motion 1 introduction the nonlinear interaction between ocean waves and offshore coastal structures has attracted significant attention from researchers previous studies have indicated that a perturbation procedure provides a powerful tool for treating the weakly nonlinear wave body interaction problem following a perturbation procedure the velocity potential which describes the flow motion and other physical quantities are expressed in terms of a formal power series under a small parameter known as a perturbation series and solved at each order by knowing the lower order solutions the second order effect is important in many cases particularly when the frequency of the second order wave excitation is close to the resonance frequency of the structure chakrabarti 1990 to refine the existing design procedure significant interest has been focused on the development of a second order theory based on the second order theory there are generally two categories of methods to deal with the wave body interaction problem one is the second order frequency domain method if restricted to simple harmonic motion the problem can be tackled at each discrete frequency by applying a frequency domain method some researchers have conducted a second order analysis in the frequency domain by adopting an indirect method based on the introduction of an assisting potential using an indirect method a semi analytical formulation of the second order wave force on structures with fundamental geometries has been presented including studies by eatock taylor and hung 1987 teng and kato 2002 and cong et al 2018 in addition a semi analytical solution based on a direct method including the second order potential itself has also been developed by other researchers such as kim and yue 1989 chau and eatock taylor 1992 huang and eatock taylor 1996 and mavrakos and chatjigeorgiou 2009 at the same time a second order analysis can also be conducted in the time domain in a time domain simulation the unknowns are on both the free surface and the body surface and a system of equations for the unknowns needs to be set up and solved at each time step by expanding the velocity potential into a perturbation series and applying the taylor expansion to approximate the boundary conditions on the moving surfaces isaacson and ng 1993 proposed a time domain constant boundary element method for the second order wave radiation problem in isaacson and ng s 1993 method the equations for unknowns are set up over the still water surface and the mean body surface which are time invariant thus the coefficient matrix of the equations is the same at each time step bai and teng 2013 made an improvement on isaacson and ng s 1993 work and applied b spline expansion of the velocity potential based on the b spline expansion method the velocity potential and its derivative are continuous on entire smooth patches of the boundary surfaces in addition the second order wave radiation with and without the presence of a small forward speed was studied by shao and faltinsen 2013 in this study a method that can avoid derivatives in the body surface boundary condition was proposed by applying the domain decomposition technique duan et al 2015 developed a second order taylor expansion boundary element method to investigate the wave radiation problem by floating bodies in the time domain and jin 2017 investigated the large amplitude drift motion of offshore platforms in a deep sea and developed a twice expansion method to overcome the inapplicability of a direct perturbation expansion when the expansion parameter is not small moreover teng et al 2018 proposed a new method for calculating the second order wave excitation force in the time domain based on a decomposition of the quadratic transfer function qtf and heo and kashiwagi 2019 proposed a direct time domain boundary element method to analyse the phenomenon of a second order springing on an elastic body with a forward speed the nonlinear hydrodynamic properties associated with a stationary cylinder or a cylinder array have been studied extensively see chau and eatock taylor 1992 teng and kato 2002 cong et al 2015 cong et al 2020 for example as explorations for ocean resources move into deeper water the radiation problem becomes increasingly important in addition to numerical methods analytical or semi analytical methods are also successful in solving the hydrodynamic problems for cases of fundamental geometries the use of analytical or semi analytical methods can bypass discrete computations and facilitate a physical understanding therefore they are efficient to allow parametric studies to be conducted in a wide parametric space however to the best of the author s knowledge with the exception of gören 1996 previous semi analytical studies at the second order have focused exclusively on a wave diffraction from otherwise fixed structures gören 1996 also attempted to derive a semi analytical solution for the second order wave radiation from an oscillating truncated cylinder in this study the body surface forcing term which is in the form of the second order derivative of the velocity potential was calculated directly and a particular solution that satisfies the nonhomogeneous body surface boundary condition was sought using a least squares method in addition gören 1996 calculated the second order wave radiation force on a cylinder through a direct pressure integration over the body surface within the framework of the potential flow theory the fluid velocity can be expressed as a derivative of the velocity potential it is known that the fluid velocity is singular at sharp corners see shao 2010 for example for the second order derivative of the velocity potential it is even much more difficult to achieve a convergent result at a sharp corner in addition as discussed by lee 2007 an evaluation of the quadratic pressure term in bernoulli s equation which is in the form of the quadratic products of the fluid velocity is less accurate when compared to the linear pressure term the quadratic pressure term is singular near the corners making it difficult to obtain an accurate integral of the quadratic pressure over a body surface with sharp corners the above discussion suggests that to obtain a reliable solution to the second order wave radiation problem we must overcome the difficulty associated with the singularity of the fluid velocity at the corner a direct evaluation of the singular terms may not lead to a reliable solution to the problem the main purpose of this study is to develop a novel solution to the second order wave radiation force on an oscillating truncated cylinder which is reliable and free from the influence of the singularity of the fluid velocity at the corner to achieve this the technique of control surfaces has been used in previous studies control surfaces have been used by some researchers in the calculation of the mean drift wave force the mean drift wave force is a time independent component of the second order wave force and can be calculated based on the first order quantities only chen 2007 lee 2007 and liang and chen 2017 integrated the technique of control surfaces into the boundary element method and illustrated the advantage of using control surfaces over the direct pressure integration in terms of the computational accuracy and efficiency they also discussed the consistency between the results using control surfaces and those based on the momentum conservation theorem namely a far field formulation encouraged by the achievements in the calculation of the mean drift wave force in this study we applied control surfaces in the calculation of the double frequency wave force the computation of the double frequency wave force is more complicated than that of the mean drift wave force as the complete double frequency wave force is contributed by not only the first order quantities but also the second order velocity potential in this study the force component directly from the second order velocity potential is evaluated by introducing an assisting potential and is then expressed as a summation of the body surface and free surface integrals involving the body surface and free surface forcing terms respectively after applying the stokes s theorem over the body surface and gauss s theorem in a control volume surrounding the cylinder the body surface integral is recast into a new integral involving quantities on a smooth control surface a certain distance from the body while without the singular terms at the sharp corner of the body surface an efficient numerical technique has also been developed to treat the oscillatory free surface integral in which the entire free surface is divided into the near field and far field regions and different numerical algorithms are used in each region for the calculation of the force component associated with the quadratic products of the first order quantities the advantage of the control surface has also been considered this force component can then be evaluated in a new way without the calculation of the singular terms at a sharp corner based on the above solution procedure a novel solution was developed for the second order wave radiation force on an oscillating truncated cylinder compared with other established methods the obvious advantage of the present solution is that the calculation of the singular terms owning to the singularity of the fluid velocity at a sharp corner is avoided in the following sections the solution is first given for the case of a surging cylinder and then extended to case of a heaving cylinder the rest of this paper is organised as the boundary value problem is introduced in section 2 which is followed by a solution to the first order velocity potential in section 3 in section 4 the calculation of the second order wave radiation force on a surging cylinder is shown then numerical results are shown in section 5 the main conclusions are drawn in section 6 the extension of the solution to the case of a heaving cylinder is provided in the appendix 2 governing equation and boundary conditions the second order wave radiation from an oscillating truncated cylinder in otherwise still water is considered fig 1 shows the definition of the coordinate systems which are fixed in space the oxy and orθ planes are both located on an undisturbed free surface and the positive z points upward an impermeable cylinder of radius a and draft t floats vertically in the fluid the water depth d is constant the distance between the bottom of the cylinder and the seabed is s where s d t we then consider the case of a cylinder experiencing a harmonic translation along the x axis with a small amplitude ξ this motion mode is conventionally defined as a surge the motion of the cylinder ξ t is prescribed as follows 1 ξ t re ξ e i ω t in which ω is the radian frequency of the forced motion and re represents the real part to be considered when the cylinder is at its equilibrium position i e ξ t 0 the z axis coincides with the vertical symmetry axis of the cylinder we assume that the fluid is inviscid and incompressible and that its motion is irrotational the fluid velocity at time t can be described by the gradient of the velocity potential φ the governing equation then becomes laplace s equation 2 φ 2 r θ z t 0 the amplitude of the motion is assumed to be small when compared to the cylinder radius i e ξ a is a small parameter we can then assume that the outgoing radiated waves are of weak nonlinearity and the wave steepness ε is a small parameter of the same order as ξ a by employing the classical perturbation procedure the velocity potential can be expanded as a perturbation series with respect to ε 3 φ ε φ 1 ε 2 φ 2 o ε 3 in eq 3 the subscripts 1 and 2 indicate the quantities of the first and second order respectively as the body is forced to move periodically with frequency ω the first and second order velocity potentials φ 1 and φ 2 are in the form of 4a ε φ 1 r θ z t re φ 1 r θ z e i ω t 4b ε 2 φ 2 r θ z t φ 2 r θ z re φ 2 r θ z e 2 i ω t the steady part of the velocity potential φ 2 is neglected because its contribution to the wave force is at the order of o ε 3 kim and yue 1989 for an impermeable surface such as the body surface and seabed no water can flow through it the component of the fluid velocity normal to the impermeable body surface must be equal to the velocity of the body surface because it is assumed that the body motion is small when compared to the principal body dimension it is possible to expand the boundary conditions originally satisfied on the instantaneous surfaces into a taylor series of the mean position of the moving surfaces then upon inserting the perturbation series into resulting expansions and consistently collecting the terms for the same order of ε and ε 2 the boundary conditions for φ 1 and φ 2 can be obtained the boundary value problem at each order is now formulated with respect to a fluid domain bounded by the seabed the body surface in its equilibrium position the still water surface and a surface located sufficiently far from the body for the wave radiation problem from a surging truncated cylinder the boundary conditions satisfied by φ 1 are then given by the following 5a φ 1 n i ω ξ n x on s b 5b φ 1 z ω 2 g φ 1 on z 0 5c φ 1 z 0 on z d in eq 5 s b is the mean body surface g is the gravitational acceleration k 0 is the positive real root of ω 2 g k 0 tanh k 0 d and n n x n y n z t is the unit normal vector pointing outward from the fluid domain moreover to ensure the uniqueness of the solution φ 1 must also satisfy the sommerfeld radiation condition at a large distance from the structure that is 6 lim r r r φ 1 i k 0 φ 1 0 in addition φ 2 is subject to the following boundary conditions 7a φ 2 n b 2 r θ z on s b 7b φ 2 z 4 ω 2 g φ 2 1 g q 2 r θ on z 0 7c φ 2 z 0 on z d in eq 7a b 2 r θ z is the body surface forcing term for a surging body and can be expressed as follows 8 b 2 r θ z 1 2 ξ 2 φ 1 x n on s b in eq 7b q 2 r θ is the free surface forcing term and can be expressed as follows 9 q 2 r θ i ω φ 1 φ 1 i ω 5 2 g 2 φ 1 φ 1 i ω 2 2 φ 1 z 2 φ 1 z 0 the main difficulties associated with the second order problem lie in the nonhomogeneous terms in eqs 8 and 9 the second order problem is further complicated by the requirement of a proper specification of the radiation condition in the far field we then examine the far field behaviour of φ 2 following the work by molin 1979 φ 2 can be decomposed into a homogeneous solution free waves φ h 2 and a particular solution locked waves φ p 2 at a large distance from the structure that is 10 φ 2 φ h 2 φ p 2 on the undisturbed free surface we can have the following 11a φ h 2 z 4 ω 2 g φ h 2 on z 0 11b φ p 2 z 4 ω 2 g φ p 2 1 g q 2 r θ on z 0 the boundary value problem for φ h 2 is similar to the first order radiation problem the far field behaviour of φ h 2 is then given by 12 φ h 2 f h θ r cosh κ 0 z d e i κ 0 r o r 3 2 r in which κ 0 satisfies 4 ω 2 g κ 0 tanh κ 0 d and the function f h θ describes the variation of the homogeneous solution along the circumferential direction in the far field the far field behaviour of φ p 2 is governed by that of the free surface forcing term q 2 r θ which contains the quadratic products of the first order radiation potential itself by using the asymptotic expansion of the first order radiation potential for a large argument the quadratic products from φ 1 itself decay with o l r as r and dominate the far field behaviour of q 2 r θ we then can have the following asymptotic form for φ p 2 13 φ p 2 f p θ r cosh 2 k 0 z d e 2 i k 0 r o r 2 r in which the function f p θ describes the variation of the particular solution along the circumferential direction in the far field it should be noted that eq 13 satisfies laplace s equation to the leading order as well as the boundary condition on the seabed eqs 10 12 and 13 suggest that φ 2 decays with o l r 1 2 in the far field a weak radiation condition can then be guaranteed for φ 2 3 solution of the first order velocity potential as shown in fig 1 the fluid domain ω is divided into two subdomains ω i and ω e here ω i is the domain below the cylinder 0 r a d z t and ω e is the domain outside the cylinder r a hereinafter φ i 1 and φ e 1 represent the first order velocity potential in ω i and ω e respectively the continuity of the pressure and normal velocity at r a then requires the following 14a φ i 1 φ e 1 r a d z t 14b φ i 1 r φ e 1 r r a d z t because of the axisymmetric geometry of the body a method for separating the variables can be used to derive the expression of the velocity potential according to yeung 1981 the expressions of φ i 1 and φ e 1 can be written as follows 15a φ i 1 r θ z ϕ i 1 r z cos θ 15b φ e 1 r θ z ϕ e 1 r z cos θ where 16a ϕ i 1 r z j 0 b j v 1 j γ j r y j γ j z 16b ϕ e 1 r z j 0 a j r 1 j κ j r z j κ j z in eq 16 a j and b j are unknown coefficients the eigenvalues γ j are defined as γ 0 1 and γ j jπ s for j 1 κ j is the jth real root of ω 2 g κ j tan κ j d and the radial eigenfunctions v 1 j γ j r and r 1 j γ j r can be determined according to the following equation with m 1 17a v m j γ j r r a m j 0 i m γ j r i m γ j a j 0 17b r m j k j r h m k 0 r j 0 k m k l r j 0 in eq 17 h m x is the hankel function of the first kind of order m and i m x and k m x are the modified hankel functions of the first and second kinds of order m respectively the eigenfunctions y j γ j z and z j k j z are orthonormal functions given at the interval d t and d 0 respectively and are defined as follows 18a y j γ j z 2 2 j 0 cos γ j z d j 0 18b z j k j z cosh k 0 z d cosh k 0 d j 0 cos k j z d cos k j d j 0 the velocity potential given in eqs 15 and 16 describes the flow in the respective region the unknown coefficients in these expressions can be determined by imposing the matching condition at r a see eq 14 the infinite series of orthogonal functions in eq 16 is truncated to finite terms and two sets of linear equations can then be established after solving the linear algebraic system the valid velocity potential in each subdomain can be obtained 4 calculation of the second order wave radiation force the wave forces acting on a body can be evaluated through an integration of the fluid pressure over the body surface the fluid pressure can be obtained from bernoulli s equation because the amplitude of the body motion is small the fluid pressure on the instantaneous body surface can be approximated using a taylor expansion about the mean body surface by employing the perturbation procedure the wave force can be expanded into a perturbation series in terms of ε 19 f f 0 ε f 1 ε 2 f 2 o ε 3 following the discussion in previous studies such as by huang and eatock taylor 1996 and bai and teng 2013 the second order wave force can be decomposed into a time oscillatory and a mean component respectively in addition the time oscillatory component can be further split into two distinct parts we can then have 20 ε 2 f 2 re f 2 e 2 i ω t f m 2 and 21 f 2 f p 2 f q 2 in eq 20 f 2 is the amplitude of the time oscillatory component and f m 2 is a time independent component and is normally called the mean drift wave force in eq 21 f 2 is expressed as a summation of f p 2 and f q 2 which are derived owing to the second order velocity potential and the quadratic products of the first order quantities respectively similar to f q 2 f m 2 is also derived from the quadratic products of the first order quantities because the calculation of f m 2 is similar to that of f q 2 it is not shown in this study when a vertical cylinder moves harmonically along the x direction the second order wave force along the z direction can be induced then the contribution directly from the second order velocity potential to the double frequency wave force on the surging cylinder can be expressed as follows 22 f p z 2 2 i ω ρ s b φ 2 n z d s in which n z is the z direction component of the normal vector in addition following ogilvie 1983 the contribution from the quadratic products of the first order quantities to the double frequency wave force on a surging cylinder can be expressed as follows 23 f q z 2 1 4 ρ s b φ 1 φ 1 n z d s 1 2 i ω ρ ξ s b φ 1 x n z d s 1 4 ρ g γ w η 1 η 1 n z d l in which γ w is the mean waterline and η 1 is the first order wave run up amplitude along the waterline 4 1 calculation of f p z 2 as for the calculation of f p z 2 the integral in eq 22 can be evaluated by using the method suggested by molin 1979 and lighthill 1979 we then specify a linear radiation problem such that 24 ϕ ˆ n n z 0 r a t z 0 1 0 r a z t and 25 ϕ ˆ z 4 ω 2 g ϕ ˆ on z 0 moreover ϕ ˆ satisfies a no flow condition on the seabed and sommerfeld radiation condition in the far field here ϕ ˆ which is governed by laplace s equation is then used as the assisting function hereinafter ϕ ˆ i and ϕ ˆ e represent the assisting functions in the inner and outer subdomains respectively in the inner subdomain ω i ϕ ˆ i can be written as follows 26 ϕ ˆ i j 0 b ˆ j v 0 j γ j r y j γ j z ϕ ˆ p where b ˆ j is an unknown coefficient the radial and vertical functions v 0 j γ j r and y j γ j z can be determined according to eqs 17a and 18a respectively and ϕ ˆ p is the particular solution expressed as 27 ϕ ˆ p 1 2 s z d 2 r 2 2 in the outer subdomain ω e ϕ ˆ e can be written as follows 28 φ ˆ e j 0 a ˆ j r 0 j κ j r z j κ j z where a ˆ j is an unknown coefficient and κ l l 1 is the lth positive real root of 4 ω 2 g κ l tan κ l d in eq 28 the radial and vertical functions r 0 j κ j r and z j κ j z can be determined according to eqs 17b and 18b respectively with k j being replaced by κ j following the method described in section 3 the unknown coefficients a ˆ j and b ˆ j can be obtained by applying the matching technique then by substituting eq 24 into eq 22 we obtain 29 f p z 2 2 i ω ρ s b φ 2 ϕ ˆ n d s green s second identity is then used on the surfaces enclosing the entire fluid domain 30 s b s d s f s φ 2 ϕ ˆ n ϕ ˆ φ 2 n d s 0 in which s is a circular cylinder enclosing the cylinder and the radius of s tends towards infinity this leads to the following 31 f p z 2 f b z 2 f f z 2 f z 2 in which 32a f b z 2 2 i ω ρ s b ϕ ˆ φ 2 n d s 32b f f z 2 2 i ω ρ s f φ 2 ϕ ˆ n ϕ ˆ φ 2 n d s 32c f z 2 2 i ω ρ s φ 2 ϕ ˆ n ϕ ˆ φ 2 n d s at a large radius a far field asymptotic expression of the assisting function ϕ ˆ can be derived using the asymptotic expressions for bessel functions large arguments the following is then obtained 33 ϕ ˆ a ˆ j 2 π κ 0 r e i κ 0 r π 4 cosh κ 0 z d cosh κ 0 d o r 3 2 based on the asymptotic behaviour of φ 2 and ϕ ˆ in the far field see eqs 10 12 13 and 33 it is found that the integral over s vanishes in the far field and does not contribute to f p z 2 a calculation is then carried out for the integral on the body surface s b substituting eq 7a into the right hand side of eq 32a yields the following 34 f b z 2 2 i ω ρ s b b 2 r θ z φ ˆ d s as shown in eq 8 b 2 r θ z contains the second order derivative of the velocity potential in the potential flow theory the fluid velocity can be expressed as the derivative of the velocity potential it is known that the fluid velocity is singular at a sharp corner it is even much more difficult to achieve a convergent evaluation of the second order derivative of the velocity potential at the corner which brings about difficulty in dealing with the integral to overcome this difficulty the following identity is used 35 s b ϕ ˆ x φ 1 n φ 1 ϕ ˆ n x ϕ ˆ x φ 1 n d s γ w ϕ ˆ φ 1 z t y d l eq 35 is derived based on the application of stokes s theorem the detailed derivation of eq 35 is presented in appendix a see eq a3 with j 1 after applying eq 35 eq 34 can be further expressed as follows 36 f b z 2 i ω ρ ξ i ω ξ s b ϕ ˆ x n x d s s b n x φ 1 ϕ ˆ d s γ w ϕ ˆ φ 1 z t y d l in eq 36 the second order derivative of the velocity potential no longer exists however eq 36 still contains the quadratic products of the fluid velocity i e the second part on the right hand side of eq 36 as discussed by chen 2007 and lee 2007 when the body has sharp corners the quadratic products of the fluid velocity near the corner is singular although this is integrable it is difficult to obtain accurate computational results through a direct integral therefore the following identity which is derived using gauss s theorem is applied to recast eq 36 37 s b s c s d s f φ 1 ϕ ˆ n d s s b s c s d s f φ 1 n ϕ ˆ ϕ ˆ n φ 1 d s the detailed derivation of eq 37 is presented in appendix a see eq a10 in eq 37 s b s c s d and s f are the boundaries of a control volume ω c in which s c r r c d z 0 represents a fictitious control surface surrounding the cylinder s d and s f are the seabed and the mean plane of the free surface in ω c the definitions of the control volume ω c and the control surface s c are given in fig 2 then the combination of eq 36 and eq 37 gives the following 38 f b z 2 i ω ρ ξ s b φ 1 x n z d s s c s f φ 1 x ϕ ˆ n ϕ ˆ x φ 1 n d s s c φ 1 ϕ ˆ n x d s γ w ϕ ˆ φ 1 z t y d l then after integrating in θ and using the orthogonality eq 38 can be further expressed as follows 39 f b z 2 i ω ρ ξ π r c d 0 ϕ e 1 r 1 r c ϕ e 1 ϕ ˆ e r ϕ 1 z ϕ ˆ e z r r c d z ω 2 g ϕ e 1 ϕ ˆ e 1 r z 0 r a ω 2 g a r c 4 ϕ e 1 r 1 r ϕ e 1 ϕ ˆ e ϕ e 1 ϕ ˆ e r z 0 r d r ϕ i 1 r z t r a it should be noted that the singular terms owing to the singularity of the fluid velocity at a corner no longer exists in eq 39 a calculation is then conducted for the integral over the free surface s f substituting eq 7b into the right hand side of eq 32b yields the following 40 f f z 2 2 i ω ρ g s f q 2 r θ ϕ d s here q 2 r θ behaves in an oscillatory manner over the entire free surface and decays in order of 1 r with an increase in the distance from the body following cong et al 2012 2018 the entire free surface is divided into the near field and far field regions and different numerical algorithms are used in each region it should be noted that a second order derivative term is involved in q 2 r θ by using the green s theorem the integral can be replaced by a new integral without the second order derivative then through an integration in the circumferential direction the free surface integral can be reduced to a series of radial integrals in addition the line integral over the far field can be simplified by neglecting the contributions owing to the evanescent modes the resulting expression for f f z 2 can be written as follows 41 f f z 2 ω 2 ρ π g i f 1 i f 2 ϕ e 1 r ϕ e 1 ϕ ˆ e r r a z 0 in which 42a i f 1 a r f ϕ e 1 r ϕ e 1 r ϕ ˆ e 1 r 2 3 ω 4 g 2 ϕ e 1 ϕ e 1 ϕ ˆ e ϕ e 1 r ϕ e 1 ϕ ˆ e r z 0 r d r 42b i f 2 a 0 a 0 a ˆ 0 h 1 k 0 r r h 1 k 0 r h 0 κ 0

respectively and r f is the radius of the circular boundary dividing the near and far field regions in the numerical implementation an adaptive integration technique is used to determine r f by using the asymptotic expansions of hankel s functions the integrand of the line integral in eq 42b can be represented through a summation of the polynomials of various orders and the integral can then be explicitly evaluated 4 2 calculation of f q z 2 from eq 23 it appears that f q z 2 depends only on the first order wave field in eq 23 the integral over the waterline γ w the third term on the right hand side of eq 23 makes no contribution to f q z 2 owing to the vertical side wall of the cylinder for a moving body the nonlinearity in the wave pressure is expected to be strong within the close vicinity of the body and it becomes difficult to obtain an accurate integral of the quadratic pressure over the body surface with sharp corners to overcome this difficulty the following identity is then used to recast the formulation containing the following quadratic pressure integration 43 s b s c s f s d φ 1 φ 1 n d s 2 s b s c s f s d φ 1 n φ 1 d s eq 43 is a special case of eq a10 with ϕ ˆ φ 1 the combination of eq 23 and eq 43 leads to the following 44 f q z 2 1 4 ρ s f s d φ 1 φ 1 n z d s 2 s c s f φ 1 n φ 1 z d s 2 i ω ξ s b φ 1 z n x φ 1 x n z d s in which n x is the x direction component of the normal vector the surface integrals in eq 44 can be simplified to line integrals by integrating in θ and using the orthogonality eq 44 can then be rewritten as follows 45 f q z 2 1 4 ρ π a r c ϕ e 1 r ϕ e 1 r 1 r 2 ϕ e 1 ϕ e 1 ω 4 g 2 ϕ e 1 ϕ e 1 z 0 r d r 2 d 0 ϕ e 1 r ϕ e 1 z r r c r c d z a r c ϕ e 1 r ϕ e 1 r 1 r 2 ϕ e 1 ϕ e 1 z d r d r 0 a ϕ i 1 r ϕ i 1 r 1 r 2 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 z d r d r 2 i ω ξ r ϕ e 1 z 0 r a r ϕ e 1 z t r a r ϕ i 1 z t r a as the obvious advantage of eq 45 the calculation of the singular terms at the sharp corner is no longer required after evaluating f b z 2 f f z 2 and f q z 2 the complete double frequency wave radiation force can be determined based on their summation that is 46 f z 2 f b z 2 f f z 2 f q z 2 in the numerical implementation a romberg quadrature is used to control the accuracy of the line integrals in eqs 39 42a and 45 based on the above solution procedure a novel solution to the second order wave radiation force on an oscillating truncated cylinder is derived in the previous sections the solution was presented for the case of a surging cylinder the extension of the solution to the case of a heaving cylinder is also given in this study please refer to appendix b for more details 5 numerical results and discussion the accuracy of the semi analytical model outlined above is described in this section first the dependency of the results on the number of eigenmodes is examined making sure that the present results are reliable in the numerical algorithm the number of eigenmodes in the inner and outer subdomains i e ω i and ω e are the same and are equal to n from mode 0 to mode n 1 the factor ρ g a ξ 2 has been used to nondimensionalise the wave force hereinafter the denotations f z f p z f q z f b z and f f z are used to represent the dimensionless double frequency wave radiation force and the force components respectively in the convergence test a truncated cylinder of radius a and draft t a is taken as an example in addition the water depth d is equal to 3a the variation of f b z f f z f q z and f z with respect to n is shown in fig 3 for k 0 a 1 0 and 3 0 respectively in fig 3 im represents the imaginary part of a complex quantity fig 3 reveals a good convergence of the present solution both the real and imaginary parts fig 3 shows that n 200 is sufficient to eliminate the dependence of the convergence on n to ensure that all results shown in the following study are free from the influence of n n 200 is adopted in the subsequent parametric study yeung 1981 examined the convergence of the added mass and radiation damping with respect to the number of eigenmodes for a truncated cylinder the added mass and radiation damping are normally defined as the parts of the linear wave radiation force that are in phase with the acceleration and velocity of the moving body respectively in the linear problem the velocity potential satisfies the homogeneous boundary conditions and the calculation of the wave force can be achieved through an integration of the linear pressure term however when analysing the second order problem various terms of significant nonlinearities will be encountered such as the body surface and free surface forcing terms as well as the quadratic pressure term therefore to ensure a convergent result a larger number of eigenmodes has to be used for the second order wave radiation force than that for the added mass and radiation damping another check that needs to be carried out is the dependence of the calculation of f q z and f b z on the size of the control surface the effect of the control surface on the calculation is examined in fig 4 in which δr r c a is varied as δr a 2a and 5a respectively note that δr 2a has been adopted in the convergence test in fig 3 from fig 4 it is found that different choices of the control surface give the same converged results in addition δr 2a is then used in all subsequent computations the validity of the proposed model is then examined by comparing the present results with other published results based on the mesh based methods isaacson and ng 1993 teng 1995 shao 2010 and bai and teng 2013 isaacson and ng 1993 solved the wave radiation problem based on the discretisation of constant panels however more advanced numerical models considering the higher order mesh based methods were used by teng 1995 shao 2010 and bai and teng 2013 who used the frequency domain higher order boundary element method cubic higher order boundary element method and b spline function expansion based boundary element method respectively to calculate the wave radiation force on a moving cylinder the comparison between the present results and the above mentioned numerical results is shown in fig 5 in the comparison a truncated cylinder of radius a and draft t 0 5a is considered in addition the water depth d is equal to 1 5a a significant deviation in the solution by isaacson and ng 1993 is observed as expected owning to the application of constant panels the variation in the physical quantities over the body surface is not captured well in the method using constant panel particularly for the solution up to the second order meanwhile good agreements between the solutions of the present model and other existing numerical results which are based on a higher order method and refined discretisation are obtained providing confidence in the use of the proposed model after demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model a parametric study is then conducted the effect of the cylinder draft on the double frequency wave radiation force and its constituent components on a surging cylinder is shown in fig 6 in which the cylinder draft is varied as t 0 5a 0 75a a 1 25a and 1 5a whereas the water depth is fixed at d 3a the effect of the cylinder draft on the force component f q z is shown in fig 6 a in fig 6 a the wave forces continue to increase as k 0 a increases until reaching a local peak and then decrease mildly with an increase in k 0 a until reaching a local trough next an increasing trend is observed again it is also found that the frequencies of the local peak and trough move gradually to the low frequency region as the cylinder draft increases the effect of the cylinder draft on the force components f b z and f f z is shown in fig 6 b and c respectively in fig 6 b the wave forces are initially similar to each other and then increase monotonously as k 0 a increases beyond a certain point namely the turning point each wave force in fig 6 b can still achieve an increasing trend but at a much milder rate which decreases as the cylinder draft decreases the general trend of the wave forces in fig 6 c is similar to that in fig 6 b when reaching beyond an obvious turning point the wave forces in fig 6 c with d 0 75a a 1 25a and 1 5a increase in a nearly linear manner with an increase in k 0 a however for d 0 5a the variation in the force is relatively smaller initially and then begins to increase with an increase in k 0 a the effect of cylinder draft on the total double frequency wave radiation force is shown in fig 6 d in the low frequency region the wave forces generally increase as the cylinder draft increases at a certain wave frequency however in the high frequency region a reversed but more pronounced trend can be found and an increase in the cylinder draft can lead to an apparent decrease in the wave force the phase angle of the wave force is shown in fig 7 for t 0 5a and a respectively it is found that the total wave force is dominated by the contribution from the body surface forcing term i e f b z and the phase angle of f b z is close to that of f z it is also found that the f q z is nearly out of phase with f b z over the entire frequency region in fig 8 we consider the effect of the water depth on the double frequency wave radiation force and its constituent components in the calculation the water depth is varied as d 2a 2 5a 3a 3 5a and 4a whereas the cylinder draft is fixed at t a in fig 8 the wave forces corresponding to different water depths follow the same trend the effect of the water depth is not obvious within the low frequency region however in the high frequency region an increase in the water depth can lead to an obvious decrease in the magnitude of the total double frequency wave radiation force and each force component 6 concluding remarks the wave radiation from an oscillating truncated cylinder was concerted in this study the main purpose of this study was to derive a reliable solution to the wave radiation force on the oscillating cylinder up to the second order the nonlinear hydrodynamic properties related to the oscillating cylinder were also investigated the main conclusions of this study are summarised as follows 1 in this study the technique of control surfaces was adopted to overcome the difficulty associated with the singularity of the fluid velocity at the corner and a novel solution to the double frequency wave radiation force on an oscillating cylinder was developed the proposed solution achieves the obvious advantage in that a calculation of the singular terms arising at the sharp corner is avoided 2 efficient numerical techniques were developed for the accurate evaluation of each force component of the total double frequency wave radiation force convergence of the present solution with respect to the number of eigenmodes and the size of the control surface was examined in detail good convergence characteristics were demonstrated a comparison of the present outcome with the published results based on higher order mesh based methods were conducted and good agreements were achieved 3 contributions to the double frequency wave radiation force from its various force components were identified the component associated with the body surface forcing term predominates among the various force components the force component from the quadratic products of the first order quantities is in general out of phase with the one associated with the body surface forcing term an extension of the present model to an analysis of the wave force on moving bodies exposed to incident waves will be straightforward it is expected that the present method can eventually be extended to studies on the combined second order wave diffraction and radiation problem

translation along the z axis with a small amplitude ξ and radian frequency ω this motion mode is conventionally defined as a heave except those on the body surface the boundary conditions satisfied by φ 1 and φ 2 on the free surface sea bed and far field in the case of a heaving cylinder are the similar to those for a surging cylinder on the body surface the boundary conditions are updated as follows a11 φ 1 n i ω ξ n z on s b and a12 φ 2 n 1 2 ξ 2 φ 1 z n on s b the eigenfunction expansion matching method is then used to solve the first order velocity potential in the inner and outer subdomains i e φ i 1 and φ e 1 for the second order time oscillatory wave force along the vertical direction i e f z 2 this can be expressed as a summation of f p z 2 and f q z 2 which are due to the second order velocity potential and the quadratic products of the first order quantities respectively after introducing the assisting function ϕ ˆ f p z 2 is contributed by the integrals over the free surface and the body surface the evaluation of the free surface integral in the case of a heaving cylinder is similar to that for a surging cylinder therefore it will not be discussed again herein the

21916,a truncated cylinder in harmonic oscillation with a small amplitude at a finite water depth is considered a perturbation procedure is applied to analyse the wave radiation problem up to the second order in frequency domain the technique of control surfaces is used to overcome the difficulty associated with the singularity of the fluid velocity at the corner and a novel solution to the double frequency wave radiation force on a surging heaving truncated cylinder is developed the proposed solution achieves an obvious advantage in that the calculation of the singular terms owing to the singularity of the fluid velocity at a sharp corner is avoided after examining the convergence and validity of the proposed model numerical studies are conducted numerical results reveal that the force component associated with the body surface forcing term predominates among the various force components of the total double frequency wave radiation force in addition the force component from the quadratic products of the first order quantities is in general out of phase with the one associated with the body surface forcing term keywords second order wave radiation truncated cylinder surge motion heave motion 1 introduction the nonlinear interaction between ocean waves and offshore coastal structures has attracted significant attention from researchers previous studies have indicated that a perturbation procedure provides a powerful tool for treating the weakly nonlinear wave body interaction problem following a perturbation procedure the velocity potential which describes the flow motion and other physical quantities are expressed in terms of a formal power series under a small parameter known as a perturbation series and solved at each order by knowing the lower order solutions the second order effect is important in many cases particularly when the frequency of the second order wave excitation is close to the resonance frequency of the structure chakrabarti 1990 to refine the existing design procedure significant interest has been focused on the development of a second order theory based on the second order theory there are generally two categories of methods to deal with the wave body interaction problem one is the second order frequency domain method if restricted to simple harmonic motion the problem can be tackled at each discrete frequency by applying a frequency domain method some researchers have conducted a second order analysis in the frequency domain by adopting an indirect method based on the introduction of an assisting potential using an indirect method a semi analytical formulation of the second order wave force on structures with fundamental geometries has been presented including studies by eatock taylor and hung 1987 teng and kato 2002 and cong et al 2018 in addition a semi analytical solution based on a direct method including the second order potential itself has also been developed by other researchers such as kim and yue 1989 chau and eatock taylor 1992 huang and eatock taylor 1996 and mavrakos and chatjigeorgiou 2009 at the same time a second order analysis can also be conducted in the time domain in a time domain simulation the unknowns are on both the free surface and the body surface and a system of equations for the unknowns needs to be set up and solved at each time step by expanding the velocity potential into a perturbation series and applying the taylor expansion to approximate the boundary conditions on the moving surfaces isaacson and ng 1993 proposed a time domain constant boundary element method for the second order wave radiation problem in isaacson and ng s 1993 method the equations for unknowns are set up over the still water surface and the mean body surface which are time invariant thus the coefficient matrix of the equations is the same at each time step bai and teng 2013 made an improvement on isaacson and ng s 1993 work and applied b spline expansion of the velocity potential based on the b spline expansion method the velocity potential and its derivative are continuous on entire smooth patches of the boundary surfaces in addition the second order wave radiation with and without the presence of a small forward speed was studied by shao and faltinsen 2013 in this study a method that can avoid derivatives in the body surface boundary condition was proposed by applying the domain decomposition technique duan et al 2015 developed a second order taylor expansion boundary element method to investigate the wave radiation problem by floating bodies in the time domain and jin 2017 investigated the large amplitude drift motion of offshore platforms in a deep sea and developed a twice expansion method to overcome the inapplicability of a direct perturbation expansion when the expansion parameter is not small moreover teng et al 2018 proposed a new method for calculating the second order wave excitation force in the time domain based on a decomposition of the quadratic transfer function qtf and heo and kashiwagi 2019 proposed a direct time domain boundary element method to analyse the phenomenon of a second order springing on an elastic body with a forward speed the nonlinear hydrodynamic properties associated with a stationary cylinder or a cylinder array have been studied extensively see chau and eatock taylor 1992 teng and kato 2002 cong et al 2015 cong et al 2020 for example as explorations for ocean resources move into deeper water the radiation problem becomes increasingly important in addition to numerical methods analytical or semi analytical methods are also successful in solving the hydrodynamic problems for cases of fundamental geometries the use of analytical or semi analytical methods can bypass discrete computations and facilitate a physical understanding therefore they are efficient to allow parametric studies to be conducted in a wide parametric space however to the best of the author s knowledge with the exception of gören 1996 previous semi analytical studies at the second order have focused exclusively on a wave diffraction from otherwise fixed structures gören 1996 also attempted to derive a semi analytical solution for the second order wave radiation from an oscillating truncated cylinder in this study the body surface forcing term which is in the form of the second order derivative of the velocity potential was calculated directly and a particular solution that satisfies the nonhomogeneous body surface boundary condition was sought using a least squares method in addition gören 1996 calculated the second order wave radiation force on a cylinder through a direct pressure integration over the body surface within the framework of the potential flow theory the fluid velocity can be expressed as a derivative of the velocity potential it is known that the fluid velocity is singular at sharp corners see shao 2010 for example for the second order derivative of the velocity potential it is even much more difficult to achieve a convergent result at a sharp corner in addition as discussed by lee 2007 an evaluation of the quadratic pressure term in bernoulli s equation which is in the form of the quadratic products of the fluid velocity is less accurate when compared to the linear pressure term the quadratic pressure term is singular near the corners making it difficult to obtain an accurate integral of the quadratic pressure over a body surface with sharp corners the above discussion suggests that to obtain a reliable solution to the second order wave radiation problem we must overcome the difficulty associated with the singularity of the fluid velocity at the corner a direct evaluation of the singular terms may not lead to a reliable solution to the problem the main purpose of this study is to develop a novel solution to the second order wave radiation force on an oscillating truncated cylinder which is reliable and free from the influence of the singularity of the fluid velocity at the corner to achieve this the technique of control surfaces has been used in previous studies control surfaces have been used by some researchers in the calculation of the mean drift wave force the mean drift wave force is a time independent component of the second order wave force and can be calculated based on the first order quantities only chen 2007 lee 2007 and liang and chen 2017 integrated the technique of control surfaces into the boundary element method and illustrated the advantage of using control surfaces over the direct pressure integration in terms of the computational accuracy and efficiency they also discussed the consistency between the results using control surfaces and those based on the momentum conservation theorem namely a far field formulation encouraged by the achievements in the calculation of the mean drift wave force in this study we applied control surfaces in the calculation of the double frequency wave force the computation of the double frequency wave force is more complicated than that of the mean drift wave force as the complete double frequency wave force is contributed by not only the first order quantities but also the second order velocity potential in this study the force component directly from the second order velocity potential is evaluated by introducing an assisting potential and is then expressed as a summation of the body surface and free surface integrals involving the body surface and free surface forcing terms respectively after applying the stokes s theorem over the body surface and gauss s theorem in a control volume surrounding the cylinder the body surface integral is recast into a new integral involving quantities on a smooth control surface a certain distance from the body while without the singular terms at the sharp corner of the body surface an efficient numerical technique has also been developed to treat the oscillatory free surface integral in which the entire free surface is divided into the near field and far field regions and different numerical algorithms are used in each region for the calculation of the force component associated with the quadratic products of the first order quantities the advantage of the control surface has also been considered this force component can then be evaluated in a new way without the calculation of the singular terms at a sharp corner based on the above solution procedure a novel solution was developed for the second order wave radiation force on an oscillating truncated cylinder compared with other established methods the obvious advantage of the present solution is that the calculation of the singular terms owning to the singularity of the fluid velocity at a sharp corner is avoided in the following sections the solution is first given for the case of a surging cylinder and then extended to case of a heaving cylinder the rest of this paper is organised as the boundary value problem is introduced in section 2 which is followed by a solution to the first order velocity potential in section 3 in section 4 the calculation of the second order wave radiation force on a surging cylinder is shown then numerical results are shown in section 5 the main conclusions are drawn in section 6 the extension of the solution to the case of a heaving cylinder is provided in the appendix 2 governing equation and boundary conditions the second order wave radiation from an oscillating truncated cylinder in otherwise still water is considered fig 1 shows the definition of the coordinate systems which are fixed in space the oxy and orθ planes are both located on an undisturbed free surface and the positive z points upward an impermeable cylinder of radius a and draft t floats vertically in the fluid the water depth d is constant the distance between the bottom of the cylinder and the seabed is s where s d t we then consider the case of a cylinder experiencing a harmonic translation along the x axis with a small amplitude ξ this motion mode is conventionally defined as a surge the motion of the cylinder ξ t is prescribed as follows 1 ξ t re ξ e i ω t in which ω is the radian frequency of the forced motion and re represents the real part to be considered when the cylinder is at its equilibrium position i e ξ t 0 the z axis coincides with the vertical symmetry axis of the cylinder we assume that the fluid is inviscid and incompressible and that its motion is irrotational the fluid velocity at time t can be described by the gradient of the velocity potential φ the governing equation then becomes laplace s equation 2 φ 2 r θ z t 0 the amplitude of the motion is assumed to be small when compared to the cylinder radius i e ξ a is a small parameter we can then assume that the outgoing radiated waves are of weak nonlinearity and the wave steepness ε is a small parameter of the same order as ξ a by employing the classical perturbation procedure the velocity potential can be expanded as a perturbation series with respect to ε 3 φ ε φ 1 ε 2 φ 2 o ε 3 in eq 3 the subscripts 1 and 2 indicate the quantities of the first and second order respectively as the body is forced to move periodically with frequency ω the first and second order velocity potentials φ 1 and φ 2 are in the form of 4a ε φ 1 r θ z t re φ 1 r θ z e i ω t 4b ε 2 φ 2 r θ z t φ 2 r θ z re φ 2 r θ z e 2 i ω t the steady part of the velocity potential φ 2 is neglected because its contribution to the wave force is at the order of o ε 3 kim and yue 1989 for an impermeable surface such as the body surface and seabed no water can flow through it the component of the fluid velocity normal to the impermeable body surface must be equal to the velocity of the body surface because it is assumed that the body motion is small when compared to the principal body dimension it is possible to expand the boundary conditions originally satisfied on the instantaneous surfaces into a taylor series of the mean position of the moving surfaces then upon inserting the perturbation series into resulting expansions and consistently collecting the terms for the same order of ε and ε 2 the boundary conditions for φ 1 and φ 2 can be obtained the boundary value problem at each order is now formulated with respect to a fluid domain bounded by the seabed the body surface in its equilibrium position the still water surface and a surface located sufficiently far from the body for the wave radiation problem from a surging truncated cylinder the boundary conditions satisfied by φ 1 are then given by the following 5a φ 1 n i ω ξ n x on s b 5b φ 1 z ω 2 g φ 1 on z 0 5c φ 1 z 0 on z d in eq 5 s b is the mean body surface g is the gravitational acceleration k 0 is the positive real root of ω 2 g k 0 tanh k 0 d and n n x n y n z t is the unit normal vector pointing outward from the fluid domain moreover to ensure the uniqueness of the solution φ 1 must also satisfy the sommerfeld radiation condition at a large distance from the structure that is 6 lim r r r φ 1 i k 0 φ 1 0 in addition φ 2 is subject to the following boundary conditions 7a φ 2 n b 2 r θ z on s b 7b φ 2 z 4 ω 2 g φ 2 1 g q 2 r θ on z 0 7c φ 2 z 0 on z d in eq 7a b 2 r θ z is the body surface forcing term for a surging body and can be expressed as follows 8 b 2 r θ z 1 2 ξ 2 φ 1 x n on s b in eq 7b q 2 r θ is the free surface forcing term and can be expressed as follows 9 q 2 r θ i ω φ 1 φ 1 i ω 5 2 g 2 φ 1 φ 1 i ω 2 2 φ 1 z 2 φ 1 z 0 the main difficulties associated with the second order problem lie in the nonhomogeneous terms in eqs 8 and 9 the second order problem is further complicated by the requirement of a proper specification of the radiation condition in the far field we then examine the far field behaviour of φ 2 following the work by molin 1979 φ 2 can be decomposed into a homogeneous solution free waves φ h 2 and a particular solution locked waves φ p 2 at a large distance from the structure that is 10 φ 2 φ h 2 φ p 2 on the undisturbed free surface we can have the following 11a φ h 2 z 4 ω 2 g φ h 2 on z 0 11b φ p 2 z 4 ω 2 g φ p 2 1 g q 2 r θ on z 0 the boundary value problem for φ h 2 is similar to the first order radiation problem the far field behaviour of φ h 2 is then given by 12 φ h 2 f h θ r cosh κ 0 z d e i κ 0 r o r 3 2 r in which κ 0 satisfies 4 ω 2 g κ 0 tanh κ 0 d and the function f h θ describes the variation of the homogeneous solution along the circumferential direction in the far field the far field behaviour of φ p 2 is governed by that of the free surface forcing term q 2 r θ which contains the quadratic products of the first order radiation potential itself by using the asymptotic expansion of the first order radiation potential for a large argument the quadratic products from φ 1 itself decay with o l r as r and dominate the far field behaviour of q 2 r θ we then can have the following asymptotic form for φ p 2 13 φ p 2 f p θ r cosh 2 k 0 z d e 2 i k 0 r o r 2 r in which the function f p θ describes the variation of the particular solution along the circumferential direction in the far field it should be noted that eq 13 satisfies laplace s equation to the leading order as well as the boundary condition on the seabed eqs 10 12 and 13 suggest that φ 2 decays with o l r 1 2 in the far field a weak radiation condition can then be guaranteed for φ 2 3 solution of the first order velocity potential as shown in fig 1 the fluid domain ω is divided into two subdomains ω i and ω e here ω i is the domain below the cylinder 0 r a d z t and ω e is the domain outside the cylinder r a hereinafter φ i 1 and φ e 1 represent the first order velocity potential in ω i and ω e respectively the continuity of the pressure and normal velocity at r a then requires the following 14a φ i 1 φ e 1 r a d z t 14b φ i 1 r φ e 1 r r a d z t because of the axisymmetric geometry of the body a method for separating the variables can be used to derive the expression of the velocity potential according to yeung 1981 the expressions of φ i 1 and φ e 1 can be written as follows 15a φ i 1 r θ z ϕ i 1 r z cos θ 15b φ e 1 r θ z ϕ e 1 r z cos θ where 16a ϕ i 1 r z j 0 b j v 1 j γ j r y j γ j z 16b ϕ e 1 r z j 0 a j r 1 j κ j r z j κ j z in eq 16 a j and b j are unknown coefficients the eigenvalues γ j are defined as γ 0 1 and γ j jπ s for j 1 κ j is the jth real root of ω 2 g κ j tan κ j d and the radial eigenfunctions v 1 j γ j r and r 1 j γ j r can be determined according to the following equation with m 1 17a v m j γ j r r a m j 0 i m γ j r i m γ j a j 0 17b r m j k j r h m k 0 r j 0 k m k l r j 0 in eq 17 h m x is the hankel function of the first kind of order m and i m x and k m x are the modified hankel functions of the first and second kinds of order m respectively the eigenfunctions y j γ j z and z j k j z are orthonormal functions given at the interval d t and d 0 respectively and are defined as follows 18a y j γ j z 2 2 j 0 cos γ j z d j 0 18b z j k j z cosh k 0 z d cosh k 0 d j 0 cos k j z d cos k j d j 0 the velocity potential given in eqs 15 and 16 describes the flow in the respective region the unknown coefficients in these expressions can be determined by imposing the matching condition at r a see eq 14 the infinite series of orthogonal functions in eq 16 is truncated to finite terms and two sets of linear equations can then be established after solving the linear algebraic system the valid velocity potential in each subdomain can be obtained 4 calculation of the second order wave radiation force the wave forces acting on a body can be evaluated through an integration of the fluid pressure over the body surface the fluid pressure can be obtained from bernoulli s equation because the amplitude of the body motion is small the fluid pressure on the instantaneous body surface can be approximated using a taylor expansion about the mean body surface by employing the perturbation procedure the wave force can be expanded into a perturbation series in terms of ε 19 f f 0 ε f 1 ε 2 f 2 o ε 3 following the discussion in previous studies such as by huang and eatock taylor 1996 and bai and teng 2013 the second order wave force can be decomposed into a time oscillatory and a mean component respectively in addition the time oscillatory component can be further split into two distinct parts we can then have 20 ε 2 f 2 re f 2 e 2 i ω t f m 2 and 21 f 2 f p 2 f q 2 in eq 20 f 2 is the amplitude of the time oscillatory component and f m 2 is a time independent component and is normally called the mean drift wave force in eq 21 f 2 is expressed as a summation of f p 2 and f q 2 which are derived owing to the second order velocity potential and the quadratic products of the first order quantities respectively similar to f q 2 f m 2 is also derived from the quadratic products of the first order quantities because the calculation of f m 2 is similar to that of f q 2 it is not shown in this study when a vertical cylinder moves harmonically along the x direction the second order wave force along the z direction can be induced then the contribution directly from the second order velocity potential to the double frequency wave force on the surging cylinder can be expressed as follows 22 f p z 2 2 i ω ρ s b φ 2 n z d s in which n z is the z direction component of the normal vector in addition following ogilvie 1983 the contribution from the quadratic products of the first order quantities to the double frequency wave force on a surging cylinder can be expressed as follows 23 f q z 2 1 4 ρ s b φ 1 φ 1 n z d s 1 2 i ω ρ ξ s b φ 1 x n z d s 1 4 ρ g γ w η 1 η 1 n z d l in which γ w is the mean waterline and η 1 is the first order wave run up amplitude along the waterline 4 1 calculation of f p z 2 as for the calculation of f p z 2 the integral in eq 22 can be evaluated by using the method suggested by molin 1979 and lighthill 1979 we then specify a linear radiation problem such that 24 ϕ ˆ n n z 0 r a t z 0 1 0 r a z t and 25 ϕ ˆ z 4 ω 2 g ϕ ˆ on z 0 moreover ϕ ˆ satisfies a no flow condition on the seabed and sommerfeld radiation condition in the far field here ϕ ˆ which is governed by laplace s equation is then used as the assisting function hereinafter ϕ ˆ i and ϕ ˆ e represent the assisting functions in the inner and outer subdomains respectively in the inner subdomain ω i ϕ ˆ i can be written as follows 26 ϕ ˆ i j 0 b ˆ j v 0 j γ j r y j γ j z ϕ ˆ p where b ˆ j is an unknown coefficient the radial and vertical functions v 0 j γ j r and y j γ j z can be determined according to eqs 17a and 18a respectively and ϕ ˆ p is the particular solution expressed as 27 ϕ ˆ p 1 2 s z d 2 r 2 2 in the outer subdomain ω e ϕ ˆ e can be written as follows 28 φ ˆ e j 0 a ˆ j r 0 j κ j r z j κ j z where a ˆ j is an unknown coefficient and κ l l 1 is the lth positive real root of 4 ω 2 g κ l tan κ l d in eq 28 the radial and vertical functions r 0 j κ j r and z j κ j z can be determined according to eqs 17b and 18b respectively with k j being replaced by κ j following the method described in section 3 the unknown coefficients a ˆ j and b ˆ j can be obtained by applying the matching technique then by substituting eq 24 into eq 22 we obtain 29 f p z 2 2 i ω ρ s b φ 2 ϕ ˆ n d s green s second identity is then used on the surfaces enclosing the entire fluid domain 30 s b s d s f s φ 2 ϕ ˆ n ϕ ˆ φ 2 n d s 0 in which s is a circular cylinder enclosing the cylinder and the radius of s tends towards infinity this leads to the following 31 f p z 2 f b z 2 f f z 2 f z 2 in which 32a f b z 2 2 i ω ρ s b ϕ ˆ φ 2 n d s 32b f f z 2 2 i ω ρ s f φ 2 ϕ ˆ n ϕ ˆ φ 2 n d s 32c f z 2 2 i ω ρ s φ 2 ϕ ˆ n ϕ ˆ φ 2 n d s at a large radius a far field asymptotic expression of the assisting function ϕ ˆ can be derived using the asymptotic expressions for bessel functions large arguments the following is then obtained 33 ϕ ˆ a ˆ j 2 π κ 0 r e i κ 0 r π 4 cosh κ 0 z d cosh κ 0 d o r 3 2 based on the asymptotic behaviour of φ 2 and ϕ ˆ in the far field see eqs 10 12 13 and 33 it is found that the integral over s vanishes in the far field and does not contribute to f p z 2 a calculation is then carried out for the integral on the body surface s b substituting eq 7a into the right hand side of eq 32a yields the following 34 f b z 2 2 i ω ρ s b b 2 r θ z φ ˆ d s as shown in eq 8 b 2 r θ z contains the second order derivative of the velocity potential in the potential flow theory the fluid velocity can be expressed as the derivative of the velocity potential it is known that the fluid velocity is singular at a sharp corner it is even much more difficult to achieve a convergent evaluation of the second order derivative of the velocity potential at the corner which brings about difficulty in dealing with the integral to overcome this difficulty the following identity is used 35 s b ϕ ˆ x φ 1 n φ 1 ϕ ˆ n x ϕ ˆ x φ 1 n d s γ w ϕ ˆ φ 1 z t y d l eq 35 is derived based on the application of stokes s theorem the detailed derivation of eq 35 is presented in appendix a see eq a3 with j 1 after applying eq 35 eq 34 can be further expressed as follows 36 f b z 2 i ω ρ ξ i ω ξ s b ϕ ˆ x n x d s s b n x φ 1 ϕ ˆ d s γ w ϕ ˆ φ 1 z t y d l in eq 36 the second order derivative of the velocity potential no longer exists however eq 36 still contains the quadratic products of the fluid velocity i e the second part on the right hand side of eq 36 as discussed by chen 2007 and lee 2007 when the body has sharp corners the quadratic products of the fluid velocity near the corner is singular although this is integrable it is difficult to obtain accurate computational results through a direct integral therefore the following identity which is derived using gauss s theorem is applied to recast eq 36 37 s b s c s d s f φ 1 ϕ ˆ n d s s b s c s d s f φ 1 n ϕ ˆ ϕ ˆ n φ 1 d s the detailed derivation of eq 37 is presented in appendix a see eq a10 in eq 37 s b s c s d and s f are the boundaries of a control volume ω c in which s c r r c d z 0 represents a fictitious control surface surrounding the cylinder s d and s f are the seabed and the mean plane of the free surface in ω c the definitions of the control volume ω c and the control surface s c are given in fig 2 then the combination of eq 36 and eq 37 gives the following 38 f b z 2 i ω ρ ξ s b φ 1 x n z d s s c s f φ 1 x ϕ ˆ n ϕ ˆ x φ 1 n d s s c φ 1 ϕ ˆ n x d s γ w ϕ ˆ φ 1 z t y d l then after integrating in θ and using the orthogonality eq 38 can be further expressed as follows 39 f b z 2 i ω ρ ξ π r c d 0 ϕ e 1 r 1 r c ϕ e 1 ϕ ˆ e r ϕ 1 z ϕ ˆ e z r r c d z ω 2 g ϕ e 1 ϕ ˆ e 1 r z 0 r a ω 2 g a r c 4 ϕ e 1 r 1 r ϕ e 1 ϕ ˆ e ϕ e 1 ϕ ˆ e r z 0 r d r ϕ i 1 r z t r a it should be noted that the singular terms owing to the singularity of the fluid velocity at a corner no longer exists in eq 39 a calculation is then conducted for the integral over the free surface s f substituting eq 7b into the right hand side of eq 32b yields the following 40 f f z 2 2 i ω ρ g s f q 2 r θ ϕ d s here q 2 r θ behaves in an oscillatory manner over the entire free surface and decays in order of 1 r with an increase in the distance from the body following cong et al 2012 2018 the entire free surface is divided into the near field and far field regions and different numerical algorithms are used in each region it should be noted that a second order derivative term is involved in q 2 r θ by using the green s theorem the integral can be replaced by a new integral without the second order derivative then through an integration in the circumferential direction the free surface integral can be reduced to a series of radial integrals in addition the line integral over the far field can be simplified by neglecting the contributions owing to the evanescent modes the resulting expression for f f z 2 can be written as follows 41 f f z 2 ω 2 ρ π g i f 1 i f 2 ϕ e 1 r ϕ e 1 ϕ ˆ e r r a z 0 in which 42a i f 1 a r f ϕ e 1 r ϕ e 1 r ϕ ˆ e 1 r 2 3 ω 4 g 2 ϕ e 1 ϕ e 1 ϕ ˆ e ϕ e 1 r ϕ e 1 ϕ ˆ e r z 0 r d r 42b i f 2 a 0 a 0 a ˆ 0 h 1 k 0 r r h 1 k 0 r h 0 κ 0

respectively and r f is the radius of the circular boundary dividing the near and far field regions in the numerical implementation an adaptive integration technique is used to determine r f by using the asymptotic expansions of hankel s functions the integrand of the line integral in eq 42b can be represented through a summation of the polynomials of various orders and the integral can then be explicitly evaluated 4 2 calculation of f q z 2 from eq 23 it appears that f q z 2 depends only on the first order wave field in eq 23 the integral over the waterline γ w the third term on the right hand side of eq 23 makes no contribution to f q z 2 owing to the vertical side wall of the cylinder for a moving body the nonlinearity in the wave pressure is expected to be strong within the close vicinity of the body and it becomes difficult to obtain an accurate integral of the quadratic pressure over the body surface with sharp corners to overcome this difficulty the following identity is then used to recast the formulation containing the following quadratic pressure integration 43 s b s c s f s d φ 1 φ 1 n d s 2 s b s c s f s d φ 1 n φ 1 d s eq 43 is a special case of eq a10 with ϕ ˆ φ 1 the combination of eq 23 and eq 43 leads to the following 44 f q z 2 1 4 ρ s f s d φ 1 φ 1 n z d s 2 s c s f φ 1 n φ 1 z d s 2 i ω ξ s b φ 1 z n x φ 1 x n z d s in which n x is the x direction component of the normal vector the surface integrals in eq 44 can be simplified to line integrals by integrating in θ and using the orthogonality eq 44 can then be rewritten as follows 45 f q z 2 1 4 ρ π a r c ϕ e 1 r ϕ e 1 r 1 r 2 ϕ e 1 ϕ e 1 ω 4 g 2 ϕ e 1 ϕ e 1 z 0 r d r 2 d 0 ϕ e 1 r ϕ e 1 z r r c r c d z a r c ϕ e 1 r ϕ e 1 r 1 r 2 ϕ e 1 ϕ e 1 z d r d r 0 a ϕ i 1 r ϕ i 1 r 1 r 2 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 z d r d r 2 i ω ξ r ϕ e 1 z 0 r a r ϕ e 1 z t r a r ϕ i 1 z t r a as the obvious advantage of eq 45 the calculation of the singular terms at the sharp corner is no longer required after evaluating f b z 2 f f z 2 and f q z 2 the complete double frequency wave radiation force can be determined based on their summation that is 46 f z 2 f b z 2 f f z 2 f q z 2 in the numerical implementation a romberg quadrature is used to control the accuracy of the line integrals in eqs 39 42a and 45 based on the above solution procedure a novel solution to the second order wave radiation force on an oscillating truncated cylinder is derived in the previous sections the solution was presented for the case of a surging cylinder the extension of the solution to the case of a heaving cylinder is also given in this study please refer to appendix b for more details 5 numerical results and discussion the accuracy of the semi analytical model outlined above is described in this section first the dependency of the results on the number of eigenmodes is examined making sure that the present results are reliable in the numerical algorithm the number of eigenmodes in the inner and outer subdomains i e ω i and ω e are the same and are equal to n from mode 0 to mode n 1 the factor ρ g a ξ 2 has been used to nondimensionalise the wave force hereinafter the denotations f z f p z f q z f b z and f f z are used to represent the dimensionless double frequency wave radiation force and the force components respectively in the convergence test a truncated cylinder of radius a and draft t a is taken as an example in addition the water depth d is equal to 3a the variation of f b z f f z f q z and f z with respect to n is shown in fig 3 for k 0 a 1 0 and 3 0 respectively in fig 3 im represents the imaginary part of a complex quantity fig 3 reveals a good convergence of the present solution both the real and imaginary parts fig 3 shows that n 200 is sufficient to eliminate the dependence of the convergence on n to ensure that all results shown in the following study are free from the influence of n n 200 is adopted in the subsequent parametric study yeung 1981 examined the convergence of the added mass and radiation damping with respect to the number of eigenmodes for a truncated cylinder the added mass and radiation damping are normally defined as the parts of the linear wave radiation force that are in phase with the acceleration and velocity of the moving body respectively in the linear problem the velocity potential satisfies the homogeneous boundary conditions and the calculation of the wave force can be achieved through an integration of the linear pressure term however when analysing the second order problem various terms of significant nonlinearities will be encountered such as the body surface and free surface forcing terms as well as the quadratic pressure term therefore to ensure a convergent result a larger number of eigenmodes has to be used for the second order wave radiation force than that for the added mass and radiation damping another check that needs to be carried out is the dependence of the calculation of f q z and f b z on the size of the control surface the effect of the control surface on the calculation is examined in fig 4 in which δr r c a is varied as δr a 2a and 5a respectively note that δr 2a has been adopted in the convergence test in fig 3 from fig 4 it is found that different choices of the control surface give the same converged results in addition δr 2a is then used in all subsequent computations the validity of the proposed model is then examined by comparing the present results with other published results based on the mesh based methods isaacson and ng 1993 teng 1995 shao 2010 and bai and teng 2013 isaacson and ng 1993 solved the wave radiation problem based on the discretisation of constant panels however more advanced numerical models considering the higher order mesh based methods were used by teng 1995 shao 2010 and bai and teng 2013 who used the frequency domain higher order boundary element method cubic higher order boundary element method and b spline function expansion based boundary element method respectively to calculate the wave radiation force on a moving cylinder the comparison between the present results and the above mentioned numerical results is shown in fig 5 in the comparison a truncated cylinder of radius a and draft t 0 5a is considered in addition the water depth d is equal to 1 5a a significant deviation in the solution by isaacson and ng 1993 is observed as expected owning to the application of constant panels the variation in the physical quantities over the body surface is not captured well in the method using constant panel particularly for the solution up to the second order meanwhile good agreements between the solutions of the present model and other existing numerical results which are based on a higher order method and refined discretisation are obtained providing confidence in the use of the proposed model after demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model a parametric study is then conducted the effect of the cylinder draft on the double frequency wave radiation force and its constituent components on a surging cylinder is shown in fig 6 in which the cylinder draft is varied as t 0 5a 0 75a a 1 25a and 1 5a whereas the water depth is fixed at d 3a the effect of the cylinder draft on the force component f q z is shown in fig 6 a in fig 6 a the wave forces continue to increase as k 0 a increases until reaching a local peak and then decrease mildly with an increase in k 0 a until reaching a local trough next an increasing trend is observed again it is also found that the frequencies of the local peak and trough move gradually to the low frequency region as the cylinder draft increases the effect of the cylinder draft on the force components f b z and f f z is shown in fig 6 b and c respectively in fig 6 b the wave forces are initially similar to each other and then increase monotonously as k 0 a increases beyond a certain point namely the turning point each wave force in fig 6 b can still achieve an increasing trend but at a much milder rate which decreases as the cylinder draft decreases the general trend of the wave forces in fig 6 c is similar to that in fig 6 b when reaching beyond an obvious turning point the wave forces in fig 6 c with d 0 75a a 1 25a and 1 5a increase in a nearly linear manner with an increase in k 0 a however for d 0 5a the variation in the force is relatively smaller initially and then begins to increase with an increase in k 0 a the effect of cylinder draft on the total double frequency wave radiation force is shown in fig 6 d in the low frequency region the wave forces generally increase as the cylinder draft increases at a certain wave frequency however in the high frequency region a reversed but more pronounced trend can be found and an increase in the cylinder draft can lead to an apparent decrease in the wave force the phase angle of the wave force is shown in fig 7 for t 0 5a and a respectively it is found that the total wave force is dominated by the contribution from the body surface forcing term i e f b z and the phase angle of f b z is close to that of f z it is also found that the f q z is nearly out of phase with f b z over the entire frequency region in fig 8 we consider the effect of the water depth on the double frequency wave radiation force and its constituent components in the calculation the water depth is varied as d 2a 2 5a 3a 3 5a and 4a whereas the cylinder draft is fixed at t a in fig 8 the wave forces corresponding to different water depths follow the same trend the effect of the water depth is not obvious within the low frequency region however in the high frequency region an increase in the water depth can lead to an obvious decrease in the magnitude of the total double frequency wave radiation force and each force component 6 concluding remarks the wave radiation from an oscillating truncated cylinder was concerted in this study the main purpose of this study was to derive a reliable solution to the wave radiation force on the oscillating cylinder up to the second order the nonlinear hydrodynamic properties related to the oscillating cylinder were also investigated the main conclusions of this study are summarised as follows 1 in this study the technique of control surfaces was adopted to overcome the difficulty associated with the singularity of the fluid velocity at the corner and a novel solution to the double frequency wave radiation force on an oscillating cylinder was developed the proposed solution achieves the obvious advantage in that a calculation of the singular terms arising at the sharp corner is avoided 2 efficient numerical techniques were developed for the accurate evaluation of each force component of the total double frequency wave radiation force convergence of the present solution with respect to the number of eigenmodes and the size of the control surface was examined in detail good convergence characteristics were demonstrated a comparison of the present outcome with the published results based on higher order mesh based methods were conducted and good agreements were achieved 3 contributions to the double frequency wave radiation force from its various force components were identified the component associated with the body surface forcing term predominates among the various force components the force component from the quadratic products of the first order quantities is in general out of phase with the one associated with the body surface forcing term an extension of the present model to an analysis of the wave force on moving bodies exposed to incident waves will be straightforward it is expected that the present method can eventually be extended to studies on the combined second order wave diffraction and radiation problem thereby providing a novel approach for estimating the second order motion response credit authorship contribution statement peiwen cong conceptualization investigation methodology resources validation

translation along the z axis with a small amplitude ξ and radian frequency ω this motion mode is conventionally defined as a heave except those on the body surface the boundary conditions satisfied by φ 1 and φ 2 on the free surface sea bed and far field in the case of a heaving cylinder are the similar to those for a surging cylinder on the body surface the boundary conditions are updated as follows a11 φ 1 n i ω ξ n z on s b and a12 φ 2 n 1 2 ξ 2 φ 1 z n on s b the eigenfunction expansion matching method is then used to solve the first order velocity potential in the inner and outer subdomains i e φ i 1 and φ e 1 for the second order time oscillatory wave force along the vertical direction i e f z 2 this can be expressed as a summation of f p z 2 and f q z 2 which are due to the second order velocity potential and the quadratic products of the first order quantities respectively after introducing the assisting function ϕ ˆ f p z 2 is contributed by the integrals over the free surface and the body surface the evaluation of the free surface integral in the case of a heaving cylinder is similar to that for a surging cylinder therefore it will not be discussed again herein the body surface integral in the case of a heaving cylinder can be expressed as follows a13 f b z 2 2 i ω ρ s b 1 2 ξ 2 φ 1 z n ϕ ˆ d s by applying the stokes s theorem and using the control surface eq

21917,spudcan foundations have been widely used in offshore oil and gas engineering for jack up rigs during penetration into seabed soil spudcan foundations may encounter large uncertainties in soil properties which have a strong impact on its bearing capacity a large number of studies have been conducted to demonstrate the failure mechanisms and the bearing capacity of spudcan foundations in soils with deterministic properties but the influence of spatially variable soil properties on spudcan foundations remains unclear and should be accounted for in this study we aimed to investigate the failure mechanisms and the bearing capacity of a spudcan foundation embedded in soils where the mean undrained shear strength increased linearly with depth the spectral representation method srm was used to generate a non stationary non gaussian random field the random finite element method rfem in conjunction with monte carlo simulations was carried out to evaluate the statistical characteristics of the bearing capacity for spudcan foundations followed by a series of comparisons and discussion the results indicated that the mean bearing capacity for the spatial variability of undrained shear strength was smaller than that obtained from the corresponding deterministic case the probability of failure decreased slightly with an increase in the degree of non stationarity under the constant coefficient of variation cov condition upon comparing the results obtained from different random field models we found that the probability of failure under the non constant condition was smaller than that under the stationary and constant cov conditions keywords bearing capacity undrained shear strength spatial variability non stationarity random finite element method rfem spudcan foundation 1 introduction because of the limited reserves of terrestrial oil and gas resources the marine reserves are abundant further the proven and mined quantity only accounts for a very small part of the total savings with countries that compete for marine resources the various offshore engineering construction needs are increasing randolph et al 2011 since the development of the world s first jack up platform supported by spudcan foundations in 1951 young et al 1984 the jack up platform has been rapidly and widely applied in offshore geotechnical engineering because of its flexibility and adaptability to various seabed soil conditions as well as different water depths at present jack up platforms make up more than two thirds of the number of active platforms commonly used around the world a typical jack up platform consists of a buoyant hull fitted with a number of movable legs capable of raising its hull over the surface of the sea the legs are attached with spudcan foundations which can penetrate the seabed by three times the diameter maximally to obtain a sufficient bearing capacity once installed jack up platforms are subjected to various periodic loads such as storms waves and currents all of the loads on the jack up platforms are transferred from spudcan foundations to the seabed soil however various complex soil conditions have a considerable impact on the foundation stability accompanied by the uncertainty of the foundation bearing capacity over the past few years researchers have paid increasingly more attention to the potential impacts of spatial variability in soil properties covering a wide range of geotechnical problems such as the stability of slopes griffiths et al 2009 jiang et al 2014 2015 li et al 2014

al 2015a 2015b wu et al 2019b in particular in the domain of offshore structure stability for example charlton and rouainia 2016 used the kernel density estimation with a non parametric method for the probability characterisation of the holding capacity for suction caisson under various scales of fluctuation li et al 2017 investigated the influence of different coefficients of variation covs on the bearing capacity of a spudcan foundation coupled with the combined vertical horizontal and moment v h m loads these studies have clearly shown the importance of the spatial variability of soil properties for geotechnical designs however in most cases the stationary random field method has been adopted to analyse the effect where the spatial variability of soil is usually described by a constant trend and a random residual vanmarck 1977 however it is well recognised that soil parameters often coincide with non stationary characteristics in some deterministic analyses for spudcan foundations the non stationary characteristics of soil parameters are also considered for example hossain and randolph 2010 analysed the penetration response of spudcan foundations in stratified soil on the basis of a large deformation finite element zhang et al 2011 investigated the spudcan foundation failure mechanism and quantified the influence on its capacity under a general loading condition and gaudin et al 2011 reviewed the recent contributions of centrifuge modelling to understand the soil and foundation interactions and develop the design and predictive methods in the field of mobile jack up drilling rig foundations we will obtain an inaccurate estimation of the spatial variability of soil parameters if we neglect the non stationary characteristics of the soil parameters and the corresponding reliability analysis results will not truly reflect the bearing capacity of the foundations kulatilake and um 2003 unlike a site investigation on the earth a deep sea soil investigation is vulnerable to the quickly changing sea conditions climate or other environmental loading and requires special equipment as well as a relatively stable geological environment in contrast it is neither practical nor economical to acquire all the data of the soil properties around embedded foundations lumb 1966 studied the characteristics of the soil s inherent variability and summarised two representative non stationary types of soil properties a the mean value of the undrained shear strength has a linear increasing tendency while the standard deviation remains constant and b both the mean and the standard deviation of the undrained shear strength increase with an increase in the depth but the cov is maintained constant thus far no consistent conclusion has been reported concerning which non stationary mode the seabed soil parameters obey specifically therefore it is necessary to describe the non stationary models of the soil spatial variability to carry out the reliability analysis and compare the differences on the basis of the two typical soil characteristics the objective of this study was to reveal the failure mechanisms and the bearing capacity of a spudcan foundation embedded at a depth three times its diameter in a non stationary random soil where the undrained shear strength increased linearly the method srm was utilised to generate non stationary non gaussian random fields the random finite element method rfem in conjunction with the monte carlo simulations was carried out to evaluate the statistical characteristics of the reliability and the bearing capacity of spudcan foundations the results obtained under the non stationary conditions and the corresponding stationary conditions were compared the research provides an advanced understanding of the failure mechanisms of embedded foundations and can serve as a complement to offshore foundation design 2 computational framework rfem was utilised to conduct the probabilistic bearing capacity analysis of a spudcan foundation this scheme involves generating a series of realisations of a random field defined by certain features and subsequently passing these realisations to the commercial software to perform a series of conventional deterministic analyses then the statistical properties of the bearing capacity of a spudcan foundation can be determined in all the procedure mentioned above mainly consists of the following three parts 1 defining the characteristics of the random field 2 generating sample realisations of the desired non gaussian non stationary random field and 3 performing a series of fem analyses utilising the realisations of the soil properties 2 1 spatial variability of undrained shear strength the undrained shear strength s u is extensively used to determine the bearing capacity of spudcan foundations under undrained conditions and is considered an important factor affecting foundation design and reliability analysis its varying characteristic in space is mainly derived from the mean the standard deviation and the scale of fluctuation resulting from each special deposition process and formation history kim and santamarina 2008 the data obtained from numerous in situ and laboratory tests stewart and randolph 1994 white et al 2010 hossain et al 2005 lee et al 2013 cao and wang 2014 wang et al 2015 jiang et al 2018 including cone penetration tests and field vane shear tests show that the mean value of the undrained shear strength μ s u has a more or less linear growth tendency and thus can be expressed as follows 1 μ s u μ s u 0 k z where μ s u 0 is the soil undrained shear strength at mudline and k signifies the increasing gradient with the depth z below the mudline hossain and randolph 2009 2010 summarised that the typical undrained shear strength at mudline μ s u 0 is 2 10 kpa and the gradient k varies between 0 and 2 kpa m although at some specific sites μ s u 0 could be up to 40 200 kpa poulos 1988 the scale of fluctuation also called the spatial correlation length indicates the spatial scale of soil heterogeneity which may differ in both the horizontal and the vertical directions moreover the scale of fluctuation in the vertical direction has a more significant influence on the soil parameters than that in the horizontal direction charlton and rouainia 2016 the relatively limited amount of data is available in the literature because the local geological environment is likely to have a major influence on the scale of fluctuation parameters kasama and whittle 2011 phoon and kulhawy 2001 compiled the data and reported that the horizontal scale of the fluctuation range of submarine soil is generally between 46 m and 60 m and the vertical scale of fluctuation is in the range of 2 6 m the mean values in the horizontal and vertical directions are 50 7 m and 3 8 m respectively cov is a normalised measure that reflects the degree of s u dispersion it is affected not only by the degree of dispersion of the variable values but also by the average level of the variable values which is the ratio of the standard deviation sd to the mean value based on in situ cone penetration tests the cov of the undrained shear strength ranges usually from 10 to 50 lee et al 1983 for the condition where both the mean and the sd of s u increase linearly with depth five typical degrees of non stationarity i e k 0 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 kpa m have been investigated μ s u 0 is equal to 10 kpa with an sd of 3 kpa and cov is held constant at 30 in this study the spudcan foundation was embedded at a depth of 54 m if the same parameters were used for the condition where the sd of s u was maintained constant when the mean of s u increased with depth the cov at the spudcan foundation level became less than the suggested lower limit i e 10 which was insignificantly small in the geotechnical parameters in order to compare and take into account the range of parameters reported in the literature only one case was studied where k was set to be 0 5 kpa m and μ s u 0 was assumed to be 40 5 kpa with an sd of 20 25 kpa giving a cov decaying exponentially from 50 to 23 using these parameters we ensured that the two non stationary conditions had the same cov i e 30 at the spudcan foundation embedment depth which might be useful for the following comparison a squared exponential 2d autocorrelation function was adopted to define the correlation structure of s u for the non stationary and stationary cases in this study jiang et al 2014 2 ρ ξ h ξ v exp ξ h l h 2 ξ v l v 2 where ξ h and ξ v are the lag distance in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively and l h and l v which are the autocorrelation lengths in the horizontal and vertical directions are set to 50 7 m and 3 8 m li et al 2015b respectively for convenience the two non stationary types referred to a constant cov condition and a non constant cov condition in the following analysis 2 2 random field generation there are some available methods for simulating the random field of a soil property such as the local average subdivision las method fenton and vanmarcke 1990 the kl expansion e g phoon et al 2002 and the spectral representation method srm e g popescu et al 1998 wu et al 2017 wu and gao 2019 in this study the srm was applied based on certain previous studies i e wu et al 2017 and wu and gao 2019 the methods for simulating a constant cov and a non constant cov non stationary random field can be described as follows 1 simulating constant cov non stationary random field consider a 2d random field y x z whose mean value and standard deviation increase linearly with depth in the z direction but its cov remains constant here μ z and σ z are the target mean value and the standard deviation of the prescribed random field at the depth z the auto correlation function describing the relationship of the soil property at different positions is defined as ρ n g t ξ x ξ z whose corresponding power spectral density function psdf is denoted as s n g κ x κ z the general steps for simulating such a non stationary field can be described as follows step 1 normalise the non stationary random field to a standard stationary random field the non stationary random field y x z can be normalised as follows 3 y x z y x z μ z σ z where y x z is a stationary random field with a zero mean value and unit variance step 2 find an underlying gaussian power spectral density function because of the correlation distortion we need to find an underlying gaussian power spectral density function psdf whose corresponding non gaussian psdf is as close to the target psdf as possible the sample free iterative scheme can be utilised to finish this task the details of this iterative scheme are provided in wu et al 2017 step 3 generate the underlying standard gaussian random field once the underlying gaussian psdf is obtained the underlying standard gaussian random field g x z can be generated by using the following equation 4 g x z l 1 0 n 1 1 l 2 0 n 2 1 s g κ x l 1 κ z l 2 δ κ x δ κ z cos κ x l 1 x κ z l 2 z ϕ l 1 l 2 1 cos κ x l 1 x κ z l 2 z ϕ l 1 l 2 2 5 κ x l i l 1 i δ κ x l 1 i 0 1 n 1 1 6 κ z l i l 2 i δ κ z l 2 i 0 1 n 2 1 where δ κ x and δ κ z are the discretisation steps in the wave number domain along the horizontal direction and the vertical direction respectively ϕ l 1 l 2 1 and ϕ l 1 l 2 2 are two sets of n 1 n 2 independent random phase angles uniformly distributed over the interval 0 2 π and s g κ x κ z is the underlying gaussian psdf step 4 map to the standard non gaussian i e log normal distribution in this study random fieldwhen the underlying gaussian random field g x z is generated it can be mapped to the standard non gaussian random field y x z through the following nonlinear memory less translation 7 y x z f y 1 φ g x z where φ is the standard unit gaussian cumulative probability function cdf and f y is the marginal non gaussian cdf of y x z with the inverse function f y 1 step 5 translate the standard non gaussian random field to the desired one once the normalised non gaussian random field y x z is generated the desired non gaussian non stationary random field y x z can be obtained as follows 8 y x z y x z σ z μ z 2 simulating non constant cov non stationary random field consider a 2d random field y x z whose mean value increases linearly with the depth in the z direction but its standard deviation σ remains constant assume that μ z is the target mean value of the prescribed random field at depth z the general steps for simulating such a non stationary field can be simply given as follows step 1 separate the standard stationary random field from the non stationary random field the non stationary random field y x z can be separated as follows 9 y x z y x z k z where y x z is a stationary random field with the mean value μ s u o and the standard deviation σ then y x z can be normalised as follows 10 y x z y x z μ s u 0 σ where y x z is a stationary random field with a zero mean value and unit variance steps 2 4 described in the above section can be applied to simulate y x z finally the desired non gaussian non stationary random field y x z can be obtained as follows 11 y x z y x z σ μ s u 0 k z 2 3 finite element modelling consider that a circular spudcan foundation is embedded into a spatially varied soil following the previous study case of li et al 2015c we built a 2d plane strain model to assess the failure mechanisms and the bearing capacity the spudcan as shown in fig 1 was composed of a top cone a thin upstand and a bottom cone the angles of the top and the bottom slopes were 30 and 15 from the horizontal respectively the spudcan foundation diameter d was 18 m and the height t was 7 2 m the leg connected with the spudcan foundation was not modelled in this study because this study merely focused on the capacity of the spudcan the spudcan embedded at a depth of 3 d three times the spudcan diameter from the mudline was considered a wished in place foundation fig 2 ideally a 3d finite element model should be used to simulate a circular spudcan ideally a 3d finite element model should be used to simulate a circular spudcan however because of the computational load a simplified 2d plane strain was applied in this study to understand the problem each analysis was accomplished with the commercial software abaqus version 6 14 which is extensively used in geotechnical engineering the spudcan was modelled as a rigid body and the load and displacement were related to a single load reference point rp at the centre of the lowest cross section where the diameter was the maximum the interface between the soil and the spudcan in this simulation was entirely tied which was rational to represent the soil undrained behaviour a downward displacement constraint was applied to the reference point to evaluate the bearing capacity for the sake of simplicity the rotation of the foundation induced by spatially varying the soil properties was not considered the soil was set as an elastoplastic material and governed by the tresca yield criterion poission s rate was fixed as 0 49 to simulate no volume change under the undrained conditions as well as to ensure the stability of the numerical analysis while young s modulus and the undrained shear strength were considered the stochastic parameters modelled by a random field young s modulus could be considered to be perfectly correlated to the undrained shear strength with a ratio of e s u 500 this has been commonly used in numerical analysis e g taiebat and carter 2000 cassidy et al 2013 a soil area of size 6 33 d 5 33 d 114 m 96 m was chosen to eliminate the boundary effects the finite element mode is shown in fig 2 the domain was discretised into approximately 16340 four node bilinear plane strain quadrilateral cpe4r elements ching and phoon 2013 investigated the effect of element size in a random field finite element simulation and concluded that the element size must be in the range of 0 13 0 17 times the scale of fluctuation as the square exponential auto correlation model is adopted for the purpose of balancing the computational time and calculating the accuracy at the same time taking into account the influence of scale of fluctuation on the element size the element size was set as 1 m 1 m further discretion was realised in the zone of 3 d in length and 2 d in width adjacent to the spudcan foundation with the element size of 0 5 m 0 5 m cassidy et al 2013 li et al 2015c the advancing front method was used to obtain a mesh with uniform element size and achieve the transition from coarse mesh to fine mesh 3 results and discussion in this study 1000 simulations were run for each case conducive to extracting the key statistics reasonably fig 3 shows the distribution of s u in the finite element analysis the deep colours denote a soil with a low value of s u weak soil while the light colours represent a high value of s u strong soil in the deterministic case of k 1 kpa m presented in fig 3a s u increases linearly with depth which produces bands of equal strength soil fig 3b shows a typical realisation of s u for the constant cov condition when k 1 kpa m it was observed that the original stratification became scattered when the random field was involved note that rather than dealing with the actual bearing capacity this study focused on the dimensionless bearing capacity factor defined as follows 12 n c q f i μ s u z where q f i is the bearing capacity computed for the i th realisation in each case and μ s u z is the mean undrained shear strength at the embedment depth in order to verify the rationality of the random finite model a deterministic case was first modelled with a uniform s u i e 10 kpa the n c value obtained from the deterministic case was 11 81 which agreed well with the deterministic result i e 11 82 of li et al 2015c who investigated the effects of different scales of fluctuation for reliable spudcan foundations comparing the plane strain result with the 3d result of 13 20 provided by li et al 2017 we found that the plane strain result appeared to underestimate the normalised bearing capacity but the difference did not affect the main purpose of this study from a qualitative point of view 3 1 bearing capacity in order to demonstrate the relationship between the bearing capacity factor and the normalised displacement i e d d where d displacement and d diameter of a spudcan foundation the displacement load results of the first 200 monte carlo simulations for the two types of non stationary models when k 0 5 kpa m are shown in fig 4 the displacement load curves exhibited a large scatter when the non stationary random filed was involved as expected it was obvious that the bearing capacity strengthened with an increase in the applied displacement until plateauing at the failure value in this study the bearing capacities corresponding to a displacement with 0 07 d were chosen as the final bearing capacities fig 5 shows how the mean value of n c and sd vary with k the results of the deterministic cases are also illustrated the mean bearing capacities for the computed results from the monte carlo simulations were less than those of the deterministic cases which indicated that when the spatial variability of the soil properties was taken into consideration the bearing capacity of the foundation decreases further note that both the mean and the sd of n c decreased with an increase in the non stationary degree this was attributed to the increasing sd of s u with depth causing more weak paths for the mechanism to follow and it apparently overcame the increasing μ s u the computed stochastic results are also listed in table 1 3 2 failure mechanism analysis the failure planes of the deterministic cases are plotted in fig 6 in the uniform soil with an overall s u of 10 kpa when k 0 kpa m the circular shear plane was closed and exhibited a symmetrical characteristic fig 6a in the other deterministic cases i e k 0 5 1 1 5 2 kpa m the shapes of the failure plane were similar in the presence of an approximate symmetry v shape here k 2 kpa m is taken as an example fig 6b the linear increase in s u was the reason for the change in the failure plane from two closed circles to the v shape under the non stationary condition the failure planes did not resemble those in the deterministic cases which had an asymmetric distribution with a characteristic of multi paths the development of an approximately circular failure plane is illustrated in fig 7 for a typical realisation of the constant cov condition when k 0 5 kpa m at the initial stage several shear planes began to form gradually at both ends of the spudcan foundation fig 7a as the vertical displacement increased the applied load increased and the shear planes started to extend toward the upper and the lower soil layers accompanied with some shear planes away from the foundation fig 7b and c which entirely differed from the deterministic case in the meantime the upper and lower shear planes tended to converge to form a circle if the trend continued a complete failure plane was formed as depicted in fig 7c on the black dash line which could pass through a strong soil area the size of the finally formed failure plane in fig 7d was smaller than that of the hypothetical failure plane and it chose to traverse the weak zone instead of continuing to develop along the strong soil note that a shear plane beneath the foundation passes through the strong soil but ended in the weak soil until the failure of the foundation this seemed to imply that the soil with a high value of s u might obstruct the development of shear planes and the shear planes usually preferred to pass through the soil with a low value of s u the failure mechanism was consistent with that reported in the literature li et al 2015b because of the randomness of the soil parameters the failure plane of different realisations could dramatically differ from each other the typical failure planes for the constant cov condition at the gradient of 1 are plotted in fig 8 with the bearing capacity factors of 6 58 9 24 9 92 10 51 11 63 and 13 37 covering the entire range of the bearing capacity factors the bearing capacity factor increased as the failure plane gradually became larger and deeper with more soil mobilised and the shape of the failure plane transformed from circular to the v shape the failure plane shown in fig 8a was similar to that illustrated in fig 8b but there was a gap in the bearing capacity factors further observation revealed that several tiny shear planes were formed around the right side of the foundation fig 8b providing a larger bearing capacity in comparison with fig 9 a and b the length of the failure planes in fig 9c and d was larger bringing about larger bearing capacities the largest n c was observed when the shear planes developed to the upper and the lower soil layers with a larger area of the influence zone i e the area where the shear planes run across in general the typical failure mechanism could be summed up by three approximate intervals of n c under the constant cov condition a n c 6 5 9 the shapes of the failure planes presented two closed circles with intensive small shear planes at one side of the foundation b n c 9 11 5 a transitory stage in which the influence zone became large but the shape was similar to type a and c n c 11 5 13 4 the failure planes had the v shape with a larger area of the influence zone consequently the area of the influence zone and the length of the shear plane were the key factors to determine the bearing capacity of the foundation in a non stationary random field several typical realisations translated from the same seed random field are illustrated in fig 9 to investigate the influence of the different degrees of non stationarity on the failure plane the seed random field with a zero mean and standard deviation implied that the random fields involved in fig 9 exhibited the same random pattern but different random values which made the failure planes comparable in fig 9 the failure planes were basically similar a close inspection revealed that the length of the shear planes augmented at the right side of the foundation when the degree of non stationarity increased 3 3 probability and reliability analysis the probability density functions pdfs for all the involved cases are plotted in fig 10 we observed that all the pdfs were symmetrical moreover a chi square test proved that the bearing capacity factors obeyed the normal distribution and thus could appropriately represent the distribution characteristics of the bearing capacity factors note that under the constant cov condition the shape of the pdf became sharp with an increase in k fig 10 in fig 11 a comparison of pdfs for the two non stationary conditions when k 0 5 kpa m and the stationary condition is illustrated the highest peak was observed under the constant cov condition based on the theory of griffiths and fenton 2001 the failure of a foundation in random fields can be regarded as the foundation bearing capacity inferior to its corresponding deterministic result and can be defined as n c n c n c d e t 1 where n c is the bearing capacity ratio the probability of n c 1 can be easily acquired from the cumulative probability functions cdfs as illustrated in fig 12 the probabilities for the constant cov condition were 87 1 87 2 86 7 and 86 7 for k 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 kpa m respectively for the stationary and non constant cov conditions the probabilities were less than those for the constant cov condition namely 82 4 and 81 2 respectively for the sake of convenience sometimes a cov of s u at the foundation embedment depth is adopted to perform the analysis for a certain non stationary soil layer e g srivastava and sivakumar babu 2009 from the viewpoint of design the results implied that this simplification may yield a safer result for deep foundations if a non constant cov model is utilised however the probability of n c 1 is extremely large and its use as the probability of design failure to determine the criterion of foundation failure is difficult to accept in usual design practice in conventional design practice the ultimate bearing capacity is calculated using the average value of the undrained shear strength while the allowable load is obtained by introducing a global factor of safety f s the probability that the bearing capacity is less than a prescribed level of applied load can be assumed by taking the factor of safety into consideration for the bearing capacity factor of the foundation obeying a normal distribution the probability of failure can be calculated by using the following formula griffiths and fenton 2001 13 p n c n c det f s φ n c det f s μ n c s d n c where f is the cumulative normal distribution function μ n c and s d n c are the mean value and the standard deviation of the bearing capacity factor respectively and n c det is the bearing capacity factor computed for each deterministic condition fig 13 shows the probability of failure developed with k under the constant cov condition in general the probability of failure decreases slightly with an increase in k when f s is 1 2 the probabilities of failure were 29 3 28 2 27 6 and 27 3 for k 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 respectively when f s increased to 1 6 the corresponding probabilities of failure were reduced to 0 4 0 37 0 35 and 0 34 note that under a specified f s the probabilities of failure were always in the same order of magnitude with an increase in the non stationary degree fig 14 indicates how the value of f s affects the probability of failure under the stationary and non stationary conditions when k 0 5 kpa m in addition to the expected trend showing the probability of failure reducing with an increase in f s we observed from the figure that the probability of failure of the non constant condition was smaller than that of the stationary and constant cov conditions irrespective of the variation of f s the traditional foundation design requires the probability of failure to be controlled within the range of 10 2 10 3 baecher and christian 2003 hence a factor of safety of 1 6 could meet the design requirement for the stationary and non stationary conditions even though the analysis of the non constant cov condition might yield a safer result 4 conclusion in this study we attempted to investigate the effect of the spatially variable undrained shear strength which increased linearly with the depth for spudcan foundations the spectral representation method srm was used to generate non stationary non gaussian random fields which were further mapped to a random finite element model moreover 1000 monte carlo simulations were realised for each case to evaluate the statistics of the bearing capacity and the reliability of the spudcan foundations comparisons were made for the results obtained from two types of non stationary random fields the following conclusions were drawn from the study 1 with an increase in the non stationary degree both the mean and the standard deviation of the bearing capacity factors decreased 2 the bearing capacity depended closely on the length of the shear plane and the area of the influence zone in the non stationary random field in general the bearing capacity increased with an increase in the length of the shear plane and the area of the influence zone 3 the probability of failure reduced slightly with an increase in the degree of non stationarity under the constant cov condition by comparing among the stationary condition constant cov condition and the non constant cov condition we found that the non constant cov condition exhibited the smallest probability of failure declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

21917,spudcan foundations have been widely used in offshore oil and gas engineering for jack up rigs during penetration into seabed soil spudcan foundations may encounter large uncertainties in soil properties which have a strong impact on its bearing capacity a large number of studies have been conducted to demonstrate the failure mechanisms and the bearing capacity of spudcan foundations in soils with deterministic properties but the influence of spatially variable soil properties on spudcan foundations remains unclear and should be accounted for in this study we aimed to investigate the failure mechanisms and the bearing capacity of a spudcan foundation embedded in soils where the mean undrained shear strength increased linearly with depth the spectral representation method srm was used to generate a non stationary non gaussian random field the random finite element method rfem in conjunction with monte carlo simulations was carried out to evaluate the statistical characteristics of the bearing capacity for spudcan foundations followed by a series of comparisons and discussion the results indicated that the mean bearing capacity for the spatial variability of undrained shear strength was smaller than that obtained from the corresponding deterministic case the probability of failure decreased slightly with an increase in the degree of non stationarity under the constant coefficient of variation cov condition upon comparing the results obtained from different random field models we found that the probability of failure under the non constant condition was smaller than that under the stationary and constant cov conditions keywords bearing capacity undrained shear strength spatial variability non stationarity random finite element method rfem spudcan foundation 1 introduction because of the limited reserves of terrestrial oil and gas resources the marine reserves are abundant further the proven and mined quantity only accounts for a very small part of the total savings with countries that compete for marine resources the various offshore engineering construction needs are increasing randolph et al 2011 since the development of the world s first jack up platform supported by spudcan foundations in 1951 young et al 1984 the jack up platform has been rapidly and widely applied in offshore geotechnical engineering because of its flexibility and adaptability to various seabed soil conditions as well as different water depths at present jack up platforms make up more than two thirds of the number of active platforms commonly used around the world a typical jack up platform consists of a buoyant hull fitted with a number of movable legs capable of raising its hull over the surface of the sea the legs are attached with spudcan foundations which can penetrate the seabed by three times the diameter maximally to obtain a sufficient bearing capacity once installed jack up platforms are subjected to various periodic loads such as storms waves and currents all of the loads on the jack up platforms are transferred from spudcan foundations to the seabed soil however various complex soil conditions have a considerable impact on the foundation stability accompanied by the uncertainty of the foundation bearing capacity over the past few years researchers have paid increasingly more attention to the potential impacts of spatial variability in soil properties covering a wide range of geotechnical problems such as the stability of slopes griffiths et al 2009 jiang et al 2014 2015 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 2015 ji et al 2019 2020 settlements of foundations fenton and griffiths 2002 jimenez and sitar 2009 wu et al 2019a and bearing capacity of foundations griffiths and fenton 2001 li et al 2015a 2015b wu et al 2019b in particular in the domain of offshore structure stability for example charlton and rouainia 2016 used the kernel density estimation with a non parametric method for the probability characterisation of the holding capacity for suction caisson under various scales of fluctuation li et al 2017 investigated the influence of different coefficients of variation covs on the bearing capacity of a spudcan foundation coupled with the combined vertical horizontal and moment v h m loads these studies have clearly shown the importance of the spatial variability of soil properties for geotechnical designs however in most cases the stationary random field method has been adopted to analyse the effect where the spatial variability of soil is usually described by a constant trend and a random residual vanmarck 1977 however it is well recognised that soil parameters often coincide with non stationary characteristics in some deterministic analyses for spudcan foundations the non stationary characteristics of soil parameters are also considered for example hossain and randolph 2010 analysed the penetration response of spudcan foundations in stratified soil on the basis of a large deformation finite element zhang et al 2011 investigated the spudcan foundation failure mechanism and quantified the influence on its capacity under a general loading condition and gaudin et al 2011 reviewed the recent contributions of centrifuge modelling to understand the soil and foundation interactions and develop the design and predictive methods in the field of mobile jack up drilling rig foundations we will obtain an inaccurate estimation of the spatial variability of soil parameters if we neglect the non stationary characteristics of the soil parameters and the corresponding reliability analysis results will not truly reflect the bearing capacity of the foundations kulatilake and um 2003 unlike a site investigation on the earth a deep sea soil investigation is vulnerable to the quickly changing sea conditions climate or other environmental loading and requires special equipment as well as a relatively stable geological environment in contrast it is neither practical nor economical to acquire all the data of the soil properties around embedded foundations lumb 1966 studied the characteristics of the soil s inherent variability and summarised two representative non stationary types of soil properties a the mean value of the undrained shear strength has a linear increasing tendency while the standard deviation remains constant and b both the mean and the standard deviation of the undrained shear strength increase with an increase in the depth but the cov is maintained constant thus far no consistent conclusion has been reported concerning which non stationary mode the seabed soil parameters obey specifically therefore it is necessary to describe the non stationary models of the soil spatial variability to carry out the reliability analysis and compare the differences on the basis of the two typical soil characteristics the objective of this study was to reveal the failure mechanisms and the bearing capacity of a spudcan foundation embedded at a depth three times its diameter in a non stationary random soil where the undrained shear strength increased linearly the method srm was utilised to generate non stationary non gaussian random fields the random finite element method rfem in conjunction with the monte carlo simulations was carried out to evaluate the statistical characteristics of the reliability and the bearing capacity of spudcan foundations the results obtained under the non stationary conditions and the corresponding stationary conditions were compared the research provides an advanced understanding of the failure mechanisms of embedded foundations and can serve as a complement to offshore foundation design 2 computational framework rfem was utilised to conduct the probabilistic bearing capacity analysis of a spudcan foundation this scheme involves generating a series of realisations of a random field defined by certain features and subsequently passing these realisations to the commercial software to perform a series of conventional deterministic analyses then the statistical properties of the bearing capacity of a spudcan foundation can be determined in all the procedure mentioned above mainly consists of the following three parts 1 defining the characteristics of the random field 2 generating sample realisations of the desired non gaussian non stationary random field and 3 performing a series of fem analyses utilising the realisations of the soil properties 2 1 spatial variability of undrained shear strength the undrained shear strength s u is extensively used to determine the bearing capacity of spudcan foundations under undrained conditions and is considered an important factor affecting foundation design and reliability analysis its varying characteristic in space is mainly derived from the mean the standard deviation and the scale of fluctuation resulting from each special deposition process and formation history kim and santamarina 2008 the data obtained from numerous in situ and laboratory tests stewart and randolph 1994 white et al 2010 hossain et al 2005 lee et al 2013 cao and wang 2014 wang et al 2015 jiang et al 2018 including cone penetration tests and field vane shear tests show that the mean value of the undrained shear strength μ s u has a more or less linear growth tendency and thus can be expressed as follows 1 μ s u μ s u 0 k z where μ s u 0 is the soil undrained shear strength at mudline and k signifies the increasing gradient with the depth z below the mudline hossain and randolph 2009 2010 summarised that the typical undrained shear strength at mudline μ s u 0 is 2 10 kpa and the gradient k varies between 0 and 2 kpa m although at some specific sites μ s u 0 could be up to 40 200 kpa poulos 1988 the scale of fluctuation also called the spatial correlation length indicates the spatial scale of soil heterogeneity which may differ in both the horizontal and the vertical directions moreover the scale of fluctuation in the vertical direction has a more significant influence on the soil parameters than that in the horizontal direction charlton and rouainia 2016 the relatively limited amount of data is available in the literature because the local geological environment is likely to have a major influence on the scale of fluctuation parameters kasama and whittle 2011 phoon and kulhawy 2001 compiled the data and reported that the horizontal scale of the fluctuation range of submarine soil is generally between 46 m and 60 m and the vertical scale of fluctuation is in the range of 2 6 m the mean values in the horizontal and vertical directions are 50 7 m and 3 8 m respectively cov is a normalised measure that reflects the degree of s u dispersion it is affected not only by the degree of dispersion of the variable values but also by the average level of the variable values which is the ratio of the standard deviation sd to the mean value based on in situ cone penetration tests the cov of the undrained shear strength ranges usually from 10 to 50 lee et al 1983 for the condition where both the mean and the sd of s u increase linearly with depth five typical degrees of non stationarity i e k 0 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 kpa m have been investigated μ s u 0 is equal to 10 kpa with an sd of 3 kpa and cov is held constant at 30 in this study the spudcan foundation was embedded at a depth of 54 m if the same parameters were used for the condition where the sd of s u was maintained constant when the mean of s u increased with depth the cov at the spudcan foundation level became less than the suggested lower limit i e 10 which was insignificantly small in the geotechnical parameters in order to compare and take into account the range of parameters reported in the literature only one case was studied where k was set to be 0 5 kpa m and μ s u 0 was assumed to be 40 5 kpa with an sd of 20 25 kpa giving a cov decaying exponentially from 50 to 23 using these parameters we ensured that the two non stationary conditions had the same cov i e 30 at the spudcan foundation embedment depth which might be useful for the following comparison a squared exponential 2d autocorrelation function was adopted to define the correlation structure of s u for the non stationary and stationary cases in this study jiang et al 2014 2 ρ ξ h ξ v exp ξ h l h 2 ξ v l v 2 where ξ h and ξ v are the lag distance in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively and l h and l v which are the autocorrelation lengths in the horizontal and vertical directions are set to 50 7 m and 3 8 m li et al 2015b respectively for convenience the two non stationary types referred to a constant cov condition and a non constant cov condition in the following analysis 2 2 random field generation there are some available methods for simulating the random field of a soil property such as the local average subdivision las method fenton and vanmarcke 1990 the kl expansion e g phoon et al 2002 and the spectral representation method srm e g popescu et al 1998 wu et al 2017 wu and gao 2019 in this study the srm was applied based on certain previous studies i e wu et al 2017 and wu and gao 2019 the methods for simulating a constant cov and a non constant cov non stationary random field can be described as follows 1 simulating constant cov non stationary random field consider a 2d random field y x z whose mean value and standard deviation increase linearly with depth in the z direction but its cov remains constant here μ z and σ z are the target mean value and the standard deviation of the prescribed random field at the depth z the auto correlation function describing the relationship of the soil property at different positions is defined as ρ n g t ξ x ξ z whose corresponding power spectral density function psdf is denoted as s n g κ x κ z the general steps for simulating such a non stationary field can be described as follows step 1 normalise the non stationary random field to a standard stationary random field the non stationary random field y x z can be normalised as follows 3 y x z y x z μ z σ z where y x z is a stationary random field with a zero mean value and unit variance step 2 find an underlying gaussian power spectral density function because of the correlation distortion we need to find an underlying gaussian power spectral density function psdf whose corresponding non gaussian psdf is as close to the target psdf as possible the sample free iterative scheme can be utilised to finish this task the details of this iterative scheme are provided in wu et al 2017 step 3 generate the underlying standard gaussian random field once the underlying gaussian psdf is obtained the underlying standard gaussian random field g x z can be generated by using the following equation 4 g x z l 1 0 n 1 1 l 2 0 n 2 1 s g κ x l 1 κ z l 2 δ κ x δ κ z cos κ x l 1 x κ z l 2 z ϕ l 1 l 2 1 cos κ x l 1 x κ z l 2 z ϕ l 1 l 2 2 5 κ x l i l 1 i δ κ x l 1 i 0 1 n 1 1 6 κ z l i l 2 i δ κ z l 2 i 0 1 n 2 1 where δ κ x and δ κ z are the discretisation steps in the wave number domain along the horizontal direction and the vertical direction respectively ϕ l 1 l 2 1 and ϕ l 1 l 2 2 are two sets of n 1 n 2 independent random phase angles uniformly distributed over the interval 0 2 π and s g κ x κ z is the underlying gaussian psdf step 4 map to the standard non gaussian i e log normal distribution in this study random fieldwhen the underlying gaussian random field g x z is generated it can be mapped to the standard non gaussian random field y x z through the following nonlinear memory less translation 7 y x z f y 1 φ g x z where φ is the standard unit gaussian cumulative probability function cdf and f y is the marginal non gaussian cdf of y x z with the inverse function f y 1 step 5 translate the standard non gaussian random field to the desired one once the normalised non gaussian random field y x z is generated the desired non gaussian non stationary random field y x z can be obtained as follows 8 y x z y x z σ z μ z 2 simulating non constant cov non stationary random field consider a 2d random field y x z whose mean value increases linearly with the depth in the z direction but its standard deviation σ remains constant assume that μ z is the target mean value of the prescribed random field at depth z the general steps for simulating such a non stationary field can be simply given as follows step 1 separate the standard stationary random field from the non stationary random field the non stationary random field y x z can be separated as follows 9 y x z y x z k z where y x z is a stationary random field with the mean value μ s u o and the standard deviation σ then y x z can be normalised as follows 10 y x z y x z μ s u 0 σ where y x z is a stationary random field with a zero mean value and unit variance steps 2 4 described in the above section can be applied to simulate y x z finally the desired non gaussian non stationary random field y x z can be obtained as follows 11 y x z y x z σ μ s u 0 k z 2 3 finite element modelling consider that a circular spudcan foundation is embedded into a spatially varied soil following the previous study case of li et al 2015c we built a 2d plane strain model to assess the failure mechanisms and the bearing capacity the spudcan as shown in fig 1 was composed of a top cone a thin upstand and a bottom cone the angles of the top and the bottom slopes were 30 and 15 from the horizontal respectively the spudcan foundation diameter d was 18 m and the height t was 7 2 m the leg connected with the spudcan foundation was not modelled in this study because this study merely focused on the capacity of the spudcan the spudcan embedded at a depth of 3 d three times the spudcan diameter from the mudline was considered a wished in place foundation fig 2 ideally a 3d finite element model should be used to simulate a circular spudcan ideally a 3d finite element model should be used to simulate a circular spudcan however because of the computational load a simplified 2d plane strain was applied in this study to understand the problem each analysis was accomplished with the commercial software abaqus version 6 14 which is extensively used in geotechnical engineering the spudcan was modelled as a rigid body and the load and displacement were related to a single load reference point rp at the centre of the lowest cross section where the diameter was the maximum the interface between the soil and the spudcan in this simulation was entirely tied which was rational to represent the soil undrained behaviour a downward displacement constraint was applied to the reference point to evaluate the bearing capacity for the sake of simplicity the rotation of the foundation induced by spatially varying the soil properties was not considered the soil was set as an elastoplastic material and governed by the tresca yield criterion poission s rate was fixed as 0 49 to simulate no volume change under the undrained conditions as well as to ensure the stability of the numerical analysis while young s modulus and the undrained shear strength were considered the stochastic parameters modelled by a random field young s modulus could be considered to be perfectly correlated to the undrained shear strength with a ratio of e s u 500 this has been commonly used in numerical analysis e g taiebat and carter 2000 cassidy et al 2013 a soil area of size 6 33 d 5 33 d 114 m 96 m was chosen to eliminate the boundary effects the finite element mode is shown in fig 2 the domain was discretised into approximately 16340 four node bilinear plane strain quadrilateral cpe4r elements ching and phoon 2013 investigated the effect of element size in a random field finite element simulation and concluded that the element size must be in the range of 0 13 0 17 times the scale of fluctuation as the square exponential auto correlation model is adopted for the purpose of balancing the computational time and calculating the accuracy at the same time taking into account the influence of scale of fluctuation on the element size the element size was set as 1 m 1 m further discretion was realised in the zone of 3 d in length and 2 d in width adjacent to the spudcan foundation with the element size of 0 5 m 0 5 m cassidy et al 2013 li et al 2015c the advancing front method was used to obtain a mesh with uniform element size and achieve the transition from coarse mesh to fine mesh 3 results and discussion in this study 1000 simulations were run for each case conducive to extracting the key statistics reasonably fig 3 shows the distribution of s u in the finite element analysis the deep colours denote a soil with a low value of s u weak soil while the light colours represent a high value of s u strong soil in the deterministic case of k 1 kpa m presented in fig 3a s u increases linearly with depth which produces bands of equal strength soil fig 3b shows a typical realisation of s u for the constant cov condition when k 1 kpa m it was observed that the original stratification became scattered when the random field was involved note that rather than dealing with the actual bearing capacity this study focused on the dimensionless bearing capacity factor defined as follows 12 n c q f i μ s u z where q f i is the bearing capacity computed for the i th realisation in each case and μ s u z is the mean undrained shear strength at the embedment depth in order to verify the rationality of the random finite model a deterministic case was first modelled with a uniform s u i e 10 kpa the n c value obtained from the deterministic case was 11 81 which agreed well with the deterministic result i e 11 82 of li et al 2015c who investigated the effects of different scales of fluctuation for reliable spudcan foundations comparing the plane strain result with the 3d result of 13 20 provided by li et al 2017 we found that the plane strain result appeared to underestimate the normalised bearing capacity but the difference did not affect the main purpose of this study from a qualitative point of view 3 1 bearing capacity in order to demonstrate the relationship between the bearing capacity factor and the normalised displacement i e d d where d displacement and d diameter of a spudcan foundation the displacement load results of the first 200 monte carlo simulations for the two types of non stationary models when k 0 5 kpa m are shown in fig 4 the displacement load curves exhibited a large scatter when the non stationary random filed was involved as expected it was obvious that the bearing capacity strengthened with an increase in the applied displacement until plateauing at the failure value in this study the bearing capacities corresponding to a displacement with 0 07 d were chosen as the final bearing capacities fig 5 shows how the mean value of n c and sd vary with k the results of the deterministic cases are also illustrated the mean bearing capacities for the computed results from the monte carlo simulations were less than those of the deterministic cases which indicated that when the spatial variability of the soil properties was taken into consideration the bearing capacity of the foundation decreases further note that both the mean and the sd of n c decreased with an increase in the non stationary degree this was attributed to the increasing sd of s u with depth causing more weak paths for the mechanism to follow and it apparently overcame the increasing μ s u the computed stochastic results are also listed in table 1 3 2 failure mechanism analysis the failure planes of the deterministic cases are plotted in fig 6 in the uniform soil with an overall s u of 10 kpa when k 0 kpa m the circular shear plane was closed and exhibited a symmetrical characteristic fig 6a in the other deterministic cases i e k 0 5 1 1 5 2 kpa m the shapes of the failure plane were similar in the presence of an approximate symmetry v shape here k 2 kpa m is taken as an example fig 6b the linear increase in s u was the reason for the change in the failure plane from two closed circles to the v shape under the non stationary condition the failure planes did not resemble those in the deterministic cases which had an asymmetric distribution with a characteristic of multi paths the development of an approximately circular failure plane is illustrated in fig 7 for a typical realisation of the constant cov condition when k 0 5 kpa m at the initial stage several shear planes began to form gradually at both ends of the spudcan foundation fig 7a as the vertical displacement increased the applied load increased and the shear planes started to extend toward the upper and the lower soil layers accompanied with some shear planes away from the foundation fig 7b and c which entirely differed from the deterministic case in the meantime the upper and lower shear planes tended to converge to form a circle if the trend continued a complete failure plane was formed as depicted in fig 7c on the black dash line which could pass through a strong soil area the size of the finally formed failure plane in fig 7d was smaller than that of the hypothetical failure plane and it chose to traverse the weak zone instead of continuing to develop along the strong soil note that a shear plane beneath the foundation passes through the strong soil but ended in the weak soil until the failure of the foundation this seemed to imply that the soil with a high value of s u might obstruct the development of shear planes and the shear planes usually preferred to pass through the soil with a low value of s u the failure mechanism was consistent with that reported in the literature li et al 2015b because of the randomness of the soil parameters the failure plane of different realisations could dramatically differ from each other the typical failure planes for the constant cov condition at the gradient of 1 are plotted in fig 8 with the bearing capacity factors of 6 58 9 24 9 92 10 51 11 63 and 13 37 covering the entire range of the bearing capacity factors the bearing capacity factor increased as the failure plane gradually became larger and deeper with more soil mobilised and the shape of the failure plane transformed from circular to the v shape the failure plane shown in fig 8a was similar to that illustrated in fig 8b but there was a gap in the bearing capacity factors further observation revealed that several tiny shear planes were formed around the right side of the foundation fig 8b providing a larger bearing capacity in comparison with fig 9 a and b the length of the failure planes in fig 9c and d was larger bringing about larger bearing capacities the largest n c was observed when the shear planes developed to the upper and the lower soil layers with a larger area of the influence zone i e the area where the shear planes run across in general the typical failure mechanism could be summed up by three approximate intervals of n c under the constant cov condition a n c 6 5 9 the shapes of the failure planes presented two closed circles with intensive small shear planes at one side of the foundation b n c 9 11 5 a transitory stage in which the influence zone became large but the shape was similar to type a and c n c 11 5 13 4 the failure planes had the v shape with a larger area of the influence zone consequently the area of the influence zone and the length of the shear plane were the key factors to determine the bearing capacity of the foundation in a non stationary random field several typical realisations translated from the same seed random field are illustrated in fig 9 to investigate the influence of the different degrees of non stationarity on the failure plane the seed random field with a zero mean and standard deviation implied that the random fields involved in fig 9 exhibited the same random pattern but different random values which made the failure planes comparable in fig 9 the failure planes were basically similar a close inspection revealed that the length of the shear planes augmented at the right side of the foundation when the degree of non stationarity increased 3 3 probability and reliability analysis the probability density functions pdfs for all the involved cases are plotted in fig 10 we observed that all the pdfs were symmetrical moreover a chi square test proved that the bearing capacity factors obeyed the normal distribution and thus could appropriately represent the distribution characteristics of the bearing capacity factors note that under the constant cov condition the shape of the pdf became sharp with an increase in k fig 10 in fig 11 a comparison of pdfs for the two non stationary conditions when k 0 5 kpa m and the stationary condition is illustrated the highest peak was observed under the constant cov condition based on the theory of griffiths and fenton 2001 the failure of a foundation in random fields can be regarded as the foundation bearing capacity inferior to its corresponding deterministic result and can be defined as n c n c n c d e t 1 where n c is the bearing capacity ratio the probability of n c 1 can be easily acquired from the cumulative probability functions cdfs as illustrated in fig 12 the probabilities for the constant cov condition were 87 1 87 2 86 7 and 86 7 for k 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 kpa m respectively for the stationary and non constant cov conditions the probabilities were less than those for the constant cov condition namely 82 4 and 81 2 respectively for the sake of convenience sometimes a cov of s u at the foundation embedment depth is adopted to perform the analysis for a certain non stationary soil layer e g srivastava and sivakumar babu 2009 from the viewpoint of design the results implied that this simplification may yield a safer result for deep foundations if a non constant cov model is utilised however the probability of n c 1 is extremely large and its use as the probability of design failure to determine the criterion of foundation failure is difficult to accept in usual design practice in conventional design practice the ultimate bearing capacity is calculated using the average value of the undrained shear strength while the allowable load is obtained by introducing a global factor of safety f s the probability that the bearing capacity is less than a prescribed level of applied load can be assumed by taking the factor of safety into consideration for the bearing capacity factor of the foundation obeying a normal distribution the probability of failure can be calculated by using the following formula griffiths and fenton 2001 13 p n c n c det f s φ n c det f s μ n c s d n c where f is the cumulative normal distribution function μ n c and s d n c are the mean value and the standard deviation of the bearing capacity factor respectively and n c det is the bearing capacity factor computed for each deterministic condition fig 13 shows the probability of failure developed with k under the constant cov condition in general the probability of failure decreases slightly with an increase in k when f s is 1 2 the probabilities of failure were 29 3 28 2 27 6 and 27 3 for k 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 respectively when f s increased to 1 6 the corresponding probabilities of failure were reduced to 0 4 0 37 0 35 and 0 34 note that under a specified f s the probabilities of failure were always in the same order of magnitude with an increase in the non stationary degree fig 14 indicates how the value of f s affects the probability of failure under the stationary and non stationary conditions when k 0 5 kpa m in addition to the expected trend showing the probability of failure reducing with an increase in f s we observed from the figure that the probability of failure of the non constant condition was smaller than that of the stationary and constant cov conditions irrespective of the variation of f s the traditional foundation design requires the probability of failure to be controlled within the range of 10 2 10 3 baecher and christian 2003 hence a factor of safety of 1 6 could meet the design requirement for the stationary and non stationary conditions even though the analysis of the non constant cov condition might yield a safer result 4 conclusion in this study we attempted to investigate the effect of the spatially variable undrained shear strength which increased linearly with the depth for spudcan foundations the spectral representation method srm was used to generate non stationary non gaussian random fields which were further mapped to a random finite element model moreover 1000 monte carlo simulations were realised for each case to evaluate the statistics of the bearing capacity and the reliability of the spudcan foundations comparisons were made for the results obtained from two types of non stationary random fields the following conclusions were drawn from the study 1 with an increase in the non stationary degree both the mean and the standard deviation of the bearing capacity factors decreased 2 the bearing capacity depended closely on the length of the shear plane and the area of the influence zone in the non stationary random field in general the bearing capacity increased with an increase in the length of the shear plane and the area of the influence zone 3 the probability of failure reduced slightly with an increase in the degree of non stationarity under the constant cov condition by comparing among the stationary condition constant cov condition and the non constant cov condition we found that the non constant cov condition exhibited the smallest probability of failure declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

with the porous layer no noteworthy change is observed for the natural frequency and added mass compared to those of owc with orifice however damping of the system is quite altered while its change due to the variations in the permeability and under water opening height has similar characteristics keywords wave energy owc cfd physical experimental modelling ldm natural frequency added mass 1 introduction energy consumption increases with population growth and mankind is not likely to abandon his ongoing lifestyle as fossil based energy sources are depleting concerns about the climate change are also raising therefore transition from conventional energy sources to renewables is vitally important for the world s future for this purpose targets have been determined for percentage usage of renewable energy throughout the world but the goals seem to fail because renewable energy market in the world s total energy consumption does not grow fast enough renewables 2018 in spite of its high potential and energy density wave energy is almost a zero contributor to the renewable energy market various type of wave energy converters has been devised and patented so far and oscillating water column owc wave energy converter wec appear to be the most promising one thanks to its simplicity stability accessibility and environmental friendly features which paved the way to the prototype stage accordingly owc wave energy converter is also one of the most studied and simply a hollow chamber partly immersed into the water with two openings one is located underwater and the other is on top or upper back of the chamber the former enables the water column in the chamber interact with ocean waves while the latter has a much smaller area and is utilized to obtain high alternating air velocities driven via the water column motions then a turbine can be installed and its rotational motion can power a generator for electricity production wave energy conversion studies are mostly triggered by the oil crisis in 1970 s and now mostly motivated by increased public awareness for the climate change issues and dwindling conventional energy resources preliminary studies were theoretical and commenced with assuming the free surface of the water column as a weightless rigid piston evans 1978 and improved by letting the pressure distribution vary spatially over the water column surface evans 1982 falnes and mciver 1985 made use of oscillating bodies and inner pressure distributions to model a wave excited system evans and porter 1995 analytically investigated the hydrodynamic performance of a simple owc device for different front wall immersion depths preceding theoretical studies have provided valuable information and physical insights about the subject but the drawback is that they mostly use potential theory and thus neglect viscous effects in addition analytical treatment of the subject is only possible for very simple geometries by the increase of computational power computational fluid dynamics cfd softwares that solve fully navier stokes equations have been implemented to investigate the different aspects of the wave structure interactions and complicated water air coupling with power take off pto mechanism lopez et al 2014 evaluated the performance of the owc device via a validated reynolds averaged navier stokes volume of fluid model ransvof under various pto dampings for different orifice sizes they reported that the pto damping is the key parameter for efficiency and should appropriately be tuned for the wave climate of the installation region kamath et al 2015 used a two dimensional 2d numerical wave tank to investigate the effects of the wave steepness on the efficiency of an owc they found that relatively steeper incident waves reduce the device performance zhang et al 2012 investigated the hydrodynamic performance of an owc under different wave conditions and front wall geometries after validation of their results with previous experimental data they found that immersion depth of the front wall is a main parameter for device performance however orifice dimensions should also be chosen adequately so that the necessary pressure could form in the air chamber for sufficient energy extraction mahnamfar and altunkaynak 2017 developed experimental and numerical models and optimized two geometrically various owcs under different wave conditions the results of the numerical model were validated with experimental data and high accuracy was obtained they reported the importance of the percentage of the air volume in the chamber to increase the owc efficiency elhanafi et al 2017a b used a fully non linear cfd model to analyze the device performance under different wave parameters and turbine dampings they concluded that all tested parameters namely the wavelength wave height and turbine damping are significant in terms of efficiency they also emphasized the influence of the front wall geometry of the chamber on the energy extraction due to its contribution to energy dissipating vortex generation on the other hand experimental investigations have been an important tool for owc analysis observations and gathered data yield significant physical insights for energy extraction process in particular about the complicated two phase fluid wave structure interaction moreover experimental data is always important in terms of validation phase thiruvenkatasanny and neelamani 1997 experimentally studied wave energy caissons in an array and optimized the clearance between them along with the pto damping for the best performance possible morris thomas et al 2007 performed physical experiments to investigate the efficiency of an owc in terms of front wall immersion depth thickness and aperture design of the studied parameters immersion depth is found the most influential on the device performance and the efficiency curve lopez et al 2015 experimentally investigated the effects of turbine induced damping and water depth variations on the performance of a fixed owc they highlighted the great influence of pto damping on the device efficiency çelik and altunkaynak 2018 performed physical experiments to optimize the chamber geometry of an owc for various wave conditions by using the experimental data they developed mathematical models to predict water column fluctuations for various underwater openings and incident wave characteristics estimation of hydrodynamic coefficients i e radiation damping added mass viscous damping and pto damping is important in as regards owc modelling for this purpose even though analytical solutions are obtainable for simple geometries one has to resort to numerical models for complex structures commercial codes that utilize boundary element method bem are often implemented for this purpose bems are based on potential and linear wave theories and thus the flow is assumed to be ideal and viscous effects are omitted falcao and henriques 2016 this necessitates applying more realistic cfd softwares to overcome the limitations water and air columns in the chamber are highly coupled in a complex manner and elaborate wave structure interactions further complicate the analysis of an owc system current computing technology cannot cope with this complexity and yield flawless results ning et al 2016 therefore experimental validation is always necessary besides according to falcao and henriques 2016 simulation of complicated phenomenon by numerical model is computationally expensive very time consuming and even forbidding for three dimensional 3d in the present study experimental free decay tests are performed to approximate the equivalent linear damping of a stationary owc via well known logarithmic decrement method ldm in effect ldm is a widely used technique for floating bodies in offshore and naval engineering chakrabarti and cotter 1992 liu et al 2014 handschel et al 2015 however its application is very limited for oscillating water columns recently in a 2d cfd simulation simonetti et al 2015 vyzikas et al 2017 and elhanafi et al 2017a b utilized the ldm to estimate the resonant frequency of a fixed owc nevertheless it was not the primary subject of their studies but rather performed in a supportive manner to the best of authors knowledge physical experimental free decay tests have not been implemented for owc systems before therefore a physical model has been constructed to perform free decay tests to investigate the applicability of ldm for fixed owcs and determine the linear equivalent damping natural frequency resonant frequency and added mass of the owc system if a representative damping coefficient and the added mass can be determined that takes account for all different types of dampings equation of motion of the water column can easily be solved as precedingly presented literature review indicates that the pto and front wall immersion depth optimization are significant in terms of feasible energy extraction in the present study physical experiments are performed for various pto dampings orifice sizes and underwater openings of chamber moreover commercial cfd software flow 3d is utilized for three dimensional 3d simulations to test the applicability of numerical model after validation of numerical model with experimental data for the same setup numerical free decay tests are also conducted where pto damping is simulated by a porous medium the objectives of this study are i to perform free decay tests for the first time to estimate the hydrodynamic parameters damping ratio resonant and natural frequencies and added mass of a fixed owc for various underwater openings of the chamber orifice sizes and porous medium permeability coefficients via physical experiments ii to investigate and quantify the relationships between the hydrodynamic parameters and opening heights orifice sizes and permeability coefficients iii to develop an empirical formula for natural frequency of a fixed owc iv to simulate 3d free decay tests with a cfds software and validate the numerical model results with experimental data and vi to provide free decay experimental data for the determination of hydrodynamic parameters of a fixed owc under different front wall openings and pto dampings the rest of this study is organized as

of the owc is shown in fig 3 where pressure sensors connected to the owc are non functional and placed for future researches owc chamber is immobilized to wave carriages with f type iron claps to keep the device stationary the owc structure is placed in the longitudinal central axis of the wave flume in head sea orientation water column surface displacements are sampled and recorded in 100 hz with resistance type twin wave probes for future analysis as time series drawbacks of the measurement with a single probe was cited previously in the literature ferguson et al 2015 accordingly in order to detect any possible sloshing motion that may occur in the chamber three wave probes are installed on the right center and left longitudinal central axis of the chamber roof measurements obtained from the wave probes are averaged during all model tests water level in the wave flume is maintained at 0 60 m overall experimental setup is depicted in fig 3 dimensionless forms of the opening height and orifice size are defined as 1 α y h 2 τ a o a w where α is the relative opening y is the underwater opening height of the chamber h is the still water depth τ is the orifice ratio a o is the cross sectional orifice area and a w is the water column surface area chosen values of the relative openings and orifice ratios for this study are given in table 1 free decay tests include imposing an initial displacement to the water column and releasing afterwards subsequently the response of the water column is investigated in the present study free decay tests are implemented as follows water column is raised to a desired level from its equilibrium position by depressurizing the air in the chamber via a vacuum pump and sealing the orifice afterwards the seal is removed and water column is released decaying oscillations are then measured and recorded for future analysis this procedure is repeated for all combinations of the opening heights and orifice ratios to transfer enough energy into the water column to obtain reasonable amount of oscillations before the system dies out two different initial displacements 0 10 m and 0 15 m are imposed on the system as intuitively expected very small and thus negligible differences are detected in the free decay time series similar results are also reported by simonetti et al 2015 therefore results obtained for the 0 10 m initial displacement will be presented free decay tests as described in the experimental set up section are also numerically carried out when the pto mechanism of the owc system is represented by a porous layer back plate of the owc chamber has been replaced with porous medium layer which acts as a filter providing approximately laminar air flow through the medium in this case non linear flow characteristics are mostly reduced and accordingly pressure drop can be approximated by a linear function of the air flow rate luo et al 2014 such a relationship may accurately be represented by darcy s equation for porous medium 3 δ p v μ l k where δ p is the pressure drop across the porous layer pa v is the average horizontal velocity thorough the porous layer m s μ is the dynamic viscosity kgm s l is the porous medium thickness m and k is the permeability of the porous medium m2 respectively different permeability values are obtained by varying the thickness of the porous layer permeability values derived from the numerically obtained pressure velocity plots are 3 21 10 8 and 5 07 10 8 respectively 2 2 logarithmic decrement method to meet the purposes of the present study a linear equivalent damping is considered in other words calculated overall damping ratio includes all types of dampings that oppose the motion of the water column in an equivalent linearized form e g viscous radiation and pto dampings mccormick 2009 logarithmic decrement method ldm can be used to determine the damping ratio of underdamped rigid body systems rao 2011 therefore in order to utilize the ldm for an owc water column has to sufficiently act in a rigid body manner that is all the water column should oscillate in unison to ensure that the relative motion between the fluid particles are zero during the experiments water column oscillated as a rigid body and no sloshing motions were generated therefore the water column motion can be considered as a single degree of freedom sdof system in the piston heave mode a gneric decaying response of an initially disturbed system is shown in fig 4 the damping ratio ζ is defined as the ratio of the damping coefficient of the system to the critical damping value rao 2011 logarithmic decrement is described as 4 δ ln y i y i 2 where y i a n d y i 2 are the two successive positive or negative peaks in the decaying time series once the logarithmic decrement is determined damping ratio can be obtained by the following expression 5 ζ δ 2 π 2 δ 2 damped natural period of the system td can be determined by measuring the time elapsed between the zero crossings of the oscillation subsequently damped and undamped natural frequency of the system may be obtained by the following relations respectively 6 w d 2 π t d 7 w n w d 1 ζ 2 finally determination of w n enables the calculation of the added mass as follows mccormick 2009 8 m a ρ g a w w n 2 m where m a is the added mass kg ρ is the density kg m3 g is the gravitaitonal constant m s2 and m is the mass of the water column kg 3 numerical model in this study the numerical model based on a rans formulation with k epsilon turbulence model together with vof surface capturing is used and it is a rather standard well known approach furthermore a widely used commercial code flow 3d has been used fig 5 shows the mesh of the owc structure used in the numerical model detailed information is readily accessible from various sources such as mahnamfar and altunkaynak 2017 and flow science inc 2012 it is to note that from 24 to 36 h of computation time was needed depending on the configuration of the owc to perform the numerical simulations however vyzikas et al 2017 reported few seconds of simulation time for the free decay tests this should be due to the 2d numerical model developed for the free decay simulations 4 validation of the numerical model results in the present study free decay tests are performed with developed experimental and 3d numerical models for determination of hydrodynamic parameters of a fixed owc remarkable agreement is found between numerical simulations and experimental measurements a comparison of typical experimentally and numerically obtained free decay time series is depicted in fig 6 oscillation amplitude of the water column is normalized by the still water depth the figure reveals that the numerical free decay time series tend to follow the experimental data very closely it is immediately realized that peak values frequency information and trend of the response are very well captured by the numerical model to quantitatively compare the experimental and numerical model results root mean square error r m s e and coefficient of efficiency ce are utilized as performance evaluation criteria the rmse is defined as 9 r m s e 1 n i 1 n e i n i 2 and the ce can be expressed as 10 c e 1 i 1 n e i n i 2 i 1 n e i e o 2 where n is the total number of observation data e i a n d n i represent the direct measurements e g damping ratio ζ and damped natural period t d obtained from experimental and simulated time series respectively and e o is the average of the relevant quantity extracted from experimental data calculated experimental and numerical damping ratios and damped natural frequencies for all different relative openings and orifice ratios are presented in table 2 rmse values of experimental and numerical models for damping ratio ζ and damped natural period t d are 0 016 and 0 052s respectively and corresponding values are 0 928 and 0 879 respectively accordingly it can safely be concluded that for all underwater opening and orifice diameters the numerical models can be utilized for free decay simulation of the owc 5 results and discussion to extract the wave energy in an efficient manner system s heave resonant frequency has to be tuned according to the prevailing incident wave frequency in this case the water column approximately oscillates as a rigid body with relatively higher amplitudes when the excitation frequency is in the vicinity of resonant frequency motion of the water column mostly depends on the system s total equivalent linear damping because restoring and inertial forces cancel each other for this reason according to chakrabarti and cotter 1992 determination of the system s overall damping is crucial for optimal design considerations fig 7 shows the damping ratios with respect to orifice ratios for different relative openings for a clear vision damping ratios for only some of the relative openings are depicted quadratic fittings are also included in the figure as it can be seen damping decreases with the increase of orifice ratio in a quadratic manner which adequately describes the relationship between the damping and orifice ratios note that as the relative opening increases quadratic relationship weakens conversely the relationship between the damping and the orifice ratios and porous medium with different permeability values is shown in fig 8 clearly relative opening has also a significant effect on the overall damping of the system it is readily observed that the damping ratio decays as the relative opening increases with an almost linear fashion for all orifice ratios and permeability values as inserted linear regression lines show water column within the chamber communicates with the exterior water mass through the underwater opening of the chamber if the opening is relatively larger alternating water mass between the chamber and the outside region moves more easily hence damping of the system decreases it is to note that as the orifice ratio increases slope of the linear decaying behavior of the damping ratio with respect to relative opening diminishes implying that the overall damping ratio of the owcs with relatively lower pto damping is more insensitive to the variations in the opening height of the chamber examination of the fig 8 further illustrates that the differences in the damping value different varying orifice ratio decrease as the relative opening increases for example for the biggest relative opening damping ratios become very close even though the orifice ratios vary in a broad range however for the smallest relative opening damping values are quite apart from each other for different orifice ratios this separation is responsible for the varying strength of the quadratic relationship presented in fig 7 as stated in the previous discussion it demonstrates that the smaller the orifice ratio the higher the sensitivity of damping ratio to the opening height variations of the chamber however contrary to the orifice case tendency of damping value variations with respect to permeability coefficient remains linear as the relative opening decreases this conclusion is drawn from the fact that as the relative opening increases linear decay of damping for different permeability values remain almost parallel as opposed to the orifice pto it can be concluded that for a constant geometry if pto mechanism is simulated by an orifice damping ratio is a function of orifice ratio and relative opening in a quadratic and linear fashion respectively if porous medium is used to represent the pto mechanism then damping ratio is both a linear function of orifice ratio and relative opening therefore the authors think that damping ratio is possibly a linear function of permeability coefficient however the further research has to be conducted for larger range of permeability values from the obtained empirical regression lines overall damping ratio can be determined for a broad range of orifice ratios and relative openings as well as different permeability values calculated natural frequencies according to eq 7 with respect to orifice ratios for relative openings used in this study are plotted in fig 9 expectedly plotted natural frequencies for different orifice ratios damping values have very similar values since by definition they represent the resonant condition for undamped systems on the other hand frequency values heavily depend on the relative opening fig 10 shows the computed natural frequency values for different orifice ratios versus relative openings each value corresponding to a distinct relative opening is the average of the natural frequencies calculated for different orifice ratios since determined porous medium natural frequencies are very close to those obtained for orifice ratios they are excluded from fig 10 however they are presented in fig 11 frequently in the literature natural frequency is calculated by the following formula as a first approximation 11 w n g d where g is the gravitaitonal constant m s2 and d is the immersion depth m of the chamber s front wall evans and porter 1995 a more general formula is given by mccormick 2007 12 w n g d d where d is the so called effective length representing the added mass set in motion by the oscillation of the water column in an experimental study d is empirically obtained by fukuda 1977 13 d 0 41 a w where a w is the water column surface area m2 there is also another formula for determination of the natural frequency of an oscillating water column which is derived by the potential flow assumptions within the framework of linear water wave theory molin 2001 to the best of the author s knowledge molin s formula has not been used for calculation of any wave energy converter tool nevertheless it has been included for completeness this formula describes the effective length as follows 14 d b π sinh 1 l b l b sinh 1 b l 1 3 b l l 2 b 2 1 3 b l l 2 b 2 b 2 l 2 1 where l and b are the length m and width m of the water column respectively computed natural frequencies by the above equations for the owc used in this study are also inserted in fig 10 for comparison it is clearly observed that natural frequencies obtained via eq 11 are higher than those that were calculated by both using the effective length obtained from eqs 13 and 14 and greatly overestimate the experimental values it is not surprising because in eq 11 added mass is ignored for relatively larger openings obtained values further diverge from the results of eq 11 quadratic fitting well represents the natural frequencies obtained from eq 11 this formula is actually a limiting case for very narrow water columns where added mass is infinitesimally small despite the crude approximation obtained it is often used for practical purposes to gain physical insights because of the challenging nature of determination of the added mass however according to the results of the present study natural frequencies calculated by eq 11 are unrealistic especially for relatively larger openings in addition morris thomas et al 2007 reported a caveat that results of eq 11 should always be considered as an upper bound for the actual value fukuda 1977 and molin 2001 determined the effective length by means of experiments and potential theory respectively as reported by veer and tholen 2008 molin 2001 formula which is somewhat unwieldy always yields slightly smaller natural frequencies than those of fukuda 1977 indeed this is the case as fig 10 illustrates however both of them provided higher values than those of determined in this study one reason for this should be fukuda 1977 used both rectangular and circular cross sections in the experiments and empirical formula was derived to represent both cross sections another reason could be lying on the underwater geometry of the tested chamber in the present study right left and back plate of the owc extends all the way down to the bottom of the wave flume where fukuda 1977 and molin 2001 used structures that pierce the free surface evenly for all sides without reaching the bottom of the tank besides they modeled the water columns in moonpools which are constructed within ships or offshore structures in some sense they resemble floating rather than fixed owcs where hydrodynamics would be different due to the coupling of the water column and floating structure according to ning et al 2016 fukuda s formula may not yield accurate values for owcs therefore fukuda s expression is modified based on the physical experimental model data gathered in the present study the modified formula for calculation of effective length is defined as 15 d 1 44 a w calculated natural frequencies by using the empirically obtained effective length very closely follow those that obtained from experimental and numerical model data gathered in this study fig 11 shows the experimentally obtained versus calculated natural frequencies by use of eq 15 45 diagonal 1 1 line is also embedded into the figure to provide better visual understanding of the accuracy of the proposed effective length formula fig 11 clearly reveals that natural frequency values obtained from the modified formula are found to be remarkably in accord with those computed from experimental and numerical model free decay time series data not surprisingly natural frequency of an owc for a fixed relative opening is independent of applied pto mechanism since by definition it is the free oscillation frequency in the absence of any external force acting on the system in addition to its validity empirical formulas in general are considered very valuable as they enhance prediction accuracy and decreases the analytical complexity mccormick et al 2018 owc wave energy converters are dynamical systems which diversely respond to various excitation frequencies in a real sea condition incident wave forces exciting the water column possess different frequencies analysis of the wave climate of a specific region where an owc is planned to be deployed reveals the dominant wave frequency present in that region most of the available incident wave energy can only be extracted if the owc structure is tuned for this pertinent frequency therefore determination of the resonant frequency for a variety of geometric parameters and applied pto dampings is of great importance for 0 ζ 1 2 where the damping ratios found in the present study lie in resonant frequency can be computed by the following expression rao 2011 16 w r w n 1 2 ζ 2 fig 12 illustrates the resonant frequencies calculated via eq 16 for different relative openings in terms of orifice ratios and permeability values it is readily observed that resonant frequency increases with relative opening for all orifice ratios and permeability values reported values are also compatible with a recent experimental study carried out by çelik and altunkaynak 2018 where the same owc tool geometric and damping parameters are used under the excitation of various monochromatic waves relevant frequencies used in the mentioned study are 3 49 rad s and 4 99 rad s for all openings and orifice ratios interior water column oscillations of the owc were found to be maximum under the excitation of an incident wave with an angular frequency value of 3 49 rad s all calculated resonant frequencies in the present study are much closer to 3 49 rad s rather than 4 99 rad s it is to note that porous medium resonant frequency values are very close to each other it is because the obtained damping values for porous medium are much below unity and square of this value even becomes smaller and resonant frequency value approach to natural frequency fig 13 shows thisrelationship for only k value 3 21 108 m2 for graphical clarity therefore empirically estimated natural frequencies for broad range of relative openings can readily be used as resonant frequencies of the owc in addition resonant frequency versus orifice ratio relationships for different relative openings are shown in fig 14 for a clear and better understanding the results are shown for only some of the relative openings however remaining results exhibit similar behavior a rectilinear relationship is evidently realized from the data depicted in fig 14 therefore for the rectangular owc geometry with orifice as a pto mechanism resonant frequency can be adequately approximated with a linear function of chamber opening and pto damping it enables accurate determination of resonant frequency under different relative openings and orifice ratios within the scope of this study added mass is also calculated by using eq 8 fig 15 demonstrates the relationship between the added mass and the opening ratio for different orifice and permeability coefficients similarly for a clearer vision results for only some of the cases are shown where undepicted results resemble the presented ones according to fig 15 there is no evident variation pattern for the added mass values as the relative opening orifice ratio or permeability values vary however added mass values are very close to each other and scattered in a narrow band essentially this should be the case expression of natural frequency is originally derived from undamped equation of motion mccormick 2007 17 ω n ρ g a w m m a however if the horizontal cross section of the owc is constant above formula reduces to eq 12 this implies that effective length d represents the added mass term in eq 17 and evidently empirically obtained natural frequency expression in this study has a constant effective length this was also the case for the empirical expressions eq 13 and eq 14 represented by fukuda 1977 and molin 2001 respectively furthermore in an experimental study conducted by chakrabarti and cotter 1992 free decay tests were used to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients of a semisubmersible and very closed values of added mass for different natural frequencies are reported 6 conclusion determination of hydrodynamic parameters of an owc is important to solve the equation of motion of the water column and calculate the performance of the device moreover previous literature reveals chamber underwater opening height and applied pto mechanism and damping as important parameters in obtaining relatively higher wave energy conversion efficiencies with this spirit in the present study physical and numerical free decay experiments are conducted to estimate the hydrodynamic parameters of a fixed owc for various chamber openings different pto mechanisms and dampings free decay tests are performed and oscillation time series of the water column free surface is recorded two initial displacements are used to deliver the required energy to the system to commence decaying oscillations it is found that obtained results are very close to each other regardless of the applied initial displacement value 3d free decay tests are also simulated by a commercial 3d navier stokes solver for the exact same settings of the physical experiments numerical model results are validated by experimental data hence applicability of the numerical model is proved to obtain the findings of this study for different structure geometries and settings numerical model can safely be applied in relatively shorter computation time while experimental studies require more effort labor force money and time and analytical studies are only available for simple geometries overall damping ratio of the owc device which represents all kind of dampings that the water column experiences during the oscillations are calculated for all of the configurations it is found that the damping ratio diminishes quadratically and linearly with increasing orifice ratio and relative opening respectively for the porous medium pto mechanism damping ratio also decays linearly as the relative opening increases illustrated regression lines express an approximate analytical relationship for determination of damping ratio in a broader range natural frequency of the owc device which is estimated according to the experimental data and numerical model results gathered in the present study is very important in estimating the response of the system to the excitation of different incident wave frequencies natural frequency values obtained from this study are found to be lower than those that were calculated by different formulas existing in the literature moreover for the first time an empirical formula is proposed to compute the natural frequency of a fixed owc empirical formulas can be widely used to estimate the response of an owc in an accurate simple enough way reducing the analytical complexity resonant frequencies of the owc device are also determined found values increase almost linearly with both increasing relative opening and the orifice ratio inserted regression lines into the figures imply that for a generic rectangular shaped owc structure resonant frequency is a linear function of both opening size and pto damping for porous medium representation of the pto mechanism resonant and natural frequencies are very close to each other so that empirical natural frequency formula proposed in this study may safely be used to estimate the resonant frequency of the owc device added mass of the system is calculated for different orifice sizes and chamber openings results showed that for all configurations added mass values are very close to each other implying the insensitivity of the added mass to pto damping and chamber opening height variations experimental findings and empirical formula obtained in the present study are readily available for a wide range of opening sizes and pto dampings especially when it is realized that all recommended opening and pto damping values in the literature lie in this range results of the present study are also very valuable in gaining physical

21918,physical experimental and 3d numerical free decay tests are performed for a stationary oscillating water column owc device with various underwater opening heights and power take off pto mechanisms numerical model results are verified with experimental data equivalent linear damping of the system is found by using logarithmic decrement method natural and resonant frequencies and added mass are calculated for the owc with the orifice it is found that damping ratio decreases quadratically with increasing orifice ratio and linearly with increasing relative opening resonant frequency

frequency for the first time an empirical formula for the natural frequency of a fixed owc is proposed added mass is found to be independent of orifice size and underwater opening height for the owc with the porous layer no noteworthy change is observed for the natural frequency and added mass compared to those of owc with orifice however damping of the system is quite altered while its change due to the variations in the permeability and under water opening height has similar characteristics keywords wave energy owc cfd physical experimental modelling ldm natural frequency added mass 1 introduction energy consumption increases with population growth and mankind is not likely to abandon his ongoing lifestyle as fossil based energy sources are depleting concerns about the climate change are also raising therefore transition from conventional energy sources to renewables is vitally important for the world s future for this purpose targets have been determined for percentage usage of renewable energy throughout the world but the goals seem to fail because renewable energy market in the world s total energy consumption does not grow fast enough renewables 2018 in spite of its high potential and energy density wave energy is almost a zero contributor to the renewable energy market various type of wave energy converters has been devised and patented so far and oscillating water column owc wave energy converter wec appear to be the most promising one thanks to its simplicity stability accessibility and environmental friendly features which paved the way to the prototype stage accordingly owc wave energy converter is also one of the most studied and simply a hollow chamber partly immersed into the water with two openings one is located underwater and the other is on top or upper back of the chamber the former enables the water column in the chamber interact with ocean waves while the latter has a much smaller area and is utilized to obtain high alternating air velocities driven via the water column motions then a turbine can be installed and its rotational motion can power a generator for electricity production wave energy conversion studies are mostly triggered by the oil crisis in 1970 s and now mostly motivated by increased public awareness for the climate change issues and dwindling conventional energy resources preliminary studies were theoretical and commenced with assuming the free surface of the water column as a weightless rigid piston evans 1978 and improved by letting the pressure distribution vary spatially over the water column surface evans 1982 falnes and mciver 1985 made use of oscillating bodies and inner pressure distributions to model a wave excited system evans and porter 1995 analytically investigated the hydrodynamic performance of a simple owc device for different front wall immersion depths preceding theoretical studies have provided valuable information and physical insights about the subject but the drawback is that they mostly use potential theory and thus neglect viscous effects in addition analytical treatment of the subject is only possible for very simple geometries by the increase of computational power computational fluid dynamics cfd softwares that solve fully navier stokes equations have been implemented to investigate the different aspects of the wave structure interactions and complicated water air coupling with power take off pto mechanism lopez et al 2014 evaluated the performance of the owc device via a validated reynolds averaged navier stokes volume of fluid model ransvof under various pto dampings for different orifice sizes they reported that the pto damping is the key parameter for efficiency and should appropriately be tuned for the wave climate of the installation region kamath et al 2015 used a two dimensional 2d numerical wave tank to investigate the effects of the wave steepness on the efficiency of an owc they found that relatively steeper incident waves reduce the device performance zhang et al 2012 investigated the hydrodynamic performance of an owc under different wave conditions and front wall geometries after validation of their results with previous experimental data they found that immersion depth of the front wall is a main parameter for device performance however orifice dimensions should also be chosen adequately so that the necessary pressure could form in the air chamber for sufficient energy extraction mahnamfar and altunkaynak 2017 developed experimental and numerical models and optimized two geometrically various owcs under different wave conditions the results of the numerical model were validated with experimental data and high accuracy was obtained they reported the importance of the percentage of the air volume in the chamber to increase the owc efficiency elhanafi et al 2017a b used a fully non linear cfd model to analyze the device performance under different wave parameters and turbine dampings they concluded that all tested parameters namely the wavelength wave height and turbine damping are significant in terms of efficiency they also emphasized the influence of the front wall geometry of the chamber on the energy extraction due to its contribution to energy dissipating vortex generation on the other hand experimental investigations have been an important tool for owc analysis observations and gathered data yield significant physical insights for energy extraction process in particular about the complicated two phase fluid wave structure interaction moreover experimental data is always important in terms of validation phase thiruvenkatasanny and neelamani 1997 experimentally studied wave energy caissons in an array and optimized the clearance between them along with the pto damping for the best performance possible morris thomas et al 2007 performed physical experiments to investigate the efficiency of an owc in terms of front wall immersion depth thickness and aperture design of the studied parameters immersion depth is found the most influential on the device performance and the efficiency curve lopez et al 2015 experimentally investigated the effects of turbine induced damping and water depth variations on the performance of a fixed owc they highlighted the great influence of pto damping on the device efficiency çelik and altunkaynak 2018 performed physical experiments to optimize the chamber geometry of an owc for various wave conditions by using the experimental data they developed mathematical models to predict water column fluctuations for various underwater openings and incident wave characteristics estimation of hydrodynamic coefficients i e radiation damping added mass viscous damping and pto damping is important in as regards owc modelling for this purpose even though analytical solutions are obtainable for simple geometries one has to resort to numerical models for complex structures commercial codes that utilize boundary element method bem are often implemented for this purpose bems are based on potential and linear wave theories and thus the flow is assumed to be ideal and viscous effects are omitted falcao and henriques 2016 this necessitates applying more realistic cfd softwares to overcome the limitations water and air columns in the chamber are highly coupled in a complex manner and elaborate wave structure interactions further complicate the analysis of an owc system current computing technology cannot cope with this complexity and yield flawless results ning et al 2016 therefore experimental validation is always necessary besides according to falcao and henriques 2016 simulation of complicated phenomenon by numerical model is computationally expensive very time consuming and even forbidding for three dimensional 3d in the present study experimental free decay tests are performed to approximate the equivalent linear damping of a stationary owc via well known logarithmic decrement method ldm in effect ldm is a widely used technique for floating bodies in offshore and naval engineering chakrabarti and cotter 1992 liu et al 2014 handschel et al 2015 however its application is very limited for oscillating water columns recently in a 2d cfd simulation simonetti et al 2015 vyzikas et al 2017 and elhanafi et al 2017a b utilized the ldm to estimate the resonant frequency of a fixed owc nevertheless it was not the primary subject of their studies but rather performed in a supportive manner to the best of authors knowledge physical experimental free decay tests have not been implemented for owc systems before therefore a physical model has been constructed to perform free decay tests to investigate the applicability of ldm for fixed owcs and determine the linear equivalent damping natural frequency resonant frequency and added mass of the owc system if a representative damping coefficient and the added mass can be determined that takes account for all different types of dampings equation of motion of the water column can easily be solved as precedingly presented literature review indicates that the pto and front wall immersion depth optimization are significant in terms of feasible energy extraction in the present study physical experiments are performed for various pto dampings orifice sizes and underwater openings of chamber moreover commercial cfd software flow 3d is utilized for three dimensional 3d simulations to test the applicability of numerical model after validation of numerical model with experimental data for the same setup numerical free decay tests are also conducted where pto damping is simulated by a porous medium the objectives of this study are i to perform free decay tests for the first time to estimate the hydrodynamic parameters damping ratio resonant and natural frequencies and added mass of a fixed owc for various underwater openings of the chamber orifice sizes and porous medium permeability coefficients via physical experiments ii to investigate and quantify the relationships between the hydrodynamic parameters and opening heights orifice sizes and permeability coefficients iii to develop an empirical formula for natural frequency of a fixed owc iv to simulate 3d free decay tests with a cfds software and validate the numerical model results with experimental data and vi to provide free decay experimental data for the determination of hydrodynamic parameters of a fixed owc under different front wall openings and pto dampings the rest of this study is organized as follows section 2 and section 3 describe the physical experimental model and numerical simulation set ups respectively description of ldm method is also presented in section 2 section 4 compares free decay time series data obtained from the experimental and numerical models section 5 is the results and discussions part where results are evaluated concluding remarks are presented in section 6 2 experimental set up 2 1 physical experimental set up physical experiments are performed in a 21 m long 1 m wide and 1 m deep wave flume located in hydraulic laboratory of istanbul technical university an owc structure with a rectangular cross section is constructed from 1 5 cm thick perplex material due to its strength and transparency a schematic of the owc along its dimensions is demonstrated in fig 1 seven different underwater opening heights are used during the experiments two different types of power take off mechanisms namely an orifice and a porous medium are constructed four different orifice diameters and porous medium with two different permeability coefficients are utilized for the experiments all underwater opening and orifice sizes are illustrated in fig 2 a physical picture of the owc is shown in fig 3 where pressure sensors connected to the owc are non functional and placed for future researches owc chamber is immobilized to wave carriages with f type iron claps to keep the device stationary the owc structure is placed in the longitudinal central axis of the wave flume in head sea orientation water column surface displacements are sampled and recorded in 100 hz with resistance type twin wave probes for future analysis as time series drawbacks of the measurement with a single probe was cited previously in the literature ferguson et al 2015 accordingly in order to detect any possible sloshing motion that may occur in the chamber three wave probes are installed on the right center and left longitudinal central axis of the chamber roof measurements obtained from the wave probes are averaged during all model tests water level in the wave flume is maintained at 0 60 m overall experimental setup is depicted in fig 3 dimensionless forms of the opening height and orifice size are defined as 1 α y h 2 τ a o a w where α is the relative opening y is the underwater opening height of the chamber h is the still water depth τ is the orifice ratio a o is the cross sectional orifice area and a w is the water column surface area chosen values of the relative openings and orifice ratios for this study are given in table 1 free decay tests include imposing an initial displacement to the water column and releasing afterwards subsequently the response of the water column is investigated in the present study free decay tests are implemented as follows water column is raised to a desired level from its equilibrium position by depressurizing the air in the chamber via a vacuum pump and sealing the orifice afterwards the seal is removed and water column is released decaying oscillations are then measured and recorded for future analysis this procedure is repeated for all combinations of the opening heights and orifice ratios to transfer enough energy into the water column to obtain reasonable amount of oscillations before the system dies out two different initial displacements 0 10 m and 0 15 m are imposed on the system as intuitively expected very small and thus negligible differences are detected in the free decay time series similar results are also reported by simonetti et al 2015 therefore results obtained for the 0 10 m initial displacement will be presented free decay tests as described in the experimental set up section are also numerically carried out when the pto mechanism of the owc system is represented by a porous layer back plate of the owc chamber has been replaced with porous medium layer which acts as a filter providing approximately laminar air flow through the medium in this case non linear flow characteristics are mostly reduced and accordingly pressure drop can be approximated by a linear function of the air flow rate luo et al 2014 such a relationship may accurately be represented by darcy s equation for porous medium 3 δ p v μ l k where δ p is the pressure drop across the porous layer pa v is the average horizontal velocity thorough the porous layer m s μ is the dynamic viscosity kgm s l is the porous medium thickness m and k is the permeability of the porous medium m2 respectively different permeability values are obtained by varying the thickness of the porous layer permeability values derived from the numerically obtained pressure velocity plots are 3 21 10 8 and 5 07 10 8 respectively 2 2 logarithmic decrement method to meet the purposes of the present study a linear equivalent damping is considered in other words calculated overall damping ratio includes all types of dampings that oppose the motion of the water column in an equivalent linearized form e g viscous radiation and pto dampings mccormick 2009 logarithmic decrement method ldm can be used to determine the damping ratio of underdamped rigid body systems rao 2011 therefore in order to utilize the ldm for an owc water column has to sufficiently act in a rigid body manner that is all the water column should oscillate in unison to ensure that the relative motion between the fluid particles are zero during the experiments water column oscillated as a rigid body and no sloshing motions were generated therefore the water column motion can be considered as a single degree of freedom sdof system in the piston heave mode a gneric decaying response of an initially disturbed system is shown in fig 4 the damping ratio ζ is defined as the ratio of the damping coefficient of the system to the critical damping value rao 2011 logarithmic decrement is described as 4 δ ln y i y i 2 where y i a n d y i 2 are the two successive positive or negative peaks in the decaying time series once the logarithmic decrement is determined damping ratio can be obtained by the following expression 5 ζ δ 2 π 2 δ 2 damped natural period of the system td can be determined by measuring the time elapsed between the zero crossings of the oscillation subsequently damped and undamped natural frequency of the system may be obtained by the following relations respectively 6 w d 2 π t d 7 w n w d 1 ζ 2 finally determination of w n enables the calculation of the added mass as follows mccormick 2009 8 m a ρ g a w w n 2 m where m a is the added mass kg ρ is the density kg m3 g is the gravitaitonal constant m s2 and m is the mass of the water column kg 3 numerical model in this study the numerical model based on a rans formulation with k epsilon turbulence model together with vof surface capturing is used and it is a rather standard well known approach furthermore a widely used commercial code flow 3d has been used fig 5 shows the mesh of the owc structure used in the numerical model detailed information is readily accessible from various sources such as mahnamfar and altunkaynak 2017 and flow science inc 2012 it is to note that from 24 to 36 h of computation time was needed depending on the configuration of the owc to perform the numerical simulations however vyzikas et al 2017 reported few seconds of simulation time for the free decay tests this should be due to the 2d numerical model developed for the free decay simulations 4 validation of the numerical model results in the present study free decay tests are performed with developed experimental and 3d numerical models for determination of hydrodynamic parameters of a fixed owc remarkable agreement is found between numerical simulations and experimental measurements a comparison of typical experimentally and numerically obtained free decay time series is depicted in fig 6 oscillation amplitude of the water column is normalized by the still water depth the figure reveals that the numerical free decay time series tend to follow the experimental data very closely it is immediately realized that peak values frequency information and trend of the response are very well captured by the numerical model to quantitatively compare the experimental and numerical model results root mean square error r m s e and coefficient of efficiency ce are utilized as performance evaluation criteria the rmse is defined as 9 r m s e 1 n i 1 n e i n i 2 and the ce can be expressed as 10 c e 1 i 1 n e i n i 2 i 1 n e i e o 2 where n is the total number of observation data e i a n d n i represent the direct measurements e g damping ratio ζ and damped natural period t d obtained from experimental and simulated time series respectively and e o is the average of the relevant quantity extracted from experimental data calculated experimental and numerical damping ratios and damped natural frequencies for all different relative openings and orifice ratios are presented in table 2 rmse values of experimental and numerical models for damping ratio ζ and damped natural period t d are 0 016 and 0 052s respectively and corresponding values are 0 928 and 0 879 respectively accordingly it can safely be concluded that for all underwater opening and orifice diameters the numerical models can be utilized for free decay simulation of the owc 5 results and discussion to extract the wave energy in an efficient manner system s heave resonant frequency has to be tuned according to the prevailing incident wave frequency in this case the water column approximately oscillates as a rigid body with relatively higher amplitudes when the excitation frequency is in the vicinity of resonant frequency motion of the water column mostly depends on the system s total equivalent linear damping because restoring and inertial forces cancel each other for this reason according to chakrabarti and cotter 1992 determination of the system s overall damping is crucial for optimal design considerations fig 7 shows the damping ratios with respect to orifice ratios for different relative openings for a clear vision damping ratios for only some of the relative openings are depicted quadratic fittings are also included in the figure as it can be seen damping decreases with the increase of orifice ratio in a quadratic manner which adequately describes the relationship between the damping and orifice ratios note that as the relative opening increases quadratic relationship weakens conversely the relationship between the damping and the orifice ratios and porous medium with different permeability values is shown in fig 8 clearly relative opening has also a significant effect on the overall damping of the system it is readily observed that the damping ratio decays as the relative opening increases with an almost linear fashion for all orifice ratios and permeability values as inserted linear regression lines show water column within the chamber communicates with the exterior water mass through the underwater opening of the chamber if the opening is relatively larger alternating water mass between the chamber and the outside region moves more easily hence damping of the system decreases it is to note that as the orifice ratio increases slope of the linear decaying behavior of the damping ratio with respect to relative opening diminishes implying that the overall damping ratio of the owcs with relatively lower pto damping is more insensitive to the variations in the opening height of the chamber examination of the fig 8 further illustrates that the differences in the damping value different varying orifice ratio decrease as the relative opening increases for example for the biggest relative opening damping ratios become very close even though the orifice ratios vary in a broad range however for the smallest relative opening damping values are quite apart from each other for different orifice ratios this separation is responsible for the varying strength of the quadratic relationship presented in fig 7 as stated in the previous discussion it demonstrates that the smaller the orifice ratio the higher the sensitivity of damping ratio to the opening height variations of the chamber however contrary to the orifice case tendency of damping value variations with respect to permeability coefficient remains linear as the relative opening decreases this conclusion is drawn from the fact that as the relative opening increases linear decay of damping for different permeability values remain almost parallel as opposed to the orifice pto it can be concluded that for a constant geometry if pto mechanism is simulated by an orifice damping ratio is a function of orifice ratio and relative opening in a quadratic and linear fashion respectively if porous medium is used to represent the pto mechanism then damping ratio is both a linear function of orifice ratio and relative opening therefore the authors think that damping ratio is possibly a linear function of permeability coefficient however the further research has to be conducted for larger range of permeability values from the obtained empirical regression lines overall damping ratio can be determined for a broad range of orifice ratios and relative openings as well as different permeability values calculated natural frequencies according to eq 7 with respect to orifice ratios for relative openings used in this study are plotted in fig 9 expectedly plotted natural frequencies for different orifice ratios damping values have very similar values since by definition they represent the resonant condition for undamped systems on the other hand frequency values heavily depend on the relative opening fig 10 shows the computed natural frequency values for different orifice ratios versus relative openings each value corresponding to a distinct relative opening is the average of the natural frequencies calculated for different orifice ratios since determined porous medium natural frequencies are very close to those obtained for orifice ratios they are excluded from fig 10 however they are presented in fig 11 frequently in the literature natural frequency is calculated by the following formula as a first approximation 11 w n g d where g is the gravitaitonal constant m s2 and d is the immersion depth m of the chamber s front wall evans and porter 1995 a more general formula is given by mccormick 2007 12 w n g d d where d is the so called effective length representing the added mass set in motion by the oscillation of the water column in an experimental study d is empirically obtained by fukuda 1977 13 d 0 41 a w where a w is the water column surface area m2 there is also another formula for determination of the natural frequency of an oscillating water column which is derived by the potential flow assumptions within the framework of linear water wave theory molin 2001 to the best of the author s knowledge molin s formula has not been used for calculation of any wave energy converter tool nevertheless it has been included for completeness this formula describes the effective length as follows 14 d b π sinh 1 l b l b sinh 1 b l 1 3 b l l 2 b 2 1 3 b l l 2 b 2 b 2 l 2 1 where l and b are the length m and width m of the water column respectively computed natural frequencies by the above equations for the owc used in this study are also inserted in fig 10 for comparison it is clearly observed that natural frequencies obtained via eq 11 are higher than those that were calculated by both using the effective length obtained from eqs 13 and 14 and greatly overestimate the experimental values it is not surprising because in eq 11 added mass is ignored for relatively larger openings obtained values further diverge from the results of eq 11 quadratic fitting well represents the natural frequencies obtained from eq 11 this formula is actually a limiting case for very narrow water columns where added mass is infinitesimally small despite the crude approximation obtained it is often used for practical purposes to gain physical insights because of the challenging nature of determination of the added mass however according to the results of the present study natural frequencies calculated by eq 11 are unrealistic especially for relatively larger openings in addition morris thomas et al 2007 reported a caveat that results of eq 11 should always be considered as an upper bound for the actual value fukuda 1977 and molin 2001 determined the effective length by means of experiments and potential theory respectively as reported by veer and tholen 2008 molin 2001 formula which is somewhat unwieldy always yields slightly smaller natural frequencies than those of fukuda 1977 indeed this is the case as fig 10 illustrates however both of them provided higher values than those of determined in this study one reason for this should be fukuda 1977 used both rectangular and circular cross sections in the experiments and empirical formula was derived to represent both cross sections another reason could be lying on the underwater geometry of the tested chamber in the present study right left and back plate of the owc extends all the way down to the bottom of the wave flume where fukuda 1977 and molin 2001 used structures that pierce the free surface evenly for all sides without reaching the bottom of the tank besides they modeled the water columns in moonpools which are constructed within ships or offshore structures in some sense they resemble floating rather than fixed owcs where hydrodynamics would be different due to the coupling of the water column and floating structure according to ning et al 2016 fukuda s formula may not yield accurate values for owcs therefore fukuda s expression is modified based on the physical experimental model data gathered in the present study the modified formula for calculation of effective length is defined as 15 d 1 44 a w calculated natural frequencies by using the empirically obtained effective length very closely follow those that obtained from experimental and numerical model data gathered in this study fig 11 shows the experimentally obtained versus calculated natural frequencies by use of eq 15 45 diagonal 1 1 line is also embedded into the figure to provide better visual understanding of the accuracy of the proposed effective length formula fig 11 clearly reveals that natural frequency values obtained from the modified formula are found to be remarkably in accord with those computed from experimental and numerical model free decay time series data not surprisingly natural frequency of an owc for a fixed relative opening is independent of applied pto mechanism since by definition it is the free oscillation frequency in the absence of any external force acting on the system in addition to its validity empirical formulas in general are considered very valuable as they enhance prediction accuracy and decreases the analytical complexity mccormick et al 2018 owc wave energy converters are dynamical systems which diversely respond to various excitation frequencies in a real sea condition incident wave forces exciting the water column possess different frequencies analysis of the wave climate of a specific region where an owc is planned to be deployed reveals the dominant wave frequency present in that region most of the available incident wave energy can only be extracted if the owc structure is tuned for this pertinent frequency therefore determination of the resonant frequency for a variety of geometric parameters and applied pto dampings is of great importance for 0 ζ 1 2 where the damping ratios found in the present study lie in resonant frequency can be computed by the following expression rao 2011 16 w r w n 1 2 ζ 2 fig 12 illustrates the resonant frequencies calculated via eq 16 for different relative openings in terms of orifice ratios and permeability values it is readily observed that resonant frequency increases with relative opening for all orifice ratios and permeability values reported values are also compatible with a recent experimental study carried out by çelik and altunkaynak 2018 where the same owc tool geometric and damping parameters are used under the excitation of various monochromatic waves relevant frequencies used in the mentioned study are 3 49 rad s and 4 99 rad s for all openings and orifice ratios interior water column oscillations of the owc were found to be maximum under the excitation of an incident wave with an angular frequency value of 3 49 rad s all calculated resonant frequencies in the present study are much closer to 3 49 rad s rather than 4 99 rad s it is to note that porous medium resonant frequency values are very close to each other it is because the obtained damping values for porous medium are much below unity and square of this value even becomes smaller and resonant frequency value approach to natural frequency fig 13 shows thisrelationship for only k value 3 21 108 m2 for graphical clarity therefore empirically estimated natural frequencies for broad range of relative openings can readily be used as resonant frequencies of the owc in addition resonant frequency versus orifice ratio relationships for different relative openings are shown in fig 14 for a clear and better understanding the results are shown for only some of the relative openings however remaining results exhibit similar behavior a rectilinear relationship is evidently realized from the data depicted in fig 14 therefore for the rectangular owc geometry with orifice as a pto mechanism resonant frequency can be adequately approximated with a linear function of chamber opening and pto damping it enables accurate determination of resonant frequency under different relative openings and orifice ratios within the scope of this study added mass is also calculated by using eq 8 fig 15 demonstrates the relationship between the added mass and the opening ratio for different orifice and permeability coefficients similarly for a clearer vision results for only some of the cases are shown where undepicted results resemble the presented ones according to fig 15 there is no evident variation pattern for the added mass values as the relative opening orifice ratio or permeability values vary however added mass values are very close to each other and scattered in a narrow band essentially this should be the case expression of natural frequency is originally derived from undamped equation of motion mccormick 2007 17 ω n ρ g a w m m a however if the horizontal cross section of the owc is constant above formula reduces to eq 12 this implies that effective length d represents the added mass term in eq 17 and evidently empirically obtained natural frequency expression in this study has a constant effective length this was also the case for the empirical expressions eq 13 and eq 14 represented by fukuda 1977 and molin 2001 respectively furthermore in an experimental study conducted by chakrabarti and cotter 1992 free decay tests were used to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients of a semisubmersible and very closed values of added mass for different natural frequencies are reported 6 conclusion determination of hydrodynamic parameters of an owc is important to solve the equation of motion of the water column and calculate the performance of the device moreover previous literature reveals chamber underwater opening height and applied pto mechanism and damping as important parameters in obtaining relatively higher wave energy conversion efficiencies with this spirit in the present study physical and numerical free decay experiments are conducted to estimate the hydrodynamic parameters of a fixed owc for various chamber openings different pto mechanisms and dampings free decay tests are performed and oscillation time series of the water column free surface is recorded two initial displacements are used to deliver the required energy to the system to commence decaying oscillations it is found that obtained results are very close to each other regardless of the applied initial displacement value 3d free decay tests are also simulated by a commercial 3d navier stokes solver for the exact same settings of the physical experiments numerical model results are validated by experimental data hence applicability of the numerical model is proved to obtain the findings of this study for different structure geometries and settings numerical model can safely be applied in relatively shorter computation time while experimental studies require more effort labor force money and time and analytical studies are only available for simple geometries overall damping ratio of the owc device which represents all kind of dampings that the water column experiences during the oscillations are calculated for all of the configurations it is found that the damping ratio diminishes quadratically and linearly with increasing orifice ratio and relative opening respectively for the porous medium pto mechanism damping ratio also decays linearly as the relative opening increases illustrated regression lines express an approximate analytical relationship for determination of damping ratio in a broader range natural frequency of the owc device which is estimated according to the experimental data and numerical model results gathered in the present study is very important in estimating the response of the system to the excitation of different incident wave frequencies natural frequency values obtained from this study are found to be lower than those that were calculated by different formulas existing in the literature moreover for the first time an empirical formula is proposed to compute the natural frequency of a fixed owc empirical formulas can be widely used to estimate the response of an owc in an accurate simple enough way reducing the analytical complexity resonant frequencies of the owc device are also determined found values increase almost linearly with both increasing relative opening and the orifice ratio inserted regression lines into the figures imply that for a generic rectangular shaped owc structure resonant frequency is a linear function of both opening size and pto damping for porous medium representation of the pto mechanism resonant and natural frequencies are very close to each other so that empirical natural frequency formula proposed in this study may safely be used to estimate the resonant frequency of the owc device added mass of the system is calculated for different orifice sizes and chamber openings results showed that for all configurations added mass values are very close to each other implying the insensitivity of the added mass to pto damping and chamber opening height variations experimental findings and empirical formula obtained in the present study are readily available for a wide range of opening sizes and pto dampings especially when it is realized that all recommended opening and pto damping values in the literature lie in this range results of the present study are also very valuable in gaining physical

21919,the in pipe inspection robotic system is crucial in examining the inside of a pipe without compromising its structural safety the in pipe inspection robotic system is a promising alternative to conventional methods of x ray inspection and visual inspection despite the ongoing investigation the effectiveness of the in pipe inspection robotic system particularly regarding the mathematical modeling of the system design still needs to be improved the in pipe inspection robot which is normally equipped with a camera or non destructive testing ndt equipment moves inside the pipeline to conduct a pipe integrity assessment the main problem during an inspection is the restricted maneuverability of the robot due to geometric changes in the pipe this can be overcome by designing a proper mathematical model to develop an effective inspection robotic system therefore this paper provides a systematic review of different modeling types of the in pipe inspection robotic systems including the assessment of the kinematic and dynamic mathematical models for the system this review paper covers in pipe inspection robotic systems with several driving mechanisms such as fluid driven wheeled mobile drive wmd screw or helical drive legged and biomimetic drives keywords in pipe inspection robot kinematic dynamic modeling review 1 introduction varieties of the in pipe inspection robots have been developed over the past decades to examine built up deposits waxes or any cracks throughout a pipeline tur and garthwaite 2010 chattopadhyay et al 2018 the in pipe inspection robotic system can be operated in oil and gas pipelines water pipelines sewerage system or any piping systems that require specific inspection research on the in pipe inspection has been intensified over the years for instance leary et al 2004 focused on the unpiggable pipeline by integrating a highly agile robotic platform and an ndt sensor deng et al 2004 examined the method of attaching an ndt system which was an x ray real time imaging inspection technique rtiit on their robotic platform to locate and inspect welding conditions in the pipeline jin et al 2004 yuan et al 2009 and karkoub et al 2017 used a magnetic flux leakage mfl sensor attached to a robot to detect internal defects of the pipe fig 1 exhibits the components of an mfl in pipe inspection robot that was created by jin et al 2004 utilization of the in pipe inspection robot has led to new challenges regarding robot functionality this includes the propelling mechanism of the robot which can be either self propelled or assisted by a medium and the degree of adaptability with variations in the pipe diameter consequently new solutions in regard to the in pipe inspection robotic systems are constantly sought after a large number of research studies involve conducting experiments of the in pipe inspection robot such as those performed by sanemori and okada 1985 niewels and jorden 1994 hirose 1999 qian et al 2000 roh et al 2009 despite considerable effort to conduct in pipe inspection through real time experiments or on site studies weaknesses of these methods can still be detected several in pipe inspection robots in the previous research had difficulties maneuvering inside a pipe with different diameters curves or bends and t joints the robots were regularly found stuck during the operation as reported by o donoghue 2003 fung et al 2006 ferreira lino et al 2006 and terenzi 2012 hence it is crucial to have a proper mathematical model to improve the maneuverability of the robot and to analyze its movement before the system can be developed and tested in real time according to yan et al 2018 jiang et al 2014 nayak and pradhan 2014 liang l et al 2013 the weaknesses of the in pipe inspection robotic system can be overcome by improving the system design steerability inside the pipe adaptability to various pipe sizes and shapes flexibility of the body stability and motion efficiency fig 2 illustrates the system designed by an and moghaddam 2015 using software applications solidworks and visual nastran the system was simulated to move inside the pipes of 100 200 mm in diameter and elbows of 150 200 mm in diameter it is argued that with the focus on the system design the improved robotic system can ensure pipes with complex geometries can be thoroughly inspected yan et al 2018 qi et al 2018 other than that the improved system design can also reduce the risk of potential hazards especially regarding underground gas and sewerage pipelines in the event of a system breakdown or failure khan 2017 nagase et al 2018 minder 2018 a review on the previous in pipe inspection robotic systems was done by several groups of researchers such as ismail et al 2012 roslin et al 2012 ismail et al 2012 assessed several in pipe inspection robot designs from 1994 to 2010 the system that was created by duan et al 2012 moved inside a pipe and was autonomously powered by lithium batteries and mobile gear arms fig 3 shows an example of the crawler system designed and developed by nagase et al 2018 roslin et al 2012 reviewed several papers related to the hybrid locomotion of the in pipe robotic system that was published from 1994 to 2012 the hybrid inspection robot is the assimilation of two or more locomotions for instance a wheeled robot combined with screw type locomotion to create a wheel wall press screw drive type inspection robot however their review only covered the design of the hybrid locomotion robot but there was no review on modeling and controller designs shukla and karki 2016 published a review on the applications of the inspection robotic system in the on shore oil and gas industry they categorized the designs of the in pipe inspection robotic system according to shapes and sizes steering mechanisms propelling mechanisms detection technology and control mechanisms shao et al 2015 classified and tabulated the performance criteria of several in pipe inspection robots they analyzed eight papers to solve the problems of variable pipe diameters vertical layouts complicated inner geometries and mini pipe issues furthermore a review of inspection technologies involving the conditions of the water pipeline was published by liu and kleiner 2013 they categorized the water pipe inspection according to various methods including visual testing electromagnetic acoustic ultrasound radiographic and thermography there are various research studies related to the designs of the in pipe inspection robotic system and experimental work on hollow pipes however the review on the modeling of the in pipe inspection robotic system is inadequate therefore the aim of this paper is to provide an extensive review of the current approaches in the modeling of the in pipe inspection robotic system technology to the best of the authors knowledge there is no comprehensive literature about the subject as yet this paper is organized as follows the section following this introduction is devoted to the classification of the pipe inspection robotic system special emphasis is placed on the classification of the outer pipe robots and the in pipe robots and their locomotions the modeling of the in pipe robotic systems are arranged as follows the robot driven by fluid the wheel mobile drive wmd type robot the screw drive or helical drive type robot the legged and biomimetic insect type robot such as snake inchworm and caterpillar type robots the conclusion section concludes the review by emphasizing the limitation of each model and research gaps that can be further explored this review consolidates and organizes these topics in a manner that will allow for more optimized in pipe inspection robotics system to be developed later understanding the following topics in detail allows for the optimal and robust controllers to be discussed in the future 2 classification of the pipe inspection robot the pipe inspection robotic systems can be roughly classified into outer pipe and in pipe inspection robotic systems the outer pipe inspection robotic system is desired in the industry due to its ability to perform the outer pipe inspection without interrupting plant operations this inspection robot clamps to the outer wall and is able to move along the pipe overcoming bends and junctions autonomously or semi autonomously mirats tur and garthwaite 2010 conversely the outer pipe inspection robotic system cannot inspect the inner pipe wall rigorously as opposed to the in pipe robotic system the outer pipe inspection robots have been discussed in several research studies park et al 2002 fukuda et al 1987 chatzakos et al 2006 nagaya et al 2012 han et al 2013 singh and ananthasuresh 2013 imajo et al 2015 the movement of the outer pipe inspection robotic system is governed by two gripper arms sliding joints on the body and sensors to detect obstacles fukuda et al 1987 fig 4 exhibits the outer pipe inspection robot clamping to the pipe during an inspection and its movement is remotely controlled han et al 2013 in contrast the in pipe inspection robotic system inspects the inner pipeline this enables an in depth overview of internal corrosion of the pipe sludge built up and any problems related to the pipe furthermore the use of the in pipe inspection robotic system is beneficial when the pipes are buried underground ghavamian et al 2018 nevertheless there are still challenges in system development and inspection particularly when pipe layouts are unspecified the ability to specify pipe layouts will allow the in pipe inspection robotic system to adapt and reconfigure in completing the inspection process more efficiently the in pipe inspection robots can be classified into a few categories including pipe inspection gauge pig robot wheeled mobile drive wmd robot screw drive or helical drive robot legged robot and biomimetic robot actuated robot examples of the biomimetic robots include those inspired by snake inchworm and caterpillar fig 5 shows the elements of classification for this system mills et al 2017 3 modeling of fluid driven in pipe inspection robotic system the fluid driven in pipe inspection robotic system is driven by the compressed conveyance fluid the difference in fluid pressures at the back and the front of the robot propels it forward the velocity of the propelled robot can be adjusted using flexible sealing elements and support on the robot s body karl dawson 2011 the fluid driven in pipe robotic system requires a proper tracking method to avoid the system from being stalled inside the pipe since the fluid driven robotic system is considered as an untethered system an external monitoring system should be attached to the pipe for the signaling purpose in identifying the robot s movement inside the pipe during an inspection in a study by nguyen and kim 2001 a pipeline inspection gauge pig was modeled in a horizontal line their research analyzed the gas velocity the position of pig and its velocity in the pipe the pig was driven by an unsteady flow of gas with the assumption that the gas is in an ideal state and in a single phase in order to analyze the pig s movement the authors used the method of characteristics moc to solve nonlinear equations for which the initial and boundary conditions were set in a rectangular grid the initial conditions of the upstream and downstream flows were then solved using the range kutta method the pressure was found from the flow rate at the pipe s inlet and outlet while the flow velocity was found from the pressure boundary condition this research focused on the interpolation and range kutta methods to solve the dynamic behavior of the pig as it moved in a straight line fig 6 illustrates the boundary condition of the pig inside the grid nguyen and kim 2001 in another study nguyen et al 2001 modeled the fluid driven pig in the 90 curved pipeline they divided the system modeling into two categories namely the flow equation modeling of gas in the pipe and dynamic modeling of the pig for these modeling techniques the ideal gas and single phase flow properties were applied other assumptions included a uniform pipe diameter induced friction from the pipe wall and the quasi steady heat in the flow they argued that the suitable velocity for the pig to move in the pipeline without posing any risk is from 1 to 5 ms 1 for the stream liquid and from 2 to 7 ms 1 for the stream gas the movement of the pig inside the pipe is driven by the pressure differences between the downstream and upstream flows the dynamic model of the pig for the curved pipe was created in three sections namely section 1 where the pig entered the curve section 2 where the pig was in the middle of the curve and section 3 where the pig comes out of the curve the head and tail of the pig are connected via the length l and the masses of its head and tail are indicated by m1 and m2 respectively the assumptions stated previously were used because most of the information for in pipe inspection or pigging pipeline is acquired from experiments fig 7 shows the pig flows inside the bend pipe while fig 8 shows the pig in three sections namely section i which is at the entrance of the pipe section ii which is at the middle of the elbow pipe and section iii which is at the exit of the pipe nguyen et al 2001 the general derivation of the equation used by nguyen et al 2001 is represented as equation 1 however there were no stability and controllability analyses conducted in this research 1 d d t k α k α p α f where k kinetic energy p potential energy in the study by hu and appleton 2005 a mathematical model for the bidirectional pipeline inspection gauge pig using the newtonian method was derived and verified using an experimental study two tests were carried out by moving the pig downstream and upstream as shown in fig 9 a for the bidirectional pig and in fig 9 b for a simple pig prototype two forces of the fluid are f t which is the force that drives the turbine to rotate and f f which is the push force in the axial direction if the propulsion force exerted on the nut at the pig is higher than the total resistance force which is the summation of frictional force and drag force the nut will move and accelerate hu and appleton 2005 then the generated torque will decrease because of the speed of the turbine increases dynamic equations for the system are shown as equations 2 4 equations 2 and 3 show a balanced equation for the torque acting on the turbine t f is the torque generated by the fluid force t b is the reaction of the torque generated by the nut and f b is the reaction force generated by the nut or pig as it moves downstream 2 t f i d

order to regulate pressures at the body deng et al 2011 furthermore a mathematical model of the pig s speed regulation using a throttle valve was also created by this group of researchers in addition wei et al 2012 modeled an extremely low frequency elf electromagnetic fields in pipelines to locate the position of the in pipe inspection robot the electromagnetic transmitter and receiver were designed and a mathematical model which is a linear equation with six unknown numbers and three algorithms were formulated according to archila and becker 2013 a few considerations should be made before a robot can be launched inside a pipeline these considerations include the pipeline properties fluid properties operation pressure and physical limitations of the robot the difference finite method is adopted to simulate the behavior of the robot with fluid inside the pipeline modeling of the fluid driven in pipe robot was extensively studied by l liang et al 2013 where an inner and outer spiral mobile robot was propelled by a higher pressure at the back of the robot computational fluid dynamics cfd was used to calculate the flow field of the liquid inside the pipe the robot s axial force increases when the pressure and concentrated liquid with high velocity pushes the outer shell of the robot the authors also emphasized that the relationship between the axial force is relative to the liquid density viscosity and eccentricity the axial force is directly proportional to the density viscosity and eccentricity of the fluid and it is inversely proportional to the diameter of the pipe a study conducted by l liang et al 2013 was then supported by liang et al 2014 who modeled a dynamic model of microrobot driven by a turbulent fluid a similar cfd method was adopted to solve the environmental and operating parameters furthermore an orthogonal optimization experiment was used to acquire the optimal inner spiral structural parameter of the robot in a paper written by mirshamsi

as an infinitesimal piece in the radial component df then df can be expressed in terms of the gravitational force using vertical components dg fig 11 shows the bidirectional pig in a pipeline established by zhu et al 2015 based on the findings of this research no significant model can be formulated because the system is only related to the force acting on the boundary of the pipe they only focused on the contact force due to the pressure exerted on the pig material properties for the disc the effect of the disc to the contact force among others most of the numerical simulations were carried out using ansys software table 1 shows the summary of the in pipe inspection robotic systems driven by fluid 4 modeling of the wheel mobile drive wmd in pipe inspection robotic system the wheeled mobile drive wmd in pipe inspection robotic system mainly consists of two parts a driving module and a mechanism to press the wheels to the pipe wall in order to generate propulsion force mirats tur and garthwaite 2010 the wheels can be on a horizontal plane and pressed to the pipe wall by adjusting the robot s wheel arm okada and kanade 1987 y zhang and yan 2007 however the mobile robot tends to slip as it maneuvers inside the pipe due to the insufficient grip on the wall according to y zhang and yan 2007 this limitation can be overcome by using an in pipe robot with wheels based on a multi axis differential mechanism finite element analysis fea was carried out by hong and yang 2011 to analyze the model based on a three adaptive symmetrical axis in pipe inspection robot an analysis is required to ensure high maneuverability of the robot in geometrically complex structures such as the pipe elbows either in a simulation or real time study the variable parameter for the adaptive system can be solved using a parallelogram and nut slider which utilizes two differential axles and one following axle pradhan et al 2017 used an fea software program ansys to find the driving torque required for the motor of the robot to overcome drag due to fluid viscosity and speed in other research studies l liang et al 2013 liang et al 2015 the robot movement was analyzed using a computational fluid dynamics cfd software program fluent the robot that was studied has four spiral tails and can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise in a study by kwon et al 2011 which employed both simulation and experimental work an inspection robot driven by a wheel chain connected to a mechanical linkage clutch was initially modeled using a kinematic method there were two cases studied by kwon et al 2011 in assessing the model as shown in fig 12 a fig 12 b and fig12 c the model assessment was based on the movement of the in pipe robotic system inside the straight pipeline and the bend section of the pipe the linear and angular velocity of the system during a rotational movement in a straight line are represented by equation 10 and equation 11 respectively while those of the rotational movement inside a bend section is represented by equation 12 and equation 13 case 1 linear velocity for rotational motion inside a straight pipeline 10 v c cos θ v c where v c linear

and bend section of the pipe the system does not grip to the pipe wall a system proposed by s jiang et al 2009 and s y jiang et al 2008 has an elastic legged wheel which acts as an adaptable mechanism to maintain traction on the pipe wall the adaptable mechanism consists of wheels on the three slider crank mechanisms located at 120 apart in the circumferential direction the pre tightened spring parallelogram mechanisms and timing belt mechanisms fig 13 a shows the configuration of the system and the components of the tri axial differential mechanism fig 13 b displays the drive wheels located at 120 which presses on the pipe wall using a slider crank with pre tightened springs their research was supported by kim et al 2013 that used the multi axial differential gear mechanism wall press mechanism and a motor to drive the system the modeling of the system was focused on the angular velocity for each gear based on the principle of superposition and linear velocity for every wheel the system is driven by a microcontroller and has no state space model for controller manipulation kim et al 2013 the research studies of hong and yang 2011 and shi and tang 2012 used a 3d modeling method in examining the behaviour of an in pipe robot with a tri axial differential mechanism using an equation of momentum transfer the authors stated that without this tri axial gearing system the locomotion interference would exist on the traction device the research by sibai et al 2012 suggested that several equations are required in calculating a suitable robotic platform and components before an actual prototype can be constructed after conducting rigorous calculations a robotic platform having a total mass of 7 5 kg was developed the platform is equipped with three motors each of which drives two wheels interestingly it has the ability to move inside a pipe with a diameter of between 12 and 16 inches unfortunately however there is no information about the movement modeling and controller shown in their work another study by damic et al 2014 modeled the dynamics of a multibody system using the object oriented technique this technique uses a bond graph and two way interprocess communication ipc pipe where the information from the targeted place will be returned to the system as a 3d image the information will then be processed before the next instruction is given by the system to proceed with the execution of the next algorithm martínez garcía et al 2014 employed a non linear algebraic solution to control the robot s trajectory planning to support the author s observation a half cell electrochemical which uses the nernst equation as an algorithm for automatic searching and problem detecting in pipelines was utilized the nernst algorithm estimates the distance between the mobile robotic system and targeted pipeline flaws based on theoretical empirical nonlinear regression then the gradient based field from the volumetric derivatives is used to control the motion of the wheeled robot the algebraic calculation determines the non linear trajectory by controlling the speed of the wheeled mobile robot to the targeted flaws since the robot poses a non holonomic kinematic constraint it can then be integrated into the general potential equation the nernst equation of the system is shown in equation 14 the forward kinematic equation is represented as equation 15 while the body diagram for the system is shown in fig 14 nernst equation for the system 14 e t e 0 κ t e t f ln a a x a r e d where e t electrode potential at instantaneous

model from a mechanical design with either a straight pipe or an elbow pipe the mathematical model discussed in their study also utilized the newtonian method the analysis was accomplished and the equation includes a few criteria such as i sliding and overturning in a straight pipe movement and ii swivel motion and stability analysis in an elbow movement the force and moment of the system s movement in straight and elbow pipes are defined with respect to the 3d axis labeled x lengthwise direction of the pipe y span wise direction of the pipe and z vertical direction motion stability in different pipe diameters was experimentally tested and the results from the experiment were linked to the mathematical model developed fig 15 shows the robot with a sliding mechanism to adapt to the diameter of the pipe and track wheel this system is introduced to create grip and reduce slip hazards as the robot moves inside the pipe the coordinate system for the robot in the elbow and straight motion are shown in equation 16 and equation 17 respectively moreover fig 16 shows the world coordinate system which is set as the center of the elbow curvature 16 r λ φ r 0 5 d cos φ cos λ r 0 5 d

motion coordinate for the system is 17 x r 2 z 2 d 2 4 another finding showed that an unknown layout and information about an in pipe inspection robotic system could be deciphered using a reconstructed image obtained from the projection of laser rays to the wall of the pipe the image acquired from the laser projection could be solved using a scheme called the active stereo omni direction vision sensor asodvs tang et al 2017 in addition zhang et al 2017 used the kinematic modeling method to analyze the location and direction of the robot in a pipe elbow in order to derive the kinematic model a displacement of the center of the driving wheel is linked to the steering angle and this is formulated as a function of the derivatives of displacement between the driving wheels and steering angle they attempted to prove the kinematic model of the system by comparing the theoretical equation with the simulation that was conducted the results obtained from the kinematic modeling and mechanical analysis supported the findings of luo et al 2017 that used different pipe diameters by changing the speed and driving force of the piston located inside the robot furthermore research by gravalos et al 2017 solved the problem of underground soil water monitoring in their study a wheeled mobile robot which was modeled to move around bend sections was employed two articulated movable platform robots were attached to a soil moisture sensor an extension rod was used to inspect the turning radius of the wheeled mobile robot inside the curved pipe in addition the vibration of the electromechanical device at a higher speed was also investigated further research about traction and interference that troubled the in pipe inspection robotic system was further elaborated by zheng et al 2018a b the robot which consisted of four components namely differential mechanism travel drive mechanism pre tightening mechanism and auxiliary support mechanism was connected via a modular platform zheng et al 2018a b proposed a solution to this problem by ensuring that the system is able to go through irregular pipes with changing diameters a tracked type in pipe inspection robot with an adjustable drive system was proposed by ciszewski et al 2014 to be used for pipe inspection and hole drilling operation on flat and curved surfaces the robot is equipped with a vision system located on the top of its body and able to operate inside pipes and ducts with a diameter range from 210 mm to 235 mm fig 17 a shows the two dimensional 2d top view of the system and fig 17 b shows the side view the dynamic model of the robot in 3d is shown in fig 17 c the system is modeled using the kinematics and dynamics methods the kinematic model is obtained by finding the velocity of

type in pipe inspection robotic system the screw drive type in pipe inspection robot is composed of a few components i e rotator elastic arms to support the body motor and wheels to drive the system the wheels are inclined at a certain angle to ensure the robot moves like a screw inside the pipe p li et al 2016 fig 18 shows the concept of the screw drive type in pipe inspection robotic system

angle of the wheels qingyou et al 2013 modeled a modular helical motion based on conic springs analysis of the traction was carried out for three types of motions which depended on the load i e small medium or heavy that the robot needed to carry the robot utilizes the synchronized motion for a small load but it performs inchworm and rigid motions for medium and heavy loads respectively in order to support the research conducted by qingyou et al 2013 chen et al 2014 asserted that unstable traction of the helical drive robot could be settled by adding a timing belt to synchronize wheel rotations which would otherwise be prompted independently this is supported by liu et al 2014 who investigated both active and passive helical drive in pipe robotic systems the problem related to the passive helical drive robot was caused by low traction and lower mechanical force transmission they modeled their system using kinematics and mechanics modeling for designing a control system they found that the active helical drive in pipe robot has better traction compared to the passive helical drive further research on the screw drive type in pipe inspection robotic system focusing on spring stiffness was conducted by kakogawa and ma 2012 the kinematic analysis of the screw drive mechanism is needed due to the inability of one degree of freedom in pipe robots to pass through curved pipe sections based on the analysis they concluded that there is a relationship between spring stiffness length of the robot torque of the motor and static friction on the inner pipe wall in addition they found an optimal spring stiffness for the robot to move along the curved section of the pipe and climb up a vertical pipe in addition li et al 2014 established an energy optimization technique to the screw drive in pipe robot equipped with an inclined angle adjustable roller based on this research energy can be optimized by conducting dynamic and model analysis a similar study was conducted by liu and li 2015 where special well tracks were used in the oil and gas exploration however the development of the wells needs to consider the risk of casualties especially to transport tools and equipment downhole to overcome this a system with higher tractive forces was designed and modeled the geometric calculation and mechanical analysis were used to identify suitable parameters for the helical drive in pipe robotic system the involvement of a robot in spraying the inner pipe wall was elaborated by chen et al 2015 the platform was modeled using a geometric method while the manipulator was modeled based on denavitt hartenberg dh the initial position of the robot was determined using a laser tracker then the robot was aligned with the pipe while the coincidence of the spray gun with the axis of the pipeline was calculated using an inverse method tian and zhang 2016 further elaborated on the mechanics of a robot in conducting an inner pipe spray among the plausible explanation for this finding is that the stability and contact of the robot movement relative to the inner pipe can be expressed as a matrix and differential algebraic equations to support the research findings of liu et al 2014a b c and li et al 2015 zheng et al 2018a b used three dimensional modeling to model a spiral or screw drive motion of an in pipe inspection robot the robot was employed to overcome motion interference when the pipe robot passing through an elbow hence the system was designed and modeled with adaptable pipe changes the in pipe inspection robotic system was modeled as a system with three components a driving mechanism a holding mechanism and an elastic mechanism the researchers created a formula for maximum size and length of the robot as it moved inside a straight pipe and elbow the motion of the system was explained as a linear motion with velocity v as the product of the wheel s angular velocity and radius of the wheel and the instantaneous radius r is a combination of the curvature for three wheels r p is the radius of the wall and the equation of the instantaneous radius is given in equation 25 to equation 27 fig 19 shows the geometric relationship between the instantaneous radius of the curvature for the robot s wheel linear velocity is given by 25 v i ω i r w where v i wheel speed ω i wheel angle speed r w radius of the driving wheel instantaneous radius is 26 r 1 r 2 r 3 3 r where r1 r2 r3 are instantaneous radius of curvature with respect to the center of the wheel 27 r 1 r r p r w sin φ r 2 r r p r w sin φ 120 o r 3 r r p r w sin φ 240 o where r p radius of elbow wall r w radius of driving wheel φ angle between the arm for drive wheel 1 and t t however the system in zheng et al 2018a b was only tested up to the simulation level and not experimentally verified even though a robot could pass through the elbow without any interference the robot was seen adaptable to various diameters and it was able to pass through the obstacle in another research study osman and kovačić 2017 investigated the screw drive type in pipe robotic system with adaptive legs this study described the mathematical modeling of the robot in terms of kinematic and dynamic screw drive principles the system consisted of two sections namely the driving section which comprised three legs and the driven section which comprised two ankles the actuator that drove the system was an electric motor with a planetary gearbox the torque generated was then transmitted to the legs and wheels of the robot the leg and wheel components were considered the driven section and these components need to be pressed to the pipe wall at all times a systematic study by zheng et al 2018a b which was supported by tourajizadeh et al 2018 solved the problem and limitation related to the screw drive type in pipe inspection robot that moved in a constant pitch rate a dynamic model of the screw drive type robot was derived and linearized around the operating point before linear quadratic controller lqr was applied to the robot system the kinematics and kinetics of the system were also derived in order to move forward the steering angle was used to handle pitch rate movement and avoid obstacles although this study was based on simulations using matlab and adams software the findings are essential to potential investigation on the in pipe inspection robot based on the studies reviewed in this section a summary regarding the screw drive and helical drive type in pipe inspection robotic systems is provided in table 3 6 modeling of legged type in pipe inspection robotic system the legged robot for in pipe inspection has many degrees of freedom enabling a wide range of motion nevertheless the robot will utilize more actuators and a complex control system to control its motion compared to a normal wheeled robot bekhit et al 2015 in the study by neubauer 1994 a legged type in pipe inspection robotic system mimicked the motion of a spider to climb vertical pipes for inner inspection the legs were pushed against the pipe wall during the climbing and five shapes of the pipes were used to test the climbing motion there were two control layers to accomplish the motion reflexive control layer and reactive control layer but they were not based on any mathematical models for further reference a system called moritz which was designed by zagler and pfeiffer 2003 had two joints for bending and another two joints for rotation the legs of the system were mounted on the front and rear body of the robot the rotation joints were used to separate the legs into two pairs and enable the robot to rotate around the longitudinal axis during its motion gait pattern sensor crawler controller and coordination were explained but without any mathematical modeling zagler and pfeiffer 2003 the in pipe robotic system moving in the crawling motion was modeled using the intelligent algorithm by qiao and shang 2012 in order to overcome the problem of maneuvering inside the elbow and u shaped pipes also an algorithm was used to determine radial variation in the pipe and the length of the elastic rear and front leg deformation using a matlab program han et al 2013 modeled two module collaboration robots for climbing and crawling inside six inches of a vertical pipeline the two modules were connected by an arm that was remotely controlled to make them flexible for climbing and moving on the pipe s surface next jatsun and malchikov 2014 illustrated several designs of the multi link in pipe inspection mobile robots that are capable of moving in a very tight space in the pipeline the robot s dynamic and motion control were mathematically modeled the numerical simulations and experimental tests showed that the robot demonstrated worm like properties in addition to the work done by han et al 2013 jatsun and malchikov 2014 on the crawling robot a five degrees of freedom 5dof crawling robot with double claws was kinematically modeled using the denavit hartenberg dh you et al 2015 the method was used to overcome the problems related to a multi pipeline environment three types of crawling motions which are crawling trajectory inside a straight pipe crawling between pipes and crawling between rows of pipes and joints the motion was based on the joint interpolation between the trajectories however the applicability of the findings might be limited due to the simulation mode of the study the information related to the legged in pipe inspection robotic system is summarized in table 4 7 modeling of biomimetic in pipe inspection robotic system snake type robot inchworm type robot caterpillar type robot the biomimetic mechanism is a semi autonomous or autonomous system that has the ability to operate in a complex environment the biomimetic mechanism can be designed and planned to be adaptable in unpredictable changes and perform multi functional tasks thus by using this biomimetic concept an in pipe inspection robotic system such as snake type robot inchworm type robot and caterpillar type robot can dramatically improve in pipe inspection enner et al 2013 modeled a snake robot that was able to move inside a straight pipe specifically by estimating the joint angles of the snake robot the robot s body moves along the center of the pipeline to estimate its diameter similarly in the case of the snake in pipe robotic system modeling jatsun et al 2014 designed and addressed the locomotion of the six linked mobile robot a mathematical model of the robot s movement in various modes especially the pipes with various parameters was also studied in addition a study by douadi et al 2014 highlighted the modeling of a snake robot on a planar surface the system consists of four active revolute joints and a passive revolute joint to solve a non holonomic kinematic constraint in the wheeled mobile robot singularities related to the robot can be solved by applying a higher number of dof and actuation input placed on the snake robot moreover hopkins and gupta 2014 modeled the snake in pipe robotic system using lagrangian dynamics for several joint modules indicated by n number of modules the equation of motion based on d h parameters on each module was acquired to visualize the pattern of motion for the snake robot one joint module was used to move the robot in the yaw motion while another was used to produce movements in the pitch direction the module movement was based on the sum of linear expansions from the parallel mechanisms fig 20 and fig 21 feature parallel mechanisms as mentioned in hopkins and gupta 2014 while the equations of the vector and coordinate system for the snake robot are shown as equation 28 equation 29 and equation 30 vector loop equation 28 o a o b b a fixed coordinate frame for the system in x and y 29 x a a 1 c θ 1 b 1 c θ 1 ψ 1 y a a 1 s θ 1 b 1 s θ 1 ψ 1 where a 1 length between point c and e c

from the research by qi et al 2017 were in correlation with those from the study by enner et al 2013 however this study focused on the helical motion of a hyper redundant in pipe robot to overcome a pipe branch the model of the system was accomplished by using a hyperbolic function to make a snake robot move in the wave curve the movement is established by changing the parameter of the hyperbolic function based on the formula of a continuous curve model the curvature and torsion curves are used to derive the joint angle of the snake robot the inchworm and caterpillar in pipe robotic systems share similar movement principles according to wang et al 2009 the gait movements for inchworm and caterpillar are relatively similar except that the caterpillar robot has longer joint modules fig 22 shows the caterpillar kinematics and its gait while fig 23 shows the inchworm kinematics model the caterpillar kinematics robot moves in the open chain closed chain open chain state while the kinematics for the inchworm is in an open chain state besides that a worm robot which was also named a flexible squirming robot was suggested by zhang et al 2013 the authors studied the structure of the guide head and brake wheels inside the pipeline apart from that traction control was analyzed using the mechanics of the robot inside the pipeline the motion stability of the flexible shaft is based on the instability theory where the flexible shaft of the system is unstable when the robot moves inside straight and curved pipelines furthermore l liu et al 2014a b c modeled an in pipe robotic system of microrobot type with an eccentric wheel for in pipe inspection the robot movement is based on the resonant principle and a micro engine is used to excite the eccentric wheel the authors solved the problem of the angular acceleration by making the wheel flexible at the contact point with the pipeline several tests were then carried out to assess the performance of the system using different diameters and different ramp angles to support the prior research by liu et al 2014a b c worm like locomotion using electromagnetic waves was proposed by sattarov and almaev 2017 to overcome the limitations faced by the current in pipe robot system to climb an inclined pipe the researchers modeled analyzed and simulated two elastic segments connected like a ring that was formed by two coupled electromagnetic actuators the actuator moves in the longitudinal and transverse motions to overcome friction liu et al 2014a b c used the optimization technique to plan a helical drive motion to be used by an inchworm in pipe robot the robot moves by extending and retracting the conic spring in a sinusoidal velocity pattern the pattern of movement can be optimized by applying a genetic algorithm ga to the system s movement in a study conducted by fortunić et al 2017 the problem concerning the robot s motion in a small and confined space was solved using a bristle based motion the modeling of the bristle based motion of the robot was verified using the simulation and experimental studies the result showed that this small and simple microrobot could move with high speed in translational and rotational motions according to yamamoto et al 2018 the current inchworm locomotion faces difficulties when moving inside narrow pipelines thus they proposed a pneumatic hollow shaft with a longer stroke to ensure that the system can roll like an inchworm at a higher speed two models were assessed in terms of their movement patterns by comparing single and double drive patterns based on the comparison it was discovered that the single drive model performed better compared to the double drive model when they were on the horizontal vertical and bend pipes with a diameter of 53 mm furthermore a single drive inchworm pneumatic based model could move horizontally with an average speed of 100 mm s and at the speed of 40 mm s when climbing a vertical pipe with an almost 90 angle yamamoto et al 2018 supported their previous research yamamoto et al 2015 on the pneumatic mechanism with high speed locomotion it was found that the forward motion was generated from a combination of the holding forces produced by an expansion of mechanism to the pipe wall and the impellent forces on the other hand adams et al 2018 conducted a water utility pipe inspection using a soft inflatable actuator the behavior of the inflatable actuator mimicked the motion of an inchworm robot and its mathematical model was computed to observe its motion inside the space provided the data on the forces and displacement were acquired through an experimental study the creation of a flexible robot to move inside a pipe was initially proposed by fei et al 2014 in a study of the marine in pipe robotic system based on a metamorphic mechanism the flexible marine in pipe robot was modeled using adams software and its kinematics was also analyzed the system was able to pass through various pipe diameters and obstacles with the addition of a spring in addition wu et al 2015 derived mathematical modeling of an in pipe swimming robot by comparing with the previous crawling robot which normally had difficulty maneuvering in a limited and narrow pipe the in pipe swimming robot can however move freely and easily inside the pipe the previous findings on the parameters of the robot explained that the pipe size and robot geometry play a vital role in the mathematical model developed kim et al 2015 also faced a similar problem to model a flexible in pipe robot that can be used to mine manganese nodules the non linearity and correlation between the vessel a vertical lifting pipe a lifting pump an intermediate buffer station a flexible pipe and a self propelled mining robot are all contributed to dynamics analysis it required a considerably longer time to be created and needed higher specifications of a computer system thus to solve this issue kim et al 2015 proposed that the equation of motion should be separated into two subsystems known as the vessel lifting pipe and the flexible pipe mining robot subsystem kwon and yi 2012 designed and exploited a motion algorithm for the caterpillar in pipe robot with a loaded spring to expand and grip the pipe wall the kinematic analysis was applied to the 4 bar mechanisms at the wheels also a new motion planning for a reconfigurable system was applied using two connected springs between the two robot s modules the consistency between these two modules was analyzed in order to optimize the motion at any complex junctions in another study in solving the problem of the complex junction and mapping of 3d in pipe inspection an algorithm named as the hierarchical integer linear programming optimization technique is used this algorithm is capable of covering the 3d region by checking certain spots in the pipe to identify any irregularities or unwanted materials simulations and experiments using the prototype robot were carried out to observe the performance of the algorithm x li et al 2012 the review of the biomimetic in pipe inspection robotic system is summarized in table 5 8 conclusion the review on the modeling of in pipe inspection robotic system is provided in this paper the literature survey includes the description of modeling of the fluid driven robot wheeled robot screw drive type robot and inchworm like robot the main contribution of this paper is the highlight of mathematical modeling in the implementation of the in pipe inspection robotic system from previous studies that had been done thus in order to fulfill the current gap a comprehensive review elucidates the mathematical models proposed by some researchers to solve the problems of in pipe inspection robots based on the review it can be concluded that a the in pipe robot moved by fluid or gas pressures can be modeled to move through and inspect a straight and curved pipe primary studies have shown that the system is assumed to move inside the ideal gas and the gas flows in a single phase inside the pipe in order to model the system that maneuvers inside bend pipes three equations models are used to ensure the stability and controllability of the robotic system furthermore this technique is also not suitable to be used with certain controllers that require several switching during a motion most of the techniques used to model the fluid driven system are based on the newtonian method and the verification that uses different techniques is considerably scarce computational fluid dynamics cfd and finite element analysis fea that are utilized in certain research such as pradhan et al 2017 x tian et al 2013 only focused on analysing the underflow behavior of the system and these techniques are not suitable to identify an accurate model of the system b research for the in pipe robotic system that employs a wheel mobile platform commonly uses newtonian and kinematic modeling techniques to show the equation of motion the system normally uses a wheel to drive the system and several studies indicate that the trackwheel powered by the geared motor is superior to a normal wheeled drive some research uses adaptive mechanisms like a sliding mechanism to expand and retract in order to adapt to a variety of size changes of a pipe these mechanisms use either two adaptive mechanisms or adaptive mechanism with three linkages located at 120 apart however based on the review there are no concrete findings of the general transfer function from the mathematical model that can be identified in order to be applied with the controller technique c screw drive and helical type in pipe robotic systems are considered effective for maneuvering inside the pipes most of the research studies reviewed that are related to the screw drive and helical in pipe robots can be divided into three categories i snake and hyper redundant robotic manipulator ii modular robot connected with either the helical springs or helical drive using a timing belt and iii screw drive in pipe system for the snake and hyper redundant in pipe robotic system the lagrangian and denavitt hartenberg dh approaches are used to visualize the motion besides that a hyperbolic function is used as a trajectory of the system to enable its movement in a helical motion for the helical system that is connected with springs the criteria emphasized by most researchers are the spring models and stiffness moreover the analyses involving kinematics dynamics and geometry are carried out to explain the behavior of the screw drive type in pipe robotic system d for the caterpillar and inchworm in pipe robotic systems previous research focused on the gait and locomotion of the system and less attention has been given to developing models that can be tested with robust controllers besides the caterpillar and inchworm in type robotic system can only be used for small pipes and not robust enough for large and different pipe diameters in addition another issue for the system is that the caterpillar and inchworm in pipe robotic systems can only work in limited pipe lengths and they are not suitable for industrial pipelines e based on the previous points the screw drive type and wheeled in pipe robotic systems are eminent to be used in conducting in pipe inspection however most of the robotic systems studied only cater to certain areas like the fact that the modeling of a straight motion is not combined with the modeling of motion inside the bend section another research gap is the ability of the in pipe robotic system to switch movements from inside a straight pipe to a bend pipe there is also no correlation between the mathematical models on an adaptive mechanism for the in pipe straight and curve motions thus these gaps are potential topics of investigation on improving the in pipe inspection robotic system further declaration of competing interests

21919,the in pipe inspection robotic system is crucial in examining the inside of a pipe without compromising its structural safety the in pipe inspection robotic system is a promising alternative to conventional methods of x ray inspection and visual inspection despite the ongoing investigation the effectiveness of the in pipe inspection robotic system particularly regarding the mathematical modeling of the system design still needs to be improved the in pipe inspection robot which is normally equipped with a camera or non destructive testing ndt equipment moves inside the pipeline to conduct a pipe integrity assessment the main problem during an inspection is the restricted maneuverability of the robot due to geometric changes in the pipe this can be overcome by designing a proper mathematical model to develop an effective inspection robotic system therefore this paper provides a systematic review of different modeling types of the in pipe inspection robotic systems including the assessment of the kinematic and dynamic mathematical models for the system this review paper covers in pipe inspection robotic systems with several driving mechanisms such as fluid driven wheeled mobile drive wmd screw or helical drive legged and biomimetic drives keywords in pipe inspection robot kinematic dynamic modeling review 1 introduction varieties of the in pipe inspection robots have been developed over the past decades to examine built up deposits waxes or any cracks throughout a pipeline tur and garthwaite 2010 chattopadhyay et al 2018 the in pipe inspection robotic system can be operated in oil and gas pipelines water pipelines sewerage system or any piping systems that require specific inspection research on the in pipe inspection has been intensified over the years for instance leary et al 2004 focused on the unpiggable pipeline by integrating a highly agile robotic platform and an ndt sensor deng et al 2004 examined the method of attaching an ndt system which was an x ray real time imaging inspection technique rtiit on their robotic platform to locate and inspect welding conditions in the pipeline jin et al 2004 yuan et al 2009 and karkoub et al 2017 used a magnetic flux leakage mfl sensor attached to a robot to detect internal defects of the pipe fig 1 exhibits the components of an mfl in pipe inspection robot that was created by jin et al 2004 utilization of the in pipe inspection robot has led to new challenges regarding robot functionality this includes the propelling mechanism of the robot which can be either self propelled or assisted by a medium and the degree of adaptability with variations in the pipe diameter consequently new solutions in regard to the in pipe inspection robotic systems are constantly sought after a large number of research studies involve conducting experiments of the in pipe inspection robot such as those performed by sanemori and okada 1985 niewels and jorden 1994 hirose 1999 qian et al 2000 roh et al 2009 despite considerable effort to conduct in pipe inspection through real time experiments or on site studies weaknesses of these methods can still be detected several in pipe inspection robots in the previous research had difficulties maneuvering inside a pipe with different diameters curves or bends and t joints the robots were regularly found stuck during the operation as reported by o donoghue 2003 fung et al 2006 ferreira lino et al 2006 and terenzi 2012 hence it is crucial to have a proper mathematical model to improve the maneuverability of the robot and to analyze its movement before the system can be developed and tested in real time according to yan et al 2018 jiang et al 2014 nayak and pradhan 2014 liang l et al 2013 the weaknesses of the in pipe inspection robotic system can be overcome by improving the system design steerability inside the pipe adaptability to various pipe sizes and shapes flexibility of the body stability and motion efficiency fig 2 illustrates the system designed by an and moghaddam 2015 using software applications solidworks and visual nastran the system was simulated to move inside the pipes of 100 200 mm in diameter and elbows of 150 200 mm in diameter it is argued that with the focus on the system design the improved robotic system can ensure pipes with complex geometries can be thoroughly inspected yan et al 2018 qi et al 2018 other than that the improved system design can also reduce the risk of potential hazards especially regarding underground gas and sewerage pipelines in the event of a system breakdown or failure khan 2017 nagase et al 2018 minder 2018 a review on the previous in pipe inspection robotic systems was done by several groups of researchers such as ismail et al 2012 roslin et al 2012 ismail et al 2012 assessed several in pipe inspection robot designs from 1994 to 2010 the system that was created by duan et al 2012 moved inside a pipe and was autonomously powered by lithium batteries and mobile gear arms fig 3 shows an example of the crawler system designed and developed by nagase et al 2018 roslin et al 2012 reviewed several papers related to the hybrid locomotion of the in pipe robotic system that was published from 1994 to 2012 the hybrid inspection robot is the assimilation of two or more locomotions for instance a wheeled robot combined with screw type locomotion to create a wheel wall press screw drive type inspection robot however their review only covered the design of the hybrid locomotion robot but there was no review on modeling and controller designs shukla and karki 2016 published a review on the applications of the inspection robotic system in the on shore oil and gas industry they categorized the designs of the in pipe inspection robotic system according to shapes and sizes steering mechanisms propelling mechanisms detection technology and control mechanisms shao et al 2015 classified and tabulated the performance criteria of several in pipe inspection robots they analyzed eight papers to solve the problems of variable pipe diameters vertical layouts complicated inner geometries and mini pipe issues furthermore a review of inspection technologies involving the conditions of the water pipeline was published by liu and kleiner 2013 they categorized the water pipe inspection according to various methods including visual testing electromagnetic acoustic ultrasound radiographic and thermography there are various research studies related to the designs of the in pipe inspection robotic system and experimental work on hollow pipes however the review on the modeling of the in pipe inspection robotic system is inadequate therefore the aim of this paper is to provide an extensive review of the current approaches in the modeling of the in pipe inspection robotic system technology to the best of the authors knowledge there is no comprehensive literature about the subject as yet this paper is organized as follows the section following this introduction is devoted to the classification of the pipe inspection robotic system special emphasis is placed on the classification of the outer pipe robots and the in pipe robots and their locomotions the modeling of the in pipe robotic systems are arranged as follows the robot driven by fluid the wheel mobile drive wmd type robot the screw drive or helical drive type robot the legged and biomimetic insect type robot such as snake inchworm and caterpillar type robots the conclusion section concludes the review by emphasizing the limitation of each model and research gaps that can be further explored this review consolidates and organizes these topics in a manner that will allow for more optimized in pipe inspection robotics system to be developed later understanding the following topics in detail allows for the optimal and robust controllers to be discussed in the future 2 classification of the pipe inspection robot the pipe inspection robotic systems can be roughly classified into outer pipe and in pipe inspection robotic systems the outer pipe inspection robotic system is desired in the industry due to its ability to perform the outer pipe inspection without interrupting plant operations this inspection robot clamps to the outer wall and is able to move along the pipe overcoming bends and junctions autonomously or semi autonomously mirats tur and garthwaite 2010 conversely the outer pipe inspection robotic system cannot inspect the inner pipe wall rigorously as opposed to the in pipe robotic system the outer pipe inspection robots have been discussed in several research studies park et al 2002 fukuda et al 1987 chatzakos et al 2006 nagaya et al 2012 han et al 2013 singh and ananthasuresh 2013 imajo et al 2015 the movement of the outer pipe inspection robotic system is governed by two gripper arms sliding joints on the body and sensors to detect obstacles fukuda et al 1987 fig 4 exhibits the outer pipe inspection robot clamping to the pipe during an inspection and its movement is remotely controlled han et al 2013 in contrast the in pipe inspection robotic system inspects the inner pipeline this enables an in depth overview of internal corrosion of the pipe sludge built up and any problems related to the pipe furthermore the use of the in pipe inspection robotic system is beneficial when the pipes are buried underground ghavamian et al 2018 nevertheless there are still challenges in system development and inspection particularly when pipe layouts are unspecified the ability to specify pipe layouts will allow the in pipe inspection robotic system to adapt and reconfigure in completing the inspection process more efficiently the in pipe inspection robots can be classified into a few categories including pipe inspection gauge pig robot wheeled mobile drive wmd robot screw drive or helical drive robot legged robot and biomimetic robot actuated robot examples of the biomimetic robots include those inspired by snake inchworm and caterpillar fig 5 shows the elements of classification for this system mills et al 2017 3 modeling of fluid driven in pipe inspection robotic system the fluid driven in pipe inspection robotic system is driven by the compressed conveyance fluid the difference in fluid pressures at the back and the front of the robot propels it forward the velocity of the propelled robot can be adjusted using flexible sealing elements and support on the robot s body karl dawson 2011 the fluid driven in pipe robotic system requires a proper tracking method to avoid the system from being stalled inside the pipe since the fluid driven robotic system is considered as an untethered system an external monitoring system should be attached to the pipe for the signaling purpose in identifying the robot s movement inside the pipe during an inspection in a study by nguyen and kim 2001 a pipeline inspection gauge pig was modeled in a horizontal line their research analyzed the gas velocity the position of pig and its velocity in the pipe the pig was driven by an unsteady flow of gas with the assumption that the gas is in an ideal state and in a single phase in order to analyze the pig s movement the authors used the method of characteristics moc to solve nonlinear equations for which the initial and boundary conditions were set in a rectangular grid the initial conditions of the upstream and downstream flows were then solved using the range kutta method the pressure was found from the flow rate at the pipe s inlet and outlet while the flow velocity was found from the pressure boundary condition this research focused on the interpolation and range kutta methods to solve the dynamic behavior of the pig as it moved in a straight line fig 6 illustrates the boundary condition of the pig inside the grid nguyen and kim 2001 in another study nguyen et al 2001 modeled the fluid driven pig in the 90 curved pipeline they divided the system modeling into two categories namely the flow equation modeling of gas in the pipe and dynamic modeling of the pig for these modeling techniques the ideal gas and single phase flow properties were applied other assumptions included a uniform pipe diameter induced friction from the pipe wall and the quasi steady heat in the flow they argued that the suitable velocity for the pig to move in the pipeline without posing any risk is from 1 to 5 ms 1 for the stream liquid and from 2 to 7 ms 1 for the stream gas the movement of the pig inside the pipe is driven by the pressure differences between the downstream and upstream flows the dynamic model of the pig for the curved pipe was created in three sections namely section 1 where the pig entered the curve section 2 where the pig was in the middle of the curve and section 3 where the pig comes out of the curve the head and tail of the pig are connected via the length l and the masses of its head and tail are indicated by m1 and m2 respectively the assumptions stated previously were used because most of the information for in pipe inspection or pigging pipeline is acquired from experiments fig 7 shows the pig flows inside the bend pipe while fig 8 shows the pig in three sections namely section i which is at the entrance of the pipe section ii which is at the middle of the elbow pipe and section iii which is at the exit of the pipe nguyen et al 2001 the general derivation of the equation used by nguyen et al 2001 is represented as equation 1 however there were no stability and controllability analyses conducted in this research 1 d d t k α k α p α f where k kinetic energy p potential energy in the study by hu and appleton 2005 a mathematical model for the bidirectional pipeline inspection gauge pig using the newtonian method was derived and verified using an experimental study two tests were carried out by moving the pig downstream and upstream as shown in fig 9 a for the bidirectional pig and in fig 9 b for a simple pig prototype two forces of the fluid are f t which is the force that drives the turbine to rotate and f f which is the push force in the axial direction if the propulsion force exerted on the nut at the pig is higher than the total resistance force which is the summation of frictional force and drag force the nut will move and accelerate hu and appleton 2005 then the generated torque will decrease because of the speed of the turbine increases dynamic equations for the system are shown as equations 2 4 equations 2 and 3 show a balanced equation for the torque acting on the turbine t f is the torque generated by the fluid force t b is the reaction of the torque generated by the nut and f b is the reaction force generated by the nut or pig as it moves downstream 2 t f i d

h a p e the speed of the pig pushed by the gas inside the pipeline can be controlled using a butterfly bypass valve located on the pig s body the valve controls the opening and closing of the hole in order to regulate pressures at the body deng et al 2011 furthermore a mathematical model of the pig s speed regulation using a throttle valve was also created by this group of researchers in addition wei et al 2012 modeled an extremely low frequency elf electromagnetic fields in pipelines to locate the position of the in pipe inspection robot the electromagnetic transmitter and receiver were designed and a mathematical model which is a linear equation with six unknown numbers and three algorithms were formulated according to archila and becker 2013 a few considerations should be made before a robot can be launched inside a pipeline these considerations include the pipeline properties fluid properties operation pressure and physical limitations of the robot the difference finite method is adopted to simulate the behavior of the robot with fluid inside the pipeline modeling of the fluid driven in pipe robot was extensively studied by l liang et al 2013 where an inner and outer spiral mobile robot was propelled by a higher pressure at the back of the robot computational fluid dynamics cfd was used to calculate the flow field of the liquid inside the pipe the robot s axial force increases when the pressure and concentrated liquid with high velocity pushes the outer shell of the robot the authors also emphasized that the relationship between the axial force is relative to the liquid density viscosity and eccentricity the axial force is directly proportional to the density viscosity and eccentricity of the fluid and it is inversely proportional to the diameter of the pipe a study conducted by l liang et al 2013 was then supported by liang et al 2014 who modeled a dynamic model of microrobot driven by a turbulent fluid a similar cfd method was adopted to solve the environmental and operating parameters furthermore an orthogonal optimization experiment was used to acquire the optimal inner spiral structural parameter of the robot in a paper written by mirshamsi and rafeeyan 2015 a similar method as nguyen et al 2001 particularly to show two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d derivations were used they also used newton s second law along with the force in tangential and normal directions fig 10 shows a diagram of the modeling using the newtonian method by mirshamsi and rafeeyan 2015 by using the newtonian method the 2d and 3d derivations of the pig movement in the normal and tangential directions can be illustrated equations 5 and 6 show the newtonian equation for the pig s movement while equations 7 9 show the velocity of the system tangential

as an infinitesimal piece in the radial component df then df can be expressed in terms of the gravitational force using vertical components dg fig 11 shows the bidirectional pig in a pipeline established by zhu et al 2015 based on the findings of this research no significant model can be formulated because the system is only related to the force acting on the boundary of the pipe they only focused on the contact force due to the pressure exerted on the pig material properties for the disc the effect of the disc to the contact force among others most of the numerical simulations were carried out using ansys software table 1 shows the summary of the in pipe inspection robotic systems driven by fluid 4 modeling of the wheel mobile drive wmd in pipe inspection robotic system the wheeled mobile drive wmd in pipe inspection robotic system mainly consists of two parts a driving module and a mechanism to press the wheels to the pipe wall in order to generate propulsion force mirats tur and garthwaite 2010 the wheels can be on a horizontal plane and pressed to the pipe wall by adjusting the robot s wheel arm okada and kanade 1987 y zhang and yan 2007 however the mobile robot tends to slip as it maneuvers inside the pipe due to the insufficient grip on the wall according to y zhang and yan 2007 this limitation can be overcome by using an in pipe robot with wheels based on a multi axis differential mechanism finite element analysis fea was carried out by hong and yang 2011 to analyze the model based on a three adaptive symmetrical axis in pipe inspection robot an analysis is required to ensure high maneuverability of the robot in geometrically complex structures such as the pipe elbows either in a simulation or real time study the variable parameter for the adaptive system can be solved using a parallelogram and nut slider which utilizes two differential axles and one following axle pradhan et al 2017 used an fea software program ansys to find the driving torque required for the motor of the robot to overcome drag due to fluid viscosity and speed in other research studies l liang et al 2013 liang et al 2015 the robot movement was analyzed using a computational fluid dynamics cfd software program fluent the robot that was studied has four spiral tails and can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise in a study by kwon et al 2011 which employed both simulation and experimental work an inspection robot driven by a wheel chain connected to a mechanical linkage clutch was initially modeled using a kinematic method there were two cases studied by kwon et al 2011 in assessing the model as shown in fig 12 a fig 12 b and fig12 c the model assessment was based on the movement of the in pipe robotic system inside the straight pipeline and the bend section of the pipe the linear and angular velocity of the system during a rotational movement in a straight line are represented by equation 10 and equation 11 respectively while those of the rotational movement inside a bend section is represented by equation 12 and equation 13 case 1 linear velocity for rotational motion inside a straight pipeline 10 v c cos θ v c where v c linear velocity at the center of the robot θ steering angle c center of the robot the steering angle for straight line movement should be positive the rotational velocity of the robot along the z axis 11 ω z

θ v c angular velocity for turning movement inside a straight pipeline 13 ω x v l l r even though the in pipe inspection robotic system discussed by kwon et al 2011 can move inside both the straight and bend section of the pipe the system does not grip to the pipe wall a system proposed by s jiang et al 2009 and s y jiang et al 2008 has an elastic legged wheel which acts as an adaptable mechanism to maintain traction on the pipe wall the adaptable mechanism consists of wheels on the three slider crank mechanisms located at 120 apart in the circumferential direction the pre tightened spring parallelogram mechanisms and timing belt mechanisms fig 13 a shows the configuration of the system and the components of the tri axial differential mechanism fig 13 b displays the drive wheels located at 120 which presses on the pipe wall using a slider crank with pre tightened springs their research was supported by kim et al 2013 that used the multi axial differential gear mechanism wall press mechanism and a motor to drive the system the modeling of the system was focused on the angular velocity for each gear based on the principle of superposition and linear velocity for every wheel the system is driven by a microcontroller and has no state space model for controller manipulation kim et al 2013 the research studies of hong and yang 2011 and shi and tang 2012 used a 3d modeling method in examining the behaviour of an in pipe robot with a tri axial differential mechanism using an equation of momentum transfer the authors stated that without this tri axial gearing system the locomotion interference would exist on the traction device the research by sibai et al 2012 suggested that several equations are required in calculating a suitable robotic platform and components before an actual prototype can be constructed after conducting rigorous calculations a robotic platform having a total mass of 7 5 kg was developed the platform is equipped with three motors each of which drives two wheels interestingly it has the ability to move inside a pipe with a diameter of between 12 and 16 inches unfortunately however there is no information about the movement modeling and controller shown in their work another study by damic et al 2014 modeled the dynamics of a multibody system using the object oriented technique this technique uses a bond graph and two way interprocess communication ipc pipe where the information from the targeted place will be returned to the system as a 3d image the information will then be processed before the next instruction is given by the system to proceed with the execution of the next algorithm martínez garcía et al 2014 employed a non linear algebraic solution to control the robot s trajectory planning to support the author s observation a half cell electrochemical which uses the nernst equation as an algorithm for automatic searching and problem detecting in pipelines was utilized the nernst algorithm estimates the distance between the mobile robotic system and targeted pipeline flaws based on theoretical empirical nonlinear regression then the gradient based field from the volumetric derivatives is used to control the motion of the wheeled robot the algebraic calculation determines the non linear trajectory by controlling the speed of the wheeled mobile robot to the targeted flaws since the robot poses a non holonomic kinematic constraint it can then be integrated into the general potential equation the nernst equation of the system is shown in equation 14 the forward kinematic equation is represented as equation 15 while the body diagram for the system is shown in fig 14 nernst equation for the system 14 e t e 0 κ t e t f ln a a x a r e d where e t electrode potential at instantaneous

model from a mechanical design with either a straight pipe or an elbow pipe the mathematical model discussed in their study also utilized the newtonian method the analysis was accomplished and the equation includes a few criteria such as i sliding and overturning in a straight pipe movement and ii swivel motion and stability analysis in an elbow movement the force and moment of the system s movement in straight and elbow pipes are defined with respect to the 3d axis labeled x lengthwise direction of the pipe y span wise direction of the pipe and z vertical direction motion stability in different pipe diameters was experimentally tested and the results from the experiment were linked to the mathematical model developed fig 15 shows the robot with a sliding mechanism to adapt to the diameter of the pipe and track wheel this system is introduced to create grip and reduce slip hazards as the robot moves inside the pipe the coordinate system for the robot in the elbow and straight motion are shown in equation 16 and equation 17 respectively moreover fig 16 shows the world coordinate system which is set as the center of the elbow curvature 16 r λ φ r 0 5 d cos φ cos λ r 0 5 d cos φ sin λ 0 5 d sin λ where r coordinates of any point in the elbow λ angle of the radius of the curvature φ posture angle of the robot r radius of curvature d diameter of the pipe in straight motion coordinate for the system is 17 x r 2 z 2 d 2 4 another finding showed that an unknown layout and information about an in pipe inspection robotic system could be deciphered using a reconstructed image obtained from the projection of laser rays to the wall of the pipe the image acquired from the laser projection could be solved using a scheme called the active stereo omni direction vision sensor asodvs tang et al 2017 in addition zhang et al 2017 used the kinematic modeling method to analyze the location and direction of the robot in a pipe elbow in order to derive the kinematic model a displacement of the center of the driving wheel is linked to the steering angle and this is formulated as a function of the derivatives of displacement between the driving wheels and steering angle they attempted to prove the kinematic model of the system by comparing the theoretical equation with the simulation that was conducted the results obtained from the kinematic modeling and mechanical analysis supported the findings of luo et al 2017 that used different pipe diameters by changing the speed and driving force of the piston located inside the robot furthermore research by gravalos et al 2017 solved the problem of underground soil water monitoring in their study a wheeled mobile robot which was modeled to move around bend sections was employed two articulated movable platform robots were attached to a soil moisture sensor an extension rod was used to inspect the turning radius of the wheeled mobile robot inside the curved pipe in addition the vibration of the electromechanical device at a higher speed was also investigated further research about traction and interference that troubled the in pipe inspection robotic system was further elaborated by zheng et al 2018a b the robot which consisted of four components namely differential mechanism travel drive mechanism pre tightening mechanism and auxiliary support mechanism was connected via a modular platform zheng et al 2018a b proposed a solution to this problem by ensuring that the system is able to go through irregular pipes with changing diameters a tracked type in pipe inspection robot with an adjustable drive system was proposed by ciszewski et al 2014 to be used for pipe inspection and hole drilling operation on flat and curved surfaces the robot is equipped with a vision system

type in pipe inspection robotic system the screw drive type in pipe inspection robot is composed of a few components i e rotator elastic arms to support the body motor and wheels to drive the system the wheels are inclined at a certain angle to ensure the robot moves like a screw inside the pipe p li et al 2016 fig 18 shows the concept of the screw drive type in pipe inspection robotic system

angle of the wheels qingyou et al 2013 modeled a modular helical motion based on conic springs analysis of the traction was carried out for three types of motions which depended on the load i e small medium or heavy that the robot needed to carry the robot utilizes the synchronized motion for a small load but it performs inchworm and rigid motions for medium and heavy loads respectively in order to support the research conducted by qingyou et al 2013 chen et al 2014 asserted that unstable traction of the helical drive robot could be settled by adding a timing belt to synchronize wheel rotations which would otherwise be prompted independently this is supported by liu et al 2014 who investigated both active and passive helical drive in pipe robotic systems the problem related to the passive helical drive robot was caused by low traction and lower mechanical force transmission they modeled their system using kinematics and mechanics modeling for designing a control system they found that the active helical drive in pipe robot has better traction compared to the passive helical drive further research on the screw drive type in pipe inspection robotic system focusing on spring stiffness was conducted by kakogawa and ma 2012 the kinematic analysis of the screw drive mechanism is needed due to the inability of one degree of freedom in pipe robots to pass through curved pipe sections based on the analysis they concluded that there is a relationship between spring stiffness length of the robot torque of the motor and static friction on the inner pipe wall in addition they found an optimal spring stiffness for the robot to move along the curved section of the pipe and climb up a vertical pipe in addition li et al 2014 established an energy optimization technique to the screw drive in pipe robot equipped with an inclined angle adjustable roller based on this research energy can be optimized by conducting dynamic and model analysis a similar study was conducted by liu and li 2015 where special well tracks were used in the oil and gas exploration however the development of the wells needs to consider the risk of casualties especially to transport tools and equipment downhole to overcome this a system with higher tractive forces was designed and modeled the geometric calculation and mechanical analysis were used to identify suitable parameters for the helical drive in pipe robotic system the involvement of a robot in spraying the inner pipe wall was elaborated by chen et al 2015 the platform was modeled using a geometric method while the manipulator was modeled based on denavitt hartenberg dh the initial position of the robot was determined using a laser tracker then the robot was aligned with the pipe while the coincidence of the spray gun with the axis of the pipeline was calculated using an inverse method tian and zhang 2016 further elaborated on the mechanics of a robot in conducting an inner pipe spray among the plausible explanation for this finding is that the stability and contact of the robot movement relative to the inner pipe can be expressed as a matrix and differential algebraic equations to support the research findings of liu et al 2014a b c and li et al 2015 zheng et al 2018a b used three dimensional modeling to model a spiral or screw drive motion of an in pipe inspection robot the robot was employed to overcome motion interference when the pipe robot passing through an elbow hence the system was designed and modeled with adaptable pipe changes the in pipe inspection robotic system was modeled as a system with three components a driving mechanism a holding mechanism and an elastic mechanism the researchers created a formula for maximum size and length of the robot as it moved inside a straight pipe and elbow the motion of the system was explained as a linear motion with velocity v as the product of the wheel s angular velocity and radius of the wheel and the instantaneous radius r is a combination of the curvature for three wheels r p is the radius of the wall and the equation of the instantaneous radius is given in equation 25 to equation 27 fig 19 shows the geometric relationship between the instantaneous radius of the curvature for the robot s wheel linear velocity is given by 25 v i ω i r w where v i wheel speed ω i wheel angle speed r w radius of the driving wheel instantaneous radius is 26 r 1 r 2 r 3 3 r where r1 r2 r3 are instantaneous radius of curvature with respect to the center of the wheel 27 r 1 r r p r w sin φ r 2 r r p r w sin φ 120 o r 3 r r p r w sin φ 240 o where r p radius of elbow wall r w radius of driving wheel φ angle between the arm for drive wheel 1 and t t however the system in zheng et al 2018a b was only tested up to the simulation level and not experimentally verified even though a robot could pass through the elbow without any interference the robot was seen adaptable to various diameters and it was able to pass through the obstacle in another research study osman and kovačić 2017 investigated the screw drive type in pipe robotic system with adaptive legs this study described the mathematical modeling of the robot in terms of kinematic and dynamic screw drive principles the system consisted of two sections namely the driving section which comprised three legs and the driven section which comprised two ankles the actuator that drove the system was an electric motor with a planetary gearbox the torque generated was then transmitted to the legs and wheels of the robot the leg and wheel components were considered the driven section and these components need to be pressed to the pipe wall at all times a systematic study by zheng et al 2018a b which was supported by tourajizadeh et al 2018 solved the problem and limitation related to the screw drive type in pipe inspection robot that moved in a constant pitch rate a dynamic model of the screw drive type robot was derived and linearized around the operating point before linear quadratic controller lqr was applied to the robot system the kinematics and kinetics of the system were also derived in order to move forward the steering angle was used to handle pitch rate movement and avoid obstacles although this study was based on simulations using matlab and adams software the findings are essential to potential investigation on the in pipe inspection robot based on the studies reviewed in this section a summary regarding the screw drive and helical drive type in pipe inspection robotic systems is provided in table 3 6 modeling of legged type in pipe inspection robotic system the legged robot for in pipe inspection has many degrees of freedom enabling a wide range of motion nevertheless the robot will utilize more actuators and a complex control system to control its motion compared to a normal wheeled robot bekhit et al 2015 in the study by neubauer 1994 a legged type in pipe inspection robotic system mimicked the motion of a spider to climb vertical pipes for inner inspection the legs were pushed against the pipe wall during the climbing and five shapes of the pipes were used to test the climbing motion there were two control layers to accomplish the motion reflexive control layer and reactive control layer but they were not based on any mathematical models for further reference a system called moritz which was designed by zagler and pfeiffer 2003 had two joints for bending and another two joints for rotation the legs of the system were mounted on the front and rear body of the robot the rotation joints were used to separate the legs into two pairs and enable the robot to rotate around the longitudinal axis during its motion gait pattern sensor crawler controller and coordination were explained but without any mathematical modeling zagler and pfeiffer 2003 the in pipe robotic system moving in the crawling motion was modeled using the intelligent algorithm by qiao and shang 2012 in order to overcome the problem of maneuvering inside the elbow and u shaped pipes also an algorithm was used to determine radial variation in the pipe and the length of the elastic rear and front leg deformation using a matlab program han et al 2013 modeled two module collaboration robots for climbing and crawling inside six inches of a vertical pipeline the two modules were connected by an arm that was remotely controlled to make them flexible for climbing and moving on the pipe s surface next jatsun and malchikov 2014 illustrated several designs of the multi link in pipe inspection mobile robots that are capable of moving in a very tight space in the pipeline the robot s dynamic and motion control were mathematically modeled the numerical simulations and experimental tests showed that the robot demonstrated worm like properties in addition to the work done by han et al 2013 jatsun and malchikov 2014 on the crawling robot a five degrees of freedom 5dof crawling robot with double claws was kinematically modeled using the denavit hartenberg dh you et al 2015 the method was used to overcome the problems related to a multi pipeline environment three types of crawling motions which are crawling trajectory inside a straight pipe crawling between pipes and crawling between rows of pipes and joints the motion was based on the joint interpolation between the trajectories however the applicability of the findings might be limited due to the simulation mode of the study the information related to the legged in pipe inspection robotic system is summarized in table 4 7 modeling of biomimetic in pipe inspection robotic system snake type robot inchworm type robot caterpillar type robot the biomimetic mechanism is a semi autonomous or autonomous system that has the ability to operate in a complex environment the biomimetic mechanism can be designed and planned to be adaptable in unpredictable changes and perform multi functional tasks thus by using this biomimetic concept an in pipe inspection robotic system such as snake type robot inchworm type robot and caterpillar type robot can dramatically improve in pipe inspection enner et al 2013 modeled a snake robot that was able to move inside a straight pipe specifically by estimating the joint angles of the snake robot the robot s body moves along the center of the pipeline to estimate its diameter similarly in the case of the snake in pipe robotic system modeling jatsun et al 2014 designed and addressed the locomotion of the six linked mobile robot a mathematical model of the robot s movement in various modes especially the pipes with various parameters was also studied in addition a study by douadi et al 2014 highlighted the modeling of a snake robot on a planar surface the system consists of four active revolute joints and a passive revolute joint to solve a non holonomic kinematic constraint in the wheeled mobile robot singularities related to the robot can be solved by applying a higher number of dof and actuation input placed on the snake robot moreover hopkins and gupta 2014 modeled the snake in pipe robotic system using lagrangian dynamics for several joint modules indicated by n number of modules the equation of motion based on d h parameters on each module was acquired to visualize the pattern of motion for the snake robot one joint module was used to move the robot in the yaw motion while another was used to produce movements in the pitch direction the module movement was based on the sum of linear expansions from the parallel mechanisms fig 20 and fig 21 feature parallel mechanisms as mentioned in hopkins and gupta 2014 while the equations of the vector and coordinate system for the snake robot are shown as equation 28 equation 29 and equation 30 vector loop equation 28 o a o b b a fixed coordinate frame for the system in x and y 29 x a a 1 c θ 1 b 1 c θ 1 ψ 1 y a a 1 s θ 1 b 1 s θ 1 ψ 1 where a 1 length between point c and e c cosine θ 1 angle x axis at point o to pivot input link b 1 link s length between points a and b ψ 1 passive joint angle vector loop equation for expanding mechanism 30 o a o e e c c f f a the results from the research by qi et al 2017 were in correlation with those from the study by enner et al 2013 however this study focused on the helical motion of a hyper redundant in pipe robot to overcome a pipe branch the model of the system was accomplished by using a hyperbolic function to make a snake robot move in the wave curve the movement is established by changing the parameter of the hyperbolic function based on the formula of a continuous curve model the curvature and torsion curves are used to derive the joint angle of the snake robot the inchworm and caterpillar in pipe robotic systems share similar movement principles according to wang et al 2009 the gait movements for inchworm and caterpillar are relatively similar except that the caterpillar robot has longer joint modules fig 22 shows the caterpillar kinematics and its gait while fig 23 shows the inchworm kinematics model the caterpillar kinematics robot moves in the open chain closed chain open chain state while the kinematics for the inchworm is in an open chain state besides that a worm robot which was also named a flexible squirming robot was suggested by zhang et al 2013 the authors studied the structure of the guide head and brake wheels inside the pipeline apart from that traction control was analyzed using the mechanics of the robot inside the pipeline the motion stability of the flexible shaft is based on the instability theory where the flexible shaft of the system is unstable when the robot moves inside straight and curved pipelines furthermore l liu et al 2014a b c modeled an in pipe robotic system of microrobot type with an eccentric wheel for in pipe inspection the robot movement is based on the resonant principle and a micro engine is used to excite the eccentric wheel the authors solved the problem of the angular acceleration by making the wheel flexible at the contact point with the pipeline several tests were then carried out to assess the performance of the system using different diameters and different ramp angles to support the prior research by liu et al 2014a b c worm like locomotion using electromagnetic waves was proposed by sattarov and almaev 2017 to overcome the limitations faced by the current in pipe robot system to climb an inclined pipe the researchers modeled analyzed and simulated two elastic segments connected like a ring that was formed by two coupled electromagnetic actuators the actuator moves in the longitudinal and transverse motions to overcome friction liu et al 2014a b c used the optimization technique to plan a helical drive motion to be used by an inchworm in pipe robot the robot moves by extending and retracting the conic spring in a sinusoidal velocity pattern the pattern of movement can be optimized by applying a genetic algorithm ga to the system s movement in a study conducted by fortunić et al 2017 the problem concerning the robot s motion in a small and confined space was solved using a bristle based motion the modeling of the bristle based motion of the robot was verified using the simulation and experimental studies the result showed that this small and simple microrobot could move with high speed in translational and rotational motions according to yamamoto et al 2018 the current inchworm locomotion faces difficulties when moving inside narrow pipelines thus they proposed a pneumatic hollow shaft with a longer stroke to ensure that the system can roll like an inchworm at a higher speed two models were assessed in terms of their movement patterns by comparing single and double drive patterns based on the comparison it was discovered that the single drive model performed better compared to the double drive model when they were on the horizontal vertical and bend pipes with a diameter of 53 mm furthermore a single drive inchworm pneumatic based model could move horizontally with an average speed of 100 mm s and at the speed of 40 mm s when climbing a vertical pipe with an almost 90 angle yamamoto et al 2018 supported their previous research yamamoto et al 2015 on the pneumatic mechanism with high speed locomotion it was found that the forward motion was generated from a combination of the holding forces produced by an expansion of mechanism to the pipe wall and the impellent forces on the other hand adams et al 2018 conducted a water utility pipe inspection using a soft inflatable actuator the behavior of the inflatable actuator mimicked the motion of an inchworm robot and its mathematical model was computed to observe its motion inside the space provided the data on the forces and displacement were acquired through an experimental study the creation of a flexible robot to move inside a pipe was initially proposed by fei et al 2014 in a study of the marine in pipe robotic system based on a metamorphic mechanism the flexible marine in pipe robot was modeled using adams software and its kinematics was also analyzed the system was able to pass through various pipe diameters and obstacles with the addition of a spring in addition wu et al 2015 derived mathematical modeling of an in pipe swimming robot by comparing with the previous crawling robot which normally had difficulty maneuvering in a limited and narrow pipe the in pipe swimming robot can however move freely and easily inside the pipe the previous findings on the parameters of the robot explained that the pipe size and robot geometry play a vital role in the mathematical model developed kim et al 2015 also faced a similar problem to model a flexible in pipe robot that can be used to mine manganese nodules the non linearity and correlation between the vessel a vertical lifting pipe a lifting pump an intermediate buffer station a flexible pipe and a self propelled mining robot are all contributed to dynamics analysis it required a considerably longer time to be created and needed higher specifications of a computer system thus to solve this issue kim et al 2015 proposed that the equation of motion should be separated into two subsystems known as the vessel lifting pipe and the flexible pipe mining robot subsystem kwon and yi 2012 designed and exploited a motion algorithm for the caterpillar in pipe robot with a loaded spring to expand and grip the pipe wall the kinematic analysis was applied to the 4 bar mechanisms at the wheels also a new motion planning for a reconfigurable system was applied using two connected springs between the two robot s modules the consistency between these two modules was analyzed in order to optimize the motion at any complex junctions in another study in solving the problem of the complex junction and mapping of 3d in pipe inspection an algorithm named as the hierarchical integer linear programming optimization technique is used this algorithm is capable of covering the 3d region by checking certain spots in the pipe to identify any irregularities or unwanted materials simulations and experiments using the prototype robot were carried out to observe the performance of the algorithm x li et al 2012 the review of the biomimetic in pipe inspection robotic system is summarized in table 5 8 conclusion the review on the modeling of in pipe inspection robotic system is provided in this paper the literature survey includes the description of modeling of the fluid driven robot wheeled robot screw drive type robot and inchworm like robot the main contribution of this paper is the highlight of mathematical modeling in the implementation of the in pipe inspection robotic system from previous studies that had been done thus in order to fulfill the current gap a comprehensive review elucidates the mathematical models proposed by some researchers to solve the problems of in pipe inspection robots based on the review it can be concluded that a the in pipe robot moved by fluid or gas pressures can be modeled to move through and inspect a straight and curved pipe primary studies have shown that the system is assumed to move inside the ideal gas and the gas flows in a single phase inside the pipe in order to model the system that maneuvers inside bend pipes three equations models are used to ensure the stability and controllability of the robotic system furthermore this technique is also not suitable to be used with certain controllers that require several switching during a motion most of the techniques used to model the fluid driven system are based on the newtonian method and the verification that uses different techniques is considerably scarce computational fluid dynamics cfd and finite element analysis fea that are utilized in certain research such as pradhan et al 2017 x tian et al 2013 only focused on analysing the underflow behavior of the system and these techniques are not suitable to identify an accurate model of the system b research for the in pipe robotic system that employs a wheel mobile platform commonly uses newtonian and kinematic modeling techniques to show the equation of motion the system normally uses a wheel to drive the system and several studies indicate that the trackwheel powered by the geared motor is superior to a normal wheeled drive some research uses adaptive mechanisms like a sliding mechanism to expand and retract in order to adapt to a variety of size changes of a pipe these mechanisms use either two adaptive mechanisms or adaptive mechanism with three linkages located at 120 apart however based on the review there are no concrete findings of the general transfer function from the mathematical model that can be identified in order to be applied with the controller technique c screw drive and helical type in pipe robotic systems are considered effective for maneuvering inside the pipes most of the research studies reviewed that are related to the screw drive and helical in pipe robots can be divided into three categories i snake and hyper redundant robotic manipulator ii modular robot connected with either the helical springs or helical drive using a timing belt and iii screw drive in pipe system for the snake and hyper redundant in pipe robotic system the lagrangian and denavitt hartenberg dh approaches are used to visualize the motion besides that a hyperbolic function is used as a trajectory of the system to enable its movement in a helical motion for the helical system that is connected with springs the criteria emphasized by most researchers are the spring models and stiffness moreover the analyses involving kinematics dynamics and geometry are carried out to explain the behavior of the screw drive type in pipe robotic system d for the caterpillar and inchworm in pipe robotic systems previous research focused on the gait and locomotion of the system and less attention has been given to developing models that can be tested with robust controllers besides the caterpillar and inchworm in type robotic system can only be used for small pipes and not robust enough for large and different pipe diameters in addition another issue for the system is that the caterpillar and inchworm in pipe robotic systems can only work in limited pipe lengths and they are not suitable for industrial pipelines e based on the previous points the screw drive type and wheeled in pipe robotic systems are eminent to be used in conducting in pipe inspection however most of the robotic systems studied only cater to certain areas like the fact that the modeling of a straight motion is not combined with the modeling of motion inside the bend section another research gap is the ability of the in pipe robotic system to switch movements from inside a straight pipe to a bend pipe there is also no correlation between the mathematical models on an adaptive mechanism for the in pipe straight and curve motions thus these gaps are potential topics of investigation on improving the in pipe inspection robotic system further declaration of competing interests
