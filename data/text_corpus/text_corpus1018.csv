5090,the spatial characteristics of droughts are important for understanding drought development and water resource allocation most previous studies mainly focus on the spatial display of drought characteristics and the identification of drought spatial extents little attention is given to measuring the spatial extent of drought at any location to this end a new framework was proposed for measuring the spatial areal extent of drought based on spatial autocorrelation and anisotropy principle the global precipitation climatology centre monthly gridded precipitation data with a spatial resolution of 25 km 25 km were used the standardized precipitation index on a three month scale spi 3 was applied to characterize meteorological droughts the base period of 1961 2010 50 years was selected for calculating climatology lengths cls spatial extents spes of meteorological droughts over the poyang lake basin the parameters of the proposed method including the drought threshold spi 1 the number of search directions 8 search radius 500 km distance step 25 km bandwidth 56 95 km and angle tolerance 22 5 were examined using sensitivity tests the results showed that notable differences in cls of 8 search directions confirmed the spatial anisotropy of droughts the statistics of spes of the spi 3 series over the basin were reported spes were mainly between 50 and 100 104 km2 the distinctive spatial pattern of the spes was revealed and characterized by a high value belt from the northeast and southwest and two low value areas the spi on other time scales spi 1 spi 6 spi 12 revealed similar characteristics as spi 3 moreover spes are potentially associated with time scales revealing a decreasing change or increasing spatial fragmentation as time scales increased the proposed method based on anisotropy is reasonable and useful for mining the spatial characteristics of droughts and can be applied in other fields keywords precipitation standardized precipitation index spatial anisotropy climatology length spatial extent meteorological drought 1 introduction drought is one of the most extreme hydroclimatic hazards characterized by slow development and an undetectable initial process and has major impacts on society environment and economy in many parts of the world kallis 2008 according to the emergency events database em dat in 2015 greater than 50 million people worldwide were affected by droughts accounting for greater than 50 of the total number of people affected by natural disasters in the entire year https www emdat be index php approximately 24 serious drought events killed approximately 3000 people and resulted greater than 230 billion in economic losses in 1980 2017 in the usa https www ncdc noaa gov billions the estimated loss resulting from droughts in a sustainable development pathway at the 1 5 c warming level is approximately three fold increased relative to the 2006 2015 interval in china and the losses are more serious for the 2 0 c warming level su et al 2018 under global warming increasing droughts have been observed in many parts of the world which has raised concerns about future droughts dai 2011 spinoni et al 2014 ipcc 2014 touma et al 2015 wang et al 2019 thus exploring drought characteristics is significant for improving the level of drought monitoring and alleviating the effects of drought the temporal and spatial characteristics of droughts are the basis and precondition for understanding drought development and its impacts currently the characteristics of droughts in space dimensions have attracted more attention in the recent decade compared to that in the time dimension e g frequency severity duration trend and period herrera estrada et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 taking a depth area duration analysis method widely used to characterize precipitation extremes as a reference andreadis et al 2005 constructed a series of severity area duration sad curves to relate the areal extent of each historical drought to its severity over the continental united states sheffield et al 2009 identified 296 large scale soil moisture drought events 0 5 million km2 and 3 months globally in 1950 2000 using the above method wang et al 2011 applied a clustering method and the sad algorithm to characterize spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture droughts in china the results showed that a total of 76 droughts with areal extents greater than 150000 km2 and durations longer than 3 months were identified in 1950 2006 of these the 1997 2003 drought was the most severe with an area of approximately 4 million km2 similarly zhai et al 2016 and yang et al 2020 also analyzed the relationships and trends between the intensity and the areal extent of droughts in china based on different drought indexes to better understand drought evolution better some studies have developed various methods techniques for characterizing the evolution process of droughts in space and time simultaneously lloyd hughes 2012 developed a 3 dimensional longitude latitude and time structure based method based on the spatial clustering algorithm proposed by andreadis et al 2005 to capture the spatiotemporal evolution of droughts xu et al 2015 identified and displayed the spatial development process of some severe drought events over the non arid regions of china using an improved 3 dimensional clustering method herrera estrada et al 2017 studied the evolution of drought events by identifying and tracking the drought clusters based on clustering analysis and the lagrangian approach zhou et al 2019 proposed an approach for investigating the migration of meteorological drought clusters although these studies considering the spatiotemporal correlation of droughts provide some implications for revealing detailed characteristics of drought most mainly focus on the spatial display of drought characteristics e g severity under an aggregation pattern studies focused on exploring spatial characteristics of drought remain limited ren et al 2012 herrera estrada et al 2017 zhou and liu 2018 it is worth noting that an important issue for the above studies is the identification of contiguous drought spatial extent as is known to all a drought event is a regional extreme which means that it not only has a duration but is also characterized by a certain spatial areal extent or spatial continuity of droughts andreadis et al 2005 ren et al 2012 drought is defined as a dry period relative to its local long term averaged condition which suggests that drought can occur everywhere dai 2011 thus it can be inferred that a drought that occurs in any location should be characterized by a continuous spatial extent previous studies mainly focus on identifying the spatial areal extent of drought and analyzing the relationship between it and other characteristics however little attention is given to measurements of the spatial areal extent of droughts that occurred at any location which is an important aspect for mining the spatial information on droughts the spatial autocorrelation principle or the semivariogram method provides some implications for identifying the spatial areal extent of droughts wang et al 2015 estimated spatiotemporal effective rainfall based on the principle in an urbanized watershed aalto et al 2016 produced a daily gridded time series of climate variables over finland by using an empirical semivariogram guo et al 2018b used a semivariogram to describe the spatial structure of satellite precipitation data touma et al 2018 investigated the spatial scales of extreme daily precipitation in the united states based on a new framework that used the semivariogram although most studies analyze the spatial structure of environment variables of interest they mainly focused on the isotropy of spatial correlation spatial autocorrelation of some environmental variables properties e g drought should also be direction dependent that is characterized by anisotropy and their variation along different directions would be quite different i e anisotropic under certain conditions kitanidis 1997 wu and zhang 2013 marra and morin 2018 hu et al 2019 simplifying this issue focusing only on isotropy might result in the loss of some spatial characteristics structures the spatial anisotropy should be given more attention hence this study proposes a simple method to quantify the spatial areal extent of meteorological droughts based on the spatial autocorrelation and anisotropy principle based on long term monthly precipitation with a high spatial resolution we use a standardized precipitation index spi to characterize meteorological droughts then the proposed method is applied to measure the spatial correlation lengths of droughts along with different directions at any location of interest and further to obtain the spatial areal extents of droughts the study is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and the precipitation datasets used section 3 mainly introduces the methods used including the drought index the detailed framework of the proposed method and the data preprocessing in section 4 the spatial correlation lengths spatial extents of meteorological droughts over a humid region are given and analyzed section 5 discusses the proposed method and its possible applications section 6 reports the summary and conclusions 2 study area and data to test the proposed method a humid region that mainly includes poyang lake basin consist of five subbasins and one lake area within 24 30 n latitude and 113 119 e longitude is selected the area is located in southeastern china in the east asian monsoon climate zone fig 1 a to obtain the spatial areal extents of meteorological droughts at the points located near the basin boundary effectively the larger spatial extent panregion with a latitude of 18 38 n and longitude of 104 126 e is considered fig 1a two precipitation datasets are used in this study one dataset is the global precipitation climatology centre monthly land surface precipitation dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 i e 25 km 25 km for 1891 2016 hereafter gpcc which is available from the deutscher wetterdienst https www dwd de en ourservices gpcc gpcc html schneider et al 2018 the other dataset is the monthly observational precipitation from the 839 meteorological stations for the period of 1961 2010 50 years in china which was obtained from the national meteorological information centre of the china meteorological administration http data cma cn the observational precipitation data were mainly used to evaluate the performance of the gpcc dataset in this study a total of 431 meteorological stations and approximately 8800 grids with a resolution of 0 25 within the panregion are shown approximately 940 grid points are noted within the selected humid region according to the rule that a station falling inside a grid is treated as being closest to the grid the correlations of the monthly precipitation series of all station grid pairs were calculated the results show excellent consistency r 0 8 fig 1a using the nanchang meteorological station id 58606 latitude 28 60 n longitude 115 92 e in the poyang lake basin as an example a detailed comparison was given fig 1b d the annual mean precipitation of the selected station is 1582 66 mm 1961 2010 the monthly average precipitation ranges from 45 50 mm in december to 302 40 mm in june with a mean of 131 89 112 69 mm and is characterized by a single peak distribution the linear relationship of the precipitation series the frequency diagrams and the linear relationship of the spi series on a 3 month scale indicate that the gpcc precipitation is consistent with observations r2 0 98 the results indicate that the gpcc precipitation dataset in this region is highly accurate which is consistent with that reported by spinoni et al 2019 thus the gpcc precipitation dataset for 1961 2010 will be used to investigate the spatial areal extent of meteorological droughts in the region 3 methodology 3 1 standardized precipitation index the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 is a well known meteorological drought index based exclusively on precipitation data it is recommended for national meteorological services by the world meteorological organization given its advantages of multiple timescales and comparability across different climate regions hayes et al 2011 zargar et al 2011 for example the spi serves as an important part of the national standard grades of meteorological drought gb t 20481 2017 formulation http www gb688 cn bzgk gb here the spi at a 3 month timescale is used to characterize meteorological droughts the spi 3 can better reveal the seasonal variation characteristics of droughts and is used in many studies e g xu et al 2015 schwalm et al 2017 guo et al 2018a the calculation procedure of spi 3 is given as follows first a given precipitation series is assumed to follow a gamma distribution the gamma density function is expressed as follows 1 f x 1 β α γ α x α 1 e x β w h e r e γ α 0 t α 1 e t d t where α β are the shape and scale parameters respectively which can be estimated using the thom method thom 1958 in addition γ α is the gamma function and x represents the total precipitation for three consecutive months furthermore the cumulative probability f x at x precipitation is calculated using the gamma cumulative distribution function finally f x is transformed into the standard normal random variable i e spi the detailed procedures of the spi are introduced by zhou and liu 2016 meteorological drought levels and the corresponding probabilities are given table 1 3 2 an approach to characterizing the spatial areal extent of droughts the main objective of the method is to measure the spatial areal extent of meteorological droughts that occurred at any point the framework and a schematic diagram of the proposed method are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively a detailed description follows based on the drought indexes and the hydrometeorological datasets with high spatial resolution a dry wet map over a region can be obtained fig 3a then a drought threshold thdrought is used to judge whether a grid observational station is under drought or not after drought identification each grid observational station over the region is binarized depending on whether it is under drought or not the binarization process can be addressed if the drought index value of a grid observational station is less than or equal to thdrought then it is assigned 1 otherwise it is assigned 0 as shown in fig 3b c orange circles indicate that a grid observational station is under drought and gray circles indicate that it has no drought a scanning window for a grid observational station with drought is constructed based on a semivariogram the scanning window includes the search direction θ unit search radius sr unit km distance step h unit km bandwidth bandw unit km and angle tolerance α unit fig 3b c based on the constructed scanning window the number of 1 1 and 1 0 pairs i e drought drought 1 1 pairs and drought nondrought 1 0 pairs shown in fig 3b c within each polygon gray shaded area in fig 3b can be counted the relationship between semivariance values and the lag distances for a selected drought point is analyzed since we focus mainly on drought points two types of point pairs namely 1 1 pairs and 1 0 pairs are considered for example we assume that the drought point at time jan jan means january over a region is p the years that meet the assumption are recorded as a set y we establish a scanning window at point p and specify a search direction θ thus in the given direction of θ the number of 1 1 pairs year y c 1 1 θ k y e a r j a n and 1 0 pairs year y c 1 0 θ k y e a r j a n within the k th polygon during the selected periods i e the set y can be counted according to the semivariance function deutsch and journel 1992 we know that the semivariance value of a 1 1 pair is γ 1 1 0 whereas that of a 1 0 pair is γ 1 0 0 5 the mean semivariance value γ k j a n of the k th polygon can be calculated using expression 2 2 γ k j a n γ 1 1 year y c 1 1 θ k y e a r j a n γ 1 0 year y c 1 0 θ k y e a r j a n year y c 1 1 θ k y e a r j a n year y c 1 0 θ k y e a r j a n for the sampling point p the mean semivariance values of all polygons in january can be calculated using equation 2 we compute the centroids of all the polygons and use them to represent the corresponding polygons the empirical relationship between the centroids and their corresponding mean semivariance values can be shown fig 3c further the spatial correlation length clθ in the given search direction θ can be obtained by fitting the empirical relationship here a frequently used theoretical exponential model is introduced as follows berndt et al 2014 aalto et al 2016 3 γ h 0 h 0 c 0 c 1 e h a 0 h 0 where c0 is the nugget effect value c is the partial sill and c c0 is the sill value which is the semivariance upper bound the range r0 denotes the distance at which the semivariance value reaches the sill when the lag distance is greater than the range r0 the spatial autocorrelation is assumed to be small and can be ignored fig 3c at this moment the range r0 is considered the correlation length clθ in terms of the exponential model the range r0 is equal to three times the parameter a0 namely clθ r0 3a0 in theory the nugget effect c0 is 0 at h 0 however in practice c0 is often greater than 0 one of the reasons is attributed to the spatial variation at distances less than the sampling interval i e sampling error curran 1988 thus datasets with high spatial resolution are needed the specified sr does not mean that an effective range r0 can be acquired using the theoretical model namely with the range r0 greater than the sr to solve this problem we propose setting a dynamic search radius based on the specified sr if the fitted range r0 is greater than the sr the search radius increases by a distance step h this procedure continues until the new range r0 is less than the reset search radius namely the effective cl is obtained the maximum search radius srmax should be specified if the effective cl is not obtained when the search radius reaches the srmax the cl for the sampling point will be regarded as an unreasonable value according to the above procedures we can obtain the cl of droughts in different directions at sampling point p and then we can obtain its spatial extent spe a schematic diagram of spe identification is shown in fig 4 spe can be calculated using expressions 4 5 4 sp e θ i θ i 1 1 2 c l θ i c l θ i 1 sin θ i 1 θ i 5 spe i 1 m 1 sp e θ i θ i 1 s p e θ m θ 1 i 1 m 1 1 2 c l θ i c l θ i 1 sin θ i 1 θ i 1 2 c l θ m c l θ 1 sin θ 1 θ m where sp e θ i θ i 1 represents the spe between the search direction of θi and the search direction of θi 1 and m denotes the number of search directions in this study the period of 1961 2010 50 years is selected as the base period for calculating the climatology spatial lengths spatial extents of meteorological droughts of all points over the humid region 3 3 parameter settings of the characterization method the parameter settings of the proposed method are given by the sensitivity tests according to table 1 an spi value of 1 is used frequently table 2 as the drought threshold i e thdrought 1 given the regular grids 25 km 25 km of the dataset used in this study the distance step is set as h 25 km to reduce sampling error as much as possible we specify 8 search directions counterclockwise at 45 intervals thus m 8 the angle tolerance and bandwidth are set at α 22 5 and bandw 56 95 km which is designed to eliminate the interference between point pairs within two adjacent polygons reduce the effects caused by increasing polygon size and ensure sufficient point pairs the different bandwidths bandw from 15 53 km to 201 93 km are investigated fig 5 considering the regularity and sparsity of grid distribution the smaller bandw cannot ensure that there are sufficient point pairs within the polygon or even no one point pair under some conditions e g the direction of 45 fig 5a b whereas the greater bandw may reduce the anisotropy for a special direction similarly the above reasons explain why more search directions greater than8 are not available for effective analysis thus the search direction angle tolerance and bandwidth are set as above based on the optimal reasonability concerning the search radius sr of a scanning window in this study we specify the search radius sr 500 km then the total polygons in one direction are g 20 the different search radii 300 km 500 km and 700 km are analyzed and compared in section 5 discussion there are three additional explanations for this finding the first explanation is the length scale of synoptic high pressure is typically 103 km barry and carleton 2013 the second is that stratified clouds which are the main cloud system producing rainfall in the midlatitudes have a characteristic spatial length of 100 1000 km liu et al 2016 sheng et al 2013 the last explanation is that a 500 km radius is used to calculate the climatology length of daily extreme precipitation in the united states touma et al 2018 based on the above references the maximum search radius srmax is set as 1000 km 4 results 4 1 identifying climatology spatial extent of meteorological droughts taking an example of a grid point 28 625 n 115 875 e corresponding to nanchang meteorological station the identification processing of the climatology lengths of its all 8 directions is shown in fig 6 droughts occurred in a total of 89 months during 1961 2010 at the selected grid point which accounted for 14 8 of the total months 600 months for each direction the number of drought and nondrought points within the 20 polygons during 89 drought months were counted e g the bottom panel in fig 6a the experimental semivariation value of each polygon was obtained based on the number of 1 1 and 1 0 point pairs e g the upper panel in fig 6a the bottom panels in fig 6a h mainly present the changing relationship between the lag distances along 8 search directions and the number of point pairs including 1 1 pairs and 1 0 pairs within each polygon the number of 1 0 pairs or 1 1 pairs in all directions had similar changes as the lag distance increased the 1 0 pairs count increased at first and then tended to be stable whereas the 1 1 pairs count initially increased then decreased and finally remained relatively stable the number of 1 1 pairs was greater than that of 1 0 pairs near the selected grid point along with all directions whereas the opposite phenomenon was observed away from the selected grid point the lag distances at which the changes occurred in different directions are different the phenomenon suggested that the direction dependent length scales of meteorological drought it should be noted that the changes of point pairs as lag distances increased in the direction of 0 90 180 and 270 were smoother i e smaller fluctuations compared with that in the direction of 45 135 225 and 315 which was related to the spatial distribution of regular gridded data the number of gird points covered by each of their polygons was not the same and characterized by fluctuation changes when the scanning window worked along with the directions of 45 135 225 and 315 fig 5 the spatial relationship between grid points and the polygons along with these directions is different from that in the directions of 0 90 180 and 270 which contributed to the change characteristics figs 5 and 6 the scatters between the semivariance values and lag distances were noted in the upper panels of fig 6a h as shown in this figure the theoretical curves of these scatters were fitted well using the exponential model r2 0 89 p 0 05 thus the cls of meteorological droughts of the selected grid point in all 8 directions were 344 km 331 km 480 km 428 km 435 km 414 km 427 km and 508 km based on the theoretical relationships the standard deviation of cls of 8 directions was approximately 56 km indicating relatively large differences in cls in different directions effective cls along 7 directions were obtained based on the base search radius of 500 km except for the direction of 315 503 km the cl of 508 km in the direction of 315 under the new search radius of 525 km was calculated by the dynamic search radii processing scheme the scatters generally remained stable along with the increasing in lag distances after the cls indicating minimal spatial correlation we noted that when the 600 km radius was used the pairs count within the last polygon was approximately 270 which is less than that in other polygons and had an impact on the cl 555 km the finding might be explained by the fact that the last polygon was along the coast given the very sparse points in this area fig 1a the climatological spatial extent of meteorological droughts of the selected grid point was obtained based on the cls along 8 directions fig 6i which was approximately 49 95 104 km2 4 2 climatology lengths spatial extent of meteorological droughts the frequency distributions of cls of all points for each search direction were given in fig 7 as indicated in fig 7 the cls of most points for almost all directions were less than 500 km the proportions were 46 06 52 03 67 16 58 74 54 37 60 02 78 78 and 60 45 of the total number of points for the directions of 0 45 90 135 180 225 270 and 315 respectively the proportion was 59 7 in all cls of 8 directions moreover distinctive frequency changes of cls were found approximately 500 km in most directions e g the direction of 90 and 135 the results suggested that the search radius of 500 km in the proposed method was reasonable for meeting the calculation need of most grid points the standard deviation of cls in 8 directions for each grid point was obtained the frequency of the standard deviations of all grid points is shown in fig 8 a although the frequency distributions e g the mean and median of cls in some directions were similar fig 7 the differences in cls of 8 directions were significant according to the distribution of standard deviations approximately 50 of the total grid points were greater than 100 km the phenomenon confirmed the anisotropy of meteorological droughts over the region fig 8b provides the frequency distribution of spes of all grid points the spes of spi 3 over the region varied over a wide scope ranging from 31 80 104 km2 5th percentile to 156 62 104 km2 95th percentile whereas the spes of approximately 50 of points were mainly between 51 27 104 km2 and 102 69 104 km2 from 25th to 75th percentile the median was 73 01 104 km2 which is less than the mean of 80 93 104 km2 and characterized by positive skewed distributions fig 9 provides the spatial distribution of the spes and their changes with the latitude and longitude the distinctive spatial pattern of spes of spi 3 was shown in this region the high spes are mainly distributed in a belt from the northeast and southwest whereas the low spes are mainly distributed on both sides of this belt namely northwestern and southeastern regions in terms of the poyang lake basin the high value belt runs across the basin two main low value regions are noted the northwestern basin mainly distributed in the xiushui basin lake area and the northern ganjiang basin and the central region of the ganjiang basin the largest subbasin of poyang lake basin fig 1a the spes showed a significant decreasing change trend as the latitude increased slope 4 92 104 km2 deg p 0 05 indicating that the small spes were more widely distributed in the northern part of the region although the change of spes with longitude was insignificant the change curve revealed several characteristic regions for example a low spe area located between the longitude of 117 e and 119 e these findings were consistent with the abovementioned spatial distribution pattern of spes 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainty and reasonability of the characterization method this method was developed based on spatial autocorrelation and anisotropy the constructed scanning window and its theoretical model of a semivariogram involved multiple parameter settings mainly including search direction search radius distance step bandwidth and angle tolerance although the parameters of the method are investigated using the sensitivity tests section 3 3 uncertainty still existed due to a deficiency of high density observations the gpcc regular gridded dataset with a spatial resolution of 25 km 25 km was used in the study although the overall performance in the rainfall amount agreed well with observations the gpcc precipitation dataset produced by interpolation methods exhibited some uncertainties becker et al 2013 sun et al 2014 2018 wang and wang 2017 the number of search directions was set as 8 in this study however this value was not to be reasonable given that we calculated the area of a polygon based on the cls in 8 directions however the selection of the dataset with a resolution of 25 km 25 km poses a challenge for setting more search directions fig 5 the bandwidth was set as 56 95 km which mainly was used to ensure sufficient points in a polygon and the anisotropy hence the larger bandwidth was not investigated fig 10 gives the statistics of mean lengths and spatial areal extents under different radii 300 km 500 km and 700 km the mean length was the averaged value of cls along 8 directions as the search radius increased the cls and spes generally became greater especially when the search radius was greater than 500 km the larger radius might have an amplification effect on cls the cumulative probability of cls under different radii is shown in fig 11 when the search radius was set as 500 km approximately 60 of the cls in 8 directions was less than the search radius whereas this value only approximately 28 for 300 km and reached up to 82 for 700 km thus a 500 km search radius was applied a portion of uncertainties would be reduced and improved by using better datasets in the future the use of a dataset with increased spatiotemporal resolutions would contribute to the robust results including more search directions such as various satellite remote sensing products and assimilation products that are not only used for the land surface the use of these datasets could contribute to solving the issue of the uneven distribution of observational gauges due to land sea boundaries e g fig 6h and ungauged regions such as complex mountain areas and deserts sun et al 2018 west et al 2019 although satellite data might have relatively low accuracy we believe it could help us to better understand droughts in their entirety the spes of meteorological droughts are difficult to measure directly but we found several indirect pieces of evidence to support the reasonability of the results from the perspective of the probability of environmental variables focused on a drought threshold of 1 was used in the study according to table 1 the probability of an spi value of less than 1 is approximately 16 the daily extreme precipitation p90 90th percentile length scales could reach 600 km over the us as reported by touma et al 2018 who focused on a 10 probability of extreme precipitation based on the isotropic theory moreover in midlatitude areas stratified cloud systems the main cloud systems for rainfall have a generalized spatial scale of 100 1000 km liu et al 2016 sheng et al 2013 huang et al 2017 noted that the rainfall induced by stratiform cloud systems contributed to approximately 60 of total rainfall near the latitude of 30 n our results were located within these ranges based on the atmospheric circulation changes associated with the drought zhang and zhou 2015 indicated that the distinct seasonal drought structures in southeast china were dominated by the east asian monsoon variability along with a strong east asian monsoon the interannual variability of eastern china summer precipitation features a meridional tripolar or sandwich pattern with drier or even drought conditions in southern and northern china but severe flooding in central eastern china huang et al 2012 zhang and zhou 2015 the el niño southern oscillation sea surface temperatures pacific decadal oscillation and north atlantic oscillation contribute to producing the distinct spatial patterns over the poyang lake basin by affecting the monsoon circulation system that dominates water vapor transport zhang et al 2011 zhou and liu 2018 sun et al 2020 after analyzing the water transport anomalies and divergence anomalies at the vertically integrated layer atmospheric column for dry years over the basin zhang et al 2017 noted that the high positive anomaly values in water vapor flux divergence were distributed in the southwestern basin and that the small water vapor convergence over the basin was mainly controlled by easterly and northeasterly moisture anomalies the above phenomena might provide some explanation for our results the study had also a few limitations three month spi still has high spatiotemporal variability thus we investigated the results using monthly spi at a 1 month 6 month and 12 month scale as reported in the supporting information the spi at other timescales 1 6 and 12 month showed some similar characteristics with that of spi 3 their results also revealed the spatial anisotropy of meteorological droughts as similar to fig 8a the proportion that standard deviation of cls in 8 directions greater than 100 km was 42 3 for spi 1 44 5 for spi 6 and 53 4 for spi 12 fig s1 the statistics of the spes of spi 1 had little difference to that of spi 3 while generally larger than that of spi 6 spi 12 fig s2 and table s1 the results suggested that the spatial anisotropy might be related to the time scales which was confirmed by the spatial changes of spes of spi 1 spi 6 spi 12 fig s3 these phenomena might be related to increased variability of droughts on short term scales and low frequency variation of droughts on longer timescales vicente serrano 2006 analyzed differences in spatial patterns of drought on different time scales from spi 1 to spi 36 over the iberian peninsula and noted that the number of spatial patterns increased as the time scale increased and great spatial complexity was noted in drought especially at long term scales which was consistent with the greater spatial fragmentation of meteorological droughts as the time scales increased in our analysis fig 9 and fig s3 thus based on effective cls of droughts in multiple directions the obtained spes should be reasonable indicating that the proposed method for obtaining climatology spatial extents of droughts based on the anisotropic hypothesis was practicable 5 2 potential applications of the characterization method the method presented in this study could have some applications in other fields there may be two important roles for quantifying the spes of environmental variables one role is that it may serve to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of droughts and help to understand the anisotropy and sizes of these drought events currently more studies have started to explore the spatiotemporal behavior processes of droughts inspiring new understanding which is one of the important factors to understand better how droughts evolve within a region compared to the static analysis in temporal or spatial dimension herrera estrada et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 however the size of the drought patches they focused on varied table 2 provides a brief review of the area thresholds of drought patches used in previous studies an area threshold is often used to filter out relatively small drought patches these studies ranged from the global scale to continental national regional and basin scales and each uses its area threshold from half a million km2 to thousands of km2 even within the same study area area thresholds can be different e g wang et al 2011 zhai et al 2016 wang et al 2011 assessed the sensitivity of area thresholds from 0 25 105 km2 to 2 0 105 km2 to soil moisture drought identification and suggested that a threshold of 1 5 105 km2 approximately 1 6 of the area of china was the most suitable in china subsequently based on this conclusion the ratio of 1 6 of the study area was considered a criterion for setting area thresholds e g guo et al 2018a xu et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 used a smaller area threshold approximately 2000 km2 and analyzed the spatiotemporal behaviors of droughts in the poyang lake basin the above studies provide a good description of drought evolution but minimal attention is given to exploring the potential reasons for the anisotropy and sizes of the drought events from the perspective of agriculture ecology the environment and natural hazards we think that the area thresholds used in previous studies would be necessary and significant and we would hope to investigate the behavioral characteristics of each drought patch as much as possible however many factors and uncertainties such as data quality methods local microclimate and complex underlying surfaces make it difficult to reveal general information and patterns regarding drought evolution climatologically e g tokay et al 2010 lloyd hughes 2012 hu et al 2015 liu et al 2019b zhou et al 2019 when a drought threshold e g the list in table 2 is applied theoretically there should be many drought patches with different sizes over a region however it seems impossible to investigate the variability of all identified drought patches especially climatologically what size drought patch i e area threshold should we focus on hence the proposed method could provide a reference for the selection of drought patches additionally the spatial correlation lengths e g climatology lengths in this study in different directions might contribute to better quantifying the relationship between two adjacent drought patches in the analysis of drought dynamics zhou et al 2019 diaz et al 2020 the other role is that it may be applied for the assessment of impacts of extreme events and to study the changes of spatial areal extents of variables of interest that occur in any location most studies focus on investigating the impacts of extremes on the elements of interest within a regular grid or within an administrative area however the role of the spatial extent of extremes in assessing impacts is often ignored according to the proposed method we can identify the spatial extent of variables properties of interest perform probability spatialization and use this information to study risk of extreme events including heatwave flash drought wildfire and extreme precipitation kuglitsch et al 2010 noted that the identification of the spatial extent of long term heatwave trends is significant for the assessment of climate impacts e g for the economy ecology and environment for a century global warming has presented multidecadal fluctuations characterized by obvious stage characteristics yao et al 2017 under global warming extreme weather and climate events e g droughts heat waves occur frequently dai 2013 showed that decreased precipitation and or increased evaporation will lead to severe and widespread droughts in the next 30 90 years over many parts of the world thus we think the proposed method could be used to analyze the interannual interdecadal variability of the spatial characteristics of droughts or heat waves or other extreme events which might contribute to understanding changes in the climate system e g lyon and barnston 2005 wasko et al 2016 dwyer and o gorman 2017 6 summary and conclusions to broaden our understanding of spatial characteristics of meteorological droughts we proposed a new framework to measure the spatial areal extent of meteorological droughts that occur in any location based on spatial autocorrelation theory the gpcc monthly gridded precipitation dataset with a spatial resolution of 25 km 25 km for 1961 2010 was used for this study the standardized precipitation index was applied to characterize meteorological droughts some parameters of the method including the drought threshold the number of search directions search radius distance step bandwidth and angle tolerance were examined using sensitivity tests the following specific parameters were employed thdrought 1 m 8 sr 500 km srmax 1000 km h 25 km bandw 56 95 km and α 22 5 based on the specified parameters the proposed method was tested in the poyang lake basin the results revealed the following 1 the cls of approximately 60 0 of the total points in all 8 directions were less than 500 km sr which indicated that the research radius of 500 km was effective 2 for most points the cls of 8 directions presented great differences the proportion of points with a standard deviation greater than 100 km was approximately 50 which confirmed the anisotropy of meteorological droughts 3 the statistics of spes of spi 3 over the humid region were given although the frequency distribution of spes was characterized by a large scope the spes of greater than 50 of points were mainly distributed in a relatively small range between 50 104 km2 and 100 104 km2 the median was 73 104 km2 4 the spes of spi 3 exhibited a distinct spatial pattern the high spes are mainly distributed in a belt from the northeast and southwest whereas the low spes are mainly distributed on both sides of this belt namely northwestern and southeastern regions the spi on other scales spi 1 spi 6 spi 12 revealed similar characteristics with spi 3 moreover the spes might be related to time scales showing a decreasing change or the increasing spatial fragmentation as the time scales increased which might be affected by increased variability of droughts on short term scales and low frequency variation of droughts on longer timescales the method and findings might be helpful to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of large scale drought events or other extreme events e g extreme precipitation and to analyze the risk assessment of extremes in the context of global warming although the above results indicate that this method based on anisotropy is justified and useful for measuring the spatial extent of droughts we believe that the study had also a few limitations for example the number of search directions search radius and the explanation mainly from the perspective of the method in the future we should improve the robustness of the results by using datasets with increased spatiotemporal resolution and explain the spatial extent of meteorological droughts by atmospheric dynamics in the region credit authorship contribution statement han zhou conceptualization funding

5090,the spatial characteristics of droughts are important for understanding drought development and water resource allocation most previous studies mainly focus on the spatial display of drought characteristics and the identification of drought spatial extents little attention is given to measuring the spatial extent of drought at any location to this end a new framework was proposed for measuring the spatial areal extent of drought based on spatial autocorrelation and anisotropy principle the global precipitation climatology centre monthly gridded precipitation data with a spatial resolution of 25 km 25 km were used the standardized precipitation index on a three month scale spi 3 was applied to characterize meteorological droughts the base period of 1961 2010 50 years was selected for calculating climatology lengths cls spatial extents spes of meteorological droughts over the poyang lake basin the parameters of the proposed method including the drought threshold spi 1 the number of search directions 8 search radius 500 km distance step 25 km bandwidth 56 95 km and angle tolerance 22 5 were examined using sensitivity tests the results showed that notable differences in cls of 8 search directions confirmed the spatial anisotropy of droughts the statistics of spes of the spi 3 series over the basin were reported spes were mainly between 50 and 100 104 km2 the distinctive spatial pattern of the spes was revealed and characterized by a high value belt from the northeast and southwest and two low value areas the spi on other time scales spi 1 spi 6 spi 12 revealed similar characteristics as spi 3 moreover spes are potentially associated with time scales revealing a decreasing change or increasing spatial fragmentation as time scales increased the

index spatial anisotropy climatology length spatial extent meteorological drought 1 introduction drought is one of the most extreme hydroclimatic hazards characterized by slow development and an undetectable initial process and has major impacts on society environment and economy in many parts of the world kallis 2008 according to the emergency events database em dat in 2015 greater than 50 million people worldwide were affected by droughts accounting for greater than 50 of the total number of people affected by natural disasters in the entire year https www emdat be index php approximately 24 serious drought events killed approximately 3000 people and resulted greater than 230 billion in economic losses in 1980 2017 in the usa https www ncdc noaa gov billions the estimated loss resulting from droughts in a sustainable development pathway at the 1 5 c warming level is approximately three fold increased relative to the 2006 2015 interval in china and the losses are more serious for the 2 0 c warming level su et al 2018 under global warming increasing droughts have been observed in many parts of the world which has raised concerns about future droughts dai 2011 spinoni et al 2014 ipcc 2014 touma et al 2015 wang et al 2019 thus exploring drought characteristics is significant for improving the level of drought monitoring and alleviating the effects of drought the temporal and spatial characteristics of droughts are the basis and precondition for understanding drought development and its impacts currently the characteristics of droughts in space dimensions have attracted more attention in the recent decade compared to that in the time dimension e g frequency severity duration trend and period herrera estrada et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 taking a depth area duration analysis method widely used to characterize precipitation extremes as a reference andreadis et al 2005 constructed a series of severity area duration sad curves to relate the areal extent of each historical drought to its severity over the continental united states sheffield et al 2009 identified 296 large scale soil moisture drought events 0 5 million km2 and 3 months globally in 1950 2000 using the above method wang et al 2011 applied a clustering method and the sad algorithm to characterize spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture droughts in china the results showed that a total of 76 droughts with areal extents greater than 150000 km2 and durations longer than 3 months were identified in 1950 2006 of these the 1997 2003 drought was the most severe with an area of approximately 4 million km2 similarly zhai et al 2016 and yang et al 2020 also analyzed the relationships and trends between the intensity and the areal extent of droughts in china based on different drought indexes to better understand drought evolution better some studies have developed various methods techniques for characterizing the evolution process of droughts in space and time simultaneously lloyd hughes 2012 developed a 3 dimensional longitude latitude and time structure based method based on the spatial clustering algorithm proposed by andreadis et al 2005 to capture the spatiotemporal evolution of droughts xu et al 2015 identified and displayed the spatial development process of some severe drought events over the non arid regions of china using an improved 3 dimensional clustering method herrera estrada et al 2017 studied the evolution of drought events by identifying and tracking the drought clusters based on clustering analysis and the lagrangian approach zhou et al 2019 proposed an approach for investigating the migration of meteorological drought clusters although these studies considering the spatiotemporal correlation of droughts provide some implications for revealing detailed characteristics of drought most mainly focus on the spatial display of drought characteristics e g severity under an aggregation pattern studies focused on exploring spatial characteristics of drought remain limited ren et al 2012 herrera estrada et al 2017 zhou and liu 2018 it is worth noting that an important issue for the above studies is the identification of contiguous drought spatial extent as is known to all a drought event is a regional extreme which means that it not only has a duration but is also characterized by a certain spatial areal extent or spatial continuity of droughts andreadis et al 2005 ren et al 2012 drought is defined as a dry period relative to its local long term averaged condition which suggests that drought can occur everywhere dai 2011 thus it can be inferred that a drought that occurs in any location should be characterized by a continuous spatial extent previous studies mainly focus on identifying the spatial areal extent of drought and analyzing the relationship between it and other characteristics however little attention is given to measurements of the spatial areal extent of droughts that occurred at any location which is an important aspect for mining the spatial information on droughts the spatial autocorrelation principle or the semivariogram method provides some implications for identifying the spatial areal extent of droughts wang et al 2015 estimated spatiotemporal effective rainfall based on the principle in an urbanized watershed aalto et al 2016 produced a daily gridded time series of climate variables over finland by using an empirical semivariogram guo et al 2018b used a semivariogram to describe the spatial structure of satellite precipitation data touma et al 2018 investigated the spatial scales of extreme daily precipitation in the united states based on a new framework that used the semivariogram although most studies analyze the spatial structure of environment variables of interest they mainly focused on the isotropy of spatial correlation spatial autocorrelation of some environmental variables properties e g drought should also be direction dependent that is characterized by anisotropy and their variation along different directions would be quite different i e anisotropic under certain conditions kitanidis 1997 wu and zhang 2013 marra and morin 2018 hu et al 2019 simplifying this issue focusing only on isotropy might result in the loss of some spatial characteristics structures the spatial anisotropy should be given more attention hence this study proposes a simple method to quantify the spatial areal extent of meteorological droughts based on the spatial autocorrelation and anisotropy principle based on long term monthly precipitation with a high spatial resolution we use a standardized precipitation index spi to characterize meteorological droughts then the proposed method is applied to measure the spatial correlation lengths of droughts along with different directions at any location of interest and further to obtain the spatial areal extents of droughts the study is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and the precipitation datasets used section 3 mainly introduces the methods used including the drought index the detailed framework of the proposed method and the data preprocessing in section 4 the spatial correlation lengths spatial extents of meteorological droughts over a humid region are given and analyzed section 5 discusses the proposed method and its possible applications section 6 reports the summary and conclusions 2 study area and data to test the proposed method a humid region that mainly includes poyang lake basin consist of five subbasins and one lake area within 24 30 n latitude and 113 119 e longitude is selected the area is located in southeastern china in the east asian monsoon climate zone fig 1 a to obtain the spatial areal extents of meteorological droughts at the points located near the basin boundary effectively the larger spatial extent panregion with a latitude of 18 38 n and longitude of 104 126 e is considered fig 1a two precipitation datasets are used in this study one dataset is the global precipitation climatology centre monthly land surface precipitation dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 i e 25 km 25 km for 1891 2016 hereafter gpcc which is available from the deutscher wetterdienst https www dwd de en ourservices gpcc gpcc html schneider et al 2018 the other dataset is the monthly observational precipitation from the 839 meteorological stations for the period of 1961 2010 50 years in china which was obtained from the national meteorological information centre of the china meteorological administration http data cma cn the observational precipitation data were mainly used to evaluate the performance of the gpcc dataset in this study a total of 431 meteorological stations and approximately 8800 grids with a resolution of 0 25 within the panregion are shown approximately 940 grid points are noted within the selected humid region according to the rule that a station falling inside a grid is treated as being closest to the grid the correlations of the monthly precipitation series of all station grid pairs were calculated the results show excellent consistency r 0 8 fig 1a using the nanchang meteorological station id 58606 latitude 28 60 n longitude 115 92 e in the poyang lake basin as an example a detailed comparison was given fig 1b d the annual mean precipitation of the selected station is 1582 66 mm 1961 2010 the monthly average precipitation ranges from 45 50 mm in december to 302 40 mm in june with a mean of 131 89 112 69 mm and is characterized by a single peak distribution the linear relationship of the precipitation series the frequency diagrams and the linear relationship of the spi series on a 3 month scale indicate that the gpcc precipitation is consistent with observations r2 0 98 the results indicate that the gpcc precipitation dataset in this region is highly accurate which is consistent with that reported by spinoni et al 2019 thus the gpcc precipitation dataset for 1961 2010 will be used to investigate the spatial areal extent of meteorological droughts in the region 3 methodology 3 1 standardized precipitation index the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 is a well known meteorological drought index based exclusively on precipitation data it is recommended for national meteorological services by the world meteorological organization given its advantages of multiple timescales and comparability across different climate regions hayes et al 2011 zargar et al 2011 for example the spi serves as an important part of the national standard grades of meteorological drought gb t 20481 2017 formulation http www gb688 cn bzgk gb here the spi at a 3 month timescale is used to characterize meteorological droughts the spi 3 can better reveal the seasonal variation characteristics of droughts and is used in many studies e g xu et al 2015 schwalm et al 2017 guo et al 2018a the calculation procedure of spi 3 is given as follows first a given precipitation series is assumed to follow a gamma distribution the gamma density function is expressed as follows 1 f x 1 β α γ α x α 1 e x β w h e r e γ α 0 t α 1 e t d t where α β are the shape and scale parameters respectively which can be estimated using the thom method thom 1958 in addition γ α is the gamma function and x represents the total precipitation for three consecutive months furthermore the cumulative probability f x at x precipitation is calculated using the gamma cumulative distribution function finally f x is transformed into the standard normal random variable i e spi the detailed procedures of the spi are introduced by zhou and liu 2016 meteorological drought levels and the corresponding probabilities are given table 1 3 2 an approach to characterizing the spatial areal extent of droughts the main objective of the method is to measure the spatial areal extent of meteorological droughts that occurred at any point the framework and a schematic diagram of the proposed method are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively a detailed description follows based on the drought indexes and the hydrometeorological datasets with high spatial resolution a dry wet map over a region can be obtained fig 3a then a drought threshold thdrought is used to judge whether a grid observational station is under drought or not after drought identification each grid observational station over the region is binarized depending on whether it is under drought or not the binarization process can be addressed if the drought index value of a grid observational station is less than or equal to thdrought then it is assigned 1 otherwise it is assigned 0 as shown in fig 3b c orange circles indicate that a grid observational station is under drought and gray circles indicate that it has no drought a scanning window for a grid observational station with drought is constructed based on a semivariogram the scanning window includes the search direction θ unit search radius sr unit km distance step h unit km bandwidth bandw unit km and angle tolerance α unit fig 3b c based on the constructed scanning window the number of 1 1 and 1 0 pairs i e drought drought 1 1 pairs and drought nondrought 1 0 pairs shown in fig 3b c within each polygon gray shaded area in fig 3b can be counted the relationship between semivariance values and the lag distances for a selected drought point is analyzed since we focus mainly on drought points two types of point pairs namely 1 1 pairs and 1 0 pairs are considered for example we assume that the drought point at time jan jan means january over a region is p the years that meet the assumption are recorded as a set y we establish a scanning window at point p and specify a search direction θ thus in the given direction of θ the number of 1 1 pairs year y c 1 1 θ k y e a r j a n and 1 0 pairs year y c 1 0 θ k y e a r j a n within the k th polygon during the selected periods i e the set y can be counted according to the semivariance function deutsch and journel 1992 we know that the semivariance value of a 1 1 pair is γ 1 1 0 whereas that of a 1 0 pair is γ 1 0 0 5 the mean semivariance value γ k j a n of the k th polygon can be calculated using expression 2 2 γ k j a n γ 1 1 year y c 1 1 θ k y e a r j a n γ 1 0 year y c 1 0 θ k y e a r j a n year y c 1 1 θ k y e a r j a n year y c 1 0 θ k y e a r j a n for the sampling point p the mean semivariance values of all polygons in january can be calculated using equation 2 we compute the centroids of all the polygons and use them to represent the corresponding polygons the empirical relationship between the centroids and their corresponding mean semivariance values can be shown fig 3c further the spatial correlation length clθ in the given search direction θ can be obtained by fitting the empirical relationship here a frequently used theoretical exponential model is introduced as follows berndt et al 2014 aalto et al 2016 3 γ h 0 h 0 c 0 c 1 e h a 0 h 0 where c0 is the nugget effect value c is the partial sill and c c0 is the sill value which is the semivariance upper bound the range r0 denotes the distance at which the semivariance value reaches the sill when the lag distance is greater than the range r0 the spatial autocorrelation is assumed to be small and can be ignored fig 3c at this moment the range r0 is considered the correlation length clθ in terms of the exponential model the range r0 is equal to three times the parameter a0 namely clθ r0 3a0 in theory the nugget effect c0 is 0 at h 0 however in practice c0 is often greater than 0 one of the reasons is attributed to the spatial variation at distances less than the sampling interval i e sampling error curran 1988 thus datasets with high spatial resolution are needed the specified sr does not mean that an effective range r0 can be acquired using the theoretical model namely with the range r0 greater than the sr to solve this problem we propose setting a dynamic search radius based on the specified sr if the fitted range r0 is greater than the sr the search radius increases by a distance step h this procedure continues until the new range r0 is less than the reset search radius namely the effective cl is obtained the maximum search radius srmax should be specified if the effective cl is not obtained when the search radius reaches the srmax the cl for the sampling point will be regarded as an unreasonable value according to the above procedures we can obtain the cl of droughts in different directions at sampling point p and then we can obtain its spatial extent spe a schematic diagram of spe identification is shown in fig 4 spe can be calculated using expressions 4 5 4 sp e θ i θ i 1 1 2 c l θ i c l θ i 1 sin θ i 1 θ i 5 spe i 1 m 1 sp e θ i θ i 1 s p e θ m θ 1 i 1 m 1 1 2 c l θ i c l θ i 1 sin θ i 1 θ i 1 2 c l θ m c l θ 1 sin θ 1 θ m where sp e θ i θ i 1 represents the spe between the search direction of θi and the search direction of θi 1 and m denotes the number of search directions in this study the period of 1961 2010 50 years is selected as the base period for calculating the climatology spatial lengths spatial extents of meteorological droughts of all points over the humid region 3 3 parameter settings of the characterization method the parameter settings of the proposed method are given by the sensitivity tests according to table 1 an spi value of 1 is used frequently table 2 as the drought threshold i e thdrought 1 given the regular grids 25 km 25 km of the dataset used in this study the distance step is set as h 25 km to reduce sampling error as much as possible we specify 8 search directions counterclockwise at 45 intervals thus m 8 the angle tolerance and bandwidth are set at α 22 5 and bandw 56 95 km which is designed to eliminate the interference between point pairs within two adjacent polygons reduce the effects caused by increasing polygon size and ensure sufficient point pairs the different bandwidths bandw from 15 53 km to 201 93 km are investigated fig 5 considering the regularity and sparsity of grid distribution the smaller bandw cannot ensure that there are sufficient point pairs within the polygon or even no one point pair under some conditions e g the direction of 45 fig 5a b whereas the greater bandw may reduce the anisotropy for a special direction similarly the above reasons explain why more search directions greater than8 are not available for effective analysis thus the search direction angle tolerance and bandwidth are set as above based on the optimal reasonability concerning the search radius sr of a scanning window in this study we specify the search radius sr 500 km then the total polygons in one direction are g 20 the different search radii 300 km 500 km and 700 km are analyzed and compared in section 5 discussion there are three additional explanations for this finding the first explanation is the length scale of synoptic high pressure is typically 103 km barry and carleton 2013 the second is that stratified clouds which are the main cloud system producing rainfall in the midlatitudes have a characteristic spatial length of 100 1000 km liu et al 2016 sheng et al 2013 the last explanation is that a 500 km radius is used to calculate the climatology length of daily extreme precipitation in the united states touma et al 2018 based on the above references the maximum search radius srmax is set as 1000 km 4 results 4 1 identifying climatology spatial extent of meteorological droughts taking an example of a grid point 28 625 n 115 875 e corresponding to nanchang meteorological station the identification processing of the climatology lengths of its all 8 directions is shown in fig 6 droughts occurred in a total of 89 months during 1961 2010 at the selected grid point which accounted for 14 8 of the total months 600 months for each direction the number of drought and nondrought points within the 20 polygons during 89 drought months were counted e g the bottom panel in fig 6a the experimental semivariation value of each polygon was obtained based on the number of 1 1 and 1 0 point pairs e g the upper panel in fig 6a the bottom panels in fig 6a h mainly present the changing relationship between the lag distances along 8 search directions and the number of point pairs including 1 1 pairs and 1 0 pairs within each polygon the number of 1 0 pairs or 1 1 pairs in all directions had similar changes as the lag distance increased the 1 0 pairs count increased at first and then tended to be stable whereas the 1 1 pairs count initially increased then decreased and finally remained relatively stable the number of 1 1 pairs was greater than that of 1 0 pairs near the selected grid point along with all directions whereas the opposite phenomenon was observed away from the selected grid point the lag distances at which the changes occurred in different directions are different the phenomenon suggested that the direction dependent length scales of meteorological drought it should be noted that the changes of point pairs as lag distances increased in the direction of 0 90 180 and 270 were smoother i e smaller fluctuations compared with that in the direction of 45 135 225 and 315 which was related to the spatial distribution of regular gridded data the number of gird points covered by each of their polygons was not the same and characterized by fluctuation changes when the scanning window worked along with the directions of 45 135 225 and 315 fig 5 the spatial relationship between grid points and the polygons along with these directions is different from that in the directions of 0 90 180 and 270 which contributed to the change characteristics figs 5 and 6 the scatters between the semivariance values and lag distances were noted in the upper panels of fig 6a h as shown in this figure the theoretical curves of these scatters were fitted well using the exponential model r2 0 89 p 0 05 thus the cls of meteorological droughts of the selected grid point in all 8 directions were 344 km 331 km 480 km 428 km 435 km 414 km 427 km and 508 km based on the theoretical relationships the standard deviation of cls of 8 directions was approximately 56 km indicating relatively large differences in cls in different directions effective cls along 7 directions were obtained based on the base search radius of 500 km except for the direction of 315 503 km the cl of 508 km in the direction of 315 under the new search radius of 525 km was calculated by the dynamic search radii processing scheme the scatters generally remained stable along with the increasing in lag distances after the cls indicating minimal spatial correlation we noted that when the 600 km radius was used the pairs count within the last polygon was approximately 270 which is less than that in other polygons and had an impact on the cl 555 km the finding might be explained by the fact that the last polygon was along the coast given the very sparse points in this area fig 1a the climatological spatial extent of meteorological droughts of the selected grid point was obtained based on the cls along 8 directions fig 6i which was approximately 49 95 104 km2 4 2 climatology lengths spatial extent of meteorological droughts the frequency distributions of cls of all points for each search direction were given in fig 7 as indicated in fig 7 the cls of most points for almost all directions were less than 500 km the proportions were 46 06 52 03 67 16 58 74 54 37 60 02 78 78 and 60 45 of the total number of points for the directions of 0 45 90 135 180 225 270 and 315 respectively the proportion was 59 7 in all cls of 8 directions moreover distinctive frequency changes of cls were found approximately 500 km in most directions e g the direction of 90 and 135 the results suggested that the search radius of 500 km in the proposed method was reasonable for meeting the calculation need of most grid points the standard deviation of cls in 8 directions for each grid point was obtained the frequency of the standard deviations of all grid points is shown in fig 8 a although the frequency distributions e g the mean and median of cls in some directions were similar fig 7 the differences in cls of 8 directions were significant according to the distribution of standard deviations approximately 50 of the total grid points were greater than 100 km the phenomenon confirmed the anisotropy of meteorological droughts over the region fig 8b provides the frequency distribution of spes of all grid points the spes of spi 3 over the region varied over a wide scope ranging from 31 80 104 km2 5th percentile to 156 62 104 km2 95th percentile whereas the spes of approximately 50 of points were mainly between 51 27 104 km2 and 102 69 104 km2 from 25th to 75th percentile the median was 73 01 104 km2 which is less than the mean of 80 93 104 km2 and characterized by positive skewed distributions fig 9 provides the spatial distribution of the spes and their changes with the latitude and longitude the distinctive spatial pattern of spes of spi 3 was shown in this region the high spes are mainly distributed in a belt from the northeast and southwest whereas the low spes are mainly distributed on both sides of this belt namely northwestern and southeastern regions in terms of the poyang lake basin the high value belt runs across the basin two main low value regions are noted the northwestern basin mainly distributed in the xiushui basin lake area and the northern ganjiang basin and the central region of the ganjiang basin the largest subbasin of poyang lake basin fig 1a the spes showed a significant decreasing change trend as the latitude increased slope 4 92 104 km2 deg p 0 05 indicating that the small spes were more widely distributed in the northern part of the region although the change of spes with longitude was insignificant the change curve revealed several characteristic regions for example a low spe area located between the longitude of 117 e and 119 e these findings were consistent with the abovementioned spatial distribution pattern of spes 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainty and reasonability of the characterization method this method was developed based on spatial autocorrelation and anisotropy the constructed scanning window and its theoretical model of a semivariogram involved multiple parameter settings mainly including search direction search radius distance step bandwidth and angle tolerance although the parameters of the method are investigated using the sensitivity tests section 3 3 uncertainty still existed due to a deficiency of high density observations the gpcc regular gridded dataset with a spatial resolution of 25 km 25 km was used in the study although the overall performance in the rainfall amount agreed well with observations the gpcc precipitation dataset produced by interpolation methods exhibited some uncertainties becker et al 2013 sun et al 2014 2018 wang and wang 2017 the number of search directions was set as 8 in this study however this value was not to be reasonable given that we calculated the area of a polygon based on the cls in 8 directions however the selection of the dataset with a resolution of 25 km 25 km poses a challenge for setting more search directions fig 5 the bandwidth was set as 56 95 km which mainly was used to ensure sufficient points in a polygon and the anisotropy hence the larger bandwidth was not investigated fig 10 gives the statistics of mean lengths and spatial areal extents under different radii 300 km 500 km and 700 km the mean length was the averaged value of cls along 8 directions as the search radius increased the cls and spes generally became greater especially when the search radius was greater than 500 km the larger radius might have an amplification effect on cls the cumulative probability of cls under different radii is shown in fig 11 when the search radius was set as 500 km approximately 60 of the cls in 8 directions was less than the search radius whereas this value only approximately 28 for 300 km and reached up to 82 for 700 km thus a 500 km search radius was applied a portion of uncertainties would be reduced and improved by using better datasets in the future the use of a dataset with increased spatiotemporal resolutions would contribute to the robust results including more search directions such as various satellite remote sensing products and assimilation products that are not only used for the land surface the use of these datasets could contribute to solving the issue of the uneven distribution of observational gauges due to land sea boundaries e g fig 6h and ungauged regions such as complex mountain areas and deserts sun et al 2018 west et al 2019 although satellite data might have relatively low accuracy we believe it could help us to better understand droughts in their entirety the spes of meteorological droughts are difficult to measure directly but we found several indirect pieces of evidence to support the reasonability of the results from the perspective of the probability of environmental variables focused on a drought threshold of 1 was used in the study according to table 1 the probability of an spi value of less than 1 is approximately 16 the daily extreme precipitation p90 90th percentile length scales could reach 600 km over the us as reported by touma et al 2018 who focused on a 10 probability of extreme precipitation based on the isotropic theory moreover in midlatitude areas stratified cloud systems the main cloud systems for rainfall have a generalized spatial scale of 100 1000 km liu et al 2016 sheng et al 2013 huang et al 2017 noted that the rainfall induced by stratiform cloud systems contributed to approximately 60 of total rainfall near the latitude of 30 n our results were located within these ranges based on the atmospheric circulation changes associated with the drought zhang and zhou 2015 indicated that the distinct seasonal drought structures in southeast china were dominated by the east asian monsoon variability along with a strong east asian monsoon the interannual variability of eastern china summer precipitation features a meridional tripolar or sandwich pattern with drier or even drought conditions in southern and northern china but severe flooding in central eastern china huang et al 2012 zhang and zhou 2015 the el niño southern oscillation sea surface temperatures pacific decadal oscillation and north atlantic oscillation contribute to producing the distinct spatial patterns over the poyang lake basin by affecting the monsoon circulation system that dominates water vapor transport zhang et al 2011 zhou and liu 2018 sun et al 2020 after analyzing the water transport anomalies and divergence anomalies at the vertically integrated layer atmospheric column for dry years over the basin zhang et al 2017 noted that the high positive anomaly values in water vapor flux divergence were distributed in the southwestern basin and that the small water vapor convergence over the basin was mainly controlled by easterly and northeasterly moisture anomalies the above phenomena might provide some explanation for our results the study had also a few limitations three month spi still has high spatiotemporal variability thus we investigated the results using monthly spi at a 1 month 6 month and 12 month scale as reported in the supporting information the spi at other timescales 1 6 and 12 month showed some similar characteristics with that of spi 3 their results also revealed the spatial anisotropy of meteorological droughts as similar to fig 8a the proportion that standard deviation of cls in 8 directions greater than 100 km was 42 3 for spi 1 44 5 for spi 6 and 53 4 for spi 12 fig s1 the statistics of the spes of spi 1 had little difference to that of spi 3 while generally larger than that of spi 6 spi 12 fig s2 and table s1 the results suggested that the spatial anisotropy might be related to the time scales which was confirmed by the spatial changes of spes of spi 1 spi 6 spi 12 fig s3 these phenomena might be related to increased variability of droughts on short term scales and low frequency variation of droughts on longer timescales vicente serrano 2006 analyzed differences in spatial patterns of drought on different time scales from spi 1 to spi 36 over the iberian peninsula and noted that the number of spatial patterns increased as the time scale increased and great spatial complexity was noted in drought especially at long term scales which was consistent with the greater spatial fragmentation of meteorological droughts as the time scales increased in our analysis fig 9 and fig s3 thus based on effective cls of droughts in multiple directions the obtained spes should be reasonable indicating that the proposed method for obtaining climatology spatial extents of droughts based on the anisotropic hypothesis was practicable 5 2 potential applications of the characterization method the method presented in this study could have some applications in other fields there may be two important roles for quantifying the spes of environmental variables one role is that it may serve to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of droughts and help to understand the anisotropy and sizes of these drought events currently more studies have started to explore the spatiotemporal behavior processes of droughts inspiring new understanding which is one of the important factors to understand better how droughts evolve within a region compared to the static analysis in temporal or spatial dimension herrera estrada et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 however the size of the drought patches they focused on varied table 2 provides a brief review of the area thresholds of drought patches used in previous studies an area threshold is often used to filter out relatively small drought patches these studies ranged from the global scale to continental national regional and basin scales and each uses its area threshold from half a million km2 to thousands of km2 even within the same study area area thresholds can be different e g wang et al 2011 zhai et al 2016 wang et al 2011 assessed the sensitivity of area thresholds from 0 25 105 km2 to 2 0 105 km2 to soil moisture drought identification and suggested that a threshold of 1 5 105 km2 approximately 1 6 of the area of china was the most suitable in china subsequently based on this conclusion the ratio of 1 6 of the study area was considered a criterion for setting area thresholds e g guo et al 2018a xu et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 used a smaller area threshold approximately 2000 km2 and analyzed the spatiotemporal behaviors of droughts in the poyang lake basin the above studies provide a good description of drought evolution but minimal attention is given to exploring the potential reasons for the anisotropy and sizes of the drought events from the perspective of agriculture ecology the environment and natural hazards we think that the area thresholds used in previous studies would be necessary and significant and we would hope to investigate the behavioral characteristics of each drought patch as much as possible however many factors and uncertainties such as data quality methods local microclimate and complex underlying surfaces make it difficult to reveal general information and patterns regarding drought evolution climatologically e g tokay et al 2010 lloyd hughes 2012 hu et al 2015 liu et al 2019b zhou et al 2019 when a drought threshold e g the list in table 2 is applied theoretically there should be many drought patches with different sizes over a region however it seems impossible to investigate the variability of all identified drought patches especially climatologically what size drought patch i e area threshold should we focus on hence the proposed method could provide a reference for the selection of drought patches additionally the spatial correlation lengths e g climatology lengths in this study in different directions might contribute to better quantifying the relationship between two adjacent drought patches in the analysis of drought dynamics zhou et al 2019 diaz et al 2020 the other role is that it may be applied for the assessment of impacts of extreme events and to study the changes of spatial areal extents of variables of interest that occur in any location most studies focus on investigating the impacts of extremes on the elements of interest within a regular grid or within an administrative area however the role of the spatial extent of extremes in assessing impacts is often ignored according to the proposed method we can identify the spatial extent of variables properties of interest perform probability spatialization and use this information to study risk of extreme events including heatwave flash drought wildfire and extreme precipitation kuglitsch et al 2010 noted that the identification of the spatial extent of long term heatwave trends is significant for the assessment of climate impacts e g for the economy ecology and environment for a century global warming has presented multidecadal fluctuations characterized by obvious stage characteristics yao et al 2017 under global warming extreme weather and climate events e g droughts heat waves occur frequently dai 2013 showed that decreased precipitation and or increased evaporation will lead to severe and widespread droughts in the next 30 90 years over many parts of the world thus we think the proposed method could be used to analyze the interannual interdecadal variability of the spatial characteristics of droughts or heat waves or other extreme events which might contribute to understanding changes in the climate system e g lyon and barnston 2005 wasko et al 2016 dwyer and o gorman 2017 6 summary and conclusions to broaden our understanding of spatial characteristics of meteorological droughts we proposed a new framework to measure the spatial areal extent of meteorological droughts that occur in any location based on spatial autocorrelation theory the gpcc monthly gridded precipitation dataset with a spatial resolution of 25 km 25 km for 1961 2010 was used for this study the standardized precipitation index was applied to characterize meteorological droughts some parameters of the method including the drought threshold the number of search directions search radius distance step bandwidth and angle tolerance were examined using sensitivity tests the following specific parameters were employed thdrought 1 m 8 sr 500 km srmax 1000 km h 25 km bandw 56 95 km and α 22 5 based on the specified parameters the proposed method was tested in the poyang lake basin the results revealed the following 1 the cls of approximately 60 0 of the total points in all 8 directions were less than 500 km sr which indicated that the research radius of 500 km was effective 2 for most points the cls of 8 directions presented great differences the proportion of points with a standard deviation greater than 100 km was approximately 50 which confirmed the anisotropy of meteorological droughts 3 the statistics of spes of spi 3 over the humid region were given although the frequency distribution of spes was characterized by a large scope the spes of greater than 50 of points were mainly distributed in a relatively small range between 50 104 km2 and 100 104 km2 the median was 73 104 km2 4 the spes of spi 3 exhibited a distinct spatial pattern the high spes are mainly distributed in a belt from the northeast and southwest whereas the low spes are mainly distributed on both sides of this belt namely northwestern and southeastern regions the spi on other scales spi 1 spi 6 spi 12 revealed similar characteristics with spi 3 moreover the spes might be related to time scales showing a decreasing change or the increasing spatial fragmentation as the time scales increased which might be affected by increased variability of droughts on short term scales and low frequency variation of droughts on longer timescales the method and findings might be helpful to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of large scale drought events or other extreme events e g extreme precipitation and to analyze the risk assessment of extremes in the context of global warming although the above results indicate that this method based on anisotropy is justified and useful for measuring the spatial extent of droughts we believe that the study had also a few limitations for example the number of search directions search radius and the explanation mainly from the perspective of the method in the future we should improve the robustness of the results by using datasets with increased spatiotemporal resolution and explain the spatial extent of meteorological droughts by atmospheric dynamics in the region credit authorship contribution statement han zhou conceptualization funding

5091,understanding the effects of best management practices bmps on nitrate reduction in karst aquifers is critical for spring restoration in this study conduit flow process cfpv2 and conduit mass three dimensional cmt3d models were applied to evaluate nitrate removal for silver springs in florida using blanket filters composed of biosorption activated media bam as the inputs of the model the spatial and temporal variability of nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge was estimated as a function of population and land use reflecting both point and non point sources of nitrate additionally the spatial heterogeneity of nitrate removal efficiency in the soil was considered in the evaluation the model estimates that conduit flow accounts for 48 of spring discharge and 47 of nitrate n mass transport on average and the contributions of conduit to flow and nitrate mass transport are higher during wet years the net effect of nitrate reduction in spring discharge was evaluated for two bmp scenarios i e implementing bam based blanket filters in 26 stormwater retention basins and 50 of the urban area the net effect of the bmp on nitrate reduction for scenario 1 is limited whereas for scenario 2 the nitrate n concentration will be reduced to 1 08 mg l in 2026 for a nitrate removal efficiency of 74 i e a 4 9 reduction relative to the baseline condition this study suggests that the bam based blanket filters benefit is likely to scale with penetration i e greater water quality benefits can be expected with greater bmp implementation further this study shows that whether bam based blanket filters leads to net water quality improvements or degradation depends on whether bam removes more or less nutrients from stormwater than the unaltered soil profile the simulated effects of the bmp on nitrate reduction may serve as an additional guidance for water resources managers to make decisions on investments in nutrient reduction technologies for spring restorations in karst systems keywords karst spring nitrate conduits stormwater best management practices 1 introduction groundwater serves as the primary source of drinking water for many

have the maximum contaminant level for nitrate in drinking water set to 10 mg l measured as nitrate nitrogen no3 n water quality standards including numeric nutrient criteria help to protect and restore the quality of water bodies such as streams lakes and springs in response to the florida springs and aquifer protection act passed in 2014 the springshed initiative began to monitor and reduce nutrient contamination in all springsheds in florida in this context the florida department of environmental protection fdep has set the nitrate limit to 0 35 mg l to maintain spring health fdep 2014 over the past few decades the nitrate n concentrations in florida s springs have significantly exceeded the 0 35 mg l standard as a result of human activities katz et al 2009 such as over fertilization of agricultural lands and lawns leakage from septic tanks polluted stormwater runoff from transportation corridors and contamination from wastewater effluent reed et al 2018 an analysis of 328 private drinking water wells in florida revealed that 66 of the wells were heavily contaminated by nitrate fdep 2012 the upper floridan aquifer ufa the most productive groundwater system in the u s is highly vulnerable to contaminants due to the karstification of its landscape characterized by the change of porosity in interconnected caves conduits and underground drainage channels ghasemizadeh et al 2012 ritter et al 2007 best management practices bmps for stormwater treatment have been developed to reduce both nitrate contaminants in urban surface runoff and in groundwater

nitrate by 57 the construction of a bam blanket filter is shown in fig 1 further details are presented in section 2 field experiments and process based numerical models have been used for evaluating the cumulative effects of bmps implemented at various spatial scales almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 sahu and gu 2009 shultz et al 2018 serving as tools for decision making on mitigation measures however to our knowledge current studies have not evaluated the performance of bam nitrate removal in karst systems the objective of this paper is to evaluate the nitrate reduction by bam based blanket filters in a karst groundwater system i e the silver springs springshed in florida using numerical models a version of modflow conduit flow process cfpv2 and the conduit mass transport three dimensional models cmt3d reimann et al 2013a 2013b 2013c spiessl et al 2007 were employed to address the variability of nitrate n concentration in blanket filter effluent the model simulates flow and contaminant transport in both porous medium and conduits sullivan et al 2019 xu et al 2015 in this paper the model was used to evaluate the effects of bam based blanket filters which are implemented in twenty six srbs in transportation corridors this study also considers an aggressive bam implementation scenario that considers multiple bmps having a combined drainage area equivalent to 50 of the urban area near the silver springs i e city of ocala this scenario is included to provide a guidance on nutrient control policies and future investment plans of nutrient reduction technologies this study seeks to answer the following questions 1 what is the potential for bam based blanket filters in stormwater basins to mitigate groundwater nitrate as compared to the baseline condition in a karst aquifer 2 what is the long term effectiveness of bam based blanket filters in reducing nitrate n concentrations in spring discharge 2 study area and methodology this section is organized as follows 1 introduction of the study area 2 model description and 3 bam blanket filter scenarios 2 1 study area silver springs fl 2 1 1 springshed characteristics the silver springs springshed with an area of about 2323 km2 is delineated using the potentiometric surface of the ufa fig 2 silver springs which is the head water of the silver river is the largest spring group in florida with an average discharge of 8 1 m3 s during the period of 2010 2016 the climate is humid subtropical with rainy summers and dry winters phelps 2004 the average annual temperature is 21 8 c and the average annual precipitation is 1290 mm the aquifer system of the springshed is comprised of the surficial aquifer the ufa a middle semi confining unit and the lower floridan aquifer the ufa is mainly composed of ocala limestone and the thickness of the ufa is about 90 m canion et al 2019 sepulveda 2002 a majority 86 of spring discharge is from the upper 30 m of the ufa faulkner 1973 the ufa is confined in most parts of the springshed except some areas where the ocala limestone crops out phelps 2004 the ufa in the western part of the springshed is near the land surface where the recharge rates are relatively higher especially in the central western portion of the springshed where there are numerous closed sinkhole depressions phelps 2004 most of the rainfall either drains directly into sinkholes or seepages into the unconfined limestone of the ufa since surface drainage is not abundant phelps 2004 groundwater flow in the ufa may occur both in the rock matrix and fractures due to the dual porosity characteristics of the aquifer phelps 2004 fractures are distributed mainly around the spring outlet where the hydraulic conductivity and groundwater flow velocity are relatively higher compared with the rock matrix faulkner 1973 these karstified features facilitate the recharge activity and correspondingly nitrate transport to the aquifer 2 1 2 lulc population density and trends in nitrate n concentration the land use and land cover lulc in the springshed is comprised of agriculture residential forest barren land i e sparse vegetation and fallow ground transportation rangeland wetlands and streams and lakes fig 3 data obtained from https data floridaswater opendata arcgis com the predominant lulc prior to 1995 included agricultural land and forest since the nitrogen source in forested land is atmospheric deposition and the associated nitrogen load is small fertilizer seepage from agriculture land is the main source of nitrate in groundwater with population growth the urban area including residential and transportation areas has gradually replaced agricultural and forest lands since 1995 most of the residents within the springshed use onsite sewage disposal systems such as septic tanks fdep 2012 and the transportation land has an impervious surface producing runoff with accumulated nutrient loads from residential lawns the leakage from septic tanks fertilizer applications to lawns and stormwater runoff from roads contribute significant nitrate loads to groundwater the population in the springshed is mainly concentrated in the city of ocala which is located at the west side of the silver springs data obtained from the u s census bureau indicate that population density has increased by 22 from 2000 to 2016 fig 4 a fig 4b and 4c show the observed nitrate n concentrations in the silver springs which were obtained from the literature fdep 2006 2012 and st johns river water management district https www sjrwmd com data from the 1900 s to the 1960 s a period with less anthropogenic influences on the environment the nitrate n concentration was 0 3 0 4 mg l on average fig 4c this nitrate n concentration can be considered as the natural level and is the restoration target for the spring since the 1960s the nitrate n concentration has dramatically increased due to agricultural development and urbanization population density and nitrate n concentration in the spring discharge have increased from 2000 to 2016 and there is a linear correlation r 2 0 62 between them as shown in fig 4d indicating that increase of nitrate n concentration is correlated with the growth of population density actions have been undertaken for protecting the spring in the past 10 years and particularly spring restoration projects have been conducted in 2015 for reducing the nitrogen load from human activities the total nitrogen has been reduced by 12 5 i e 42 565 kg n for urban fertilizer 2 8 i e 96 668 kg n for agricultural fertilizer and 1 5 i e 11 022 kg n for onsite sewage treatment and disposal systems fdep 2015 the observed mean annual nitrate n concentration has been reduced from 1 26 mg l in 2015 to 1 14 mg l in 2016 following the restoration projects green arrows in fig 4c 2 2 model description 2 2 1 the epm model model development is shown as a flowchart in fig 5 the first step is to develop a three dimensional groundwater flow epm equivalent porous media model which was created using modflow the model domain is discretized into 496 rows and 236 columns with the cell size of 190 5 m by 190 5 m fig 6 a as shown in fig 6b layers 1 and 2 represent the oligocene formation surficial aquifer and miocene formation intermediate confining unit respectively according to the hydrogeologic units of the floridan aquifer described in faulkner 1973 layer 3 represents the avon park formation which presents the ocala limestone i e the ufa the base of the model layer 4 is the semi confining layer underlying the ufa the top of model layer 1 is at the bottom of surface sand cover this layer is also the top of the intermediate confining unit the top of model layer 2 coincides with the bottom of model layer 1 and the bottom of model layer 2 is the top of the ufa the determination of layer thickness was based on the north florida southeast georgia nfseg model which was developed by the st johns river water management district sjrwmd durden et al 2013 the silver springshed is included in this model boundary according to the data used in the nfseg model the thicknesses of layers 1 and 2 in the epm model are both set uniformly to 9 m but layer 3 can be variable exceeding 300 m in the west but thinning to about 60 m in the central areas according to boring logs conducted in the field near the springs the material within the depth 0 to 3 m is mainly clayed sand further faulkner 1973 reported that the surficial aquifer which is composed of marine sand and clay ranges from 0 to 30 m in thickness and the intermediate confining unit where clay and hard dense sand are the dominant material ranges from 0 to 30 m therefore the thickness values set in the model are within the ranges of values in both the documentation and observations for the epm model the springshed fig 2 is set as a no flux boundary because the springshed is delineated using potentiometric head and it is can be considered as a subsurface drainage basin thus no lateral flow occurred at the boundary the boundary conditions of the nfseg model are a result of extensive calibration done using multiple observed groundwater wells scattered over florida and georgia as such aquifer properties and some of the boundary conditions e g rivers and lakes for layers in the domain of the epm model remain the same as those used in the nfseg model specifically a head dependent flux boundary was used to simulate rivers lakes as well as streams the boundary condition for these water bodies was determined according to the nfseg model only one discharge point in the springshed silver springs is assumed for the model and treated as a drain boundary hydraulic conductivities from the nfseg model were used in the epm model as described durden et al 2013 used groundwater head at monitoring wells across the domain to calibrate the hydraulic conductivities in the nfseg model in the epm model calibrated horizontal hydraulic conductivities in layer 1 range from 3 10 5 to 5 10 5 m s at the central and western parts of the study region in other areas conductivities range from 4 10 6 to 3 10 5 m s the horizontal hydraulic conductivity distribution in layer 2 is similar to but much higher than layer 1 at the central and western parts of the study area horizontal hydraulic conductivities range from 3 10 4 to 0 06 m s caused by the cropping out of ocala limestone in some parts around the silver springs hydraulic conductivities in layer 3 is much higher than that in layer 2 e g 0 02 to 0 3 m s in the central and western parts of the study area due to fractures and conduits but the distribution is similar as layer 2 vertical hydraulic conductivities in layers 1 and 2 are much lower than horizontal conductivities in particular at the north and south of the study region because the aquifer consists of low permeable rock matrix with clay or other horizontal low permeability layers for reasons discussed earlier conduit networks are assumed to be predominantly in the deeper part of the aquifer are simulated in layer 3 in the epm model high hydraulic conductivity cells were used for representing karst features in the ufa modflow can not simulate flow regimes in karst features well using high hydraulic conductivity cells and is limited to laminar conditions therefore the cfpv2 and cmt3d model was used to simulate flow and contaminant transport in the silver springshed the mechanisms for the two models are described in the following sections 2 2 2 cfpv2 for flow modeling cfpv2 simulates flows in both rock matrix and conduits darcy s law is applicable in the rock matrix where the flow is laminar and the governing equation is 1 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z s s h t w where k x k y and k z lt 1 are the hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z directions respectively h l is the hydraulic head w is the source and or sink term t 1 s s l 1 is the specific storage of the porous material and t t is time eq 1 is solved by modflow harbaugh 2005 the flow in conduits is turbulent and the darcy weisbach equation is used for calculating the hydraulic head shoemaker et al 2007 2 h l f δ l d v 2 2 g where h l is the head loss along the conduit length δ l l f is the friction factor d is the conduit diameter l v is the average velocity lt 1 and g is the gravitational acceleration constant lt 2 conduit network consists of discrete cylindrical tubes and nodes in the model the nodes located in each modflow cell compute the exchange between tubes and rock matrix the flow exchange between the rock matrix and a conduit node is computed by the following equation 3 q ex α i j k h n h i j k where q ex is the volumetric exchange flow rate l3t 1 α i j k is the pipe conductance at cell i j k l2t 1 h n is the head at the conduit node n and h i j k is the head at the cell i j k 2 2 3 the cmt3d modeling cmt3d simulates the contaminant transport in both the rock matrix and conduits reimann et al 2013a and it is an extension of mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 which is a three dimensional groundwater solute transport model the nitrate transport in the rock matrix is modeled by 4 θ c no 3 t x i θ d ij c no 3 x j x i θ ν i c no 3 q s c s no 3 r where θ is the porosity of the porous medium c no 3 ml 3 is the nitrate n concentration x i l is the distance along the direction i d ij l2t 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient ν i lt 1 is the linear pore water velocity q s t 1 is the volumetric flow rate per unit volume of aquifer representing sources and sinks c s no 3 ml 3 is the nitrate n concentration of the source and sink flux and r ml 3t 1 is the chemical reaction term the sorption of nitrate is assumed to be negligible due to its high mobility exner et al 2014 wei et al 2018 and the reaction kinetics term in this model was excluded in the simulation to generate more conservative solutions for policy making in this study c s no 3 represents the nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge for a conservative assessment r term may be relaxed temporarily the method for quantifying the spatial and temporal variability of c s no 3 is described in the following section the nitrate transport in conduits is modeled by advective transport module clark 2009 5 c j t v j c x d 2 c x 2 where c j ml 3 is the nitrate n concentration in a conduit tube v j is the velocity lt 1 and d l2t 1 is the dispersion coefficient the dispersion and chemical reaction in conduits are not considered in this study due to the limited residence time 2 2 4 converting epm to cfpv2 the second step in model development is to use a steady state cfpv2 model for quantifying conduit parameters the study period for the steady state and transient simulations are both considerably short 16 30 years compared to that of conduit evolution e g hundreds or thousands of years therefore conduit parameters will remain constant during the entire simulation period and the steady state model can be used to quantify the conduit parameters the steady state cfpv2 model was created by incorporating conduit networks simulated by conduit nodes and discrete cylindrical pipes shoemaker et al 2007 in the ufa the third layer of the epm model where karstic features are distributed faulkner 1973 phelps 2004 faulkner 1973 delineated a fracture and possible faults map in central florida however it is still a challenge to identify conduit structures in this area in particular in silver springshed conduit structures in this study were determined based on sinkhole locations since groundwater enters karst systems through surface infiltration and direct injection of runoff into conduits via sinkholes sinkhole locations likely provide the underlying karst structure faulkner 1973 ghasemizadeh et al 2012 as such the model uses known sinkhole locations to characterize the karst arrangement as seen in fig 2 specifically model cells with a high density of sinkholes are represented as a pipe having conduit parameters e g diameter length in the cfpv2 model accordingly there are seven conduits developed in the cfpv2 model fig 2 which are comprised of 687 discrete cylindrical conduit pipes hydraulic conductivity in the matrix around the conduits is still low therefore the hydraulic conductivity values in these cells were lowered to the average hydraulic conductivity values of the surrounding matrix a tracer study conducted by fdep 2011 reported that there are no mature conduits in the upper portion of the springshed therefore conduits were assigned mostly in the central west portion of the domain fig 2 the boundary conditions of the epm model described in section 2 2 1 were retained in the cfpv2 model the sources of groundwater recharge in the springshed include net precipitation rainfall minus evapotranspiration surface flow into sinkholes irrigation on agricultural lands and discharge from onsite sewage disposal system durden et al 2013 reported that the estimation of aquifer recharge of the entire model involves land use soil evapotranspiration and stream flow data a long term averaged recharge rates across the springshed were set in the first layer of the steady state model ranging from 0 to 588 mm year durden et al 2013 in particular higher recharge rates are mostly distributed in the central and western parts of the springshed where a high density of sinkholes is distributed the steady state simulation used a single one day time step to investigate and project the annual nitrate n concentration in silver springs a flow simulation in a transient state was conducted from 2000 to 2030 by setting the recharge factor in the modflow cfp program as one to represent the recharge values in the steady state model in the transient simulation recharge factors were quantified by calibration using annual water levels in 13 monitoring wells and annual discharge of silver springs from 2000 to 2020 for instance recharge factor ranged from 1 to 3 may be applied to wet years years with higher recharge rate whereas 0 1 may be used for dry years the recharge factors from 2001 to 2010 were used for the projection period 2021 2030 by assuming the values between the two periods are the same annual stress periods with a daily time step were used effective porosity governs the velocity of groundwater movement in transient simulations fine to course grained sands are the dominant material in the surficial aquifer and the effective porosity for layer 1 is set as 0 25 model layer 2 is a semi confining layer where clay is the main soil type combined with sands and some hard limestone and the effective porosity for layer 2 is set as 0 05 an effective porosity of 0 3 was used for layer 3 because the aquifer is loose and fractures are highly distributed these porosity values are also within the ranges of porosity documented in phelps 2004 2 2 5 cmt3d hydraulic head and groundwater flow simulated by the transient cfpv2 model in both the rock matrix and conduits are used by the cmt3d to simulate nitrate transport as shown in fig 5 cfpv2 generates the link mt3dms file for matrix transport lmt6 and the link cmt3d file for conduit transport lct6 cmt3d uses these files to sequentially calculate transport through the matrix using mt3dms and then calculate transport through conduits using an advective transport model spiessl et al 2002 flux between the matrix and conduits is calculated using eq 3 in the transport model three parameters are required to simulate nitrate n concentration in silver springs the dispersion coefficient in the rock matrix and the conduits and the nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge i e input nitrate n concentration the dispersion coefficient in conduits is neglected in this study the recharge rates and head difference along the conduits result in a high velocity and a more turbulent flow regime resulting in a very low residence time of the groundwater in conduits making dispersion unlikely the dispersion coefficient in the rock matrix was estimated through a tracer test conducted from may 2019 to march 2020 on the field sites in the city of ocala near the silver springs tracer tests were conducted by injecting three different dyes into three monitoring wells and sampling downstream at a daily frequency the two region non equilibrium transport model in the cxtfit program toride et al 1999 was applied to analyze the tracer dye results nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge which is assigned as constant head boundary in the first layer of the transport model is described in the following section the study period of the transport model is the same as that of the transient flow model 2000 to 2030 with annual stress periods simulated at a daily time step 2 2 6 nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge opportunities for improving model fidelity can be found in improved estimation of nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge for which the observation data are usually not available it has been reported that lulc appleyard 1995 mcmahon et al 2008 robertson et al 2000 trojan et al 2003 and population density gardner and vogel 2005 affects the recharge nitrate n concentrations nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge was estimated for each type of lulc and the area change for each lulc type has been calculated as described in section 2 1 2 the nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge was set to 4 mg l for agricultural land and 0 12 mg l for forested land phelps 2004 for residential and transportation lands the population density was used as the factor for estimating the spatial and temporal change of nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge as population increases the nitrate n concentration from septic tanks and lawn fertilizer may also increase within a given residential area further more impervious areas i e transportation corridors may be developed as a result of population growth and more stormwater runoff from these areas are generated fig 4d shows the linear relationship between population density in city of ocala and observed nitrate n concentration in spring discharge in this study the nitrate n concentrations in groundwater recharge c input m l3 for urban and transportation lands were assumed to be linearly proportional to population density p d pop l2 6 c input k p d b the slope k m l3 and the background concentration b m l3 were estimated during calibration of the transport model since the transport model is a cold start model concentration of contaminant is simulated from zero at the beginning of the modeling period the initial conditions were initialized by running the model from 1995 to 2000 with recharge nitrate n concentration estimated using population densities from this respective period during calibration the simulated annual nitrate n concentration was compared with its observed counterpart the focus of this study is to analyze the potential for bmp in srbs to mitigate nitrate at a given nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge as compared to the condition without bmp implementation simulation of nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge through time is outside the scope of this study further after the implementation of spring restoration projects from 2015 described in section 2 1 2 nitrogen loads at the land surface should be controlled therefore it was assumed that nitrate n concentrations in groundwater recharge for the years from 2017 were the same as that in 2016 till the implementation of bmp in 2021 assuming no changes in lulc and population density 2 2 7 model calibration and validation model calibration progressed sequentially beginning with hydrologic calibration of the steady state cfpv2 model recharge calibration of the transient model then progressing to calibration of the cmt3d model hydraulic conductivity conduit diameter d tortuosity and conductance α i j k were calibrated in the steady state cfpv2 model calibration targets of the steady state cfpv2 model includes mean observed water levels in 13 monitoring wells in the springshed fig 2 and mean observed discharge of silver springs over the period from 2000 to 2016 particularly the hydraulic conductivity values around the conduits were lowered to the average hydraulic conductivity values for the surrounding matrix after calibration the inter annual variability of groundwater recharge was estimated through the calibration of the transient cfpv2 model by taking the observed water levels in 13 monitoring wells fig 2 and the observed discharge of the silver springs as calibration targets the variable annual recharge was calibrated by applying an adjustment factor to the recharge used in the steady state model finally the nitrate transport model cmt3d was calibrated and validated by matching the observed annual average nitrate n concentration in spring discharge fig 4b the two parameters in eq 6 were estimated during the calibration period 2000 2008 and the nitrate transport model was validated during 2009 2016 2 3 bam based blanket filter scenarios bam based blanket filter as a bmp could be used to further reduce the nitrate n concentration bam is a type of green sorption medium and made from a mixture of natural and recycled materials containing sand clay and tire crumb the clay content in bam helps to keep moisture within the medium for a longer time which is essential for the survival of microbial community for denitrification o reilly et al 2014 salamah 2014 bam requires relatively less area compared to other bmps sirianuntapiboon et al 2006 in an srb near the silver springs bam was set up within a depth of 1 2 m so that the blank filter is above the local groundwater table fig 1 such shallow blanket filter has been tested in the field and the average nitrate reduction over seven rainfall events is 57 wen et al 2019a b the calibrated and validated groundwater and nitrate transport model was utilized to assess the effectiveness of the bam based blanket filter on nitrate reduction by comparison with a baseline condition in which no blanket filter is implemented a portion of nitrate in stormwater is removed by natural soil profile before stormwater recharges the groundwater to evaluate the net effects of bam based blanket filters on removing nitrate in the silver springs the spatial heterogeneity of nitrate removal in the soil is considered in this study kibler et al 2020 collected soil samples in the srbs as well as other areas in central florida and reported the observed nitrate removal efficiencies of the soils are 50 74 and 92 a negative nitrate removal efficiency indicates that it is possible in some cases for the soil matrix to contribute to the nitrate n concentration in the groundwater by scouring of the soil medium two bmp scenarios are considered both of which are assumed to be implemented in 2021 the first bmp scenario is to implement blanket filters in the twenty six srbs owned by the florida department of transportation fdot and the second scenario is to implement blanket filters in multiple srbs located in ocala for a combined drainage area of half of the city area fig 7 the total drainage area of the twenty six srbs is 14 9 km2 which accounts for 0 64 of the springshed area the drainage area for the second scenario is 111 9 km2 and accounts for 9 6 of the springshed area assuming a 10 year longevity of bam the effects of bmp on nitrate reduction are assessed for the period of 2021 2030 during which the input nitrate n concentrations are assumed to be constant the recharge for this period is adopted from the period of 2001 2010 3 results 3 1 groundwater flow 3 1 1 steady state cfpv2 model the calibrated conduit parameters from the steady state cfpv2 flow model are shown in table 1 and the index for each conduit is shown in fig 2 the conduit diameter and conductance were estimated for each conduit the calibrated values for conduit diameter range from 1 5 m to 6 0 m the diameters for conduits 1 2 6 and 7 which are the main conduits fig 2 were estimated as 6 0 m the conduit 5 has a diameter of 1 5 m which merges to conduit 2 fig 2 the vent diameter for silver spring has been reported to be 11 m ghosh et al 2016 sepulveda 2002 and the conduit diameter in the ufa has been reported as ranging from 3 m to 6 m xu et al 2015 higher conductance values are calibrated for some conduits e g conduit 1 2 6 and 7 shown in table 1 hovorka et al 1995 reported that the conductance for karst aquifers ranges from 3 10 6 to 1 8 m2 day the roughness height was assumed to be uniform over the 7 conduits and the estimated value is 0 05 m the range of tortuosity carbonate aquifers has been reported from 1 to 3 9 assari and mohammadi 2017 worthington 2015 and the tortuosity for each conduit in this study was estimated as 1 5 the observed versus simulated average water levels during 2000 2016 in the monitoring wells fig 2 are shown in fig 8 a the average root mean square error rmse and relative error between simulated and observed water levels are 0 47 m and 2 respectively the relative error for the simulated mean spring discharge is 5 3 1 2 transient cfpv2 model the range of the adjustment factor is 1 1 5 for dry years and 3 4 5 for wet years fig 8a shows the scatter plot of observed versus simulated water levels in the monitoring wells the rmse of simulated heads is 0 66 m 0 62 m for the calibration validation period and the relative errors are 4 for both the calibration and validation periods fig 8b shows the time series of simulated and observed annual spring discharge the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse for simulated discharge is 0 93 0 94 for the calibration validation period and the relative error is 2 3 for the calibration validation period these statistics indicate the good performance of the transient groundwater flow model 3 2 nitrate transport the calibrated nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge for three types of lulc from 2000 to 2016 is shown in fig 9 the nitrate n concentrations in recharge for agricultural and forested lands are constants as described in section 2 2 4 the slope k and intercept b in eq 6 were calibrated as 7000 mg l km2 people and 0 03 mg l respectively the natural background concentration of nitrate in 200 wells was smaller than 0 10 mg l in the study by panno et al 2006 in fig 4b nitrate n concentration was 0 04 mg l in 1904 with population around 3380 uscb 1995 therefore it is reasonable to consider the calibrated intercept as the background concentration of nitrate moreover the longitudinal dispersivity yielded from the tracer data is 1 8 m and the ratio of longitudinal to transverse dispersivity is set to 0 1 both values are on the same magnitudes as previously reported ones in the ufa reed et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 fig 10 shows the simulated and observed mean annual nitrate n concentration in spring discharge during the calibration 2000 2008 and validation periods 2009 2016 the rmse for the calibration validation period is 0 06 mg l 0 09 mg l and the relative error for the calibration validation period is 4 5 the difference between observed and simulated nitrate n concentration i e 2010 could be due to other factors than lulc and population density such as the variation of fertilizer application rates harper 2014 as shown in fig 10 the nitrate n concentration positively correlates with recharge and spring discharge for example the observed nitrate n concentration reached to a high value at a peaked spring discharge i e 2005 and decreased gradually as the discharge reduced i e 2005 2007 groundwater recharge during storm events strongly depends on hydrologic conditions and land use hem 1985 huebsch et al 2014 nitrate in the soil is accumulated to a high level prior to storm events in agricultural and urban lawn areas higher recharge in wet years mobilizes and transports more nitrate into the aquifer therefore the nitrate in this system is transport limited instead of nitrate supply limited and the recharge rate has an enrichment effect on nitrate n concentration the relation between hydrologic conditions and concentration is similar as that reported in duncan et al 2017 and it shows the higher concentrations coupled with higher discharge values contributed to higher nitrate fluxes in the higher hydrologic conditions based on the observations of nitrate time series over multiple seasons the implementation of spring restoration projects in 2015 and 2016 were included in the simulation by importing the nitrate reductions into cmt3d model and the annual nitrate shows a decline after 2015 besides the effect of variation of annual recharge the nitrate n concentration increased from 2016 to 2018 due to the increasing recharge and then reduced to 1 14 mg l in 2020 which is about 4 times of the restoration target fig 10 3 3 effects of bmp the net effects of two bmp scenarios on nitrate reduction in the spring discharge are shown in fig 10 considering the effect of restoration project section 2 1 2 the input nitrate n concentration in 2016 was used for the period of 2017 2020 the fluctuations of nitrate n concentration during 2017 2020 and the projection period 2021 2030 are due to the inter annual variation of recharge for example the nitrate n concentration in a wet year e g 2030 is higher than that in a dry year e g 2029 in scenario 1 bam based blanket filters have almost no effect on reduction of the nitrate n concentration in the spring discharge in a normal year e g 2026 compared to the baseline condition without bam implemented compared to the averaged observed nitrate n concentration over the period from 2000 to 2020 there will be a 0 6 net improvement to 2 9 net degradation in nitrate n concentration based on different soil removal efficiencies in the projection period table 2 this is due to the limited drainage area which only accounts for 0 64 of the springshed area and small amount of stormwater treated by bam based blanket filters in the 26 fdot srbs further the bmp investigated in this study involves the removal and replacement of part of the soil profile with bam media whether the bam based blanket filters lead to net water quality improvements or degradation depends on whether the bam removes more or less nitrate from stormwater than the unaltered soil profile therefore the slight effect of this scenario is also probably caused by the performance difference between the nitrate removal of bam 57 and unaltered soil 50 to 92 when more or larger bam based blanket filters are implemented thus treating a larger drainage area the net improvement or degradation of nitrate n concentration in spring discharge would be more significant for instance given a nitrate removal efficiency of 74 in soil the nitrate n concentration will be reduced to 1 08 mg l in 2026 i e a 4 9 reduction relative to the baseline condition shown in scenario 2 during a wet year specifically 2023 the nitrate n concentration would be slightly higher at 1 19 mg l and slightly lower during a dry year 2029 compared to the averaged observed nitrate n concentration over 2000 2020 there will be a 15 8 net improvement to 23 8 net degradation in nitrate n concentration in the projection period table 2 as shown in fig 10 the nitrate n concentration in spring discharge will have quick responses to the bam based blanket filters for example from a dry year 2022 to a wet year 2023 nitrate n concentration will increase without a delay similarly due to the insufficient recharge a quick and continuous decline on nitrate n concentration will occur over the period from 2025 to 2027 these quick responses are resulted from the flow and nitrate transport in conduits huebsch et al 2014 as shown in fig 7 most of the bam implementation areas are located at the central springshed where subsurface medium has been maturely karstified faulkner 1973 a large proportion of attenuated nitrate filtered in the top soil and bam layers of the blanket filters may mobilize into conduits from the surrounding rock matrix or from blanket filters directly however treated nitrate in the rock matrix can hardly change nitrate n concentrations within groundwater storage given the large volume peterson et al 2002 hence the proportion of treated nitrate in conduits may dominate the fluctuations of the nitrate n concentration in the aquifer lack of denitrification capacity leads to few nitrate reductions occurring in conduits and the nitrate n concentration in the aquifer does not continue to decline before it reaches the springs the quantitative analysis of nitrate in conduits is discussed in the following section model results did not provide convincing evidence that even with a large scale implementation of bam based stormwater bmp nitrate n concentrations in silver springs could be reduced to a reasonable level fig 10 for instance the largest bmp scale investigated scenario 2 bam blanket filters are implemented in 50 of city area yielded a mean net improvement of 15 8 up to 24 net degradation in silver springs nitrate n concentrations from 2021 to 2030 table 2 this modeling study indicates that the spring water quality benefits accruing from implementation of bam based stormwater bmps are ambiguous a wide range of outcomes are possible ranging from water quality improvements to net degradation fig 10 this result points to a critical knowledge gap that should be addressed before large scale investments into bam based blanket filters whether bam based blanket filters lead to a net water quality improvement or degradation depends on whether bam removes more or less nutrients from stormwater compared to the unaltered soil profile for instance if stormwater infiltration through the soil profile into the groundwater increases the nitrate concentration then any given bmp would need to have a removal efficiency equal to or higher to prevent degradation of the water quality the construction of the bmp investigated in this study involves the removal of a portion of the soil profile replaced with bam media in some springshed locations replacing the soil profile with bam will lead to greater nutrient removal in other cases the natural removal of the unaltered soil profile will exceed that of the bam media the spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrient remediation properties introduces considerable uncertainty to the potential cumulative water quality improvements offered by bam based blanket filters the cumulative impact of large scale bam implementation will be on the higher end of net improvement estimated in this study 15 8 decrease in nitrate concentration if and only if bam replaces soils with the poorest possible nutrient remediation potential i e those which generate 50 of nitrate therefore the most pressing concern is how to differentiate between soils that will benefit from bam replacement and those which will not this requires addressing a critical knowledge gap regarding the relative nutrient remediation potential of bam versus soils of variable properties the uncertainty in soil heterogeneity can be resolved but only after achieving greater understanding of nutrient transformations within soils of variable properties and then understanding how those variable soils are distributed spatially these two questions need to be answered to assist water resources managers in making cost effective decisions regarding bmp implementation if we assume that poor soils low nitrate removal efficiency which are good candidates for replacement with bam can be isolated then the modeling study indicates that the bam based blanket filters benefit is likely to scale with penetration i e greater water quality benefits can be expected with greater bmp implementation however this study suggests that even the maximum expected benefits may be nominal the greatest net improvement scenario 2 was achieved assuming that bam blanket filter media was installed in 50 of the city area which is associated with a great cost to taxpayers while still representing large investments scenario 2 is a more realistic scenario to predict possible net improvements removing the uncertainty in soil nitrate removal at best scenario 2 would lead to maximum net water quality reduction of 15 8 in nitrate in the spring considering the resources required for such implementation and the limited water quality benefits the bam based blanket filters investigated may not be a rational investment to improve silver springs water quality given the modest improvements that can be expected with realistic bam based blanket filters implementation scenarios water quality in silver springs would still fall quite short of restoration targets to achieve restoration goals in silver springs non transportation sources of nutrients such as agricultural applications and septic tanks also need to be controlled or treated the groundwater flow and transport models developed herein could be used to evaluate the efficiency of a larger suite of remediation measures in conjunction with transportation related bmps additionally the model used in this study can be used for other karst springsheds within florida 4 discussions 4 1 effects of conduits on flow and nitrate transport the conduit network in the springshed plays an important role on the flow path of groundwater and by association the nitrate transport using the conduit network shown in fig 2 for model calibration it was estimated that 48 of spring discharge and 47 of nitrate mass are transported through the conduits for the validation period it is expected that a higher percentage of groundwater discharge and nitrate would be transported through the conduit network in wet years for instance when considering just 2019 a wet year the percentage of spring discharge and nitrate through conduits is 51 and 61 as shown in fig 11 the percentages of flow and nitrate contributed from conduits increase with recharge positive trend lines fitted to the data with an r 2 value of 0 61 for flow and 0 79 for nitrate indicate the increasing contribution of conduit flow and transport for wet years and high flow springsheds in the wet years with higher recharge the hydraulic head in the matrix is higher which induces more flow into the conduits from the matrix 4 2 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of spring discharge to model parameters was evaluated for assessing the discharge uncertainty in the model characterization sensitivity simulations were conducted by increasing and decreasing the calibrated conduit parameters by 25 50 and 75 fig 12 a shows the sensitivity of spring discharge averaged over the 2000 2016 period to changes in selected parameters conduit diameter conductance and roughness height the spring discharge is most sensitive to conduit diameter shown in fig 12a specifically if the conduit diameter were increased by 25 spring discharge would be increased by 25 if conduit conductance were to increase by 25 spring discharge would only be increased by 7 the spring discharge is least sensitive to the conduit roughness height showing just a 2 decrease in spring discharge when roughness height was increased by 25 the conduit diameter is the most important parameter among the three due to its strong relationship with the average velocity theoretically higher conduit diameter and conductance mean higher drainage capacity of matrix and conduit network therefore the parameter sets of the conduit network play important roles on the variation of spring discharge the impact of aquifer properties on nitrate presence in spring discharge was assessed by performing a sensitivity analysis on the effective porosity fig 12b shows simulated nitrate n concentrations in spring discharge with effective porosities of the ufa ranging from 0 2 to 0 4 as compared to the calibrated value 0 3 higher effective porosities of the ufa results in lower nitrate concentrations present in spring discharge aquifers with lower effective porosities tends to show nitrate transport being more sensitive to the recharge variation ho and webb 1998 5 conclusions in this study cfpv2 and cmt3d models were applied to discover the effect of a bam based stormwater bmp on nitrate removal in the discharge of silver springs given the nitrate removal efficiency of the bam based blanket filter and spatial heterogeneity of soil nitrate removal tested by field experiments the net effect of the bmp on nitrate removal in karst areas was evaluated using the model modeling results show that the nitrate n concentration present in karst springsheds is higher in wetter years with higher recharge therefore the inter annual variation of nitrate concentration is controlled by the hydrologic condition for the scenario implementing 26 srbs having a combined drainage area of 14 9 km2 and e g a 74 soil removal efficiency the reduction of nitrate in spring discharge will be less than 1 compared to the baseline condition when considering the more aggressive scenario implementation of multiple bmps with a combined drainage area of 111 9 km2 the nitrate n concentration in spring discharge will be reduced by 4 9 for a normal recharge year and can decline to up to 0 97 mg l for a dry year further compared to the observed nitrate n concentration over the period from 2000 to 2020 there will be a range of 15 8 net improvement to 23 8 net degradation in nitrate n concentration in the projection period the modeling study indicates that the bam based blanket filters benefit is likely to scale with penetration i e greater water quality benefits can be expected with greater bmp implementation however this study suggests that even the maximum expected benefits may be nominal the greatest possible net improvement scenario 2 was achieved assuming bam based blanket filters were installed in multiple fdot srbs which will be a great investment for water resources management other restoration measures are necessary to meet the restoration target for example considering that nitrate from agricultural lands accounts for a large proportion of pollution in groundwater other bmps on or near agricultural lands could be implemented for further nitrate removal conduit networks play an important role in groundwater flow and nitrate transport in the silver springs springshed an average percentage of mass transport from conduits is 48 for water and 47 for nitrate moreover the linear relationship between recharge and flow nitrate contribution of conduits indicates that higher percentages of flow and nitrate are transported through conduits to the spring outlets in wetter years this study is the first regional scale application of the numerical model to evaluate the effect of bmp nitrate removal in karst springsheds providing a useful tool for water resources managers the input nitrate n concentration is simply assumed as a function of land use and land cover change and population density future analysis could focus on 1 including more factors to quantify the input nitrate n concentration 2 quantifying the reaction kinetics for the critical biogeochemical processes in the karst environment and 3 determining the location and treatment scale of blanket filters based on this regional scale modeling of bmp

5091,understanding the effects of best management practices bmps on nitrate reduction in karst aquifers is critical for spring restoration in this study conduit flow process cfpv2 and conduit mass three dimensional cmt3d models were applied to evaluate nitrate removal for silver springs in florida using blanket filters composed of biosorption activated media bam as the inputs of the model the spatial and temporal variability of nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge was estimated as a function of population and land use reflecting both point and non point sources of nitrate additionally the spatial heterogeneity of nitrate removal efficiency in the soil was considered in the evaluation the model estimates that conduit flow accounts for 48 of spring discharge and 47 of nitrate n mass transport on average and the contributions of conduit to flow and nitrate mass transport are higher during wet years the net effect of nitrate reduction in spring discharge was evaluated for two bmp scenarios i e implementing bam based blanket filters in 26 stormwater retention basins and 50 of the urban area the net effect of the bmp on nitrate reduction for scenario 1 is limited whereas for scenario 2 the nitrate n concentration will be reduced to 1 08 mg l in 2026 for a nitrate removal efficiency of 74 i e a 4 9 reduction relative to the baseline condition this study suggests that the bam based blanket filters benefit is likely to scale with penetration i e greater water quality benefits can be expected with greater bmp implementation further this study shows that whether bam based blanket filters leads to net water quality improvements or degradation depends on whether bam removes more or less nutrients from stormwater than the unaltered soil profile the simulated effects of the bmp on nitrate reduction may serve as an additional guidance for water resources managers to make decisions on investments in nutrient reduction technologies for spring restorations in karst systems keywords karst spring nitrate conduits stormwater best management practices 1 introduction groundwater serves as the primary source of drinking water for many

restore the quality of water bodies such as streams lakes and springs in response to the florida springs and aquifer protection act passed in 2014 the springshed initiative began to monitor and reduce nutrient contamination in all springsheds in florida in this context the florida department of environmental protection fdep has set the nitrate limit to 0 35 mg l to maintain spring health fdep 2014 over the past few decades the nitrate n concentrations in florida s springs have significantly exceeded the 0 35 mg l standard as a result of human activities katz et al 2009 such as over fertilization of agricultural lands and lawns leakage from septic tanks polluted stormwater runoff from transportation corridors and contamination from wastewater effluent reed et al 2018 an analysis of 328 private drinking water wells in florida revealed that 66 of the wells were heavily contaminated by nitrate fdep 2012 the upper floridan aquifer ufa the most productive groundwater system in the u s is highly vulnerable to contaminants due to the karstification of its landscape characterized by the change of porosity in interconnected caves conduits and underground drainage channels ghasemizadeh et al 2012 ritter et al 2007 best management practices bmps for stormwater treatment have been developed to reduce both nitrate contaminants in urban surface runoff and in groundwater recharge bratieres et al 2008 reported that biofilters remove 70 of nitrate in urban runoff studies have shown that the water quality of bmp effluent can be improved by up to 50 when using bio

the cumulative effects of bmps implemented at various spatial scales almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 sahu and gu 2009 shultz et al 2018 serving as tools for decision making on mitigation measures however to our knowledge current studies have not evaluated the performance of bam nitrate removal in karst systems the objective of this paper is to evaluate the nitrate reduction by bam based

contaminant transport in both porous medium and conduits sullivan et al 2019 xu et al 2015 in this paper the model was used to evaluate the effects of bam based blanket filters which are implemented in twenty six srbs in transportation corridors this study also considers an aggressive bam implementation scenario that considers multiple bmps having a combined drainage area equivalent to 50 of the urban area near the silver springs i e city of ocala this scenario is included to provide a guidance on nutrient control policies and future investment plans of nutrient reduction technologies this study seeks to answer the following questions 1 what is the potential for bam based blanket filters in stormwater basins to mitigate groundwater nitrate as compared to the baseline condition in a karst aquifer 2 what is the long term effectiveness of bam based blanket filters in reducing nitrate n concentrations in spring discharge 2 study area and methodology this section is organized as follows 1 introduction of the study area 2 model description and 3 bam blanket filter scenarios 2 1 study area silver springs fl 2 1 1 springshed characteristics the silver springs springshed with an area of about 2323 km2 is delineated using the potentiometric surface of the ufa fig 2 silver springs which is the head water of the silver river is the largest spring group in florida with an average discharge of 8 1 m3 s during the period of 2010 2016 the climate is humid subtropical with rainy summers and dry winters phelps 2004 the average annual temperature is 21 8 c and the average annual precipitation is 1290 mm the aquifer system of the springshed is comprised of the surficial aquifer the ufa a middle semi confining unit and the lower floridan aquifer the ufa is mainly composed of ocala limestone and the thickness of the ufa is about 90 m canion et al 2019 sepulveda 2002 a majority 86 of spring discharge is from the upper 30 m of the ufa faulkner 1973 the ufa is confined in most parts of the springshed except some areas where the ocala limestone crops out phelps 2004 the ufa in the western part of the springshed is near the land surface where the recharge rates are relatively higher especially in the central western portion of the springshed where there are numerous closed sinkhole depressions phelps 2004 most of the rainfall either drains directly into sinkholes or seepages into the unconfined limestone of the ufa since surface drainage is not abundant phelps 2004 groundwater flow in the ufa may occur both in the rock matrix and fractures due to the dual porosity characteristics of the aquifer phelps 2004 fractures are distributed mainly around the spring outlet where the hydraulic conductivity and groundwater flow velocity are relatively higher compared with the rock matrix faulkner 1973 these karstified features facilitate the recharge activity and correspondingly nitrate transport to the aquifer 2 1 2 lulc population density and trends in nitrate n concentration the land use and land cover lulc in the springshed is comprised of agriculture residential forest barren land i e sparse vegetation and fallow ground transportation rangeland wetlands and streams and lakes fig 3 data obtained from https data floridaswater opendata arcgis com the predominant lulc prior to 1995 included agricultural land and forest since the nitrogen source in forested land is atmospheric deposition and the associated nitrogen load is small fertilizer seepage from agriculture land is the main source of nitrate in groundwater with population growth the urban area including residential and transportation areas has gradually replaced agricultural and forest lands since 1995 most of the residents within the springshed use onsite sewage disposal systems such as septic tanks fdep 2012 and the transportation land has an impervious surface producing runoff with accumulated nutrient loads from residential lawns the leakage from septic tanks fertilizer applications to lawns and stormwater runoff from roads contribute significant nitrate loads to groundwater the population in the springshed is mainly concentrated in the city of ocala which is located at the west side of the silver springs data obtained from the u s census bureau indicate that population density has increased by 22 from 2000 to 2016 fig 4 a fig 4b and 4c show the observed nitrate n concentrations in the silver springs which were obtained from the literature fdep 2006 2012 and st johns river water management district https www sjrwmd com data from the 1900 s to the 1960 s a period with less anthropogenic influences on the environment the nitrate n concentration was 0 3 0 4 mg l on average fig 4c this nitrate n concentration can be considered as the natural level and is the restoration target for the spring since the 1960s the nitrate n concentration has dramatically increased due to agricultural development and urbanization population density and nitrate n concentration in the spring discharge have increased from 2000 to 2016 and there is a linear correlation r 2 0 62 between them as shown in fig 4d indicating that increase of nitrate n concentration is correlated with the growth of population density actions have been undertaken for protecting the spring in the past 10 years and particularly spring restoration projects have been conducted in 2015 for reducing the nitrogen load from human activities the total nitrogen has been reduced by 12 5 i e 42 565 kg n for urban fertilizer 2 8 i e 96 668 kg n for agricultural fertilizer and 1 5 i e 11 022 kg n for onsite sewage treatment and disposal systems fdep 2015 the observed mean annual nitrate n concentration has been reduced from 1 26 mg l in 2015 to 1 14 mg l in 2016 following the restoration projects green arrows in fig 4c 2 2 model description 2 2 1 the epm model model development is shown as a flowchart in fig 5 the first step is to develop a three dimensional groundwater flow epm equivalent porous media model which was created using modflow the model domain is discretized into 496 rows and 236 columns with the cell size of 190 5 m by 190 5 m fig 6 a as shown in fig 6b layers 1 and 2 represent the oligocene formation surficial aquifer and miocene formation intermediate confining unit respectively according to the hydrogeologic units of the floridan aquifer described in faulkner 1973 layer 3 represents the avon park formation which presents the ocala limestone i e the ufa the base of the model layer 4 is the semi confining layer underlying the ufa the top of model layer 1 is at the bottom of surface sand cover this layer is also the top of the intermediate confining unit the top of model layer 2 coincides with the bottom of model layer 1 and the bottom of model layer 2 is the top of the ufa the determination of layer thickness was based on the north florida southeast georgia nfseg model which was developed by the st johns river water management district sjrwmd durden et al 2013 the silver springshed is included in this model boundary according to the data used in the nfseg model the thicknesses of layers 1 and 2 in the epm model are both set uniformly to 9 m but layer 3 can be variable exceeding 300 m in the west but thinning to about 60 m in the central areas according to boring logs conducted in the field near the springs the material within the depth 0 to 3 m is mainly clayed sand further faulkner 1973 reported that the surficial aquifer which is composed of marine sand and clay ranges from 0 to 30 m in thickness and the intermediate confining unit where clay and hard dense sand are the dominant material ranges from 0 to 30 m therefore the thickness values set in the model are within the ranges of values in both the documentation and observations for the epm model the springshed fig 2 is set as a no flux boundary because the springshed is delineated using potentiometric head and it is can be considered as a subsurface drainage basin thus no lateral flow occurred at the boundary the boundary conditions of the nfseg model are a result of extensive calibration done using multiple observed groundwater wells scattered over florida and georgia as such aquifer properties and some of the boundary conditions e g rivers and lakes for layers in the domain of the epm model remain the same as those used in the nfseg model specifically a head dependent flux boundary was used to simulate rivers lakes as well as streams the boundary condition for these water bodies was determined according to the nfseg model only one discharge point in the springshed silver springs is assumed for the model and treated as a drain boundary hydraulic conductivities from the nfseg model were used in the epm model as described durden et al 2013 used groundwater head at monitoring wells across the domain to calibrate the hydraulic conductivities in the nfseg model in the epm model calibrated horizontal hydraulic conductivities in layer 1 range from 3 10 5 to 5 10 5 m s at the central and western parts of the study region in other areas conductivities range from 4 10 6 to 3 10 5 m s the horizontal hydraulic conductivity distribution in layer 2 is similar to but much higher than layer 1 at the central and western parts of the study area horizontal hydraulic conductivities range from 3 10 4 to 0 06 m s caused by the cropping out of ocala limestone in some parts around the silver springs hydraulic conductivities in layer 3 is much higher than that in layer 2 e g 0 02 to 0 3 m s in the central and western parts of the study area due to fractures and conduits but the distribution is similar as layer 2 vertical hydraulic conductivities in layers 1 and 2 are much lower than horizontal conductivities in particular at the north and south of the study region because the aquifer consists of low permeable rock matrix with clay or other horizontal low permeability layers for reasons discussed earlier conduit networks are assumed to be predominantly in the deeper part of the aquifer are simulated in layer 3 in the epm model high hydraulic conductivity cells were used for representing karst features in the ufa modflow can not simulate flow regimes in karst features well using high hydraulic conductivity cells and is limited to laminar conditions therefore the cfpv2 and cmt3d model was used to simulate flow and contaminant transport in the silver springshed the mechanisms for the two models are described in the following sections 2 2 2 cfpv2 for flow modeling cfpv2 simulates flows in both rock matrix and conduits darcy s law is applicable in the rock matrix where the flow is laminar and the governing equation is 1 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z s s h t w where k x k y and k z lt 1 are the hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z directions respectively h l is the hydraulic head w is the source and or sink term t 1 s s l 1 is the specific storage of the porous material and t t is time eq 1 is solved by modflow harbaugh 2005 the flow in conduits is turbulent and the darcy weisbach equation is used for calculating the hydraulic head shoemaker et al 2007 2 h l f δ l d v 2 2 g where h l is the head loss along the conduit length δ l l f is the friction factor d is the conduit diameter l v is the average velocity lt 1 and g is the gravitational acceleration constant lt 2 conduit network consists of discrete cylindrical tubes and nodes in the model the nodes located in each modflow cell compute the exchange between tubes and rock matrix the flow exchange between the rock matrix and a conduit node is computed by the following equation 3 q ex α i j k h n h i j k where q ex is the volumetric exchange flow rate l3t 1 α i j k is the pipe conductance at cell i j k l2t 1 h n is the head at the conduit node n and h i j k is the head at the cell i j k 2 2 3 the cmt3d modeling cmt3d simulates the contaminant transport in both the rock matrix and conduits reimann et al 2013a and it is an extension of mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 which is a three dimensional groundwater solute transport model the nitrate transport in the rock matrix is modeled by 4 θ c no 3 t x i θ d ij c no 3 x j x i θ ν i c no 3 q s c s no 3 r where θ is the porosity of the porous medium c no 3 ml 3 is the nitrate n concentration x i l is the distance along the direction i d ij l2t 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient ν i lt 1 is the linear pore water velocity q s t 1 is the volumetric flow rate per unit volume of aquifer representing sources and sinks c s no 3 ml 3 is the nitrate n concentration of the source and sink flux and r ml 3t 1 is the chemical reaction term the sorption of nitrate is assumed to be negligible due to its high mobility exner et al 2014 wei et al 2018 and the reaction kinetics term in this model was excluded in the simulation to generate more conservative solutions for policy making in this study c s no 3 represents the nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge for a conservative assessment r term may be relaxed temporarily the method for quantifying the spatial and temporal variability of c s no 3 is described in the following section the nitrate transport in conduits is modeled by advective transport module clark 2009 5 c j t v j c x d 2 c x 2 where c j ml 3 is the nitrate n concentration in a conduit tube v j is the velocity lt 1 and d l2t 1 is the dispersion coefficient the dispersion and chemical reaction in conduits are not considered in this study due to the limited residence time 2 2 4 converting epm to cfpv2 the second step in model development is to use a steady state cfpv2 model for quantifying conduit parameters the study period for the steady state and transient simulations are both considerably short 16 30 years compared to that of conduit evolution e g hundreds or thousands of years therefore conduit parameters will remain constant during the entire simulation period and the steady state model can be used to quantify the conduit parameters the steady state cfpv2 model was created by incorporating conduit networks simulated by conduit nodes and discrete cylindrical pipes shoemaker et al 2007 in the ufa the third layer of the epm model where karstic features are distributed faulkner 1973 phelps 2004 faulkner 1973 delineated a fracture and possible faults map in central florida however it is still a challenge to identify conduit structures in this area in particular in silver springshed conduit structures in this study were determined based on sinkhole locations since groundwater enters karst systems through surface infiltration and direct injection of runoff into conduits via sinkholes sinkhole locations likely provide the underlying karst structure faulkner 1973 ghasemizadeh et al 2012 as such the model uses known sinkhole locations to characterize the karst arrangement as seen in fig 2 specifically model cells with a high density of sinkholes are represented as a pipe having conduit parameters e g diameter length in the cfpv2 model accordingly there are seven conduits developed in the cfpv2 model fig 2 which are comprised of 687 discrete cylindrical conduit pipes hydraulic conductivity in the matrix around the conduits is still low therefore the hydraulic conductivity values in these cells were lowered to the average hydraulic conductivity values of the surrounding matrix a tracer study conducted by fdep 2011 reported that there are no mature conduits in the upper portion of the springshed therefore conduits were assigned mostly in the central west portion of the domain fig 2 the boundary conditions of the epm model described in section 2 2 1 were retained in the cfpv2 model the sources of groundwater recharge in the springshed include net precipitation rainfall minus evapotranspiration surface flow into sinkholes irrigation on agricultural lands and discharge from onsite sewage disposal system durden et al 2013 reported that the estimation of aquifer recharge of the entire model involves land use soil evapotranspiration and stream flow data a long term averaged recharge rates across the springshed were set in the first layer of the steady state model ranging from 0 to 588 mm year durden et al 2013 in particular higher recharge rates are mostly distributed in the central and western parts of the springshed where a high density of sinkholes is distributed the steady state simulation used a single one day time step to investigate and project the annual nitrate n concentration in silver springs a flow simulation in a transient state was conducted from 2000 to 2030 by setting the recharge factor in the modflow cfp program as one to represent the recharge values in the steady state model in the transient simulation recharge factors were quantified by calibration using annual water levels in 13 monitoring wells and annual discharge of silver springs from 2000 to 2020 for instance recharge factor ranged from 1 to 3 may be applied to wet years years with higher recharge rate whereas 0 1 may be used for dry years the recharge factors from 2001 to 2010 were used for the projection period 2021 2030 by assuming the values between the two periods are the same annual stress periods with a daily time step were used effective porosity governs the velocity of groundwater movement in transient simulations fine to course grained sands are the dominant material in the surficial aquifer and the effective porosity for layer 1 is set as 0 25 model layer 2 is a semi confining layer where clay is the main soil type combined with sands and some hard limestone and the effective porosity for layer 2 is set as 0 05 an effective porosity of 0 3 was used for layer 3 because the aquifer is loose and fractures are highly distributed these porosity values are also within the ranges of porosity documented in phelps 2004 2 2 5 cmt3d hydraulic head and groundwater flow simulated by the transient cfpv2 model in both the rock matrix and conduits are used by the cmt3d to simulate nitrate transport as shown in fig 5 cfpv2 generates the link mt3dms file for matrix transport lmt6 and the link cmt3d file for conduit transport lct6 cmt3d uses these files to sequentially calculate transport through the matrix using mt3dms and then calculate transport through conduits using an advective transport model spiessl et al 2002 flux between the matrix and conduits is calculated using eq 3 in the transport model three parameters are required to simulate nitrate n concentration in silver springs the dispersion coefficient in the rock matrix and the conduits and the nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge i e input nitrate n concentration the dispersion coefficient in conduits is neglected in this study the recharge rates and head difference along the conduits result in a high velocity and a more turbulent flow regime resulting in a very low residence time of the groundwater in conduits making dispersion unlikely the dispersion coefficient in the rock matrix was estimated through a tracer test conducted from may 2019 to march 2020 on the field sites in the city of ocala near the silver springs tracer tests were conducted by injecting three different dyes into three monitoring wells and sampling downstream at a daily frequency the two region non equilibrium transport model in the cxtfit program toride et al 1999 was applied to analyze the tracer dye results nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge which is assigned as constant head boundary in the first layer of the transport model is described in the following section the study period of the transport model is the same as that of the transient flow model 2000 to 2030 with annual stress periods simulated at a daily time step 2 2 6 nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge opportunities for improving model fidelity can be found in improved estimation of nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge for which the observation data are usually not available it has been reported that lulc appleyard 1995 mcmahon et al 2008 robertson et al 2000 trojan et al 2003 and population density gardner and vogel 2005 affects the recharge nitrate n concentrations nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge was estimated for each type of lulc and the area change for each lulc type has been calculated as described in section 2 1 2 the nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge was set to 4 mg l for agricultural land and 0 12 mg l for forested land phelps 2004 for residential and transportation lands the population density was used as the factor for estimating the spatial and temporal change of nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge as population increases the nitrate n concentration from septic tanks and lawn fertilizer may also increase within a given residential area further more impervious areas i e transportation corridors may be developed as a result of population growth and more stormwater runoff from these areas are generated fig 4d shows the linear relationship between population density in city of ocala and observed nitrate n concentration in spring discharge in this study the nitrate n concentrations in groundwater recharge c input m l3 for urban and transportation lands were assumed to be linearly proportional to population density p d pop l2 6 c input k p d b the slope k m l3 and the background concentration b m l3 were estimated during calibration of the transport model since the transport model is a cold start model concentration of contaminant is simulated from zero at the beginning of the modeling period the initial conditions were initialized by running the model from 1995 to 2000 with recharge nitrate n concentration estimated using population densities from this respective period during calibration the simulated annual nitrate n concentration was compared with its observed counterpart the focus of this study is to analyze the potential for bmp in srbs to mitigate nitrate at a given nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge as compared to the condition without bmp implementation simulation of nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge through time is outside the scope of this study further after the implementation of spring restoration projects from 2015 described in section 2 1 2 nitrogen loads at the land surface should be controlled therefore it was assumed that nitrate n concentrations in groundwater recharge for the years from 2017 were the same as that in 2016 till the implementation of bmp in 2021 assuming no changes in lulc and population density 2 2 7 model calibration and validation model calibration progressed sequentially beginning with hydrologic calibration of the steady state cfpv2 model recharge calibration of the transient model then progressing to calibration of the cmt3d model hydraulic conductivity conduit diameter d tortuosity and conductance α i j k were calibrated in the steady state cfpv2 model calibration targets of the steady state cfpv2 model includes mean observed water levels in 13 monitoring wells in the springshed fig 2 and mean observed discharge of silver springs over the period from 2000 to 2016 particularly the hydraulic conductivity values around the conduits were lowered to the average hydraulic conductivity values for the surrounding matrix after calibration the inter annual variability of groundwater recharge was estimated through the calibration of the transient cfpv2 model by taking the observed water levels in 13 monitoring wells fig 2 and the observed discharge of the silver springs as calibration targets the variable annual recharge was calibrated by applying an adjustment factor to the recharge used in the steady state model finally the nitrate transport model cmt3d was calibrated and validated by matching the observed annual average nitrate n concentration in spring discharge fig 4b the two parameters in eq 6 were estimated during the calibration period 2000 2008 and the nitrate transport model was validated during 2009 2016 2 3 bam based blanket filter scenarios bam based blanket filter as a bmp could be used to further reduce the nitrate n concentration bam is a type of green sorption medium and made from a mixture of natural and recycled materials containing sand clay and tire crumb the clay content in bam helps to keep moisture within the medium for a longer time which is essential for the survival of microbial community for denitrification o reilly et al 2014 salamah 2014 bam requires relatively less area compared to other bmps sirianuntapiboon et al 2006 in an srb near the silver springs bam was set up within a depth of 1 2 m so that the blank filter is above the local groundwater table fig 1 such shallow blanket filter has been tested in the field and the average nitrate reduction over seven rainfall events is 57 wen et al 2019a b the calibrated and validated groundwater and nitrate transport model was utilized to assess the effectiveness of the bam based blanket filter on nitrate reduction by comparison with a baseline condition in which no blanket filter is implemented a portion of nitrate in stormwater is removed by natural soil profile before stormwater recharges the groundwater to evaluate the net effects of bam based blanket filters on removing nitrate in the silver springs the spatial heterogeneity of nitrate removal in the soil is considered in this study kibler et al 2020 collected soil samples in the srbs as well as other areas in central florida and reported the observed nitrate removal efficiencies of the soils are 50 74 and 92 a negative nitrate removal efficiency indicates that it is possible in some cases for the soil matrix to contribute to the nitrate n concentration in the groundwater by scouring of the soil medium two bmp scenarios are considered both of which are assumed to be implemented in 2021 the first bmp scenario is to implement blanket filters in the twenty six srbs owned by the florida department of transportation fdot and the second scenario is to implement blanket filters in multiple srbs located in ocala for a combined drainage area of half of the city area fig 7 the total drainage area of the twenty six srbs is 14 9 km2 which accounts for 0 64 of the springshed area the drainage area for the second scenario is 111 9 km2 and accounts for 9 6 of the springshed area assuming a 10 year longevity of bam the effects of bmp on nitrate reduction are assessed for the period of 2021 2030 during which the input nitrate n concentrations are assumed to be constant the recharge for this period is adopted from the period of 2001 2010 3 results 3 1 groundwater flow 3 1 1 steady state cfpv2 model the calibrated conduit parameters from the steady state cfpv2 flow model are shown in table 1 and the index for each conduit is shown in fig 2 the conduit diameter and conductance were estimated for each conduit the calibrated values for conduit diameter range from 1 5 m to 6 0 m the diameters for conduits 1 2 6 and 7 which are the main conduits fig 2 were estimated as 6 0 m the conduit 5 has a diameter of 1 5 m which merges to conduit 2 fig 2 the vent diameter for silver spring has been reported to be 11 m ghosh et al 2016 sepulveda 2002 and the conduit diameter in the ufa has been reported as ranging from 3 m to 6 m xu et al 2015 higher conductance values are calibrated for some conduits e g conduit 1 2 6 and 7 shown in table 1 hovorka et al 1995 reported that the conductance for karst aquifers ranges from 3 10 6 to 1 8 m2 day the roughness height was assumed to be uniform over the 7 conduits and the estimated value is 0 05 m the range of tortuosity carbonate aquifers has been reported from 1 to 3 9 assari and mohammadi 2017 worthington 2015 and the tortuosity for each conduit in this study was estimated as 1 5 the observed versus simulated average water levels during 2000 2016 in the monitoring wells fig 2 are shown in fig 8 a the average root mean square error rmse and relative error between simulated and observed water levels are 0 47 m and 2 respectively the relative error for the simulated mean spring discharge is 5 3 1 2 transient cfpv2 model the range of the adjustment factor is 1 1 5 for dry years and 3 4 5 for wet years fig 8a shows the scatter plot of observed versus simulated water levels in the monitoring wells the rmse of simulated heads is 0 66 m 0 62 m for the calibration validation period and the relative errors are 4 for both the calibration and validation periods fig 8b shows the time series of simulated and observed annual spring discharge the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse for simulated discharge is 0 93 0 94 for the calibration validation period and the relative error is 2 3 for the calibration validation period these statistics indicate the good performance of the transient groundwater flow model 3 2 nitrate transport the calibrated nitrate n concentration in groundwater recharge for three types of lulc from 2000 to 2016 is shown in fig 9 the nitrate n concentrations in recharge for agricultural and forested lands are constants as described in section 2 2 4 the slope k and intercept b in eq 6 were calibrated as 7000 mg l km2 people and 0 03 mg l respectively the natural background concentration of nitrate in 200 wells was smaller than 0 10 mg l in the study by panno et al 2006 in fig 4b nitrate n concentration was 0 04 mg l in 1904 with population around 3380 uscb 1995 therefore it is reasonable to consider the calibrated intercept as the background concentration of nitrate moreover the longitudinal dispersivity yielded from the tracer data is 1 8 m and the ratio of longitudinal to transverse dispersivity is set to 0 1 both values are on the same magnitudes as previously reported ones in the ufa reed et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 fig 10 shows the simulated and observed mean annual nitrate n concentration in spring discharge during the calibration 2000 2008 and validation periods 2009 2016 the rmse for the calibration validation period is 0 06 mg l 0 09 mg l and the relative error for the calibration validation period is 4 5 the difference between observed and simulated nitrate n concentration i e 2010 could be due to other factors than lulc and population density such as the variation of fertilizer application rates harper 2014 as shown in fig 10 the nitrate n concentration positively correlates with recharge and spring discharge for example the observed nitrate n concentration reached to a high value at a peaked spring discharge i e 2005 and decreased gradually as the discharge reduced i e 2005 2007 groundwater recharge during storm events strongly depends on hydrologic conditions and land use hem 1985 huebsch et al 2014 nitrate in the soil is accumulated to a high level prior to storm events in agricultural and urban lawn areas higher recharge in wet years mobilizes and transports more nitrate into the aquifer therefore the nitrate in this system is transport limited instead of nitrate supply limited and the recharge rate has an enrichment effect on nitrate n concentration the relation between hydrologic conditions and concentration is similar as that reported in duncan et al 2017 and it shows the higher concentrations coupled with higher discharge values contributed to higher nitrate fluxes in the higher hydrologic conditions based on the observations of nitrate time series over multiple seasons the implementation of spring restoration projects in 2015 and 2016 were included in the simulation by importing the nitrate reductions into cmt3d model and the annual nitrate shows a decline after 2015 besides the effect of variation of annual recharge the nitrate n concentration increased from 2016 to 2018 due to the increasing recharge and then reduced to 1 14 mg l in 2020 which is about 4 times of the restoration target fig 10 3 3 effects of bmp the net effects of two bmp scenarios on nitrate reduction in the spring discharge are shown in fig 10 considering the effect of restoration project section 2 1 2 the input nitrate n concentration in 2016 was used for the period of 2017 2020 the fluctuations of nitrate n concentration during 2017 2020 and the projection period 2021 2030 are due to the inter annual variation of recharge for example the nitrate n concentration in a wet year e g 2030 is higher than that in a dry year e g 2029 in scenario 1 bam based blanket filters have almost no effect on reduction of the nitrate n concentration in the spring discharge in a normal year e g 2026 compared to the baseline condition without bam implemented compared to the averaged observed nitrate n concentration over the period from 2000 to 2020 there will be a 0 6 net improvement to 2 9 net degradation in nitrate n concentration based on different soil removal efficiencies in the projection period table 2 this is due to the limited drainage area which only accounts for 0 64 of the springshed area and small amount of stormwater treated by bam based blanket filters in the 26 fdot srbs further the bmp investigated in this study involves the removal and replacement of part of the soil profile with bam media whether the bam based blanket filters lead to net water quality improvements or degradation depends on whether the bam removes more or less nitrate from stormwater than the unaltered soil profile therefore the slight effect of this scenario is also probably caused by the performance difference between the nitrate removal of bam 57 and unaltered soil 50 to 92 when more or larger bam based blanket filters are implemented thus treating a larger drainage area the net improvement or degradation of nitrate n concentration in spring discharge would be more significant for instance given a nitrate removal efficiency of 74 in soil the nitrate n concentration will be reduced to 1 08 mg l in 2026 i e a 4 9 reduction relative to the baseline condition shown in scenario 2 during a wet year specifically 2023 the nitrate n concentration would be slightly higher at 1 19 mg l and slightly lower during a dry year 2029 compared to the averaged observed nitrate n concentration over 2000 2020 there will be a 15 8 net improvement to 23 8 net degradation in nitrate n concentration in the projection period table 2 as shown in fig 10 the nitrate n concentration in spring discharge will have quick responses to the bam based blanket filters for example from a dry year 2022 to a wet year 2023 nitrate n concentration will increase without a delay similarly due to the insufficient recharge a quick and continuous decline on nitrate n concentration will occur over the period from 2025 to 2027 these quick responses are resulted from the flow and nitrate transport in conduits huebsch et al 2014 as shown in fig 7 most of the bam implementation areas are located at the central springshed where subsurface medium has been maturely karstified faulkner 1973 a large proportion of attenuated nitrate filtered in the top soil and bam layers of the blanket filters may mobilize into conduits from the surrounding rock matrix or from blanket filters directly however treated nitrate in the rock matrix can hardly change nitrate n concentrations within groundwater storage given the large volume peterson et al 2002 hence the proportion of treated nitrate in conduits may dominate the fluctuations of the nitrate n concentration in the aquifer lack of denitrification capacity leads to few nitrate reductions occurring in conduits and the nitrate n concentration in the aquifer does not continue to decline before it reaches the springs the quantitative analysis of nitrate in conduits is discussed in the following section model results did not provide convincing evidence that even with a large scale implementation of bam based stormwater bmp nitrate n concentrations in silver springs could be reduced to a reasonable level fig 10 for instance the largest bmp scale investigated scenario 2 bam blanket filters are implemented in 50 of city area yielded a mean net improvement of 15 8 up to 24 net degradation in silver springs nitrate n concentrations from 2021 to 2030 table 2 this modeling study indicates that the spring water quality benefits accruing from implementation of bam based stormwater bmps are ambiguous a wide range of outcomes are possible ranging from water quality improvements to net degradation fig 10 this result points to a critical knowledge gap that should be addressed before large scale investments into bam based blanket filters whether bam based blanket filters lead to a net water quality improvement or degradation depends on whether bam removes more or less nutrients from stormwater compared to the unaltered soil profile for instance if stormwater infiltration through the soil profile into the groundwater increases the nitrate concentration then any given bmp would need to have a removal efficiency equal to or higher to prevent degradation of the water quality the construction of the bmp investigated in this study involves the removal of a portion of the soil profile replaced with bam media in some springshed locations replacing the soil profile with bam will lead to greater nutrient removal in other cases the natural removal of the unaltered soil profile will exceed that of the bam media the spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrient remediation properties introduces considerable uncertainty to the potential cumulative water quality improvements offered by bam based blanket filters the cumulative impact of large scale bam implementation will be on the higher end of net improvement estimated in this study 15 8 decrease in nitrate concentration if and only if bam replaces soils with the poorest possible nutrient remediation potential i e those which generate 50 of nitrate therefore the most pressing concern is how to differentiate between soils that will benefit from bam replacement and those which will not this requires addressing a critical knowledge gap regarding the relative nutrient remediation potential of bam versus soils of variable properties the uncertainty in soil heterogeneity can be resolved but only after achieving greater understanding of nutrient transformations within soils of variable properties and then understanding how those variable soils are distributed spatially these two questions need to be answered to assist water resources managers in making cost effective decisions regarding bmp implementation if we assume that poor soils low nitrate removal efficiency which are good candidates for replacement with bam can be isolated then the modeling study indicates that the bam based blanket filters benefit is likely to scale with penetration i e greater water quality benefits can be expected with greater bmp implementation however this study suggests that even the maximum expected benefits may be nominal the greatest net improvement scenario 2 was achieved assuming that bam blanket filter media was installed in 50 of the city area which is associated with a great cost to taxpayers while still representing large investments scenario 2 is a more realistic scenario to predict possible net improvements removing the uncertainty in soil nitrate removal at best scenario 2 would lead to maximum net water quality reduction of 15 8 in nitrate in the spring considering the resources required for such implementation and the limited water quality benefits the bam based blanket filters investigated may not be a rational investment to improve silver springs water quality given the modest improvements that can be expected with realistic bam based blanket filters implementation scenarios water quality in silver springs would still fall quite short of restoration targets to achieve restoration goals in silver springs non transportation sources of nutrients such as agricultural applications and septic tanks also need to be controlled or treated the groundwater flow and transport models developed herein could be used to evaluate the efficiency of a larger suite of remediation measures in conjunction with transportation related bmps additionally the model used in this study can be used for other karst springsheds within florida 4 discussions 4 1 effects of conduits on flow and nitrate transport the conduit network in the springshed plays an important role on the flow path of groundwater and by association the nitrate transport using the conduit network shown in fig 2 for model calibration it was estimated that 48 of spring discharge and 47 of nitrate mass are transported through the conduits for the validation period it is expected that a higher percentage of groundwater discharge and nitrate would be transported through the conduit network in wet years for instance when considering just 2019 a wet year the percentage of spring discharge and nitrate through conduits is 51 and 61 as shown in fig 11 the percentages of flow and nitrate contributed from conduits increase with recharge positive trend lines fitted to the data with an r 2 value of 0 61 for flow and 0 79 for nitrate indicate the increasing contribution of conduit flow and transport for wet years and high flow springsheds in the wet years with higher recharge the hydraulic head in the matrix is higher which induces more flow into the conduits from the matrix 4 2 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of spring discharge to model parameters was evaluated for assessing the discharge uncertainty in the model characterization sensitivity simulations were conducted by increasing and decreasing the calibrated conduit parameters by 25 50 and 75 fig 12 a shows the sensitivity of spring discharge averaged over the 2000 2016 period to changes in selected parameters conduit diameter conductance and roughness height the spring discharge is most sensitive to conduit diameter shown in fig 12a specifically if the conduit diameter were increased by 25 spring discharge would be increased by 25 if conduit conductance were to increase by 25 spring discharge would only be increased by 7 the spring discharge is least sensitive to the conduit roughness height showing just a 2 decrease in spring discharge when roughness height was increased by 25 the conduit diameter is the most important parameter among the three due to its strong relationship with the average velocity theoretically higher conduit diameter and conductance mean higher drainage capacity of matrix and conduit network therefore the parameter sets of the conduit network play important roles on the variation of spring discharge the impact of aquifer properties on nitrate presence in spring discharge was assessed by performing a sensitivity analysis on the effective porosity fig 12b shows simulated nitrate n concentrations in spring discharge with effective porosities of the ufa ranging from 0 2 to 0 4 as compared to the calibrated value 0 3 higher effective porosities of the ufa results in lower nitrate concentrations present in spring discharge aquifers with lower effective porosities tends to show nitrate transport being more sensitive to the recharge variation ho and webb 1998 5 conclusions in this study cfpv2 and cmt3d models were applied to discover the effect of a bam based stormwater bmp on nitrate removal in the discharge of silver springs given the nitrate removal efficiency of the bam based blanket filter and spatial heterogeneity of soil nitrate removal tested by field experiments the net effect of the bmp on nitrate removal in karst areas was evaluated using the model modeling results show that the nitrate n concentration present in karst springsheds is higher in wetter years with higher recharge therefore the inter annual variation of nitrate concentration is controlled by the hydrologic condition for the scenario implementing 26 srbs having a combined drainage area of 14 9 km2 and e g a 74 soil removal efficiency the reduction of nitrate in spring discharge will be less than 1 compared to the baseline condition when considering the more aggressive scenario implementation of multiple bmps with a combined drainage area of 111 9 km2 the nitrate n concentration in spring discharge will be reduced by 4 9 for a normal recharge year and can decline to up to 0 97 mg l for a dry year further compared to the observed nitrate n concentration over the period from 2000 to 2020 there will be a range of 15 8 net improvement to 23 8 net degradation in nitrate n concentration in the projection period the modeling study indicates that the bam based blanket filters benefit is likely to scale with penetration i e greater water quality benefits can be expected with greater bmp implementation however this study suggests that even the maximum expected benefits may be nominal the greatest possible net improvement scenario 2 was achieved assuming bam based blanket filters were installed in multiple fdot srbs which will be a great investment for water resources management other restoration measures are necessary to meet the restoration target for example considering that nitrate from agricultural lands accounts for a large proportion of pollution in groundwater other bmps on or near agricultural lands could be implemented for further nitrate removal conduit networks play an important role in groundwater flow and nitrate transport in the silver springs springshed an average percentage of mass transport from conduits is 48 for water and 47 for nitrate moreover the linear relationship between recharge and flow nitrate contribution of conduits indicates that higher percentages of flow and nitrate are transported through conduits to the spring outlets in wetter years this study is the first regional scale application of the numerical model to evaluate the effect of bmp nitrate removal in karst springsheds providing a useful tool for water resources managers the input nitrate n concentration is simply assumed as a function of land use and land cover change and population density future analysis could focus on 1 including more factors to quantify the input nitrate n concentration 2 quantifying the reaction kinetics for the critical biogeochemical processes in the karst environment and 3 determining the location and treatment scale of blanket filters based on this regional scale modeling of bmp implementation a comprehensive restoration plan is recommended to achieve the restoration goal for silver springs that considers both reduction of nitrate sources e g fertilizer run off and septic

5092,bimodal transport due to dual mobile advection or mass exchange between mobile and immobile zones has been widely observed for pollutants moving in heterogeneous media existing nonlocal transport models however cannot capture either heterogeneity in mobile domains or bi peak concentration phenomena for breakthrough curves btcs of solute transport in complex media therefore this study proposed a dual heterogeneous domain model dhdm framework conceptualized from the distributed order time fractional derivative that incorporates a broader spectrum of particle movement in the dual domain system than the classical single domain model a lagrangian scheme was developed to solve the dhdm using the bernoulli trial with the transition probability simulating mass exchange between different domains phase transition probabilities calculated based on the zeroth spatial moments of dual domain transport equations were used to simulate the particle partitioning between different domains applications to transport experiments in silt clay columns conducted in our laboratory showed that the dhdm yielded significant improvement for simulating solute transport behavior compared to the single domain anomalous transport model parameter analysis of the dhdm further revealed that the velocity disparity of the two domains controlled the btc rising time and the shape of the second peak in the btc when the velocity of the slow domain is extremely small the second btc peak develops a shoulder characteristic during the late time tail of the btc this study improved our understanding for bimodal transport in a dual domain system and provides a feasible tool for capturing a wide range of bimodal transport in complex media keywords bimodal sub diffusion time fractional derivative lagrangian scheme transition probability column experiments 1 introduction non fickian or anomalous transport of solutes has been widely observed in both natural aquifers anderson 1984 zheng and gorelick 2003 zheng et al 2010 ma et al 2010 bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 chang and yeh 2016 cvetkovic et al 2016 and laboratory experiments hatano and hatano 1998 klise et al 2004 mehdinejadiani 2017 moradi and mehdinejadiani 2018 2020 porro et al 1993 silliman and simpson 1987 the physicochemical heterogeneity of subsurface media may account for the prevalence of anomalous transport which is usually characterized by faster breakthrough also called super diffusion heavy trailing edges of plume snapshots also called sub diffusion or both mixed anomalous diffusion anomalous transport poses significant challenges for accurate prediction and remediation of groundwater contamination compared with super diffusion the existence of sub diffusion is much more general three popular types of non fickian transport frameworks were developed to simulate solute transport with time nonlocality over the past few decades including the continuous time random walk model ctrw berkowitz et al 2001 the multi rate mass transfer model mrmt haggerty and gorelick 1995 and the time fractional advection dispersion equation model t fade schumer et al 2003 metzler and klafter 2000 the relationship between ctrw mrmt and t fade has been discussed theoretically berkowitz et al 2006 and evaluated quantitatively using real world data lu et al 2018a additionally several studies were also conducted to evaluate the applicability of different time nonlocal transport models in capturing anomalous transport in column experiments bromly and hinz 2004 gao et al 2009 and streams sun et al 2020 the time nonlocal transport models mentioned above have provided sufficient tools to capture various late time tailing responses in solute breakthrough curves btcs with a wide range of decline elution slopes haggerty et al 2000 zhang et al 2007 however modifications may still be needed when simulating solute transport in more complex media samiee et al 2018 sun et al 2019 berkowitz et al 2008 yin et al 2020 for such challenges the most popular extension upon these models is the development and use of the dual time scale model dtsm which contains a heterogeneous mobile domain with a power law distribution of velocities and an immobile domain acting as a storage zone berkowitz et al 2008 such dual domain systems may occur in fractured rock berkowitz et al 2008 interaggregate soil sciortino et al 2015 fractured porous media cadini et al 2012 gerke and van genuchten 1993 yin et al 2020 karst aquifer media dewaide et al 2018 or the hyporheic zone sun et al 2020 the primary distinction between the dtsm and the traditional mobile immobile domain is the heterogeneity description within the mobile domain to simulate the full transition time spectrum of solute transport in the dual domain system various physical models were developed for instance bijeljic et al 2011 developed a dual domain transport model based on the ctrw framework in which a truncated power law memory function is used to capture anomalous transport within the mobile domain shen and phanikumar 2009 proposed a space fractional transient storage model by expanding the pioneering work of benson et al 2000a b in introducing space fractional derivatives to hydrology to capture anomalous solute transport in the stream and chemical mass exchange with the riverbed more recently sun et al 2020 developed a similar dual domain model evolved from the fractional mobile immobile model to simulate solute transport in the hyporheic zone these modifications have greatly expanded the applicability of time nonlocal transport models in simulating sub diffusion processes in complex media a notable characteristic of solute transport in the previously described complex domain systems is the presence of a concentration shoulder or the secondary late time concentration shouldering effect occurring during the late time tail of btcs berkowitz et al 2008 the mechanism of the contaminant shoulder shouldering effect has been systematically discussed by bijeljic et al 2011 and sun et al 2020 albeit under a different modeling theoretical application however this previous model theory was restricted to simulate dual peaked btcs which were developed for more generalized hydrogeologic systems siirila woodburn et al 2015 additionally the existing dual permeability model also called the mobile mobile model cannot capture anomalous transport within each domain as it assumes fickian transport in both domains chastanet and wood 2008 lu et al 2018b xie et al 2019 this theoretical deficiency limits hydrologists in appropriately developing a full understanding of solute transport process in complex systems this study proposes the development and use of a dual heterogeneous domain model dhdm using the conception of the distributed order time fractional derivative model dt fdm caputo 2001 gorenflo and mainardi 2005 the idea of fractional derivative of distributed orders was developed several decades ago caputo 1969 and used to simulate complex physical processes chechkin et al 2003 meerschaert and scheffler 2006 luchko 2009 tomovski and sandev 2017 more recently the distributed order fractional derivative models were developed to simulate groundwater flow su 2012 2017 or solute transport in heterogeneous porous media liang et al 2019 the novel theory proposed in the present study allows advection and anomalous diffusion in both domains and mass exchange between the two domains a similar transport model was developed by yin et al 2020 to capture bi peak super diffusion in alluvial aquifers a random walk particle tracking method is developed to solve the dhdm since it is computationally efficient and free of numerical dispersion it is noteworthy that the dhdm is superior to the existing dual domain transport models in quantifying complex solute transport the remainder of the work is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the development of the dual heterogeneous domain model and the random walk particle tracking scheme used to solve the new dhdm in section 3 the dhdm is applied to solute transport column experiments with various flow rates parameters and simulated btcs of the single domain transport model and dhdm are compared to better understand solute transport dynamics in soil columns in section 4 we discuss the origin of bimodal sub diffusion in dual domain systems btcs generated from both the mobile mobile domain and the mobile immobile domain are evaluated systematically the overall summary and conclusions are presented in section 5 2 development of the dual heterogeneous domain model this section presents the development of a general dual heterogeneous domain model dhdm to capture the bimodal sub diffusive transport using the concept of the distributed order time fractional derivation 2 1 governing equations for dhdm the distributed order time fractional diffusion equation can be written as luchko 2009 tomovski and sandev 2017 1 0 1 ω γ d t γ u t d γ l x where γ dimensionless 0 γ 1 is the order of the time fractional derivative ω γ t γ 1 denotes the weight for the order γ the symbol d t γ denotes the positive riemann liouville fractional derivative see further discussion in zhang et al 2008a u t is a differentiable function of t and the advection dispersion operator l x describes the spatial movement of particles energy or wave the discrete component version of the dt fdm 1 takes the form diethelm and ford 2009 2 i 1 k ω i d t γ u t l x to capture bimodal sub diffusion in dual domain media we extend upon the dt fdm 2 by allowing for different time fractional orders and spatial movement of solute particles in each domain while the mass exchange is driven by the concentration gradient between the two domains this results in the following dhdm 3a c 1 m t β 1 γ 1 c 1 m t γ 1 l 1 x c 1 m α φ 1 c 2 m c 1 m 3b c 2 m t β 2 γ 2 c 2 m t γ 2 l 2 x c 2 m α φ 2 c 1 m c 2 m where c i ml 3 i 1 2 is the concentration in domain i t t is time and x l is space coordinate φ i dimensionless is the volume fraction of the ith domain the operator l i x v i x d i 2 x 2 and v i lt 1 is the effective velocity in the ith domain v i is typically called the average linear velocity or seepage velocity for groundwater in the hydrogeology community which is equal to the darcy velocity divided by the effective porosity d i l 2 t 1 is the diffusion coefficient α t 1 is the first order rate coefficient for mass transfer β i t γ i 1 is the fractional capacity coefficient in the ith domain and γ i dimensionless is the time index representing the degree of time nonlocality for solute transport in the ith domain the time nonlocalities of different domains have an important impact on the mass exchange process here we assume the same time nonlocality for each domain which means that solute holding abilities of the two domains are the same e g β 1 β 2 β and γ 1 γ 2 γ we will explore more complex situations such as the domain sensitive retention process in future studies incorporating the above assumption yields the simplified dhdm as 4a c 1 m t β γ c 1 m t γ l 1 x c 1 m α φ 1 c 2 m c 1 m 4b c 2 m t β γ c 2 m t γ l 2 x c 2 m α φ 2 c 1 m c 2 m the governing equation for a single domain shown in the dhdm 4 without the mass exchange term reduces to the fractional mobile immobile fmim model proposed by schumer et al 2003 a detailed comparative analysis between the dhdm and fmim will be conducted in section 3 to check the feasibility validity of the dhdm 4 it is noteworthy that the tempered time fractional operator defined by meerschaert et al 2008 can be conveniently added to the dhdm 4 to simulate solute transport in media with upper limits for solute retention capabilities model 4 can effectively capture the commonly observed solute retention in each domain and therefore it may improve the classical dual advection dispersion equation dade model with mass transfer between the two mobile domains gerke and van genuchten 1993 leij et al 2012 lu et al 2018b for quantifying non fickian transport 2 2 lagrangian solution for the dhdm 4 2 2 1 particle tracking in a single domain the particle tracking random walk method ptrw is used to solve the dhdm 4 consisting of two major modules including particle transport in one domain and mass exchange between the two domains with different advective diffusive properties for instance particles traveling in a single domain can be approximated by a series of a two step random process e g jump followed by waiting zhang et al 2015 in this study we separate the whole time dt during the jth jump waiting event into two components 5 d t j d m j d i j where d m j is the mobile or operational time during the j jump and d i j is the immobile or waiting time after the jth jump the mobile time d m j can be defined as a constant or an exponentially distributed random variable for computational efficiency we select the first method the waiting time d i j is a stable random noise rescaled by d m j and β 6 d i j cos π γ 2 β d m j 1 γ s γ β 1 σ 1 μ 0 where s γ 1 1 0 denotes a stable random variable with the maximum skewness β unit scale σ and zero shift μ the method for generating stable random variables is based on the algorithm proposed by baeumer and meerschaert 2010 the jump size during the mobile time d m j due to advection and dispersion with constant coefficients can be approximated by the langevin equation corresponding to the classical advection dispersion equation ade labolle et al 1996 dentz and bolster 2010 7 d x j v d m j 2 d d m i ξ t where ξ t is a gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance 2 2 2 transition probability between domains in dhdm the main challenge to solve the dhdm 4 using the ptrw is to define the time dependent transition probability of solute particles between different domains the term transition probability originated from the concept of continuous time markov chains which represents the probability that a process in state i at present will be in state j at a future time e g ross 2003 using this principle in particle tracking with a pre assigned transition probability function we can determine if a particle is in phase i and thus susceptible to fractional order γi or in phase j after a time step δt using a bernoulli trial on the appropriate phase transition probability the phase transition probability function ptpf was applied by salamon et al 2006 whereby the simulated mass transfer between mobile and immobile zones by the ptrw scheme after extending the idea of ptpf was first proposed by michalak and kitanidis 2000 salamon et al 2006 used the normalized zeroth order spatial moments which describes the distribution of mass in different phases as the ptpf this study extends the concept of ptpf to the dhdm here we consider the first order mass transfer between each domain it is noteworthy that the mass in the immobile zones is not exchangeable with each other but can affect the mass transfer process i e this study considers a parallel immobile system the concentration for the mobile phase is now substituted for its fourier transform to calculate the zeroth order moments of the fourier domain the classical definition of the fourier transform and its inverse is used here 8a c p t c x t e i 2 π p x d x 8b c x t c p t e i 2 π p x d p by taking the fourier transform of 4 using 8a and assuming spatially uniform coefficients within a grid we obtain the following equations 9a φ 1 c 1 m t φ 1 β γ c 1 m t γ φ 1 l 1 p c 1 m w 1 t 9b φ 2 c 2 m t φ 2 β γ c 2 m t γ φ 2 l 2 p c 2 m w 2 t where l i p v i 2 π i p c i m d i 4 π 2 p 2 c i m w i t α c 1 m c 2 m the nth order moments about the origin for solutes can be related to the nth order derivative of its concentration in fourier space because the image function is also the characteristic function goltz and roberts 1987 zhang et al 2008b hence the zeroth order spatial moments of the concentration in the real domain can be evaluated by 10 μ i φ i c i m p 0 w h e r e i 1 2 substituting equation 10 into 9 and setting p 0 yields the following equation forms 11a μ 1 t β γ μ 1 t γ α μ 1 φ 1 μ 2 φ 2 11b μ 2 t β γ μ 2 t γ α μ 1 φ 1 μ 2 φ 2 equation 11 cannot be solved analytically motivating us to develop a numerical solution using the finite difference method shown in appendix a when the initial conditions μ 1 t 0 1 and μ 2 t 0 0 are considered the solution of 11 provides the transition probability for a solute particle in domain 1 to either remain in domain 1 or transfer to domain 2 similarly the transition probability for the solute particle located in domain 2 can be obtained with the initial conditions of μ 1 t 0 0 and μ 2 t 0 1 it is noteworthy that when γ 1 model 11 reduces to the governing equation of the zeroth order moments for the traditional mobile mobile model with a retardation factor r i 1 β in this case the analytical solution is obtained and used for the validation of the accuracy of the numerical scheme fig 1 fig 1 shows the evolution of the transition probability while p i j refers to the probability of a particle starting in the domain i and ending in domain j after a certain amount of time results of a simple parameter sensitivity analysis are also shown and plotted in fig 1 to provide a better understanding of the impact dependence of time nonlocality on mass transfer a larger β or a smaller γ will decrease the mass transfer rate which may be due to more solute mass absorbed within the immobile zone 2 2 3 implementation of the lagrangian scheme after calculating the phase transition probabilities a uniform 0 1 random number ω is obtained for each particle and is then compared with the corresponding phase transition probability for each time step the movement of the particle being in the ith domain is calculated according to 12 x t n d m x t n v i δ t 2 d i d m ξ t i f ω p i i x t n v j δ t 2 d j d m ξ t i f ω p i i w h e r e i j 1 2 n 0 1 2 where x t n d m is the position of the particle at time t n d m in addition the clock physical time t n 1 for a random walker after the n 1th jump and waiting events can be calculated by 13 t n 1 t n d m cos π γ 2 β d m 1 γ s γ 1 1 0 2 3 boundary conditions and concentration calculation the robin boundary condition is used herein to simulate the continuous injection of tracers the inlet boundary condition of the ptrw scheme for the time fractional model is the same as that for the traditional ade model labolle 2006 zhang et al 2016 in the present study the release rate of particles at the inlet boundary is determined by the velocity and the number of particles denoting a unit concentration 14 r e l e a s e r a t e v in dta c 0 n p where v in φ 1 v 1 φ 2 v 2 is the volumetric average velocity for the dual domain system c 0 ml 3 is the inlet concentration n p m 1 denotes the number of particles per unit volume with a unit concentration and a l 2 denotes the cross sectional area of fluid flow the release rate of sources in each domain is assumed to be flux weighted for the continuous injection boundary condition both the flux averaged and volume averaged concentrations representing the flux and resident concentrations respectively are calculated herein based on the trajectory of particles the flux averaged concentration denotes mass content within a unit volume of flux across a specific cross sectional area this kind of concentration scheme is widely observed reported in multi scale tracer experiments for simplicity and convenience of measurements the resident concentration denotes the mass density residing at a specific cell at time t which can be detected by discrete soil groundwater samples or electrical conductivity sensors zhang et al 2006 confusion between the resident and flux averaged concentrations may lead to misinterpretations of actual observations and measurements parker and van genuchten 1984 and mis calibration of parameters kim and feyen 2000 for our ptrw scheme the normalized flux averaged concentration is calculated by 15 c f x τ p n total t 1 t 2 δ x x p t d t v t 2 t 1 a n p where c f x τ ml 3 is the average flux concentration from time t 1 to t 2 δ is a dirac delta function and x p t is the location of particle p at time t ntotal dimensionless is the total number of particles in the domains the details for calculating the resident concentration can be found in labolle et al 1996 to examine the lagrangian scheme developed above for the dhdm 4 an eulerian numerical solver using the finite difference method or fdm was also developed it should be noted that an instantaneous injection mode was used in application herein three numerical examples with different mass exchange rates are shown in fig 2 other parameters of the dhdm 4 used to calculate the btcs plotted in fig 2 include v 1 1 c m h v 2 0 3 c m h d 1 0 1 c m 2 h d 2 0 03 c m 2 h γ 0 7 β 0 1 h 0 3 and φ 1 0 7 the volume averaged concentrations calculated by the lagrangian scheme match the fdm solutions extremely well 3 laboratory experiments and model application 3 1 laboratory experiments three soil columns were re packed in our laboratory to conduct conservative solute transport experiments the plexiglass columns have a dimension of 45 cm in length with an inner diameter of 14 cm the setup of the vertically oriented column from bottom to top includes 1 a lower 5 cm height water chamber with an overlying 3 cm height sandy transitional layer to promote steady state and uniform flow into the above representative heterogeneous porous medium 2 a 30 cm height of the representative heterogeneous packed soil and 3 finally a top most 3 cm height sandy transitional layer above which a constant head overflow port is outfitted to ensure stable uniform and constant flow during all experiments fig 3 the soil packed in the column was collected from the subsurface at a depth of 1 2 m at the tongzhou field tracer experiment site beijing china which was installed with high density monitoring wells and fundamental facilities for conducting field tracer experiments the sample representative elementary volumes rev for all of these packed systems were achieved to include the scale of heterogeneity i e porosity and permeability within the column volumes the sediments are fine grained alluvial flood deposits with a significant mass percentage of silty clay the grain size fraction and composition of the soil are listed in table 1 the 30 cm length of the column was selected for this study due to the following two reasons first the soil can be well mixed and then uniformly packed in the column for the purpose of investigating the potential impact of local scale heterogeneity i e from pore scale heterogeneity dead end pores to grain scale heterogeneity on anomalous transport the results and implications of experiments from columns with smaller size can provide fundamental knowledge before moving to larger scale study such as scale dependent more complicated anomalous transport in a longer column second the experiments with different size of columns were widely used to study anomalous transport of conservative or reactive solutes in porous media including 1 m long columns e g liu et al 2008 lu et al 2018a 2019 ma and selim 1996 novakowski 1992 zaheer et al 2017 and relatively larger columns 1 m e g huang et al 1995 porro et al 1993 sharma et al 2020 while the larger scale column was typically filled with sand and or gravel the small scale column was preferred for fine grained soil if a larger scale column is filled even partially with fine grained materials a large hydraulic gradient would be required to drive water flowing through the column which is not ideal for a typical laboratory experiment we will test longer columns and explore the impact of macroscopic heterogeneity on anomalous transport in a future study water through the column was supplied by a peristaltic pump with a constant rotational speed to reach a steady state flow condition the transport experiments were conducted in three steps first the column was slowly saturated by injecting clean water from the bottom at a constant flow rate to ensure stable displacement processes and saturated conditions were maintained second after saturation two liters of dissolved bromide br tracer as nabr were injected into the column as a continuous source third clean water without br was injected into the column with the same flow rate until the completion of the experiment effluent samples were collected throughout the experimental period to capture high resolution btcs three sets of column experiments with different flow rates 47 4 ml h 34 5 ml h and 15 ml h were performed to analyze the impact of flow velocity on solute transport the flow rates were selected to be consistent with realistic variations of groundwater flow rates observed in the field more details about the column experiments can be found in table 2 3 2 experimental results fig 4 shows the btcs for experiments 1 1 1 3 with various flow rates all the btcs of br exhibit sub diffusion phenomenon characterized by the heavy late time concentration tailing due to the presence of immobile zones in the silty clay packed column similar sub diffusive transport has been observed for many column scale experiments by previous studies using homogeneous media lu et al 2018a 2019 garrard et al 2017 zaheer et al 2017 or heterogeneous media huang et al 1995 gao et al 2009 to provide preliminary evaluation of the btcs obtained from the column experiments the fractional mobile immobile model fmim was proposed schumer et al 2003 zhang et al 2009 the fmim is selected here for two reasons 1 the successful and wide applications of the fmim reported in previous works major et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 garrard et al 2017 made it an appropriate tool for simulating sub diffusive transport and 2 the fitted result of fmim can be a reference for the further application of the dhdm for column transport experiments which will be conducted in section 3 3 as mentioned previously the columns used in this study were uniformly packed and the hydraulic head at both the top and bottom of the column remained stable during the tracer transport experiments moreover the effective velocity was assumed to be generally uniform and the flow system can be described as that similar to a confined 1 d aquifer where both the classical ade and the fractional model may be used for transport simulation upon upscaling solute transport in the column as a 1 d process the governing equation of the fmim can be obtained as schumer et al 2003 16 c t β γ c t γ v c x d 2 c t 2 where c ml 3 is the tracer concentration β t γ 1 is the fractional capacity coefficient and v lt 1 and d l 2 t 1 are the effective velocity and dispersion coefficient respectively when β 0 model 16 reduces to the classical advection dispersion equation ade model it should be noted that the tempered time fractional derivative model proposed by meerschaert et al 2008 has been previously used to capture sub diffusion in multi scale heterogeneous media lu et al 2018a garrard et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 to exponentially truncate the power law pdf of waiting times for solute particles an additional parameter λ was used to capture the transient process from non fickian to fickian transport this transient process truncated power law may arise while the travel time or distance becomes large enough exceeds a given threshold value berkowitz et al 2006 however the particle travel distance through column experiments is relatively short as is the case for this study hence to reduce the number of model parameters the tempered fractional operator is not invoked here the lagrangian scheme proposed by zhang et al 2008a is used to solve model 16 and the flux averaged concentration is calculated to fit the observed btcs from the column transport experiments the fitted results of the fmim model 16 are plotted in fig 4 for comparison purposes the best fit result of the ade model for experiment 1 3 is also plotted both the ade and fmim models can capture the rising limb of the btc well for the late time concentration tailing behavior of the btcs the fmim model 16 fits the data better than the ade however a slight shoulder observed in the mid tailing portion of the btcs cannot be robustly captured by either the ade or the fmim model 16 this specific structure of the btcs i e shouldering effect poses a significant challenge for solute transport modeling solute transport behavior and btcs with the similar shouldering effects have been studied previously and theoretical models have been developed for instance a two time domain ctrw model was proposed by berkowitz et al 2008 to simulate solute transfer between a main heterogeneous domain and an immobile domain we tried to apply the two time domain ctrw for simulating solute transport of the column transport experiments but the fitting results not shown here are not satisfactory the reason may be due to the possible advection of solute particles in the slow i e relatively immobile domain while the slow domain is assumed to be immobile in the two time domain ctrw therefore the dhdm 4 with advection and dispersion in both domains may be needed to appropriately capture the bimodal sub diffusion as tested below 3 3 bimodal sub diffusion in column experiments the results displayed in fig 5 show that the dhdm 4 can fit the observed btcs well for all three column experiments performed compared with the best fit results of the fmim 16 and ade models the dhdm 4 can better capture the late time concentration tails of the btcs most notably including the bimodal sub diffusion characteristics of the observed btcs the best fit parameters of the dhdm 4 for all experiments are listed in table 4 it should be noted that the best fit velocity of the fast domain in the dhdm 4 is slightly larger than that of the fmim model 16 listed in table 3 since the former also considers the slow domain with a smaller velocity the dispersivity of the dhdm 4 is much smaller than that of the fmim model 16 when a model assuming a single domain i e the fmim model 16 for the whole system is used to simulate solute transport in the dual domain system the dispersivity needs to be larger than those of models that incorporate two domains to capture the elongated expansion of the btcs caused by mass exchange between the two domain regime the parameters capturing time nonlocality β and γ and the volumetric proportion of the domain φ remain stable due to the consistent packing method utilized for the soil columns the mass transfer rate describing solute interaction between the different domains changes with the variation of the flowrate as shown in table 4 a higher flowrate leads to a larger mass transfer rate representing stronger more pronounced solute exchange 4 discussion 4 1 the origin of bimodal sub diffusion dual convection versus mass transfer bimodal btcs have been widely observed and investigated in previous studies siirila woodburn et al 2015 dual domain permeability fields and sorption kinetics were commonly considered to be the two major causes for bimodal transport of conservative tracers quinodoz and valocchi 1993 michalak and kitanidis 2000 coppola et al 2009 to date most previous studies focusing on bimodal transport were based on the dual homogeneous domain model chastanet and wood 2008 leij et al 2012 lu et al 2018b both dual advection and mass transfer between mobile immobile zones can trigger bimodal transport the questions that remain unknown are when is dual advection needed to simulate bimodal transport in a dual domain system how to recognize elucidate the underlying mechanisms yielding the bimodal btc structure so that we can choose the appropriate model the general framework of the dual domain solute transport scheme proposed in this study allows us to distinguish the bi peak btcs induced by dual advection or sorption kinetics in this section a series of btcs are generated using the fully lagrangian solver developed in section 2 to illustrate the characteristics of bi peak btcs resulting from dual advection or mobile immobile systems 4 1 1 bimodal transport in a dual advection system bimodal transport in a dual advection system as described by the dhdm 4 can be affected by three parameters the velocity v in each domain the volumetric proportion φ of each domain and the mass exchange rate α between domains first the discrepancy between pore velocities in different domains which can cause a bimodal transport process in a dual domain system may affect the position and magnitude of the 2nd peak of the btc preferential flow paths can be widely present in multi scale heterogeneous media which may cause and or enhance bimodal transport processes to illustrate the impact of the discrepancy between velocities in each domain on the structure of the btcs several scenarios are established and tested herein for description simplicity velocity in the fast domain remains constant v 1 1 cm h and various velocities in the slow domain are selected v 2 1 0 0 5 0 3 0 1 and 0 01 cm h respectively the other parameters are defined as follows β 0 1 h 0 3 γ 0 7 α 0 01 h 1 and φ1 0 7 to focus on the impact of advection on bimodal transport the dispersivity within both domains is assumed to be small and constant with an imposed value of 0 1 cm the btcs are collected from points along 5 cm downstream from the source location where an instantaneous source is released the concentration profile used in this section is the flux averaged concentration described by eq 15 results plotted in fig 6 a show that on the one hand the bimodal structure of the btc becomes more apparent for larger discrepancies in the velocity between different domains this is because when solute transport in both domains is dominated by advection a larger discrepancy or contrast between velocities can result in further separation of the two concentration peaks on the other hand when the velocity within the slow domain is small i e v 2 0 01 cm h due to diffusion and mass exchange the ancillary peak of the btc becomes relative mild and evolves eventually to a shoulder within the late time portion of the btc in this case the slow domain is analogous to an immobile domain where solute particles experience very slow advection and dispersion second the volumetric proportion of each domain directly controls the solute mass of each peak and shifts both the leading and trailing edges of the btc fig 6b a larger volumetric proportion leads to more solute mass within the corresponding domain it is noteworthy that the volumetric proportion of the domains have no apparent influence on the slope of the leading arrival wave affected mainly by the particle mobility in the fast domain or trailing elution wave of which the slope is controlled by the time index γ zhang et al 2006 edges of the btc third the mass exchange rate has a significant impact on solute transport in dual domain systems as discussed in detail in previous studies that assume fickian diffusion processes for mobile particles leij et al 2012 sciortino et al 2015 xie et al 2019 and therefore detailed results specific to this are not shown in this study 4 1 2 bimodal transport in the mobile immobile system as discussed above and shown in fig 6a when the velocity in the slow domain is too small the dual advection domain will reduce to the mobile immobile system btcs with a shoulder in the late time concentration tail can be observed for solute transport in such a dual domain system berkowitz et al 2008 bijeljic et al 2011 in this case the structure of the btc i e pattern of the declining limb is primarily controlled by the parameters φ i and α to better understand the characteristics of bimodal transport in such a system btcs are generated numerically with various φ i and α while the other parameters are defined as follows v 1 1 0 cm h d 1 0 1 cm2 h β 0 1 h 0 3 and γ 0 7 an instantaneous point source is considered and the btcs are collected at 5 cm downstream from the source the btcs shown in fig 7 a are generated by fixing the volumetric proportion of the immobile domain 0 7 obvious differences are observed when the mass transfer rate α varies from 0 005 h 1 to 0 5 h 1 a smaller mass transfer rate leads to more gradual and wider shoulders as shown in fig 7a when the mass transfer rate is relatively large 0 5 h 1 in fig 7a there is only a single peak with a heavy significant concentration tail for the btc implying that the strong communication between the two domains tends to overshadow the discrepancy of particle transport dynamics in the two domains in addition btcs of solute transport in the dual domain system with various volumetric proportions of the mobile domain φ 1 are depicted in fig 7b results show that φ 1 affects the duration broadness of the shoulder for the late time concentration tail portion of the btc where a lower φ 1 meaning more portion of the slow domain leads to a broader shoulder due to more particles being trapped by the slow domain and thereby expanding the shoulder 5 summary and conclusion this study focused on quantifying solute transport in bimodal structured porous media we developed a dual heterogeneous domain model called dhdm conceptualized from the distributed order time fractional derivative to capture bimodal sub diffusion in dual domains to solve the new model a random walk particle tracking solver was developed where the bernoulli process was used to simulate particle transition between the two domains phase transition probabilities calculated by the zeroth order spatial moments of the dual domain transport equations were used to simulate the solute particle partitioning in different domains compared with the traditional dual domain system the heterogeneity of domains retards the mass transfer process the random walk particle tracking approach based on the phase transition probability can provide satisfactory solutions for the dhdm with high computational efficiency and free of numerical dispersion the dhdm was applied to quantify and simulate bimodal sub diffusion characterized by late time tails of btcs observed from a series of column transport experiments performed in the laboratory compared with the traditional time nonlocal transport model with a single advective domain i e the standard fmim the dhdm can capture the overall pattern of the btcs more accurately results showed that the velocity field within the column can be divided into two domains with different velocities e g a fast domain and a slow domain mass exchange occurred between the two domains which was affected by the velocity within each domain neglecting this dual domain structure may have obvious and significant impact on the estimation of model parameters and result in an artificially larger dispersivity the impact of model parameters on solute transport for dual domain systems was explored providing additional information for bimodal transport in complex porous media the results revealed that the discrepancy of the average velocities between the two domains control the timing and the shape of the second peak and or shoulder for the btcs when the velocity in the slow domain is extremely small the second peak of the btc evolves and declines to a shoulder during the late time portion of the btc which has also been observed and discussed by previous studies berkowitz et al 2008 bijeljic et al 2011 sun et al 2020 credit authorship contribution

detailed description of the numerical scheme to solve eqs 11a and 11b which governs the evolution of the zeroth order spatial moments of solute plumes in two mobile domains the analytical solution for

5092,bimodal transport due to dual mobile advection or mass exchange between mobile and immobile zones has been widely observed for pollutants moving in heterogeneous media existing nonlocal transport models however cannot capture either heterogeneity in mobile domains or bi peak concentration phenomena for breakthrough curves btcs of solute transport in complex media therefore this study proposed a dual heterogeneous domain model dhdm framework conceptualized from the distributed order time fractional derivative that incorporates a broader spectrum of particle movement in the dual domain system than the classical single domain model a lagrangian scheme was developed to solve the dhdm using the bernoulli trial with the transition probability simulating mass exchange between different domains phase transition probabilities calculated based on the zeroth spatial moments of dual domain transport equations were used to simulate the particle partitioning between different domains applications to transport experiments in silt clay columns conducted in our laboratory showed that the dhdm yielded significant improvement for simulating solute transport behavior compared to the single domain anomalous transport model parameter analysis of the dhdm further revealed that the velocity disparity of the two domains controlled the btc rising time and the shape of the second peak in the btc when the velocity of the slow domain is extremely small the second btc peak develops a shoulder characteristic during the late time tail of the btc this study improved our understanding for bimodal transport in a dual domain system and provides a feasible tool for capturing a wide range of bimodal transport in complex media keywords bimodal sub diffusion time fractional derivative lagrangian scheme transition probability column experiments 1 introduction non fickian or anomalous transport of solutes has been widely observed in both natural aquifers anderson 1984 zheng and gorelick 2003 zheng et al 2010 ma et al 2010 bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 chang and yeh 2016 cvetkovic et al 2016 and laboratory experiments hatano and hatano 1998 klise et al 2004 mehdinejadiani 2017 moradi and mehdinejadiani 2018 2020 porro et al 1993 silliman and simpson 1987 the physicochemical heterogeneity of subsurface media may account for the prevalence of anomalous transport which is usually characterized by faster breakthrough also called super diffusion heavy trailing edges of plume snapshots also called sub diffusion or both mixed anomalous diffusion anomalous transport poses significant challenges for accurate prediction and remediation of groundwater contamination compared with super diffusion the existence of sub diffusion is much more general three popular types of non fickian transport frameworks were developed to simulate solute transport with time nonlocality over the past few decades including the continuous time random walk model ctrw berkowitz et al 2001 the multi rate mass transfer model mrmt haggerty and gorelick 1995 and the time fractional advection dispersion equation model t fade schumer et al 2003 metzler and klafter 2000 the relationship between ctrw mrmt and t fade has been discussed theoretically berkowitz et al 2006 and evaluated quantitatively using real world data lu et al 2018a additionally several studies were also conducted to evaluate the applicability of different time nonlocal transport models in capturing anomalous transport in column experiments bromly and hinz 2004 gao et al 2009 and streams sun et al 2020 the time nonlocal transport models mentioned above have provided sufficient tools to capture various late time tailing responses in solute breakthrough curves btcs with a wide range of decline elution slopes haggerty et al 2000 zhang et al 2007 however modifications may still be needed when simulating solute transport in more complex media samiee et al 2018 sun et al 2019 berkowitz et al 2008 yin et al 2020 for such challenges the most popular extension upon these models is the development and use of the dual time scale model dtsm which contains a heterogeneous mobile domain with a power law distribution of velocities and an immobile domain acting as a storage zone berkowitz et al 2008 such dual domain systems may occur in fractured rock berkowitz et al 2008 interaggregate soil sciortino et al 2015 fractured porous media cadini et al 2012 gerke and van genuchten 1993 yin et al 2020 karst aquifer media dewaide et al 2018 or the hyporheic zone sun et al 2020 the primary distinction between the dtsm and the traditional mobile immobile domain is the heterogeneity description within the mobile domain to simulate the full transition time spectrum of solute transport in the dual domain system various physical models were developed for instance bijeljic et al 2011 developed a dual domain transport model based on the ctrw framework in which a truncated power law memory function is used to capture anomalous transport within the mobile domain shen and phanikumar 2009 proposed a space fractional transient storage model by expanding the pioneering work of benson et al 2000a b in introducing space fractional derivatives to hydrology to capture anomalous solute transport in the stream and chemical mass exchange with the riverbed more recently sun et al 2020 developed a similar dual domain model evolved from the fractional mobile immobile model to simulate solute transport in the hyporheic zone these modifications have greatly expanded the applicability of time nonlocal transport models in simulating sub diffusion processes in complex media a notable characteristic of solute transport in the previously described complex domain systems is the presence of a concentration shoulder or the secondary late time concentration shouldering effect occurring during the late time tail of btcs berkowitz et al 2008 the mechanism of the contaminant shoulder shouldering effect has been systematically discussed by bijeljic et al 2011 and sun et al 2020 albeit under a different modeling theoretical application however this previous model theory was restricted to simulate dual peaked btcs which were developed for more generalized hydrogeologic systems siirila woodburn et al 2015 additionally the existing dual permeability model also called the mobile mobile model cannot capture anomalous transport within each domain as it assumes fickian transport in both domains chastanet and wood 2008 lu et al 2018b xie et al 2019 this theoretical deficiency limits hydrologists in appropriately developing a full understanding of solute transport process in complex systems this study proposes the development and use of a dual heterogeneous domain model dhdm using the conception of the distributed order time fractional derivative model dt fdm caputo 2001 gorenflo and mainardi 2005 the idea of fractional derivative of distributed orders was developed several decades ago caputo 1969 and used to simulate complex physical processes chechkin et al 2003 meerschaert and scheffler 2006 luchko 2009 tomovski and sandev 2017 more recently the distributed order fractional derivative models were developed to simulate groundwater flow su 2012 2017 or solute transport in heterogeneous porous media liang et al 2019 the novel theory proposed in the present study allows advection and anomalous diffusion in both domains and mass exchange between the two domains a similar transport model was developed by yin et al 2020 to capture bi peak super diffusion in alluvial aquifers a random walk particle tracking method is developed to solve the dhdm since it is computationally efficient and free of numerical dispersion it is noteworthy that the dhdm is superior to the existing dual domain transport models in quantifying complex solute transport the remainder of the work is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the development of the dual heterogeneous domain model and the random walk particle tracking scheme used to solve the new dhdm in section 3 the dhdm is applied to solute transport column experiments with various flow rates parameters and simulated btcs of the single domain transport model and dhdm are compared to better understand solute transport dynamics in soil columns in section 4 we discuss the origin of bimodal sub diffusion in dual domain systems btcs generated from both the mobile mobile domain and the mobile immobile domain are evaluated systematically the overall summary and conclusions are presented in section 5 2 development of the dual heterogeneous domain model this section presents the development of a general dual heterogeneous domain model dhdm to capture the bimodal sub diffusive transport using the concept of the distributed order time fractional derivation 2 1 governing equations for dhdm the distributed order time fractional diffusion equation can be written as luchko 2009 tomovski and sandev 2017 1 0 1 ω γ d t γ u t d γ l x where γ dimensionless 0 γ 1 is the order of the time fractional derivative ω γ t γ 1 denotes the weight for the order γ the symbol d t γ denotes the positive riemann liouville fractional derivative see further discussion in zhang et al 2008a u t is a differentiable function of t and the advection dispersion operator l x describes the spatial movement of particles energy or wave the discrete component version of the dt fdm 1 takes the form diethelm and ford 2009 2 i 1 k ω i d t γ u t l x to capture bimodal sub diffusion in dual domain media we extend upon the dt fdm 2 by allowing for different time fractional orders and spatial movement of solute particles in each domain while the mass exchange is driven by the concentration gradient between the two domains this results in the following dhdm 3a c 1 m t β 1 γ 1 c 1 m t γ 1 l 1 x c 1 m α φ 1 c 2 m c 1 m 3b c 2 m t β 2 γ 2 c 2 m t γ 2 l 2 x c 2 m α φ 2 c 1 m c 2 m where c i ml 3 i 1 2 is the concentration in domain i t t is time and x l is space coordinate φ i dimensionless is the volume fraction of the ith domain the operator l i x v i x d i 2 x 2 and v i lt 1 is the effective velocity in the ith domain v i is typically called the average linear velocity or seepage velocity for groundwater in the hydrogeology community which is equal to the darcy velocity divided by the effective porosity d i l 2 t 1 is the diffusion coefficient α t 1 is the first order rate coefficient for mass transfer β i t γ i 1 is the fractional capacity coefficient in the ith domain and γ i dimensionless is the time index representing the degree of time nonlocality for solute transport in the ith domain the time nonlocalities of different domains have an important impact on the mass exchange process here we assume the same time nonlocality for each domain which means that solute holding abilities of the two domains are the same e g β 1 β 2 β and γ 1 γ 2 γ we will explore more complex situations such as the domain sensitive retention process in future studies incorporating the above assumption yields the simplified dhdm as 4a c 1 m t β γ c 1 m t γ l 1 x c 1 m α φ 1 c 2 m c 1 m 4b c 2 m t β γ c 2 m t γ l 2 x c 2 m α φ 2 c 1 m c 2 m the governing equation for a single domain shown in the dhdm 4 without the mass exchange term reduces to the fractional mobile immobile fmim model proposed by schumer et al 2003 a detailed comparative analysis between the dhdm and fmim will be conducted in section 3 to check the feasibility validity of the dhdm 4 it is noteworthy that the tempered time fractional operator defined by meerschaert et al 2008 can be conveniently added to the dhdm 4 to simulate solute transport in media with upper limits for solute retention capabilities model 4 can effectively capture the commonly observed solute retention in each domain and therefore it may improve the classical dual advection dispersion equation dade model with mass transfer between the two mobile domains gerke and van genuchten 1993 leij et al 2012 lu et al 2018b for quantifying non fickian transport 2 2 lagrangian solution for the dhdm 4 2 2 1 particle tracking in a single domain the particle tracking random walk method ptrw is used to solve the dhdm 4 consisting of two major modules including particle transport in one domain and mass exchange between the two domains with different advective diffusive properties for instance particles traveling in a single domain can be approximated by a series of a two step random process e g jump followed by waiting zhang et al 2015 in this study we separate the whole time dt during the jth jump waiting event into two components 5 d t j d m j d i j where d m j is the mobile or operational time during the j jump and d i j is the immobile or waiting time after the jth jump the mobile time d m j can be defined as a constant or an exponentially distributed random variable for computational efficiency we select the first method the waiting time d i j is a stable random noise rescaled by d m j and β 6 d i j cos π γ 2 β d m j 1 γ s γ β 1 σ 1 μ 0 where s γ 1 1 0 denotes a stable random variable with the maximum skewness β unit scale σ and zero shift μ the method for generating stable random variables is based on the algorithm proposed by baeumer and meerschaert 2010 the jump size during the mobile time d m j due to advection and dispersion with constant coefficients can be approximated by the langevin equation corresponding to the classical advection dispersion equation ade labolle et al 1996 dentz and bolster 2010 7 d x j v d m j 2 d d m i ξ t where ξ t is a gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance 2 2 2 transition probability between domains in dhdm the main challenge to solve the dhdm 4 using the ptrw is to define the time dependent transition probability of solute particles between different domains the term transition probability originated from the concept of continuous time markov chains which represents the probability that a process in state i at present will be in state j at a future time e g ross 2003 using this principle in particle tracking with a pre assigned transition probability function we can determine if a particle is in phase i and thus susceptible to fractional order γi or in phase j after a time step δt using a bernoulli trial on the appropriate phase transition probability the phase transition probability function ptpf was applied by salamon et al 2006 whereby the simulated mass transfer between mobile and immobile zones by the ptrw scheme after extending the idea of ptpf was first proposed by michalak and kitanidis 2000 salamon et al 2006 used the normalized zeroth order spatial moments which describes the distribution of mass in different phases as the ptpf this study extends the concept of ptpf to the dhdm here we consider the first order mass transfer between each domain it is noteworthy that the mass in the immobile zones is not exchangeable with each other but can affect the mass transfer process i e this study considers a parallel immobile system the concentration for the mobile phase is now substituted for its fourier transform to calculate the zeroth order moments of the fourier domain the classical definition of the fourier transform and its inverse is used here 8a c p t c x t e i 2 π p x d x 8b c x t c p t e i 2 π p x d p by taking the fourier transform of 4 using 8a and assuming spatially uniform coefficients within a grid we obtain the following equations 9a φ 1 c 1 m t φ 1 β γ c 1 m t γ φ 1 l 1 p c 1 m w 1 t 9b φ 2 c 2 m t φ 2 β γ c 2 m t γ φ 2 l 2 p c 2 m w 2 t where l i p v i 2 π i p c i m d i 4 π 2 p 2 c i m w i t α c 1 m c 2 m the nth order moments about the origin for solutes can be related to the nth order derivative of its concentration in fourier space because the image function is also the characteristic function goltz and roberts 1987 zhang et al 2008b hence the zeroth order spatial moments of the concentration in the real domain can be evaluated by 10 μ i φ i c i m p 0 w h e r e i 1 2 substituting equation 10 into 9 and setting p 0 yields the following equation forms 11a μ 1 t β γ μ 1 t γ α μ 1 φ 1 μ 2 φ 2 11b μ 2 t β γ μ 2 t γ α μ 1 φ 1 μ 2 φ 2 equation 11 cannot be solved analytically motivating us to develop a numerical solution using the finite difference method shown in appendix a when the initial conditions μ 1 t 0 1 and μ 2 t 0 0 are considered the solution of 11 provides the transition probability for a solute particle in domain 1 to either remain in domain 1 or transfer to domain 2 similarly the transition probability for the solute particle located in domain 2 can be obtained with the initial conditions of μ 1 t 0 0 and μ 2 t 0 1 it is noteworthy that when γ 1 model 11 reduces to the governing equation of the zeroth order moments for the traditional mobile mobile model with a retardation factor r i 1 β in this case the analytical solution is obtained and used for the validation of the accuracy of the numerical scheme fig 1 fig 1 shows the evolution of the transition probability while p i j refers to the probability of a particle starting in the domain i and ending in domain j after a certain amount of time results of a simple parameter sensitivity analysis are also shown and plotted in fig 1 to provide a better understanding of the impact dependence of time nonlocality on mass transfer a larger β or a smaller γ will decrease the mass transfer rate which may be due to more solute mass absorbed within the immobile zone 2 2 3 implementation of the lagrangian scheme after calculating the phase transition probabilities a uniform 0 1 random number ω is obtained for each particle and is then compared with the corresponding phase transition probability for each time step the movement of the particle being in the ith domain is calculated according to 12 x t n d m x t n v i δ t 2 d i d m ξ t i f ω p i i x t n v j δ t 2 d j d m ξ t i f ω p i i w h e r e i j 1 2 n 0 1 2 where x t n d m is the position of the particle at time t n d m in addition the clock physical time t n 1 for a random walker after the n 1th jump and waiting events can be calculated by 13 t n 1 t n d m cos π γ 2 β d m 1 γ s γ 1 1 0 2 3 boundary conditions and concentration calculation the robin boundary condition is used herein to simulate the continuous injection of tracers the inlet boundary condition of the ptrw scheme for the time fractional model is the same as that for the traditional ade model labolle 2006 zhang et al 2016 in the present study the release rate of particles at the inlet boundary is determined by the velocity and the number of particles denoting a unit concentration 14 r e l e a s e r a t e v in dta c 0 n p where v in φ 1 v 1 φ 2 v 2 is the volumetric average velocity for the dual domain system c 0 ml 3 is the inlet concentration n p m 1 denotes the number of particles per unit volume with a unit concentration and a l 2 denotes the cross sectional area of fluid flow the release rate of sources in each domain is assumed to be flux weighted for the continuous injection boundary condition both the flux averaged and volume averaged concentrations representing the flux and resident concentrations respectively are calculated herein based on the trajectory of particles the flux averaged concentration denotes mass content within a unit volume of flux across a specific cross sectional area this kind of concentration scheme is widely observed reported in multi scale tracer experiments for simplicity and convenience of measurements the resident concentration denotes the mass density residing at a specific cell at time t which can be detected by discrete soil groundwater samples or electrical conductivity sensors zhang et al 2006 confusion between the resident and flux averaged concentrations may lead to misinterpretations of actual observations and measurements parker and van genuchten 1984 and mis calibration of parameters kim and feyen 2000 for our ptrw scheme the normalized flux averaged concentration is calculated by 15 c f x τ p n total t 1 t 2 δ x x p t d t v t 2 t 1 a n p where c f x τ ml 3 is the average flux concentration from time t 1 to t 2 δ is a dirac delta function and x p t is the location of particle p at time t ntotal dimensionless is the total number of particles in the domains the details for calculating the resident concentration can be found in labolle et al 1996 to examine the lagrangian scheme developed above for the dhdm 4 an eulerian numerical solver using the finite difference method or fdm was also developed it should be noted that an instantaneous injection mode was used in application herein three numerical examples with different mass exchange rates are shown in fig 2 other parameters of the dhdm 4 used to calculate the btcs plotted in fig 2 include v 1 1 c m h v 2 0 3 c m h d 1 0 1 c m 2 h d 2 0 03 c m 2 h γ 0 7 β 0 1 h 0 3 and φ 1 0 7 the volume averaged concentrations calculated by the lagrangian scheme match the fdm solutions extremely well 3 laboratory experiments and model application 3 1 laboratory experiments three soil columns were re packed in our laboratory to conduct conservative solute transport experiments the plexiglass columns have a dimension of 45 cm in length with an inner diameter of 14 cm the setup of the vertically oriented column from bottom to top includes 1 a lower 5 cm height water chamber with an overlying 3 cm height sandy transitional layer to promote steady state and uniform flow into the above representative heterogeneous porous medium 2 a 30 cm height of the representative heterogeneous packed soil and 3 finally a top most 3 cm height sandy transitional layer above which a constant head overflow port is outfitted to ensure stable uniform and constant flow during all experiments fig 3 the soil packed in the column was collected from the subsurface at a depth of 1 2 m at the tongzhou field tracer experiment site beijing china which was installed with high density monitoring wells and fundamental facilities for conducting field tracer experiments the sample representative elementary volumes rev for all of these packed systems were achieved to include the scale of heterogeneity i e porosity and permeability within the column volumes the sediments are fine grained alluvial flood deposits with a significant mass percentage of silty clay the grain size fraction and composition of the soil are listed in table 1 the 30 cm length of the column was selected for this study due to the following two reasons first the soil can be well mixed and then uniformly packed in the column for the purpose of investigating the potential impact of local scale heterogeneity i e from pore scale heterogeneity dead end pores to grain scale heterogeneity on anomalous transport the results and implications of experiments from columns with smaller size can provide fundamental knowledge before moving to larger scale study such as scale dependent more complicated anomalous transport in a longer column second the experiments with different size of columns were widely used to study anomalous transport of conservative or reactive solutes in porous media including 1 m long columns e g liu et al 2008 lu et al 2018a 2019 ma and selim 1996 novakowski 1992 zaheer et al 2017 and relatively larger columns 1 m e g huang et al 1995 porro et al 1993 sharma et al 2020 while the larger scale column was typically filled with sand and or gravel the small scale column was preferred for fine grained soil if a larger scale column is filled even partially with fine grained materials a large hydraulic gradient would be required to drive water flowing through the column which is not ideal for a typical laboratory experiment we will test longer columns and explore the impact of macroscopic heterogeneity on anomalous transport in a future study water through the column was supplied by a peristaltic pump with a constant rotational speed to reach a steady state flow condition the transport experiments were conducted in three steps first the column was slowly saturated by injecting clean water from the bottom at a constant flow rate to ensure stable displacement processes and saturated conditions were maintained second after saturation two liters of dissolved bromide br tracer as nabr were injected into the column as a continuous source third clean water without br was injected into the column with the same flow rate until the completion of the experiment effluent samples were collected throughout the experimental period to capture high resolution btcs three sets of column experiments with different flow rates 47 4 ml h 34 5 ml h and 15 ml h were performed to analyze the impact of flow velocity on solute transport the flow rates were selected to be consistent with realistic variations of groundwater flow rates observed in the field more details about the column experiments can be found in table 2 3 2 experimental results fig 4 shows the btcs for experiments 1 1 1 3 with various flow rates all the btcs of br exhibit sub diffusion phenomenon characterized by the heavy late time concentration tailing due to the presence of immobile zones in the silty clay packed column similar sub diffusive transport has been observed for many column scale experiments by previous studies using homogeneous media lu et al 2018a 2019 garrard et al 2017 zaheer et al 2017 or heterogeneous media huang et al 1995 gao et al 2009 to provide preliminary evaluation of the btcs obtained from the column experiments the fractional mobile immobile model fmim was proposed schumer et al 2003 zhang et al 2009 the fmim is selected here for two reasons 1 the successful and wide applications of the fmim reported in previous works major et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 garrard et al 2017 made it an appropriate tool for simulating sub diffusive transport and 2 the fitted result of fmim can be a reference for the further application of the dhdm for column transport experiments which will be conducted in section 3 3 as mentioned previously the columns used in this study were uniformly packed and the hydraulic head at both the top and bottom of the column remained stable during the tracer transport experiments moreover the effective velocity was assumed to be generally uniform and the flow system can be described as that similar to a confined 1 d aquifer where both the classical ade and the fractional model may be used for transport simulation upon upscaling solute transport in the column as a 1 d process the governing equation of the fmim can be obtained as schumer et al 2003 16 c t β γ c t γ v c x d 2 c t 2 where c ml 3 is the tracer concentration β t γ 1 is the fractional capacity coefficient and v lt 1 and d l 2 t 1 are the effective velocity and dispersion coefficient respectively when β 0 model 16 reduces to the classical advection dispersion equation ade model it should be noted that the tempered time fractional derivative model proposed by meerschaert et al 2008 has been previously used to capture sub diffusion in multi scale heterogeneous media lu et al 2018a garrard et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 to exponentially truncate the power law pdf of waiting times for solute particles an additional parameter λ was used to capture the transient process from non fickian to fickian transport this transient process truncated power law may arise while the travel time or distance becomes large enough exceeds a given threshold value berkowitz et al 2006 however the particle travel distance through column experiments is relatively short as is the case for this study hence to reduce the number of model parameters the tempered fractional operator is not invoked here the lagrangian scheme proposed by zhang et al 2008a is used to solve model 16 and the flux averaged concentration is calculated to fit the observed btcs from the column transport experiments the fitted results of the fmim model 16 are plotted in fig 4 for comparison purposes the best fit result of the ade model for experiment 1 3 is also plotted both the ade and fmim models can capture the rising limb of the btc well for the late time concentration tailing behavior of the btcs the fmim model 16 fits the data better than the ade however a slight shoulder observed in the mid tailing portion of the btcs cannot be robustly captured by either the ade or the fmim model 16 this specific structure of the btcs i e shouldering effect poses a significant challenge for solute transport modeling solute transport behavior and btcs with the similar shouldering effects have been studied previously and theoretical models have been developed for instance a two time domain ctrw model was proposed by berkowitz et al 2008 to simulate solute transfer between a main heterogeneous domain and an immobile domain we tried to apply the two time domain ctrw for simulating solute transport of the column transport experiments but the fitting results not shown here are not satisfactory the reason may be due to the possible advection of solute particles in the slow i e relatively immobile domain while the slow domain is assumed to be immobile in the two time domain ctrw therefore the dhdm 4 with advection and dispersion in both domains may be needed to appropriately capture the bimodal sub diffusion as tested below 3 3 bimodal sub diffusion in column experiments the results displayed in fig 5 show that the dhdm 4 can fit the observed btcs well for all three column experiments performed compared with the best fit results of the fmim 16 and ade models the dhdm 4 can better capture the late time concentration tails of the btcs most notably including the bimodal sub diffusion characteristics of the observed btcs the best fit parameters of the dhdm 4 for all experiments are listed in table 4 it should be noted that the best fit velocity of the fast domain in the dhdm 4 is slightly larger than that of the fmim model 16 listed in table 3 since the former also considers the slow domain with a smaller velocity the dispersivity of the dhdm 4 is much smaller than that of the fmim model 16 when a model assuming a single domain i e the fmim model 16 for the whole system is used to simulate solute transport in the dual domain system the dispersivity needs to be larger than those of models that incorporate two domains to capture the elongated expansion of the btcs caused by mass exchange between the two domain regime the parameters capturing time nonlocality β and γ and the volumetric proportion of the domain φ remain stable due to the consistent packing method utilized for the soil columns the mass transfer rate describing solute interaction between the different domains changes with the variation of the flowrate as shown in table 4 a higher flowrate leads to a larger mass transfer rate representing stronger more pronounced solute exchange 4 discussion 4 1 the origin of bimodal sub diffusion dual convection versus mass transfer bimodal btcs have been widely observed and investigated in previous studies siirila woodburn et al 2015 dual domain permeability fields and sorption kinetics were commonly considered to be the two major causes for bimodal transport of conservative tracers quinodoz and valocchi 1993 michalak and kitanidis 2000 coppola et al 2009 to date most previous studies focusing on bimodal transport were based on the dual homogeneous domain model chastanet and wood 2008 leij et al 2012 lu et al 2018b both dual advection and mass transfer between mobile immobile zones can trigger bimodal transport the questions that remain unknown are when is dual advection needed to simulate bimodal transport in a dual domain system how to recognize elucidate the underlying mechanisms yielding the bimodal btc structure so that we can choose the appropriate model the general framework of the dual domain solute transport scheme proposed in this study allows us to distinguish the bi peak btcs induced by dual advection or sorption kinetics in this section a series of btcs are generated using the fully lagrangian solver developed in section 2 to illustrate the characteristics of bi peak btcs resulting from dual advection or mobile immobile systems 4 1 1 bimodal transport in a dual advection system bimodal transport in a dual advection system as described by the dhdm 4 can be affected by three parameters the velocity v in each domain the volumetric proportion φ of each domain and the mass exchange rate α between domains first the discrepancy between pore velocities in different domains which can cause a bimodal transport process in a dual domain system may affect the position and magnitude of the 2nd peak of the btc preferential flow paths can be widely present in multi scale heterogeneous media which may cause and or enhance bimodal transport processes to illustrate the impact of the discrepancy between velocities in each domain on the structure of the btcs several scenarios are established and tested herein for description simplicity velocity in the fast domain remains constant v 1 1 cm h and various velocities in the slow domain are selected v 2 1 0 0 5 0 3 0 1 and 0 01 cm h respectively the other parameters are defined as follows β 0 1 h 0 3 γ 0 7 α 0 01 h 1 and φ1 0 7 to focus on the impact of advection on bimodal transport the dispersivity within both domains is assumed to be small and constant with an imposed value of 0 1 cm the btcs are collected from points along 5 cm downstream from the source location where an instantaneous source is released the concentration profile used in this section is the flux averaged concentration described by eq 15 results plotted in fig 6 a show that on the one hand the bimodal structure of the btc becomes more apparent for larger discrepancies in the velocity between different domains this is because when solute transport in both domains is dominated by advection a larger discrepancy or contrast between velocities can result in further separation of the two concentration peaks on the other hand when the velocity within the slow domain is small i e v 2 0 01 cm h due to diffusion and mass exchange the ancillary peak of the btc becomes relative mild and evolves eventually to a shoulder within the late time portion of the btc in this case the slow domain is analogous to an immobile domain where solute particles experience very slow advection and dispersion second the volumetric proportion of each domain directly controls the solute mass of each peak and shifts both the leading and trailing edges of the btc fig 6b a larger volumetric proportion leads to more solute mass within the corresponding domain it is noteworthy that the volumetric proportion of the domains have no apparent influence on the slope of the leading arrival wave affected mainly by the particle mobility in the fast domain or trailing elution wave of which the slope is controlled by the time index γ zhang et al 2006 edges of the btc third the mass exchange rate has a significant impact on solute transport in dual domain systems as discussed in detail in previous studies that assume fickian diffusion processes for mobile particles leij et al 2012 sciortino et al 2015 xie et al 2019 and therefore detailed results specific to this are not shown in this study 4 1 2 bimodal transport in the mobile immobile system as discussed above and shown in fig 6a when the velocity in the slow domain is too small the dual advection domain will reduce to the mobile immobile system btcs with a shoulder in the late time concentration tail can be observed for solute transport in such a dual domain system berkowitz et al 2008 bijeljic et al 2011 in this case the structure of the btc i e pattern of the declining limb is primarily controlled by the parameters φ i and α to better understand the characteristics of bimodal transport in such a system btcs are generated numerically with various φ i and α while the other parameters are defined as follows v 1 1 0 cm h d 1 0 1 cm2 h β 0 1 h 0 3 and γ 0 7 an instantaneous point source is considered and the btcs are collected at 5 cm downstream from the source the btcs shown in fig 7 a are generated by fixing the volumetric proportion of the immobile domain 0 7 obvious differences are observed when the mass transfer rate α varies from 0 005 h 1 to 0 5 h 1 a smaller mass transfer rate leads to more gradual and wider shoulders as shown in fig 7a when the mass transfer rate is relatively large 0 5 h 1 in fig 7a there is only a single peak with a heavy significant concentration tail for the btc implying that the strong communication between the two domains tends to overshadow the discrepancy of particle transport dynamics in the two domains in addition btcs of solute transport in the dual domain system with various volumetric proportions of the mobile domain φ 1 are depicted in fig 7b results show that φ 1 affects the duration broadness of the shoulder for the late time concentration tail portion of the btc where a lower φ 1 meaning more portion of the slow domain leads to a broader shoulder due to more particles being trapped by the slow domain and thereby expanding the shoulder 5 summary and conclusion this study focused on quantifying solute transport in bimodal structured porous media we developed a dual heterogeneous domain model called dhdm conceptualized from the distributed order time fractional derivative to capture bimodal sub diffusion in dual domains to solve the new model a random walk particle tracking solver was developed where the bernoulli process was used to simulate particle transition between the two domains phase transition probabilities calculated by the zeroth order spatial moments of the dual domain transport equations were used to simulate the solute particle partitioning in different domains compared with the traditional dual domain system the heterogeneity of domains retards the mass transfer process the random walk particle tracking approach based on the phase transition probability can provide satisfactory solutions for the dhdm with high computational efficiency and free of numerical dispersion the dhdm was applied to quantify and simulate bimodal sub diffusion characterized by late time tails of btcs observed from a series of column transport experiments performed in the laboratory compared with the traditional time nonlocal transport model with a single advective domain i e the standard fmim the dhdm can capture the overall pattern of the btcs more accurately results showed that the velocity field within the column can be divided into two domains with different velocities e g a fast domain and a slow domain mass exchange occurred between the two domains which was affected by the velocity within each domain neglecting this dual domain structure may have obvious and significant impact on the estimation of model parameters and result in an artificially larger dispersivity the impact of model parameters on solute transport for dual domain systems was explored providing additional information for bimodal transport in complex porous media the results revealed that the discrepancy of the average velocities between the two domains control the timing and the shape of the second peak and or shoulder for the btcs when the velocity in the slow domain is extremely small the second peak of the btc evolves and declines to a shoulder during the late time portion of the btc which has also been observed and discussed by previous studies berkowitz et al 2008 bijeljic et al 2011 sun et al 2020 credit authorship contribution

5093,decision makers face major challenges when trying to reduce risks of water scarcity sustainably through measures of water reuse one of these challenges is the lack of interconnectedness between risk assessment for water scarcity and sustainability assessment for water reuse therefore this paper aims to explore the conceptual integration of risk and sustainability assessments rsa in a framework for decision support in water scarcity water reuse situations this article follows a three steps approach i defining and interpreting the water scarcity water reuse situation as a coupled human and natural system ii identifying and defining key concepts relevant for risk and sustainability assessment and iii constructing the integrated rsa framework for decision support as a result the latter provides a conceptualisation of a simultaneous assessment of water scarcity as a risk and the sustainability of water reuse measures according to the social economic and environmental dimensions it contemplates an analysis phase and an evaluation phase to provide unified information on the level of water scarcity risk and water reuse sustainability the resulting indicates that the integration of risk and sustainability in one joint assessment for decision support is conceptually feasible it hence paves the way towards a comprehensive and consistent methodological operationalisation and empirical application keywords water scarcity water reuse risk reduction sustainability decision making integrated assessment 1 introduction achieving water security is key for sustainable development united nations 2015 water security may be achieved by managing water resources in a way that they are accessible in an appropriate quantity and quality for human uses while respecting water as integral part of ecosystems e g gwp 2000 schulte and morrison 2014 but water resources are increasingly stressed in their quantity and quality by demographic development economic growth and climate change which is likely to lead to a severe global water crisis alcamo et al 2007 kumar et al 2018 over 1 7 billion people live in river basins where withdrawal exceeds recharge undp 2016 by 2050 70 of the river basins are projected to suffer water related problems with more than four billion people living in cities with persistent or seasonal water scarcity alcamo et al 2007 mcdonald et al 2011 wwap 2018 the world is therefore far from being water secure water reuse or using treated wastewater for diverse purposes is heavily discussed as a means of increasing available water quantities at diverse quality ranges and thus lowering freshwater withdrawals to alleviate water scarcity wwap 2017 gancheva et al 2018 fit for purpose production and the use of this kind of water are certainly not the only means of overcoming water scarcity since there are other alternatives including desalination inter basin water transfer and water withdrawal restriction however water reuse is seeing a particularly increased implementation in regions facing apparent water scarcity generating water scarcity water reuse situations e g asano et al 2007 levy et al 2014 fao 2017 voulvoulis 2018 water reuse in these regions is also specifically advocated as a sustainable measure to overcome water scarcity bedbabis et al 2010 wilcox et al 2016 el moussaoui et al 2017 fito and van hulle 2020 hence the current discourse in scientific and grey literature seems to advocate for water reuse as a sustainable measure to overcome the risk of water scarcity so far much needed attention is being paid on the risks related to the quality of the used water and how to mitigate reduce and circumvent these e g wwap 2017 dwa 2019 however the contribution of water reuse measures to the reduction of water scarcity risk has not been a major topic yet one reason seems to be that water scarcity and water reuse are mostly tackled in two different realms of water management responding to different aims while water scarcity is a subject of natural disaster risk management to identify and reduce the level of risk water reuse evolved in water resources management with the aim of long term assurance of water availability in adequate quality i e to support a sustainable water resource management each realm has distinct conceptual and methodological approaches and these differences make it particularly challenging for an integration that supports decision making unisdr 2015 in this case on water scarcity risk reduction through sustainable water reuse there are approaches for risk assessment to deal with water scarcity on the one hand e g veldkamp et al 2016 and sustainability assessment of water reuse measures on the other hand e g akhoundi and nazif 2018 while a risk assessment related to water scarcity highlight issues of water shortage e g wef global risk report 2019 and in water supply e g world risk report by mucke et al 2019 a water related sustainability assessment provides information focusing on social economic and environmental aspects of water management measures such as water reuse e g opher et al 2019 rezaei et al 2019 aspects such as whether there will be enough quantity of water resource as well as knowing about the water scarcity situation have been reported as relevant success factors for the implementation of water reuse measures mainali et al 2011 tran et al 2017 such information can be provided by a risk assessment of water scarcity likewise considering a lesson learnt from the hyogo framework for action 2005 2015 unisdr 2015 taken by the sustainable development goals sdgs i e sdg 11 united nations 2015 there is the need for integrating risk and sustainability approaches in general thus before a decision maker tackles the challenging question of which kind of measure to use to reduce the risks from the quality of treated wastewater it may make sense to first assess if any of the considered water reuse measures would actually sustainably reduce the main risk namely that of water scarcity if this is not the case other measures to do so may have to be sought currently assessment approaches considering simultaneously both aspects that of a risk and a sustainability assessment are lacking therefore this research aims at developing a framework that conceptually integrates risk assessment and sustainability assessment for decision support in water scarcity water reuse situations the intention of the framework is to ensure an appropriate joint consideration of the risk of water scarcity and the sustainability of water reuse as a measure for risk reduction this provides the basis for a subsequent assessment of water quality risk the intended integrated risk and sustainability assessment rsa framework is designed to be applied in an a ex ante manner to support decisions related to whether a water reuse measure should be implemented given a measured or projected risk of water scarcity and what would be required to do this sustainably or b ex post manner providing information about the risk of water scarcity and the sustainable performance of an already implemented water reuse measure both ex ante and ex post assessments are focused on water reuse measures including comparative assessments between different system arrangements and technologies but a comparison of water scarcity risk reduction measures beyond water reuse exceeds the scope of this work the reader may expect a conceptual work focused on the water quantity aspects of water management integrating water scarcity risk assessment and water reuse sustainability assessment in a decision support framework a detailed reflection on water quality and accessibility issues would transcend the scope of this work section 2 describes the approach for the development of the framework using a three step procedure section 3 presents the results and discussion comprising i the system analysis of water scarcity water reuse situations ii systematisation and explanation of concepts relevant for this framework and finally iii the integrated rsa framework for decision support moreover this section refers to the comprehensiveness specificity and limitations of the framework section 4 provides conclusions and an outlook on future research demands particularly referring to methodological implementation 2 developing the conceptual framework the use of conceptual frameworks is common in the environmental sciences especially in the context of comprehensive analysis or management of natural resources e g berrouet et al 2018 pavan and ometto 2018 however despite their fundamental role not much detail is given about the approaches and steps followed for the construction of such frameworks jabareen 2009 offers a clear reflection on the meaning and analysis of conceptual frameworks accordingly conceptual frameworks bear on the following core characteristics ibid i a construct where each concept plays an integral role ii interpretative approach to social reality iii understanding rather than theoretical explanation iv interpretation of intentions rather than knowledge of hard facts v indeterministic in nature and therefore do not enable us to predict an outcome vi developed and constructed through a process of qualitative analysis vii the sources of data consist of many discipline oriented theories that become the empirical data of the conceptual framework analysis these characteristics are highly interwoven for example conceptual frameworks provide an interpretative approach to social reality while also being an interpretation of intentions which may not predict an outcome these characteristics and the analysis phases proposed by jabareen allow for the derivation of three steps for the development of conceptual frameworks i definition and interpretation of the subject at stake ii identification and description of key concepts and iii construction of the conceptual framework fig 1 depicts a schematic view of the approach as well as a preview of the obtained results see section 3 to understand the structure of this article the following subsections present more details about the three steps and their use for the development of the integrated rsa framework for decision support 2 1 definition and interpretation the subject at stake the subject at stake is the decision making in water scarcity water reuse situations with special focus on water quantity matters these situations refer to actors e g in a municipality which expect to face or currently face water scarcity and who are planning to or have already implemented water reuse measures see fig 2 the aim is to support ex ante assessments related to the design planning and implementation of future water reuse measures or ex post assessments related to the performance control and monitoring of implemented water reuse measures both perspectives can support design planning and implementation aspects to reduce the risk increase the sustainability or even correlate the level of risk and sustainability in all these cases decision makers exhibit an interest in reducing water scarcity by implementing sustainable water reuse measures assessments play a key role in decision support by operationalising the topic they aim to asses alcamo et al 2003 for the above mentioned water scarcity water reuse situations a risk assessment of water scarcity informs about the level of risk and how this could change i e scenarios or be reduced e g gain and giupponi 2015 veldkamp et al 2016 in contrast a sustainability assessment can be used to compare different water reuse measures or portfolios of those measures e g benavides et al 2019 opher et al 2019 rezaei et al 2019 while risk assessment does not address the sustainability of alternative measures a sustainability assessment does not comprise the water scarcity risk reduction effects of water reuse measures each of these assessments supports a particular decision and are not necessarily interrelated but this distinction can inhibit comprehensiveness of decisions see fig 2a however since both assessments have succeeded in providing the respective information for decision making the focus of an advanced assessment here is set on further interrelating them therefore the integrated rsa framework intends to offer a structured and aforethought approach for addressing risk and sustainability simultaneously in a unified manner from the beginning this is supposed to bridge data and information throughout the decision making process for the delivery of comprehensive and consistent information rather than to converge results of two different assessment processes see fig 2b to gain a deeper understanding of a water scarcity water reuse situation there is a need for interpreting it first this should lead to a simplified representation that helps to reduce the complicatedness of the real world situation and hence facilitate its understanding systems thinking allows addressing this complicatedness by interpreting situations as a set of interconnected parts which function together as a complex whole smithson et al 2008 p 9 in general natural or environmental systems e g ecosystems hydrological systems are originally conceptualised separate to societal systems e g social organisational systems smithson et al 2008 jalilov et al 2018 however for water management and related risk and sustainability studies there is a particular interest in the interrelations between both systems turner et al 2003 ostrom 2009 binder et al 2013 srinivasan et al 2013 schanze 2016 therefore the interpretation of a water scarcity water reuse situation needs to follow a systemic approach in this case as a coupled human and natural system chans liu et al 2007 this way the system should consider and describe interrelations in form of energy matter and information flows ibid the approach used for analysing the water scarcity water reuse situation distinguishes between a natural or environmental sub system referring to biophysical aspects of matter and energy flows whereas the human sub system covers biophysical aspects on the one hand and immaterial aspects related to information flows on the other hand in a water scarcity water reuse chans focused on water quantity the biophysical system comprises the natural sub system and the biophysical aspects of the human sub system in addition considering the decision making process for structuring the assessment requires involvement of the immaterial aspects of the human sub system in the respective chans examples of elements related to the biophysical human aspects can include water withdrawal facilities water supply infrastructure sanitation wastewater treatment plants irrigation equipment whereas immaterial elements may refer to e g the organisation of water resources management and the institutional arrangements such as legal regulations and governance modes see fig 3 in general systems analysis may involve qualitative or quantitative methods liu et al 2007 a qualitative approach is used for the development of the integrated rsa framework with the potential of quantitative analyses in subsequent research 2 2 identification and definition of key concepts to further conceptualise the water scarcity water reuse situation and develop the integrated rsa framework it is important to define the following key concepts water scarcity water reuse risk sustainability and the respective assessments additionally understanding decision making is required for tailoring the integrated assessment towards decision support the reflection of all these concepts is relevant for overcoming misunderstandings in this interdisciplinary space primarily because the way of understanding these concepts influences the preferred type of assessment tarne et al 2017 see section 3 2 a non systematic literature review involving academic and grey literature of these concepts is carried out to collect and contrast definitions from different disciplines and sectors to derive a coherent understanding the definitions found in documents of international organisations e g fao unisdr iso as well regulations e g in the european union were assumed to represent a common transdisciplinary understanding of each concepts as far as they are supported by the scientific literature section 3 2 presents the results of this review for the derivation of the working definitions of the mentioned concepts relevant for the framework 2 3 construction of the conceptual framework after interpreting the situation and defining the relevant concepts there is the need of interrelating them to build the integrated rsa framework in this research it involves the following steps 1 interrelating water scarcity with risk and water reuse with sustainability this means using the risk and sustainability concepts to interpret the definitions of water scarcity and water reuse respectively as well as analysing potential risks for the sustainability of the water reuse measure 2 relating risk and sustainability assessments with each other and with decision making this addresses the alignment of the integrated assessment to decision making focusing on the common scope of the assessment and what it comprises e g structure procedure indicators 3 results and discussion the approach followed in this research facilitated a situational focus of the framework for the water related situation an open search of definitions of the relevant concepts and a structured interrelation of these concepts to create the framework the results are conceptual and intend to provide the basis for methodological operationalisation and empirical studies involving existing methods and real world data 3 1 defining and interpreting the water scarcity water reuse situation according to section 2 1 the water scarcity water reuse situation may be interpreted as a coupled human and natural system chans this system comprises on the one hand natural and human biophysical aspects involving water flows and on the other hand immaterial aspects of water management decision making with its institutional context individual elements need to be defined and interrelated to support decision making on water scarcity risk reduction and sustainable water reuse the interconnection between the biophysical system and the immaterial aspects of the human sub system is given by the management alternatives that have an effect on the water flows biophysical aspects while resulting from the decision making process based on immaterial aspects e g regulatory frame fig 4 shows the simplified representation of the system understanding the biophysical system that portrays the water flows consists of elements of the natural sub system e g the catchment area ecosystems and biophysical aspects of the human sub system e g withdrawal supply sanitation and treatment facilities reuse different shapes classify these elements as natural or human processes sequence of change steps or activities resulting in natural or human outputs products goods and users that make deliberate application or utilisation of water for a specific purpose fao n d the classes refer to elements that have associated influences on the quantity of water e g iwa 2016 they are related to the water flows which in turn depend on climatological and hydrological conditions as well as the water management moreover it is possible to distinguish the water flow system in four main categories source freshwater resource use human use of water treatment sanitation and the treatment process and reuse human use and discharge of the treated wastewater and generated by products this categorisation helps relating the elements of the source and use categories to the water scarcity aspects of the situation and the components of the treatment and reuse categories to water reuse the reuse directly refers to elements of water use but it is presented in a separate category to schematically highlight that it is the use of treated wastewater and not of freshwater therefore there is a circular idea of water flows presented linearly such compartmentalised interpretation supports the understanding of the situation by providing the decision maker with a general overview while considering relevant elements and their interrelations the immaterial aspects of the human sub system focus on the information flows that result in the selection of management alternatives they comprise the decision makers actors involved in the decision making process e g a mayor further stakeholders involved e g civil society ngos as well as the institutional and organisational context the institutional and organisational context can define how decisions are made based on societal rules that structure social interactions redlawsk and lau 2013 e g regulations referring to water reuse practices however there are information flows between the various institutional and organisational arrangements and to the different decision makers and stakeholders likewise there is a constant exchange of information between the decision makers and with stakeholders this exchange is not necessarily uniform between the persons and groups involved and hence can generate information and power asymmetries e g loch et al 2014 avellán et al 2019 pan et al 2019 a proper representation of all actors and stakeholders requires specific stakeholder mapping and analysis according to social science methods e g mitchell et al 1997 reed et al 2009 although all immaterial aspects are situational they are presented in a generic manner in fig 4 for schematic reasons finally decision making is summarised in one general box referring to water scarcity risk reduction and sustainable water reuse the defined aim for this framework and directly linked to the design of potential ex ante assessment or the performance control of existing ex post assessment management alternatives overall the water scarcity water reuse situation exceeds natural and engineering science boundaries and links to the social sciences here particularly referring to decision theory but beyond also several actor stakeholder and network theories a chans representation allows to portray not only matter flows water but also basic societal information flows simultaneously and hence precisely meets the requirements of the subject of the framework although any water scarcity water reuse situation has its site specific character this first general conceptualisation serves as basis for adaptation and refinement with a consistent level of detail 3 2 identifying and defining key concepts the literature review provides an overview of the various in many cases converging understandings of the concepts relevant for the framework with the intention of creating a consistent basis this is relevant because the water scarcity water reuse situation transcends to an interdisciplinary or even transdisciplinary realm as already visible from the different sources of concept definitions 3 2 1 water scarcity water management can be split into three main aspects quantity quality and accessibility of water resources schulte and morrison 2014 issues associated with the quantity of water resources often refer to the terms scarcity as in lack of and stress see table 1 the latter is usually indicated as a less severe condition than scarcity e g falkenmark et al 1989 in contrast schulte and morrison 2014 differentiate between both terms where water scarcity relates only to the availability of water in quantitative terms and water stress involves any issue pertaining either quantity availability quality or accessibility of to water resources nevertheless all of the definitions of scarcity and stress allude to the inability of meeting the needs or demand of the human population thus the discussion must not only contemplate natural hydrological aspects but recognise the intrinsic human component that shapes this term i e there is no scarcity if no human requirement has to be met there seems to be a prevailing subjectivity in the use of terms that can lead to a general ambiguity for instance the relation between the terms availability and scarcity although availability is often referred to as the quantity of water resources e g hoekstra 2000 schulte and morrison 2014 it can also refer to a situation that does not only comprise the quantity of water but also its quality and accessibility especially when the quality of the water resources is not appropriate or they are not accessible then they are ultimately not available for human use thus when addressing scarcity as focused on quantitative availability it is more appropriate to maintain the concrete use of quantity instead of availability combining this to the view presented by schulte and morrison 2014 the term water stress can be applied as a degree of the net availability of water for human use considering quantity quality and accessibility rather than as less severe or general term for water scarcity the use of the term water scarcity is already discussed by hoekstra 2000 highlighting that it can respond to a supply problem a demand problem or an economic perspective of water later gain and giupponi 2015 emphasised two primary measurements of water scarcity supply driven which is the available quantity of water for human use with respect to renewable freshwater resources and demand driven referring to how much water is demanded with respect to the available quantity in the first case the focus is set on the water available for withdrawal whereas in the second case the focus point is the human demand for water either way and according to a general definition water scarcity refers to an amount of water for human use it is worth mentioning that there is discussion about considering environmental or ecosystem water requirements to determine the water resources available for human use oki and kanae 2006 schulte and morrison 2014 schneider and avellan 2019 directly relating to their relevance in defining water scarcity since this work follows the line of a chans with natural and human biophysical and immaterial aspects the terms water withdrawal and water demand are differentiated water scarcity involves the quantity of natural water resources available for withdrawal a biophysical human aspect to fulfil a specific water demand a human immaterial aspect hence water withdrawal is the actual amount physically extracted human biophysical aspect supply driven whereas water demand here refers to the amount of water required by society which may or not be met involving immaterial aspects as well demand driven in general there is a direct relationship between both of these terms which is why water withdrawal is used to estimate water demand vörösmarty et al 2000 rosegrant and cai 2002 oki and kanae 2006 table 2 presents the definitions used for the integrated rsa framework 3 2 2 water reuse the interchangeable use of several terms such as water recycling treated wastewater reuse water reuse and water reclamation generates confusion ricart and rico 2019 because of its widespread application this work refers mainly to the terms water reuse and water reclamation the international organisation for standardisation iso defines water reuse as the use of treated wastewater for beneficial use allowing to employ it as a synonym of water reclamation iso 16075 1 2015 some organisations like the german association for water wastewater and waste dwa make use of this definition however other authors and regulations highlight differences between both terms in those cases water reclamation refers to a particular instance of water reuse that involves additional rigorous treatment for more restricted uses asano et al 2007 ansari et al 2018 european commission 2018 ricart and rico 2019 the proposal for a regulation on minimum requirements for water reuse of the european commission 2018 indicates that water reclamation involves the treatment of urban wastewater in a reclamation treatment plant following specific requirements therefore water reclamation refers to a type of water reuse that allows providing water that meets particular quality characteristics this work recognises the difference in water reuse and reclamation as well as the fact that water reclamation is a type of water reuse see table 3 however for practical reasons and because this framework does not strictly define the use of the treated wastewater the choice is to refer to the general term water reuse 3 2 3 risk and risk assessments according to the united nations office for disaster risk reduction undrr formerly unisdr disaster risk is the potential loss of life injury or destroyed or damaged assets which could occur to a system society or a community in a specific period of time determined probabilistically as a function of hazard exposure vulnerability and capacity undrr n d the operationalisation of risk considers it to be a function of hazard exposure and vulnerability of the studied system e g blanco vogt and schanze 2014 garrick and hall 2014 rubert and beetlestone 2014 sayers et al 2016 table 4 shows the respective working definitions used in this research risk assessments ra provide decision makers with information related to the probable responses when exposed to a hazard zio 2018 to explore means of risk reduction there are well developed and structured assessment frameworks to assess risk guiding the identification analysis and evaluation of hazards and their impacts and resulting risk zio 2018 these assessments involve two main tasks i risk analysis sources pathways receptors and consequences and ii risk evaluation schanze 2009 3 2 4 sustainability and sustainability assessments the meaning of sustainability and sustainable development originated from the intention of reconciling human development and environment to improve human life quality marchese et al 2018 the social economic and environmental dimensions otherwise known as the triple bottom line help to understand and operationalise sustainable development acting as the three pillars of sustainability waas et al 2011 other dimensions such as the institutional dimension related to democracy and governance e g waas et al 2011 toumi et al 2017 and the cultural dimension e g balkema et al 2002 appear as the fourth pillar in some cases however the three main pillars maintain their fundamental status in sustainability indistinctly of the approach there are different definitions associated with these pillars but they tend to point in the same direction e g balkema et al 2002 waas et al 2011 table 5 shows the definitions used for the integrated rsa framework see table 6 unlike risk even with a set of defined dimensions the challenge in operationalising sustainable development is handling it since the definitions outline a concept rather than giving a rigid rule balkema et al 2002 p 154 this can be an opportunity that allows flexibility to adapt to the different needs and circumstances but it implies a more significant challenge for its practical implementation waas et al 2011 despite the associated challenges of the analysis and evaluation of sustainable development a broad term defining this endeavour is sustainability assessment sa sa is the most commonly used term amongst many others e g sustainability appraisal integrated assessment integrated sa sustainability impact assessment triple bottom line assessment 3 e integrated assessment environment economy equity and extended integrated assessment pope et al 2004 2017 hacking and guthrie 2008 there are different definitions and understandings of sa e g hacking and guthrie 2008 sala et al 2015 pope et al 2017 the one presented by hacking and guthrie 2008 p 73 and used in this framework is broad enough for various decision making situations e g policies programmes plans projects etc involving individual or collective issues a means of directing planning and decision making towards sustainable development 3 2 5 decision making although decision theory provides different views it is well established that decision making commonly aims at maximising the gains benefits or achievement of defined interests edwards 1954 tversky and kahneman 1986 this also means minimising the maximum losses or maximising the minimal gain edwards 1954 whether it is including phases of framing editing and evaluation tversky and kahneman 1986 or considering simplification tasks that involve decomposition editing or heuristics redlawsk and lau 2013 there are common aspects in behavioural decision theory that lead to a final decision or choice output i identification of the interest goal or aim ii framing and decomposing and iii an evaluation see fig 5 the framing and decomposing stage delineates the boundary of the problem and breaks it into elements that are easier to evaluate in doing so the interest or aim might change and the process restarts feedback if that is not the case the evaluation phase judges the components according to defined criteria targets or thresholds depending on the aim finally a rational choice corresponds to the best evaluated alternative that mostly allows fulfilling the interest or aim tversky and kahneman 1986 redlawsk and lau 2013 all three steps or phases are embedded in a specific context and rely on constant input and output of data and information thus decision making can be categorised as a sequence of steps with cyclic feedbacks that leads to a decision 3 3 construction of the integrated rsa framework this third step is dedicated to the construction of the framework first it comprises the incremental interrelation of the key concepts defined in the previous section second the integrated rsa framework itself is compiled 3 3 1 interrelating the key concepts 3 3 1 1 water scarcity from a risk perspective water scarcity is fundamentally associated with threatening natural conditions and adverse social economic and environmental consequences such as the lack of water for basic household needs e g washing and cooking wwap 2018 thus it involves an intrinsic risk as a risk it can be expressed as a probability function of negative consequences due to the change of natural or human aspects this function describes the human water demand human immaterial aspect being exposed to the hazard of a decrease in water quantities available for human use natural and human biophysical aspects these components shape the interpretation of the risk dimensions as shown in fig 6 at a glance the hazard seems to be related to reduced quantities of water resources available for human use a reduction of water resources does not directly imply adverse effects but it can potentially result in harm which fits the definition of hazard there are different reasons for a decrease negative delta in the quantity of water resources which relate to the natural and human biophysical aspects and can be distinguished as source and pathways according to the source pathway receptor concept e g sayers et al 2016 the decrease can be triggered by drivers of change such as climate change upstream land use change or water withdrawal e g vörösmarty et al 2000 this understanding places the hazard at the source and use categories of the proposed system s representation of the water scarcity water reuse situation and directly points to the catchment water bodies considering climatological and hydrological processes as well as human water uses exposure relates to the hazard prone areas and all the elements receptors that are within that area a decrease in the quantity of water resources hazard fundamentally relates to elements e g municipal or domestic industrial agricultural with a human demand for water resources what constitutes the exact boundaries of an exposed area is circumstantial and usually involves contextual e g water infrastructure spatial e g river valley and temporal features e g under future boundary conditions due to climatic change defining the exposed area allows to specify the system s representation of the water scarcity water reuse situation by identifying the involved elements e g the exposed area entails intense agricultural activities which determine the demand for water resources and diminish the role of drinking water treatment processes this allows characterising the system according to the local context vulnerability refers to the human demand for water resources that is susceptible to a decrease in water resources in addition to human biophysical aspects such as water use and respective technologies it comprises social economic and environmental values and functions blanco vogt and schanze 2014 the demand may underlie a spatial pattern and temporal variability moreover it can change in the long run due to e g demographic development urbanisation and intensification of agricultural use for example communities located in areas arid or semi arid regions can be highly vulnerable to an increase in water demand e g in a hot and dry season fao 2017 voulvoulis 2018 the coping capacity can be manifold with measures ranging from water harvesting in rainy seasons to emergency water supply through road tankers water scarcity as a risk is the likelihood of not fulfilling the human water demand due to a decrease in the quantity of water resources for human use it may result from either a decrease of the freshwater resources due to climatological hydrological processes or the increase of human demand on the one hand or simultaneous occurrence of both on the other hand in this case a risk assessment consists of a combined analysis and evaluation of the hazard as the decrease of the quantity of water resources the vulnerability of human water demand maybe undergoing seasonal or long term increase and depending on exposure the likelihood of its occurrence needs to be calculated as probability and if possible additionally with its uncertainty the representation of the water scarcity water reuse situation as a system can facilitate the analysis of the risk by underlining exposed and highly vulnerable elements of the system for instance there is a fast growing city with increasing water demand which sets the focus on the municipal element of the system as well as on all the related aspects for water supply water withdrawals drinking water treatment a system s visualisation can serve as a mental map supporting the analysis of the conceptual components of risk facilitating the comprehension and implications of a water scarcity situation 3 3 1 2 water reuse from a sustainability perspective this subsection focuses on the characteristics of water reuse measures to be sustainable emphasising on quantity of water supply see table 7 potential water quality issues are acknowledged and thus quality risks for the sustainability of water reuse are presented in the next subsection from a societal perspective a sustainable water reuse measure can secure social needs by providing ready to use contaminant free water resources and hence support social well being challenging social aspects such as perception and acceptance can be addressed through capacity development empowerment and active participation of the community to allocate the reuse measures where they are most needed and socially accepted baggett et al 2006 rice et al 2016 khanpae et al 2020 another challenge relies on the coordination of the water supply and sanitation sectors and the participation of the involved stakeholders fao 2017 ricart and rico 2019 from an economically sustainable perspective a re valorisation of water resources and the possible by products e g energy nutrients resulting from their treatment can foster long term resource efficiency under careful considerations of financial and scale treatment plant size aspects asano et al 2007 yang and abbaspour 2007 the challenge is to provide an interesting and feasible business model that compensates the expenses of the needed treatment processes e g circular economy perspective iwa 2016 voulvoulis 2018 the contribution of water reuse to environmental sustainability relies on reducing the demand for freshwater resources by providing further uses for already used water this can reduce the depletion of water resources wwap 2017 libutti et al 2018 and hence support the protection conservation and enhancement of the ability of the environment to sustain human needs furthermore treatment and reuse may advance overall purification and release water with proper quality for discharge in water bodies avoiding further contamination still there are some challenges in this dimension such as greenhouse gas emissions from energy demand hafeez et al 2014 as well as environmental risks see subsection 3 3 1 3 3 3 1 3 water scarcity and other risks for sustainable water reuse measures there are different aspects that pose other risks to the sustainability of a water reuse measure i e for the fulfilment of the definitions presented in table 7 on the one hand the risk of water scarcity affects the feasibility of the implementation of a water reuse measure because if the water scarcity is severe there is the possibility of expecting not enough wastewater quantity for a reuse measure e g beveridge et al 2017 tran et al 2017 in the case of a less severe water scarcity there is still the risk of concentrating pollutants in the wastewater which challenges the performance of the wastewater treatment systems as well as increasing the associated costs tran et al 2017 these issues are of relevance for the integrated rsa framework and may challenge water reuse measures as a sustainable means of reducing the risk of water scarcity on the other hand there are social and environmental risks associated to water reuse itself mainly related to the quality of the treated wastewater in the first case water reuse can pose a risk to human health due to contact and or ingestion of hazardous components e g heavy metals pathogens present in the treated wastewater e g toze 2006 fao 2017 ricart and rico 2019 likewise the existence of pollutants in the treated wastewater can also affect the environment for instance soil properties e g increased salinity and heavy metal concentration e g urbano et al 2015 fao 2017 khanpae et al 2020 therefore it is common to find regulations and guidelines for safe water reuse such as the health protection measures proposed by the who ranging from the classification of crops to irrigation strategies who 2006 other risks related to water supply sanitation and treatment processes that should be considered are accidental leakage and cross connection events e g oesterholt et al 2007 sercu et al 2011 likewise the compliance of relevant financial and regulatory instruments is an important factor challenging water reuse measures avellán et al 2019 all of these aspects along with the mentioned health and environmental issues should be considered when designing and implementing a water reuse measure avellán et al 2019 this can be addressed by including the respective indicators for evaluation in the sa e g spiller 2016 benavides et al 2019 3 3 2 integrated risk and sustainability assessment rsa framework specifying the key concepts and interrelating them for a water scarcity water reuse situation sets the basis of the integrated rsa framework for decision support this framework includes a risk assessment for water scarcity and a sustainability assessment for water reuse to support decisions regarding the implementation of water reuse as means of water scarcity risk reduction focusing on water quantity according to the definition of sustainability assessments given by hacking and guthrie 2008 the rsa framework is defined as a procedure that aims to guide decision making towards risk reduction and increased sustainability in line with the tasks involved in assessments the framework comprises an analysis phase and an evaluation phase to support decision making in a water scarcity water reuse situation through an integrated assessment risk and sustainability assessments need to be combined appropriately the steps involved in decision making serve as a basis to do so i identification of the interest goal or aim ii framing and decomposing and iii an evaluation see fig 5 the interest or aim define the focus and type of assessment e g quantitative qualitative level of stakeholder involvement the framing and decomposing stage in decision making relates to the analysis phase of the assessment i e the identification of the different components or elements and interlinkages finally the evaluation is explicitly present in the decision making and assessment tasks i e the judgement of the situation based on risk and sustainability criteria or thresholds this work proposes that in the dynamic flow of information between the stages of decision making assessments provide a means of organising and processing information to understand and evaluate a water scarcity water reuse situation see fig 7 this way the output of the integrated rsa framework is the level of risk of water scarcity or risk reduction and the level of sustainability of water reuse measures this information output can guide the decision maker towards choosing the option or a set of management options that allow minimising the risk and maximising the sustainability in the assessed context the decision support framework is finalised by including the general structure of the integrated rsa in the representation of the initial decision making situation see fig 2 fig 7 presents an advanced conceptualisation of this situation following the steps of the decision making and including the risk and sustainability assessment a detailed description of each step is given below the proposed framework uses the sustainability dimensions to organise and process the information thus the social economic and environmental aspects also hold true for the risk analysis and evaluation by doing so there is the possibility of decomposing the water scarcity water reuse situation into more focused fragments allowing to address it from the perspectives of these three dimensions and through the lenses of risk and sustainability this grants a comprehensive view of the situation considering e g the social vulnerabilities to water scarcity the social impacts of a water reuse measure and the relevant aspects to achieve social sustainability that include simultaneously a risk reduction likewise for the other dimensions 3 3 2 1 information pool all the information used to define the aim and to perform the rsa framework as well as the information generated in each of the decision making steps flows from and into the general information pool the input of different actors and stakeholders e g public administration private sector civil society ngos academia enriches this information pool the pool is heterogeneous and not entirely open as presented in the scheme but rather exhibiting divisions that reflect the common information asymmetries this is an issue that decision makers need to be aware of and address because it directly influences the performance of this information based assessment 3 3 2 2 interest or aim even though the specific interest or aim depends on the decision makers the principal intention underlying this framework is to reduce the risk of water scarcity through the implementation of sustainable water reuse measures in other words this means minimising risk and maximising sustainability the assessment can be applied i ex ante for decisions on different water scarcity scenarios and alternative water reuse measures to select the water reuse measures that should be implemented similar to opher et al 2019 under a particular water scarcity situation or ii ex post for decisions on the performance of the current water reuse measure similar to benavides et al 2019 under a given water scarcity situation for the identification of intervention points that can increase the sustainability and minimise the risk more specific interests or aims would include aspects that depend on the site specific context such as particular limitations and trade offs e g financial resources and time or available capacity among many others e g kurian et al 2019 they could also point towards achieving synergistic results e g coordination between the water supply and sanitation sectors fao 2017 these specific interests or aims do not undermine the main interest but can shape the assessment highlighting aspects that need detailed analysis and determining evaluation criteria 3 3 2 3 analysis the analysis phase provides an understanding of the water scarcity water reuse situation by identifying elements processes and fluxes and interpreting their interrelations it considers 1 identification of elements within the natural and human sub systems e g relevant water uses e g in industry agriculture essential activities and processes e g drinking water sanitation and wastewater treatment processes and actors e g a list of stakeholders main decision makers information holders this could be supported by existing indicators related to the risk of water scarcity and the sustainability of water reuse 2 interpretation of the situation and identification of interrelations natural and human aspects of the situation and the use of risk and sustainability dimensions for interpretation and interrelation of concepts the interpretation and representation of the situation as a chans as shown in fig 4 helps to visually place and connect the identified elements of the situation further categorisation can describe the nature of the interlinkages e g as consumption negative or production positive values of water flows drivers of water scarcity and water reuse e g increase in water withdrawal pressures biophysical and societal responses and impacts social economic and environmental 3 3 2 4 evaluation the evaluation of the situation requires indicators and related criteria as targets or threshold values here the indicators and target or threshold values could result from the analysis and refer to the level of risk for water scarcity and the level of sustainability for water reuse measures e g spiller 2016 choi et al 2017 benavides et al 2019 the analysis provides a systematic understanding of the water scarcity water reuse situation to select the indicators whereof evaluation criteria may be derived from societal goals as e g set in legal regulations the results of the analysis are evaluated based on the target or threshold values set in the respective step and lead to the combined level of risk and sustainability of the water scarcity water reuse situation the choice requires a methodological structuring of the decision making problem this is typically done by the use of multi criteria decision making approaches such as multiple attribute decision making e g ahp topsis or multiple objective decision making approaches covering impact and equity analyses relevant for water security kalbar et al 2012 mardani et al 2015 2017 nie et al 2018 these approaches involve weighing and thresholds for the indicators the current framework is not prescriptive of one evaluation method but rather allows using the method that is considered more suitable for each specific case it is important to highlight that at any stage of the assessment given the newly generated information there is the possibility of rethinking and changing the initial aim and restarting the procedure however the result of the analysis provides the data to evaluate different alternatives this means that the evaluation is not a process that considers feedback like the analysis instead it is a snapshot of the analysed situation 3 3 2 5 choice the final decision making refers to alternatives for water scarcity risk reduction through sustainable water reuse these alternatives can be portfolios of water reuse measures they are analysed ex ante or ex post under water scarcity scenarios taking environmental and societal change into account the chosen alternative is supposed to be the optimal choice for the initial interest or aim i e minimising risk and maximising sustainability given context specific restrictions another possible circumstance is an inconclusive one where the final choice does not lead to a measure but rather to a change in the aim or focus and a restart of the process feedback loop this could be the case for a severe water scarcity that does not allow for a sustainable implementation of water reuse in this case the decision maker should evaluate other alternatives to cope with water scarcity e g desalination inter basin transfers 3 3 3 discussing the integrated rsa framework the proposed integrated rsa framework focuses exclusively on water quantity issues consciously omitting water quality and access problems that may be present it can be further expanded to a cascade process in which a first rsa assessment refers to the existing quantity of water resources to then further comprise risks associated to quality and finally to accessibility this process is similar to the rationale proposed by the german association for water wastewater and waste dwa 2019 for the development of water reuse measures but integrating the risk and sustainability perspectives from the source until the discharge of water however it is suggested that indicators related to the water quality aspects of the water reuse measure are also included in the evaluation of the sustainability assessment since they are relevant for a successful sustainable implementation accordingly an enhancement of the framework would steer decision makers attention to these aspects with their particular relevance for water reuse regarding the approach followed for the development of the framework and the final result see section 2 there is compliance with the presented seven characteristics as follows i the framework is constructed in a way where each concept plays an integral role i e risk and sustainabilityare used to interpret water scarcity and water reuse respectively and decision making concepts together with risk and sustainability assessment support the structure of the assessment all three steps of building the framework follow an ii interpretative approach to the water scarcity water reuse situation iii providing an understanding instead of a theoretical explanation iv the framework interprets intentions rather than knowledge of hard facts v being indeterministic in nature vi the development and construction followed a process of qualitative analysis and vii the source of data here mostly information consists of many disciplinary concepts these concepts will shape the practical implementation of the conceptual framework after its future operationalisation as methodology while this framework has not been tested yet it offers a first approach of conceptual integration of risk and sustainability assessment for decision making in water scarcity water reuse situations in order to provide an aforethought structure that frames the empirical work ex ante or ex post the findings highlight the relevance of a consistent terminology for understanding the situation what it comprises and for the interrelation of the concepts further operationalisation of this framework is needed for a final testing in empirical cases given the importance of information for the decision making such an assessment is ideally supported by involving the decision makers and the different stakeholders to foster an organised and transparent generation and exchange of information for water scarcity risk reduction e g unisdr 2005 rubert and beetlestone 2014 as well as acceptance of the water reuse measure pereira et al 2002 neto 2016 ricart 2016 usón et al 2017 zijp et al 2017 this in turn can help in building trust and increase collaboration for water scarcity risk reduction via an implementation of sustainable water reuse measures e g pahl wostl et al 2007 dobbie et al 2016 4 conclusions and outlook this article provides four main contributions that can result relevant for water security in water scarcity water reuse situations from a risk and sustainability point of view 1 a representation of the water scarcity water reuse situation as a chans 2 a review on the concepts of water scarcity water reuse risk and sustainability with their assessments and decision making 3 an interpretation of water scarcity as a risk and water reuse as a sustainable alternative water source and 4 the integrated rsa framework for decision support as a first systematic conceptualisation of a simultaneous risk and sustainability assessment of water scarcity and water reuse this research prepares for a methodological implementation of studies on water reuse in the context of water scarcity by portraying the possibility of combining efforts to address the water scarcity water reuse situation in a more comprehensive manner analysing the situation as a system and interrelating relevant key concepts for decision support to finally perform a joint evaluation based on risk and sustainability indicators and criteria the methodological implementation of the framework can mostly bear on established but up to now independent methods for risk assessment on the one hand and sustainability assessment on the other hand this is expected to foster exchange of information and collaboration among decision makers and stakeholders highlighting how they are connected to and through the system the final outcome for decision making can be seen as a unified source of information with a comprehensive view of the situation the conceptual framework and its subsequent methodological implementation and empirical application will foster compliance with international policies on managing water scarcity it mainly supports a joint risk and sustainability perspective as requested e g by the 2030 agenda for sustainable development accordingly advances from this research are timely and call for further elaboration and testing under real world conditions their empirical application is expected to support decision making on various water management and governance levels regarding an integrated water scarcity risk reduction and sustainable development of water re use as a means of resilience building further research should primarily focus on the methodological implementation through consistent sets of indicators with target or threshold values and weights although this research focused on water quantity it does not neglect water quality and accessibility the latter two should play a prominent role in future research and their inclusion into this three

5093,decision makers face major challenges when trying to reduce risks of water scarcity sustainably through measures of water reuse one of these challenges is the lack of interconnectedness between risk assessment for water scarcity and sustainability assessment for water reuse therefore this paper aims to explore the conceptual integration of risk and sustainability assessments rsa in a framework for decision support in water scarcity water reuse situations this article follows a three steps approach i defining and interpreting the water scarcity water reuse situation as a coupled human and natural system ii identifying and defining key concepts relevant for risk and sustainability assessment and iii constructing the integrated rsa framework for decision support as a result the latter provides a conceptualisation of a simultaneous assessment of water scarcity as a risk and the sustainability of water reuse measures according to the social economic and environmental dimensions it contemplates an analysis phase and an evaluation phase to provide unified information on the level of water scarcity risk and water reuse sustainability the resulting indicates that the integration of risk and sustainability in one joint assessment for decision support is conceptually feasible it hence paves the way towards a comprehensive and consistent methodological operationalisation and empirical application keywords water scarcity water reuse risk reduction sustainability decision making integrated assessment 1 introduction achieving water security is key for sustainable development united nations 2015 water security may be achieved by managing water resources in a way that they are accessible in an appropriate quantity and quality for human uses while respecting water as integral part of ecosystems e g gwp 2000 schulte and morrison 2014 but water resources are increasingly stressed in their quantity and quality by demographic development economic growth and climate change which is likely to lead to a severe global water crisis alcamo et al 2007 kumar et al 2018 over 1 7 billion people live in river basins where withdrawal exceeds recharge undp 2016 by 2050 70 of the river basins are projected to suffer water related problems with more than four billion people living in cities with persistent or seasonal water scarcity alcamo et al 2007 mcdonald et al 2011 wwap 2018 the world is therefore far from being water secure water reuse or using treated wastewater for diverse purposes is heavily discussed as a means of increasing available water quantities at diverse quality ranges and thus lowering freshwater withdrawals to alleviate water scarcity wwap 2017 gancheva et al 2018 fit for purpose production and the use of this kind of water are certainly not the only means of overcoming water scarcity since there are other alternatives including desalination inter basin water transfer and water withdrawal restriction however water reuse is seeing a particularly increased implementation in regions facing apparent water scarcity generating water scarcity water reuse situations e g asano et al 2007 levy et al 2014 fao 2017 voulvoulis 2018 water reuse in these regions is also specifically advocated as a sustainable measure to overcome water scarcity bedbabis et al 2010 wilcox et al 2016 el moussaoui et al 2017 fito and van hulle 2020 hence the current discourse in scientific and grey literature seems to advocate for water reuse as a sustainable measure to overcome the risk of water scarcity so far much needed attention is being paid on the risks related to the quality of the used water and how to mitigate reduce and circumvent these e g wwap 2017 dwa 2019 however the contribution of water reuse measures to the reduction of water scarcity risk has not been a major topic yet one reason seems to be that water scarcity and water reuse are mostly tackled in two different realms of water management responding to different aims while water scarcity is a subject of natural disaster risk management to identify and reduce the level of risk water reuse evolved in water resources management with the aim of long term assurance of water availability in adequate quality i e to support a sustainable water resource management each realm has distinct conceptual and methodological approaches and these differences make it particularly challenging for an integration that supports decision making unisdr 2015 in this case on water scarcity risk reduction through sustainable water reuse there are approaches for risk assessment to deal with water scarcity on the one hand e g veldkamp et al 2016 and sustainability assessment of water reuse measures on the other hand e g akhoundi and nazif 2018 while a risk assessment related to water scarcity highlight issues of water shortage e g wef global risk report 2019 and in water supply e g world risk report by mucke et al 2019 a water related sustainability assessment provides information focusing on social economic and environmental aspects of water management measures such as water reuse e g opher et al 2019 rezaei et al 2019 aspects such as whether there will be enough quantity of water resource as well as knowing about the water scarcity situation have been reported as relevant success factors for the implementation of water reuse measures mainali et al 2011 tran et al 2017 such information can be provided by a risk assessment of water scarcity likewise considering a lesson learnt from the hyogo framework for action 2005 2015 unisdr 2015 taken by the sustainable development goals sdgs i e sdg 11 united nations 2015 there is the need for integrating risk and sustainability approaches in general thus before a decision maker tackles the challenging question of which kind of measure to use to reduce the risks from the quality of treated wastewater it may make sense to first assess if any of the considered water reuse measures would actually sustainably reduce the main risk namely that of water scarcity if this is not the case other measures to do so may have to be sought currently assessment approaches considering simultaneously both aspects that of a risk and a sustainability assessment are lacking therefore this research aims at developing a framework that conceptually integrates risk assessment and sustainability assessment for decision support in water scarcity water reuse situations the intention of the framework is to ensure an appropriate joint consideration of the risk of water scarcity and the sustainability of water reuse as a measure for risk reduction this provides the basis for a subsequent assessment of water quality risk the intended integrated risk and sustainability assessment rsa framework is designed to be applied in an a ex ante manner to support decisions related to whether a water reuse measure should be implemented given a measured or projected risk of water scarcity and what would be required to do this sustainably or b ex post manner providing information about the risk of water scarcity and the sustainable performance of an already implemented water reuse measure both ex ante and ex post assessments are focused on water reuse measures including comparative assessments between different system arrangements and technologies but a comparison of water scarcity risk reduction measures beyond water reuse exceeds the scope of this work the reader may expect a conceptual work focused on the water quantity aspects of water management integrating water scarcity risk assessment and water reuse sustainability assessment in a decision support framework a detailed reflection on water quality and accessibility issues would transcend the scope of this work section 2 describes the approach for the development of the framework using a three step procedure section 3 presents the results and discussion comprising i the system analysis of water scarcity water reuse situations ii systematisation and explanation of concepts relevant for this framework and finally iii the integrated rsa framework for decision support moreover this section refers to the comprehensiveness specificity and limitations of the framework section 4 provides conclusions and an outlook on future research demands particularly referring to methodological implementation 2 developing the conceptual framework the use of conceptual frameworks is common in the environmental sciences especially in the context of comprehensive analysis or management of natural resources e g berrouet et al 2018 pavan and ometto 2018 however despite their fundamental role not much detail is given about the approaches and steps followed for the construction of such frameworks jabareen 2009 offers a clear reflection on the meaning and analysis of conceptual frameworks accordingly conceptual frameworks bear on the following core characteristics ibid i a construct where each concept plays an integral role ii interpretative approach to social reality iii understanding rather than theoretical explanation iv interpretation of intentions rather than knowledge of hard facts v indeterministic in nature and therefore do not enable us to predict an outcome vi developed and constructed through a process of qualitative analysis vii the sources of data consist of many discipline oriented theories that become the empirical data of the conceptual framework analysis these characteristics are highly interwoven for example conceptual frameworks provide an interpretative approach to social reality while also being an interpretation of intentions which may not predict an outcome these characteristics and the analysis phases proposed by jabareen allow for the derivation of three steps for the development of conceptual frameworks i definition and interpretation of the subject at stake ii identification and description of key concepts and iii construction of the conceptual framework fig 1 depicts a schematic view of the approach as well as a preview of the obtained results see section 3 to understand the structure of this article the following subsections present more details about the three steps and their use for the development of the integrated rsa framework for decision support 2 1 definition and interpretation the subject at stake the subject at stake is the decision making in water scarcity water reuse situations with special focus on water quantity matters these situations refer to actors e g in a municipality which expect to face or currently face water scarcity and who are planning to or have already implemented water reuse measures see fig 2 the aim is to support ex ante assessments related to the design planning and implementation of future water reuse measures or ex post assessments related to the performance control and monitoring of implemented water reuse measures both perspectives can support design planning and implementation aspects to reduce the risk increase the sustainability or even correlate the level of risk and sustainability in all these cases decision makers exhibit an interest in reducing water scarcity by implementing sustainable water reuse measures assessments play a key role in decision support by operationalising the topic they aim to asses alcamo et al 2003 for the above mentioned water scarcity water reuse situations a risk assessment of water scarcity informs about the level of risk and how this could change i e scenarios or be reduced e g gain and giupponi 2015 veldkamp et al 2016 in contrast a sustainability assessment can be used to compare different water reuse measures or portfolios of those measures e g benavides et al 2019 opher et al 2019 rezaei et al 2019 while risk assessment does not address the sustainability of alternative measures a sustainability assessment does not comprise the water scarcity risk reduction effects of water reuse measures each of these assessments supports a particular decision and are not necessarily interrelated but this distinction can inhibit comprehensiveness of decisions see fig 2a however since both assessments have succeeded in providing the respective information for decision making the focus of an advanced assessment here is set on further interrelating them therefore the integrated rsa framework intends to offer a structured and aforethought approach for addressing risk and sustainability simultaneously in a unified manner from the beginning this is supposed to bridge data and information throughout the decision making process for the delivery of comprehensive and consistent information rather than to converge results of two different assessment processes see fig 2b to gain a deeper understanding of a water scarcity water reuse situation there is a need for interpreting it first this should lead to a simplified representation that helps to reduce the complicatedness of the real world situation and hence facilitate its understanding systems thinking allows addressing this complicatedness by interpreting situations as a set of interconnected parts which function together as a complex whole smithson et al 2008 p 9 in general natural or environmental systems e g ecosystems hydrological systems are originally conceptualised separate to societal systems e g social organisational systems smithson et al 2008 jalilov et al 2018 however for water management and related risk and sustainability studies there is a particular interest in the interrelations between both systems turner et al 2003 ostrom 2009 binder et al 2013 srinivasan et al 2013 schanze 2016 therefore the interpretation of a water scarcity water reuse situation needs to follow a systemic approach in this case as a coupled human and natural system chans liu et al 2007 this way the system should consider and describe interrelations in form of energy matter and information flows ibid the approach used for analysing the water scarcity water reuse situation distinguishes between a natural or environmental sub system referring to biophysical aspects of matter and energy flows whereas the human sub system covers biophysical aspects on the one hand and immaterial aspects related to information flows on the other hand in a water scarcity water reuse chans focused on water quantity the biophysical system comprises the natural sub system and the biophysical aspects of the human sub system in addition considering the decision making process for structuring the assessment requires involvement of the immaterial aspects of the human sub system in the respective chans examples of elements related to the biophysical human aspects can include water withdrawal facilities water supply infrastructure sanitation wastewater treatment plants irrigation equipment whereas immaterial elements may refer to e g the organisation of water resources management and the institutional arrangements such as legal regulations and governance modes see fig 3 in general systems analysis may involve qualitative or quantitative methods liu et al 2007 a qualitative approach is used for the development of the integrated rsa framework with the potential of quantitative analyses in subsequent research 2 2 identification and definition of key concepts to further conceptualise the water scarcity water reuse situation and develop the integrated rsa framework it is important to define the following key concepts water scarcity water reuse risk sustainability and the respective assessments additionally understanding decision making is required for tailoring the integrated assessment towards decision support the reflection of all these concepts is relevant for overcoming misunderstandings in this interdisciplinary space primarily because the way of understanding these concepts influences the preferred type of assessment tarne et al 2017 see section 3 2 a non systematic literature review involving academic and grey literature of these concepts is carried out to collect and contrast definitions from different disciplines and sectors to derive a coherent understanding the definitions found in documents of international organisations e g fao unisdr iso as well regulations e g in the european union were assumed to represent a common transdisciplinary understanding of each concepts as far as they are supported by the scientific literature section 3 2 presents the results of this review for the derivation of the working definitions of the mentioned concepts relevant for the framework 2 3 construction of the conceptual framework after interpreting the situation and defining the relevant concepts there is the need of interrelating them to build the integrated rsa framework in this research it involves the following steps 1 interrelating water scarcity with risk and water reuse with sustainability this means using the risk and sustainability concepts to interpret the definitions of water scarcity and water reuse respectively as well as analysing potential risks for the sustainability of the water reuse measure 2 relating risk and sustainability assessments with each other and with decision making this addresses the alignment of the integrated assessment to decision making focusing on the common scope of the assessment and what it comprises e g structure procedure indicators 3 results and discussion the approach followed in this research facilitated a situational focus of the framework for the water related situation an open search of definitions of the relevant concepts and a structured interrelation of these concepts to create the framework the results are conceptual and intend to provide the basis for methodological operationalisation and empirical studies involving existing methods and real world data 3 1 defining and interpreting the water scarcity water reuse situation according to section 2 1 the water scarcity water reuse situation may be interpreted as a coupled human and natural system chans this system comprises on the one hand natural and human biophysical aspects involving water flows and on the other hand immaterial aspects of water management decision making with its institutional context individual elements need to be defined and interrelated to support decision making on water scarcity risk reduction and sustainable water reuse the interconnection between the biophysical system and the immaterial aspects of the human sub system is given by the management alternatives that have an effect on the water flows biophysical aspects while resulting from the decision making process based on immaterial aspects e g regulatory frame fig 4 shows the simplified representation of the system understanding the biophysical system that portrays the water flows consists of elements of the natural sub system e g the catchment area ecosystems and biophysical aspects of the human sub system e g withdrawal supply sanitation and treatment facilities reuse different shapes classify these elements as natural or human processes sequence of change steps or activities resulting in natural or human outputs products goods and users that make deliberate application or utilisation of water for a specific purpose fao n d the classes refer to elements that have associated influences on the quantity of water e g iwa 2016 they are related to the water flows which in turn depend on climatological and hydrological conditions as well as the water management moreover it is possible to distinguish the water flow system in four main categories source freshwater resource use human use of water treatment sanitation and the treatment process and reuse human use and discharge of the treated wastewater and generated by products this categorisation helps relating the elements of the source and use categories to the water scarcity aspects of the situation and the components of the treatment and reuse categories to water reuse the reuse directly refers to elements of water use but it is presented in a separate category to schematically highlight that it is the use of treated wastewater and not of freshwater therefore there is a circular idea of water flows presented linearly such compartmentalised interpretation supports the understanding of the situation by providing the decision maker with a general overview while considering relevant elements and their interrelations the immaterial aspects of the human sub system focus on the information flows that result in the selection of management alternatives they comprise the decision makers actors involved in the decision making process e g a mayor further stakeholders involved e g civil society ngos as well as the institutional and organisational context the institutional and organisational context can define how decisions are made based on societal rules that structure social interactions redlawsk and lau 2013 e g regulations referring to water reuse practices however there are information flows between the various institutional and organisational arrangements and to the different decision makers and stakeholders likewise there is a constant exchange of information between the decision makers and with stakeholders this exchange is not necessarily uniform between the persons and groups involved and hence can generate information and power asymmetries e g loch et al 2014 avellán et al 2019 pan et al 2019 a proper representation of all actors and stakeholders requires specific stakeholder mapping and analysis according to social science methods e g mitchell et al 1997 reed et al 2009 although all immaterial aspects are situational they are presented in a generic manner in fig 4 for schematic reasons finally decision making is summarised in one general box referring to water scarcity risk reduction and sustainable water reuse the defined aim for this framework and directly linked to the design of potential ex ante assessment or the performance control of existing ex post assessment management alternatives overall the water scarcity water reuse situation exceeds natural and engineering science boundaries and links to the social sciences here particularly referring to decision theory but beyond also several actor stakeholder and network theories a chans representation allows to portray not only matter flows water but also basic societal information flows simultaneously and hence precisely meets the requirements of the subject of the framework although any water scarcity water reuse situation has its site specific character this first general conceptualisation serves as basis for adaptation and refinement with a consistent level of detail 3 2 identifying and defining key concepts the literature review provides an overview of the various in many cases converging understandings of the concepts relevant for the framework with the intention of creating a consistent basis this is relevant because the water scarcity water reuse situation transcends to an interdisciplinary or even transdisciplinary realm as already visible from the different sources of concept definitions 3 2 1 water scarcity water management can be split into three main aspects quantity quality and accessibility of water resources schulte and morrison 2014 issues associated with the quantity of water resources often refer to the terms scarcity as in lack of and stress see table 1 the latter is usually indicated as a less severe condition than scarcity e g falkenmark et al 1989 in contrast schulte and morrison 2014 differentiate between both terms where water scarcity relates only to the availability of water in quantitative terms and water stress involves any issue pertaining either quantity availability quality or accessibility of to water resources nevertheless all of the definitions of scarcity and stress allude to the inability of meeting the needs or demand of the human population thus the discussion must not only contemplate natural hydrological aspects but recognise the intrinsic human component that shapes this term i e there is no scarcity if no human requirement has to be met there seems to be a prevailing subjectivity in the use of terms that can lead to a general ambiguity for instance the relation between the terms availability and scarcity although availability is often referred to as the quantity of water resources e g hoekstra 2000 schulte and morrison 2014 it can also refer to a situation that does not only comprise the quantity of water but also its quality and accessibility especially when the quality of the water resources is not appropriate or they are not accessible then they are ultimately not available for human use thus when addressing scarcity as focused on quantitative availability it is more appropriate to maintain the concrete use of quantity instead of availability combining this to the view presented by schulte and morrison 2014 the term water stress can be applied as a degree of the net availability of water for human use considering quantity quality and accessibility rather than as less severe or general term for water scarcity the use of the term water scarcity is already discussed by hoekstra 2000 highlighting that it can respond to a supply problem a demand problem or an economic perspective of water later gain and giupponi 2015 emphasised two primary measurements of water scarcity supply driven which is the available quantity of water for human use with respect to renewable freshwater resources and demand driven referring to how much water is demanded with respect to the available quantity in the first case the focus is set on the water available for withdrawal whereas in the second case the focus point is the human demand for water either way and according to a general definition water scarcity refers to an amount of water for human use it is worth mentioning that there is discussion about considering environmental or ecosystem water requirements to determine the water resources available for human use oki and kanae 2006 schulte and morrison 2014 schneider and avellan 2019 directly relating to their relevance in defining water scarcity since this work follows the line of a chans with natural and human biophysical and immaterial aspects the terms water withdrawal and water demand are differentiated water scarcity involves the quantity of natural water resources available for withdrawal a biophysical human aspect to fulfil a specific water demand a human immaterial aspect hence water withdrawal is the actual amount physically extracted human biophysical aspect supply driven whereas water demand here refers to the amount of water required by society which may or not be met involving immaterial aspects as well demand driven in general there is a direct relationship between both of these terms which is why water withdrawal is used to estimate water demand vörösmarty et al 2000 rosegrant and cai 2002 oki and kanae 2006 table 2 presents the definitions used for the integrated rsa framework 3 2 2 water reuse the interchangeable use of several terms such as water recycling treated wastewater reuse water reuse and water reclamation generates confusion ricart and rico 2019 because of its widespread application this work refers mainly to the terms water reuse and water reclamation the international organisation for standardisation iso defines water reuse as the use of treated wastewater for beneficial use allowing to employ it as a synonym of water reclamation iso 16075 1 2015 some organisations like the german association for water wastewater and waste dwa make use of this definition however other authors and regulations highlight differences between both terms in those cases water reclamation refers to a particular instance of water reuse that involves additional rigorous treatment for more restricted uses asano et al 2007 ansari et al 2018 european commission 2018 ricart and rico 2019 the proposal for a regulation on minimum requirements for water reuse of the european commission 2018 indicates that water reclamation involves the treatment of urban wastewater in a reclamation treatment plant following specific requirements therefore water reclamation refers to a type of water reuse that allows providing water that meets particular quality characteristics this work recognises the difference in water reuse and reclamation as well as the fact that water reclamation is a type of water reuse see table 3 however for practical reasons and because this framework does not strictly define the use of the treated wastewater the choice is to refer to the general term water reuse 3 2 3 risk and risk assessments according to the united nations office for disaster risk reduction undrr formerly unisdr disaster risk is the potential loss of life injury or destroyed or damaged assets which could occur to a system society or a community in a specific period of time determined probabilistically as a function of hazard exposure vulnerability and capacity undrr n d the operationalisation of risk considers it to be a function of hazard exposure and vulnerability of the studied system e g blanco vogt and schanze 2014 garrick and hall 2014 rubert and beetlestone 2014 sayers et al 2016 table 4 shows the respective working definitions used in this research risk assessments ra provide decision makers with information related to the probable responses when exposed to a hazard zio 2018 to explore means of risk reduction there are well developed and structured assessment frameworks to assess risk guiding the identification analysis and evaluation of hazards and their impacts and resulting risk zio 2018 these assessments involve two main tasks i risk analysis sources pathways receptors and consequences and ii risk evaluation schanze 2009 3 2 4 sustainability and sustainability assessments the meaning of sustainability and sustainable development originated from the intention of reconciling human development and environment to improve human life quality marchese et al 2018 the social economic and environmental dimensions otherwise known as the triple bottom line help to understand and operationalise sustainable development acting as the three pillars of sustainability waas et al 2011 other dimensions such as the institutional dimension related to democracy and governance e g waas et al 2011 toumi et al 2017 and the cultural dimension e g balkema et al 2002 appear as the fourth pillar in some cases however the three main pillars maintain their fundamental status in sustainability indistinctly of the approach there are different definitions associated with these pillars but they tend to point in the same direction e g balkema et al 2002 waas et al 2011 table 5 shows the definitions used for the integrated rsa framework see table 6 unlike risk even with a set of defined dimensions the challenge in operationalising sustainable development is handling it since the definitions outline a concept rather than giving a rigid rule balkema et al 2002 p 154 this can be an opportunity that allows flexibility to adapt to the different needs and circumstances but it implies a more significant challenge for its practical implementation waas et al 2011 despite the associated challenges of the analysis and evaluation of sustainable development a broad term defining this endeavour is sustainability assessment sa sa is the most commonly used term amongst many others e g sustainability appraisal integrated assessment integrated sa sustainability impact assessment triple bottom line assessment 3 e integrated assessment environment economy equity and extended integrated assessment pope et al 2004 2017 hacking and guthrie 2008 there are different definitions and understandings of sa e g hacking and guthrie 2008 sala et al 2015 pope et al 2017 the one presented by hacking and guthrie 2008 p 73 and used in this framework is broad enough for various decision making situations e g policies programmes plans projects etc involving individual or collective issues a means of directing planning and decision making towards sustainable development 3 2 5 decision making although decision theory provides different views it is well established that decision making commonly aims at maximising the gains benefits or achievement of defined interests edwards 1954 tversky and kahneman 1986 this also means minimising the maximum losses or maximising the minimal gain edwards 1954 whether it is including phases of framing editing and evaluation tversky and kahneman 1986 or considering simplification tasks that involve decomposition editing or heuristics redlawsk and lau 2013 there are common aspects in behavioural decision theory that lead to a final decision or choice output i identification of the interest goal or aim ii framing and decomposing and iii an evaluation see fig 5 the framing and decomposing stage delineates the boundary of the problem and breaks it into elements that are easier to evaluate in doing so the interest or aim might change and the process restarts feedback if that is not the case the evaluation phase judges the components according to defined criteria targets or thresholds depending on the aim finally a rational choice corresponds to the best evaluated alternative that mostly allows fulfilling the interest or aim tversky and kahneman 1986 redlawsk and lau 2013 all three steps or phases are embedded in a specific context and rely on constant input and output of data and information thus decision making can be categorised as a sequence of steps with cyclic feedbacks that leads to a decision 3 3 construction of the integrated rsa framework this third step is dedicated to the construction of the framework first it comprises the incremental interrelation of the key concepts defined in the previous section second the integrated rsa framework itself is compiled 3 3 1 interrelating the key concepts 3 3 1 1 water scarcity from a risk perspective water scarcity is fundamentally associated with threatening natural conditions and adverse social economic and environmental consequences such as the lack of water for basic household needs e g washing and cooking wwap 2018 thus it involves an intrinsic risk as a risk it can be expressed as a probability function of negative consequences due to the change of natural or human aspects this function describes the human water demand human immaterial aspect being exposed to the hazard of a decrease in water quantities available for human use natural and human biophysical aspects these components shape the interpretation of the risk dimensions as shown in fig 6 at a glance the hazard seems to be related to reduced quantities of water resources available for human use a reduction of water resources does not directly imply adverse effects but it can potentially result in harm which fits the definition of hazard there are different reasons for a decrease negative delta in the quantity of water resources which relate to the natural and human biophysical aspects and can be distinguished as source and pathways according to the source pathway receptor concept e g sayers et al 2016 the decrease can be triggered by drivers of change such as climate change upstream land use change or water withdrawal e g vörösmarty et al 2000 this understanding places the hazard at the source and use categories of the proposed system s representation of the water scarcity water reuse situation and directly points to the catchment water bodies considering climatological and hydrological processes as well as human water uses exposure relates to the hazard prone areas and all the elements receptors that are within that area a decrease in the quantity of water resources hazard fundamentally relates to elements e g municipal or domestic industrial agricultural with a human demand for water resources what constitutes the exact boundaries of an exposed area is circumstantial and usually involves contextual e g water infrastructure spatial e g river valley and temporal features e g under future boundary conditions due to climatic change defining the exposed area allows to specify the system s representation of the water scarcity water reuse situation by identifying the involved elements e g the exposed area entails intense agricultural activities which determine the demand for water resources and diminish the role of drinking water treatment processes this allows characterising the system according to the local context vulnerability refers to the human demand for water resources that is susceptible to a decrease in water resources in addition to human biophysical aspects such as water use and respective technologies it comprises social economic and environmental values and functions blanco vogt and schanze 2014 the demand may underlie a spatial pattern and temporal variability moreover it can change in the long run due to e g demographic development urbanisation and intensification of agricultural use for example communities located in areas arid or semi arid regions can be highly vulnerable to an increase in water demand e g in a hot and dry season fao 2017 voulvoulis 2018 the coping capacity can be manifold with measures ranging from water harvesting in rainy seasons to emergency water supply through road tankers water scarcity as a risk is the likelihood of not fulfilling the human water demand due to a decrease in the quantity of water resources for human use it may result from either a decrease of the freshwater resources due to climatological hydrological processes or the increase of human demand on the one hand or simultaneous occurrence of both on the other hand in this case a risk assessment consists of a combined analysis and evaluation of the hazard as the decrease of the quantity of water resources the vulnerability of human water demand maybe undergoing seasonal or long term increase and depending on exposure the likelihood of its occurrence needs to be calculated as probability and if possible additionally with its uncertainty the representation of the water scarcity water reuse situation as a system can facilitate the analysis of the risk by underlining exposed and highly vulnerable elements of the system for instance there is a fast growing city with increasing water demand which sets the focus on the municipal element of the system as well as on all the related aspects for water supply water withdrawals drinking water treatment a system s visualisation can serve as a mental map supporting the analysis of the conceptual components of risk facilitating the comprehension and implications of a water scarcity situation 3 3 1 2 water reuse from a sustainability perspective this subsection focuses on the characteristics of water reuse measures to be sustainable emphasising on quantity of water supply see table 7 potential water quality issues are acknowledged and thus quality risks for the sustainability of water reuse are presented in the next subsection from a societal perspective a sustainable water reuse measure can secure social needs by providing ready to use contaminant free water resources and hence support social well being challenging social aspects such as perception and acceptance can be addressed through capacity development empowerment and active participation of the community to allocate the reuse measures where they are most needed and socially accepted baggett et al 2006 rice et al 2016 khanpae et al 2020 another challenge relies on the coordination of the water supply and sanitation sectors and the participation of the involved stakeholders fao 2017 ricart and rico 2019 from an economically sustainable perspective a re valorisation of water resources and the possible by products e g energy nutrients resulting from their treatment can foster long term resource efficiency under careful considerations of financial and scale treatment plant size aspects asano et al 2007 yang and abbaspour 2007 the challenge is to provide an interesting and feasible business model that compensates the expenses of the needed treatment processes e g circular economy perspective iwa 2016 voulvoulis 2018 the contribution of water reuse to environmental sustainability relies on reducing the demand for freshwater resources by providing further uses for already used water this can reduce the depletion of water resources wwap 2017 libutti et al 2018 and hence support the protection conservation and enhancement of the ability of the environment to sustain human needs furthermore treatment and reuse may advance overall purification and release water with proper quality for discharge in water bodies avoiding further contamination still there are some challenges in this dimension such as greenhouse gas emissions from energy demand hafeez et al 2014 as well as environmental risks see subsection 3 3 1 3 3 3 1 3 water scarcity and other risks for sustainable water reuse measures there are different aspects that pose other risks to the sustainability of a water reuse measure i e for the fulfilment of the definitions presented in table 7 on the one hand the risk of water scarcity affects the feasibility of the implementation of a water reuse measure because if the water scarcity is severe there is the possibility of expecting not enough wastewater quantity for a reuse measure e g beveridge et al 2017 tran et al 2017 in the case of a less severe water scarcity there is still the risk of concentrating pollutants in the wastewater which challenges the performance of the wastewater treatment systems as well as increasing the associated costs tran et al 2017 these issues are of relevance for the integrated rsa framework and may challenge water reuse measures as a sustainable means of reducing the risk of water scarcity on the other hand there are social and environmental risks associated to water reuse itself mainly related to the quality of the treated wastewater in the first case water reuse can pose a risk to human health due to contact and or ingestion of hazardous components e g heavy metals pathogens present in the treated wastewater e g toze 2006 fao 2017 ricart and rico 2019 likewise the existence of pollutants in the treated wastewater can also affect the environment for instance soil properties e g increased salinity and heavy metal concentration e g urbano et al 2015 fao 2017 khanpae et al 2020 therefore it is common to find regulations and guidelines for safe water reuse such as the health protection measures proposed by the who ranging from the classification of crops to irrigation strategies who 2006 other risks related to water supply sanitation and treatment processes that should be considered are accidental leakage and cross connection events e g oesterholt et al 2007 sercu et al 2011 likewise the compliance of relevant financial and regulatory instruments is an important factor challenging water reuse measures avellán et al 2019 all of these aspects along with the mentioned health and environmental issues should be considered when designing and implementing a water reuse measure avellán et al 2019 this can be addressed by including the respective indicators for evaluation in the sa e g spiller 2016 benavides et al 2019 3 3 2 integrated risk and sustainability assessment rsa framework specifying the key concepts and interrelating them for a water scarcity water reuse situation sets the basis of the integrated rsa framework for decision support this framework includes a risk assessment for water scarcity and a sustainability assessment for water reuse to support decisions regarding the implementation of water reuse as means of water scarcity risk reduction focusing on water quantity according to the definition of sustainability assessments given by hacking and guthrie 2008 the rsa framework is defined as a procedure that aims to guide decision making towards risk reduction and increased sustainability in line with the tasks involved in assessments the framework comprises an analysis phase and an evaluation phase to support decision making in a water scarcity water reuse situation through an integrated assessment risk and sustainability assessments need to be combined appropriately the steps involved in decision making serve as a basis to do so i identification of the interest goal or aim ii framing and decomposing and iii an evaluation see fig 5 the interest or aim define the focus and type of assessment e g quantitative qualitative level of stakeholder involvement the framing and decomposing stage in decision making relates to the analysis phase of the assessment i e the identification of the different components or elements and interlinkages finally the evaluation is explicitly present in the decision making and assessment tasks i e the judgement of the situation based on risk and sustainability criteria or thresholds this work proposes that in the dynamic flow of information between the stages of decision making assessments provide a means of organising and processing information to understand and evaluate a water scarcity water reuse situation see fig 7 this way the output of the integrated rsa framework is the level of risk of water scarcity or risk reduction and the level of sustainability of water reuse measures this information output can guide the decision maker towards choosing the option or a set of management options that allow minimising the risk and maximising the sustainability in the assessed context the decision support framework is finalised by including the general structure of the integrated rsa in the representation of the initial decision making situation see fig 2 fig 7 presents an advanced conceptualisation of this situation following the steps of the decision making and including the risk and sustainability assessment a detailed description of each step is given below the proposed framework uses the sustainability dimensions to organise and process the information thus the social economic and environmental aspects also hold true for the risk analysis and evaluation by doing so there is the possibility of decomposing the water scarcity water reuse situation into more focused fragments allowing to address it from the perspectives of these three dimensions and through the lenses of risk and sustainability this grants a comprehensive view of the situation considering e g the social vulnerabilities to water scarcity the social impacts of a water reuse measure and the relevant aspects to achieve social sustainability that include simultaneously a risk reduction likewise for the other dimensions 3 3 2 1 information pool all the information used to define the aim and to perform the rsa framework as well as the information generated in each of the decision making steps flows from and into the general information pool the input of different actors and stakeholders e g public administration private sector civil society ngos academia enriches this information pool the pool is heterogeneous and not entirely open as presented in the scheme but rather exhibiting divisions that reflect the common information asymmetries this is an issue that decision makers need to be aware of and address because it directly influences the performance of this information based assessment 3 3 2 2 interest or aim even though the specific interest or aim depends on the decision makers the principal intention underlying this framework is to reduce the risk of water scarcity through the implementation of sustainable water reuse measures in other words this means minimising risk and maximising sustainability the assessment can be applied i ex ante for decisions on different water scarcity scenarios and alternative water reuse measures to select the water reuse measures that should be implemented similar to opher et al 2019 under a particular water scarcity situation or ii ex post for decisions on the performance of the current water reuse measure similar to benavides et al 2019 under a given water scarcity situation for the identification of intervention points that can increase the sustainability and minimise the risk more specific interests or aims would include aspects that depend on the site specific context such as particular limitations and trade offs e g financial resources and time or available capacity among many others e g kurian et al 2019 they could also point towards achieving synergistic results e g coordination between the water supply and sanitation sectors fao 2017 these specific interests or aims do not undermine the main interest but can shape the assessment highlighting aspects that need detailed analysis and determining evaluation criteria 3 3 2 3 analysis the analysis phase provides an understanding of the water scarcity water reuse situation by identifying elements processes and fluxes and interpreting their interrelations it considers 1 identification of elements within the natural and human sub systems e g relevant water uses e g in industry agriculture essential activities and processes e g drinking water sanitation and wastewater treatment processes and actors e g a list of stakeholders main decision makers information holders this could be supported by existing indicators related to the risk of water scarcity and the sustainability of water reuse 2 interpretation of the situation and identification of interrelations natural and human aspects of the situation and the use of risk and sustainability dimensions for interpretation and interrelation of concepts the interpretation and representation of the situation as a chans as shown in fig 4 helps to visually place and connect the identified elements of the situation further categorisation can describe the nature of the interlinkages e g as consumption negative or production positive values of water flows drivers of water scarcity and water reuse e g increase in water withdrawal pressures biophysical and societal responses and impacts social economic and environmental 3 3 2 4 evaluation the evaluation of the situation requires indicators and related criteria as targets or threshold values here the indicators and target or threshold values could result from the analysis and refer to the level of risk for water scarcity and the level of sustainability for water reuse measures e g spiller 2016 choi et al 2017 benavides et al 2019 the analysis provides a systematic understanding of the water scarcity water reuse situation to select the indicators whereof evaluation criteria may be derived from societal goals as e g set in legal regulations the results of the analysis are evaluated based on the target or threshold values set in the respective step and lead to the combined level of risk and sustainability of the water scarcity water reuse situation the choice requires a methodological structuring of the decision making problem this is typically done by the use of multi criteria decision making approaches such as multiple attribute decision making e g ahp topsis or multiple objective decision making approaches covering impact and equity analyses relevant for water security kalbar et al 2012 mardani et al 2015 2017 nie et al 2018 these approaches involve weighing and thresholds for the indicators the current framework is not prescriptive of one evaluation method but rather allows using the method that is considered more suitable for each specific case it is important to highlight that at any stage of the assessment given the newly generated information there is the possibility of rethinking and changing the initial aim and restarting the procedure however the result of the analysis provides the data to evaluate different alternatives this means that the evaluation is not a process that considers feedback like the analysis instead it is a snapshot of the analysed situation 3 3 2 5 choice the final decision making refers to alternatives for water scarcity risk reduction through sustainable water reuse these alternatives can be portfolios of water reuse measures they are analysed ex ante or ex post under water scarcity scenarios taking environmental and societal change into account the chosen alternative is supposed to be the optimal choice for the initial interest or aim i e minimising risk and maximising sustainability given context specific restrictions another possible circumstance is an inconclusive one where the final choice does not lead to a measure but rather to a change in the aim or focus and a restart of the process feedback loop this could be the case for a severe water scarcity that does not allow for a sustainable implementation of water reuse in this case the decision maker should evaluate other alternatives to cope with water scarcity e g desalination inter basin transfers 3 3 3 discussing the integrated rsa framework the proposed integrated rsa framework focuses exclusively on water quantity issues consciously omitting water quality and access problems that may be present it can be further expanded to a cascade process in which a first rsa assessment refers to the existing quantity of water resources to then further comprise risks associated to quality and finally to accessibility this process is similar to the rationale proposed by the german association for water wastewater and waste dwa 2019 for the development of water reuse measures but integrating the risk and sustainability perspectives from the source until the discharge of water however it is suggested that indicators related to the water quality aspects of the water reuse measure are also included in the evaluation of the sustainability assessment since they are relevant for a successful sustainable implementation accordingly an enhancement of the framework would steer decision makers attention to these aspects with their particular relevance for water reuse regarding the approach followed for the development of the framework and the final result see section 2 there is compliance with the presented seven characteristics as follows i the framework is constructed in a way where each concept plays an integral role i e risk and sustainabilityare used to interpret water scarcity and water reuse respectively and decision making concepts together with risk and sustainability assessment support the structure of the assessment all three steps of building the framework follow an ii interpretative approach to the water scarcity water reuse situation iii providing an understanding instead of a theoretical explanation iv the framework interprets intentions rather than knowledge of hard facts v being indeterministic in nature vi the development and construction followed a process of qualitative analysis and vii the source of data here mostly information consists of many disciplinary concepts these concepts will shape the practical implementation of the conceptual framework after its future operationalisation as methodology while this framework has not been tested yet it offers a first approach of conceptual integration of risk and sustainability assessment for decision making in water scarcity water reuse situations in order to provide an aforethought structure that frames the empirical work ex ante or ex post the findings highlight the relevance of a consistent terminology for understanding the situation what it comprises and for the interrelation of the concepts further operationalisation of this framework is needed for a final testing in empirical cases given the importance of information for the decision making such an assessment is ideally supported by involving the decision makers and the different stakeholders to foster an organised and transparent generation and exchange of information for water scarcity risk reduction e g unisdr 2005 rubert and beetlestone 2014 as well as acceptance of the water reuse measure pereira et al 2002 neto 2016 ricart 2016 usón et al 2017 zijp et al 2017 this in turn can help in building trust and increase collaboration for water scarcity risk reduction via an implementation of sustainable water reuse measures e g pahl wostl et al 2007 dobbie et al 2016 4 conclusions and outlook this article provides four main contributions that can result relevant for water security in water scarcity water reuse situations from a risk and sustainability point of view 1 a representation of the water scarcity water reuse situation as a chans 2 a review on the concepts of water scarcity water reuse risk and sustainability with their assessments and decision making 3 an interpretation of water scarcity as a risk and water reuse as a sustainable alternative water source and 4 the integrated rsa framework for decision support as a first systematic conceptualisation of a simultaneous risk and sustainability assessment of water scarcity and water reuse this research prepares for a methodological implementation of studies on water reuse in the context of water scarcity by portraying the possibility of combining efforts to address the water scarcity water reuse situation in a more comprehensive manner analysing the situation as a system and interrelating relevant key concepts for decision support to finally perform a joint evaluation based on risk and sustainability indicators and criteria the methodological implementation of the framework can mostly bear on established but up to now independent methods for risk assessment on the one hand and sustainability assessment on the other hand this is expected to foster exchange of information and collaboration among decision makers and stakeholders highlighting how they are connected to and through the system the final outcome for decision making can be seen as a unified source of information with a comprehensive view of the situation the conceptual framework and its subsequent methodological implementation and empirical application will foster compliance with international policies on managing water scarcity it mainly supports a joint risk and sustainability perspective as requested e g by the 2030 agenda for sustainable development accordingly advances from this research are timely and call for further elaboration and testing under real world conditions their empirical application is expected to support decision making on various water management and governance levels regarding an integrated water scarcity risk reduction and sustainable development of water re use as a means of resilience building further research should primarily focus on the methodological implementation through consistent sets of indicators with target or threshold values and weights although this research focused on water quantity it does not neglect water quality and accessibility the latter two should play a prominent role in future research and their inclusion into this three

5094,river sediment transport is an important global environmental issue for it leads to waterway sedimentation ecological degradation and river geomorphologic evolution its quantification is of the highest importance for river and watershed management however it remains unclear what the applicability of different sediment transport formulas in sediment transport process and what the characteristics of non cohesive sediment transport processes with different hydrological durations this study developed a two dimensional 2d surface water flow model fm coupled with a sediment transport st model in the mike 21 modelling system the characteristic difference on simulated non cohesive sediment transport under different sediment concentrations hydrological durations and sediment transport formulas were quantified by calculating the bed load suspended load and bed level change results indicated that the bed load and suspended load using the engelund and fredsøe formula were significantly lower than the van rijn formula for individual rainfall simulation scenarios with the increase in peak flow both suspended load and bed load first increased and then decreased in the long term duration simulations high sediment concentrations were accompanied by higher bed load and lower suspension load for the engelund and fredsøe formula but by lower bed load and suspension load for the van rijn formula the high sediment concentrations resulted in a higher erosion rate and low sediment concentrations resulted in a higher deposition rate the two formulas had a high degree of consistency in seasonality and the bed level changes in spring and summer were mainly sedimentary while in autumn and winter they were mainly erosive the engelund and fredsøe formula produced high riverbed erosion capacity at low discharge but the van rijn formula had high erosion capacity at high discharge keywords mathematical modelling hydrological durations sediment transport formulas bed level change suspended sediment concentration erosion and sedimentary processes 1 introduction river is the link between land and sea and plays a major role in the material circulation of the biosphere hydrosphere lithosphere and atmosphere suspended sediment transport is important in fluvial hydraulics and applied hydrodynamics because it significantly impacts river ecosystems such as aquatic plant and animal health and river channel and estuary delta evolution which play a vital role in governing fluvial morphodynamics ecological management and nutrient transport benda and dunne 1997 it is also of vital importance for water infrastructure design channel control and evolution floodplain wetland protection disaster reduction land use planning and water resources decision making management best 1988 the sediment particles adhere to a variety of nutrient salts and parasites which are the food sources of many aquatic organisms panagopoulos et al 2019 the sediment concentration of the river directly affects the transparency and light conditions of the water body thus affecting the growth of the floating animals and plants sediment concentration also affects the river scour and carrying capacity which have great influence on the riverbed physiognomy evolution pähtz et al 2020 long term sediment transport change affects the energy conversion and nutrient transport between the hydrosphere biosphere and lithosphere which affects the biomass and biological species however sediment transport in rivers is complex due to the temporal and spatial variability of water and sediment loads which are controlled by a suite of factors whose individual effects are often difficult to disentangle prosser et al 2001 in addition the impacts of different hydrological durations on suspended sediment supply are still unclear because suspended sediment concentration ssc and suspension duration can be influenced by many factors such as fluvial geomorphology flood duration grain size and flow frequency zeiger and hubbart 2016 suspended sediment concentration depends mainly on flow hydraulics but is also controlled by the upstream sediment supply particle settling velocity and sediment carrying capacity ashmore and day 1988 horowitz 2003 rates of erosion and deposition can also differ during the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph richey et al 1986 effective discharge for suspended sediment transport is also not well understood although rapidly rising large flows are more effective for particle deposition than are slowly rising moderate flows roy and sinha 2014 additionally field measurements on some hydrological variables such as shear stress suspended load bed load flood depth and bed level change are difficult to obtain because of the limitations timeliness and uncertainty of floods and dangerous conditions therefore mathematical modelling can be an effective approach for this task numerous hydrodynamic hd models have been developed to simulate river flow and sediment transport salvadore et al 2015 these models can be divided as one dimensional 1d two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d the 1d models are mostly based on finite difference and finite element methods while they are simple to use they do not provide detailed information on the flow field gharari and razavi 2018 1d hydraulic models provide cross sectional averaged velocity distribution and water surface elevation at selected longitudinal locations along a river carling et al 2010 crispino et al 2015 the progression of the peak flood level down the system is not considered in these models but the flood is assumed to peak instantaneously and simultaneously at all sections leandro et al 2009 tunnicliffe et al 2012 the steady state 1d models do not provide the transversal structure of downstream directed flow properties let alone cross stream or vertically directed components of flow properties castellarin et al 2009 leandro et al 2011 mark et al 2004 masood and takeuchi 2012 2d models may represent flow properties in two dimensions along the longitudinal and the transversal or the longitudinal and the vertical directions in complex rivers a 2d model allows transverse variations in water level so that features such as diagonal riffles can be modelled hung et al 2009 abderrezzak et al 2016 ouillon and le guennec 1996 the advantage of 2d models over 1d models is that they predict current directions and changes in the pattern of velocity distribution vargas luna et al 2015 3d models will also predict the vertical velocity distributions however 3d models are rarely employed to river scale problems due to their huge computational and input data requirements 2d hydraulic modelling is currently a more affordable approach compared to 3d modelling because of its computational running time requirements salvadore et al 2015 the 2d hd models have been used extensively to simulate hydrodynamics water quality flood forecasting and solute transport in rivers lakes estuaries harbours and constructed wetlands crowder and diplas 2000 ekama and marais 2004 horritt and bates 2002 zhang et al 2017 additionally simulated sediment transport may differ depending on the sediment transport equations used because the suitability of a given formula can vary lópez and garcía 1998 walling 1983 a number of sediment transport formulas for bed load suspended load and total load have been developed over the years and have been used to estimate sediment transport ackers and white 1973 engelund and fredsøe 1976 meyer peter and müller 1948 van rijn 1984 these formulas were developed for specific systems and correspond to a limited set of field or experimental data different formulas may be adapted for different rivers and different hydrological periods the uncertainty and differences between them are still worthy of attention gomez and church 1989 there is no universal formula that is valid for all cases because many parameters influence sediment transport at the same time the sediment transport processes at these high or low concentrations may be significantly different wu et al 2008 a large number of comparison studies have been done to test the predictability of various sediment transport methods covering a wide range of flow conditions and sediment types berg and gelder 1993 liu et al 2002 tayfur and singh 2012 ulses et al 2008 vachtman et al 2013 however none of few studies have been devoted to the difference of the application and selection of sediment formula under different hydrological periods and sediment concentrations ulses et al 2008 scholars pay more attention to the sediment transport processes under extreme weather events such as extreme storms and floods therefore the applicability of the sediment formula under different hydrological duration and concentrations in different regions is still worth studying in this study we used a software package that incorporated sediment transport st model coupled with a mike 21 flow model fm modelling system for spatially distributed 2d surface water flow simulation which was developed by the danish hydraulic institute dhi the mike 21 fm is a new modelling system based on a flexible mesh approach which has a user friendly interface good visualization and flexibility to deal with complex terrain dhi 2012a the st model predicts sediment movement along a river the sand transport module describes sand erosion transport and deposition due to currents and waves or pure currents it calculates the transport of non cohesive materials based on flow conditions from hydrodynamic calculations dhi 2012b for the pure current model type the bed load and suspended load are calculated separately the combined currents and waves model use the total load the specific objectives and research questions for this study therefore were to 1 develop a suitable 2d surface water flow model including sediment transport using the mike 21 fm modelling system 2 evaluate the performance of the model and set up hydrological scenarios with different sediment transport formulas 3 calculate the bed load suspended load and bed level change for different hydrological durations ssc rating curves and sediment transport formulas 4 study the uncertainty and differences in the performances of transport formulas under different hydrological scenarios and 5 identify the characteristics of non cohesive sediment transport with different hydrological durations and sediment transport formulas 2 methodology 2 1 geographical setting the hanjiang river located between 106 and 114 e and 30 34 n fig 1 is about 1570 km long and is the longest tributary of the yangtze river with a basin area of about 170 400 km2 wei et al 2016 the basin is affected by the sub tropical monsoon and has average annual temperatures of 15 17 c annual precipitation ranges from 1200 mm in the southern plains to about 700 800 mm in the north hilly regions lu et al 2018a about 60 of annual precipitation occurs from april to july wang et al 2016 more than 70 of the elevation is below 1000 m in the basin and only 4 is above 2000 m the elevation gradually decreases from the upper to lower reaches danjiangkou reservoir was completed in 1974 separating the hanjiang river into higher and mid lower reaches danjiangkou to zhongxiang make up the middle reaches of the river and are located in hubei province of central china fig 1 danjiangkou reservoir is the principal water resources provider for china s central line of south to north water diversion project snwdp since 2010 9 5 109m3 of water has been extracted every year from the danjiangkou reservoir and 13 109m3 water will be extracted every year from 2030 onwards when the second phase is complete accounting for 27 and 37 of the respective current annual release from the reservoir downstream yang et al 2012 several projects have been built to mitigate the negative effects of the snwdp on the hanjiang river including the yangtze hanjiang water diversion project the xinglong water conservancy project and the wangfuzhou and cuijiaying dam 2 2 study site and data to better investigate sediment transport and model applicability in a small and medium watershed we chose the middle reach of the hanjiang river as the study site due to its complex geographical conditions and high level of human disturbance the river bed of the middle reach is wide and shallow and the water flow is scattered which belongs to wandering river channel the width of the narrow reach is about 300 400 m it can reach 2 3 km in the wet period and the maximum width can reach 5 6 km the operation of cuijiaying dam altered the peak flow sediment transport riparian vegetation and aquatic habitat in the middle hanjiang river the post dam peak discharge inundation extent and sediment load decreased significantly from pre dam conditions lu et al 2018b there are two hydrological stations xiangyang and huangzhuang in the middle part of the hanjiang river fig 1 daily discharge and water level data were obtained from the hubei province hydrology and water resources bureau while cross sectional topographic data and daily sediment data were obtained from the china yangtze river water resources commission 2 3 model development 2 3 1 hydrodynamic model the hd module is the basic computational component of the mike 21 fm modelling system and provides the hydrodynamic basis for the transport eco lab particle tracking mud transport and sand transport modules dhi 2012a in this study we coupled the sand transport module with the flow model to evaluate the impacts of different hydrological durations and sediment transport formulas on simulated non cohesive sediment transport the hd module is based on the numerical solution of 2d shallow water equations the depth integrated incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations both cartesian and spherical coordinates can be used in the horizontal domain the spatial discretization of the primary equations is performed using a cell centered finite volume method the spatial domain is discretized by subdividing the continuum into non overlapping cells paliwal and patra 2011 to solve these equations using finite volume numerical methods unstructured grids were used to define the topography of the study site an approximate riemann solver was used to calculate the convective fluxes which made it possible to handle discontinuous solutions warren and bach 1992 flow and water level variations were described by the saint venant equations the conservation of mass and momentum integrated over the vertical expressed as follows 1 h t p x q y w 2 p t x p 2 h y pq h g h

atmospheric pressure kg m s2 pw is the density of water kg m3 and τ xx τ yy τ xy are the components of effective shear stress 2 3 2 sediment transport model the st module in the mike 21 fm describes sand erosion transport and deposition under the action of pure currents the hydrodynamic basis for the st module must be calculated using the hd module the st module calculates sediment transport capacity the initial rates of bed level changes and morphological changes for non cohesive sediment based on hydrodynamic flow conditions dhi 2012b bed load and suspended load transport are calculated separately the bed load is mainly controlled by the bed shear stress or stream power per unit area and reacts instantaneously with flow the suspended load on the other hand is characterized by a phase lag in transport compared to flow because it takes some time or distance to adapt the vertical concentration profile to the flow for the pure current model type sediment transport rates are calculated continuously throughout the simulation based on sediment transport formulae derived from either empirical or deterministic principles in this study we didn t consider waves and non equilibrium transport rates were calculated considering the conditions at previous time steps we also did not include the influence of helical flow on sand transport the non cohesive suspended sediment in a fluid can be described by a transport equation for the volumetric sediment concentration two sediment theories that take bed load and suspended load into account are presently available in the model van rijn van rijn 1984 and engelund and fredsoe engelund and fredsøe 1976 the van rijn formula is given by the following two equations 4 s bl 0 053 t 2 1 d 0 3 s 1 g d 50 3 5 s sl f c a v h where sbl is the bed load m2 s ssl is the suspended load m2 s t is the non dimensional transport stage depending on critical friction velocity and effective friction velocity d is the non dimensional particle parameter s is the relative density of the sediment ca is the volumetric bed concentration m f is the concentration factor for the suspended load based on the bed load v is the velocity m s and h is the flow depth the probability of sediment grain movement can according to engelund and fredsøe 1976 be determined as 6 p 1 π 6 μ d θ θ c 4 1 4 θ θ c 7 θ u f 2 s l g d 50 8 u f v 6 2 5 ln h 2 5 d 50 9

is the shields parameter g is the acceleration of gravity s is the relative density of the sediment and d50 is the median grain size measured flow and sediment data from 2009 to 2015 at the huangzhuang gage station were used to generate the ssc rating curves eqs 11 14 according to the construction time of the dam we divided the original data into two parts before and after the dam construction eqs 11 and 12 were solved by fitting ssc data and corresponding discharges during the pre dam pre 2010 and post dam post 2011 periods respectively fig 2 the ssc data above the line were selected as high sediment concentrations component according to the data before the dam construction and the data located below the line is selected as low sediment concentrations component for the data after dam construction therefore the ssc data were classified into values greater and less than these linear regressions to develop eqs 13 and 14 eq 13 was fitted to the data located above the linear regression of ssc in the pre dam period and eq 14 represented the data located below the linear regression from the post dam period eqs 13 and 14 were used to calculate potential high and low sediment concentrations for the upstream boundary conditions respectively the main reason for adopting these equations was that they provided the maximum possible differences in ssc for a given discharge level these two sediment concentrations were used to simulate differences in sediment transport processes for different hydrographic duration scenarios as a function of sediment supply using the van rijn 1984 and engelund and fredsøe 1976 sediment transport equations 11 ssc 0 0437 q 0 6381 r 2 0 863 12 ssc 0 0051 q 1 3372 r 2 0 712 13 ssc 0 0545 q 0 8293 r 2 0 647 14 ssc 0 0034 q 1 4212 r

providing the mike 21 fm with a suitable mesh grid is essential for obtaining reliable results setting up the mesh included selecting the appropriate area to be modelled setting adequate bathymetry and flow field resolutions and defining codes for open and closed boundaries in this study two open boundary conditions were defined from the mesh file specified in the domain parameters a south boundary code 3 and a north boundary code 4 one for the upstream boundary conditions consisting of daily water level time series at xiangyang station code 4 another for the downstream boundary conditions consisting of daily river flow time series at huangzhuang station code 3 furthermore the simulated river reach should have similar geographical characteristics and minimum geographical heterogeneity as much as possible in this study the mesh file was generated in the mike zero mesh generator which is a tool for generating and handling unstructured meshes including the definition and editing of boundaries each boundary section must contain at least 2 nodes the mesh file is an ascii file that contains information on the geographical position and bathymetry for each node point in the mesh the file also includes information of the order relationship between nodes in the mesh the bathymetry and mesh file described the water depths in the model area based on valid xyz data we used a 2018 landsat tm image as the background for creating the mesh the topographic data file xyz was extracted by arcmap based on the dem data with thespatialresolutionof30 m the grid a and bathymetry b files are shown in fig 3 2 3 4 model parameter setting and calibration the model was validated using water level discharge and suspended sediment load data measured data obtained between january 1 2013 and december 31 2014 were used for validation and data from january 1 2011 to december 31 2012 were used for calibration the calibration and validation fits were evaluated statistically using several indicators in this study nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr were calculated to estimate errors between the simulated and the measured value moriasi et al 2015 li et al 2018 noori and kalin 2016 the bed resistance is the most effective parameter for the calibration result of hydrodynamic modeling the manning s n roughness coefficients that were optimized during the model calibration and a value of 0 032 was finally specified as an overall resistance for the whole stretch of the river the porosity of sediment generally varies from 0 3 to 0 7 dhi 2012a and porosity of uniformly distributed grain sizes in the riverbed typically varies from 0 282 to 0 376 lane et al 2002 sulaiman and tsutsumi 2007 sediment transport is relatively insensitive to porosity but is very sensitive to manning s roughness coefficient ding and wang 2005 therefore porosity value of 0 4 was specified in this study the minimum grain size 0 007 mm considered in this study was greater than the maximum size 0 002 mm of cohesive soil folk 1966 we assumed values for grain size distribution dimensionless critical shear stress manning s roughness coefficient porosity cohesion less sediment and bare floodplain without vegetation the dimensionless critical shear stress was specified to be 0 056 wiberg and smith 1987 sediment transport calculations are sensitive to the dimensionless critical shear stress value which may vary by an order of magnitude léonard and richard 2004 critical shear stresses for incipient motion may also vary significantly within mixed sized and poorly sorted sediments kirchner et al 1990 wilcock 1988 in addition after trying different time steps higher than 1 min the optimal time step was found to be 5 min initial condition of surface level was set up with a value of 0 0 m eddy viscosity of 0 28 was specified the model parameters setting are listed in table 1 after the calibration and validation of the model we set up the relevant research scenarios to study the difference and applicability of the two different sediment formulas we use two formulas to simulate different hydrological durations we divide the simulation duration into three types long term short term and seasonal short term scenarios refer to a single rainfall event with different peak discharge seasonal scenarios included four seasons of summer autumn and winter for each scenario two formulas are tried respectively rainfall events with maximum annual discharge values from 2009 to 2015 were selected seven different hydrographic rainfall events were considered in this study two discharges occurred prior to cuijiaying dam operation 2009 and 2010 and five followed operations 2011 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 each event was simulated for 10 days five days before and after the peak flood at the study site details of the rainfall events are shown in table 2 to study seasonal differences in sediment transport we added a phased simulation for spring summer autumn and winter to compare simulations between different hydrological durations table 2 3 results 3 1 performance evaluation of the model the errors associated with calibration and validation of the hd and st models are shown in table 4 for calibration at the huangzhuang station the rsr and nsce for discharge were 0 55 and 0 89 respectively the same values were 0 63 and 0 15 for water level and 0 69 and 0 83 for sediment load the pbias values of 3 87 2 89 and 9 32 were recorded for discharge water level and sediment load respectively the best rsr and nsce performance occurred during the discharge calibration additionally during the validation phase the rsr values of 0 63 0 69 and 0 55 the nsce values of 0 91 0 25 and 0 71 the pbias values of 3 46 5 97 and 12 85 were observed for discharge water level and sediment load respectively the best nsce value 0 91 and pbias value 3 46 occurred during the discharge validation but the best rsr performance occurred during the sediment load validation in general during the calibration phase the discharge simulation performed better while the water level and sediment load simulations were better during the validation phase table 3 showed the performance evaluation criteria for recommended statistical performance measures specifically for discharge results the performance rating was considered to be good in the calibration phase and in the validation phase the performance rating for rsr nsce and pbias were satisfactory very good and very good respectively for sediment results in the calibration phase the performance rating for rsr nsce and pbias were satisfactory good and good respectively in the validation phase good performance rating was obtained for three statistical measures beside simulation of water level obtained negative nsce value of 0 15 or a low value of 0 25 during calibration and validation phases but the performance rating for rsr and pbias were satisfactory considering what will be doing with the model output and may be used to draw conclusions the relatively poor performance of the water level has no significant impact on the research objectives and is in the acceptable range a scatter plot of the observed and simulated values of the hydrological time series is shown fig 4 to compare the calibration and validation model results the simulated values were slightly lower than the measured value for low water levels during the calibration and validation phases during the validation stage the simulated values of the high water level component were significantly lower than the measured values especially when the water level is more than 43 m fig 4 a fig 4 b shows that the simulated ssc values were slightly lower than the measured values in the part of high sediment concentration during the calibration and validation phases moderate and low ssc peaks were generally modelled well while high discharge peaks were underestimated compared with water level and sediment concentration the simulated and measured values for discharge had better agreement it can be seen in fig 4 c that the simulated and measured values matched in both high and low discharge parts in addition the scatter plot of observed and simulated values for discharge and suspend sediment concentrations are shown in fig 4 d the water sediment relationship had a positive correlation in the low value part but was not significant in the high value part the cumulative values of simulated hydrological time series data from calibration and validation were plotted with observed data in fig 5 fig 5 a shows that the relationship between simulated and observed cumulative values for discharge and water level had better agreement in the calibration phase as the accumulative value increased the observed values were slightly lower than the simulated values for the discharge sediment relationship in contrast the observed accumulative value was slightly higher than the simulated value in the validation phase the relationship between simulated and observed cumulative values for discharge and water level were similar to those in the calibration phase fig 5 b the simulated and observed cumulative curves for discharge and sediment load matched better than in the calibration phase however these results were considered to be satisfactory based on the performance results reported above and considering the quality and quantity of measured data the simulation time step and the project scope the model was therefore suitable for tracking the features of observed hydrologic characteristics 3 2 sediment concentration with different hydrological durations and sediment transport formulas the results for suspended load and bed load under different hydrological durations with two different sediment transport formulas are shown in fig 6 for the engelund and fredsøe sediment transport formula the bed load was the highest 3 10 4 m3 s in winter and the lowest 8 7 10 5 m3 s in summer and for van rijn formula the bed load was the highest 4 6 10 4 m3 s in summer and the lowest 1 7 10 4 m3 s in spring fig 6 a the suspended load was the highest 3 4 10 4 m3 s in autumn and the lowest 3 8 10 5 m3 s in spring for both sediment transport formulas there are obvious seasonal differences in the process of sediment transport and in the same season there are also differences in suspended load and bed load the seasonal bed load varied greatly under different sediment transport formulas but the seasonal suspended load was highly consistent thus give an indication on the different description characteristics of two sediment formulas in terms of suspended load and bed load the interaction between the bed load and the alluvial bed is one of the most fundamental aspects of the morphological behavior of a river bend engelund and fredsøe 1976 according to the scientific principles of two sediment transport formulas in contrast to the suspended load the bed load responds immediately to changes in local hydraulic conditions bed load material is composed of larger grains rate in which grains travel is dependent on the transporting capacity of the flow the results for suspended load and bed load in individual rainfall scenarios with two different sediment transport formulas are shown in fig 6 b overall the bed load was significantly lower than the suspended load and only when the flood peak reached 14 600 was the bed load 8 1 10 5m3 s slightly higher than the suspended load 3 9 10 5 m3 s for the engelund and fredsøe formula the riverbed and suspended loads for the engelund and fredsøe were significantly lower than for the van rijn formula the minimum bed load 1 3 10 5 m3 s occurred under the engelund and fredsøe formula when the flood peak reached 2030 m3 s and the maximum bed load 1 9 10 4 m3 s occurred under the van rijn formula when the flood peak reached 5600 m3 s in addition as the peak flow value increased both suspended and bed loads first increased and then decreased and the performance of the suspended load was more obvious the ratings exhibited that suspended load change is more obvious in response to seasonal flood the sediment balance contains contributions from the three transport mechanisms settling advection and diffusion there are different driving factors in the transport process of suspended load and bed load and the exchange mechanism existbetween suspended load and bed load for the long term 12 months simulations the suspended load and bed load results for the two sediment transport formulas with high and low sediment concentrations are shown in fig 7 a it is clear that for both formulas the riverbed load was significantly higher than the suspended load at both high and low concentrations for the engelund and fredsøe formula high sediment concentrations were accompanied by higher bed load and lower suspension load while for the van rijn formula high sediment concentrations were accompanied by lower bed load and suspension load the ssc results for long term seasonal and individual rainfall simulation scenarios for different sediment transport formulas and sediment concentrations are shown in fig 7 b for seasonal simulation scenarios the van rijn formula sediment concentrations were higher than with the engelund and fredsøe formula for individual rainfall simulation scenarios the minimum ssc 32 g m3 occurred under the engelund and fredsøe formula with the flood peak value of 2900 m3 s and the maximum ssc 87 g m3 occurred under the van rijn formula whit the flood peak value of 2430 m3 s furthermore ssc from the engelund and fredsøe formula were significantly lower than that from the van rijn formula with peak values of 14200 m3 s and 14600 m3 s for long term simulation scenarios the ssc obtained by van rijn formula was higher than that of engelund and fredsøe formula in both high and low sediment concentrations besides there is a large spatial difference in suspended sediment concentration fig 9 a the reason is that the spatial variability in suspended sediment concentration largely depends on the differences in topography flow rate and sediment source of different river sections and these factors are characterized by a high heterogeneity most noticeably the two sediment formulas show obvious differences in the simulation of seasonal and long term hydrological periods but show similar rules in a short term single rainfall event which has important guiding significance for the selection of sediment formulas in the simulation of cross season or longer periods two sediment transport formulas used herein exclude the effect of riverbed porosity which is included in the continuity equation for update of bed level instead due to the non uniform vertical distribution of the suspended sediment concentration the effective fall height of grains will be different from the mean fall height 3 3 changes in bed topography during sediment transport bed level changes over different hydrological durations during sediment transport are shown in fig 8 in the long term simulation scenarios the riverbed variability from the van rijn formula was significantly greater than from the engelund and fredsøe formula fig 8 a the effects of different sediment concentrations on riverbed topography were clear for the two different formulas the minimum and maximum bed level change under the engelund and fredsøe formula and van rijn formula was 3 2 10 4 m and 1 32 10 3 m respectively our study also shows that there is large spatial variability in bed level change under long term simulation scenarios fig 9 b diversity in river ecosystems largely depends on the spatial and temporal diversity of physical processes such as precipitation magnitude frequency and duration leitch et al 2014 furthermore high sediment concentrations resulted in high erosion volume and low sediment concentrations resulted in higher deposition volume the lower erosion depth was not caused by decreased sediment transport capacity with higher flows but was because the erosion volume was spread over a progressively larger area as flow increased the van rijn and engelund and fredsøe formula results were highly consistent with the highest bed level variability 7 5 10 3 m in summer and the lowest bed level variability 4 10 3 m in spring fig 8 b the contribution of the engelund and fredsøe formula to riverbed topographic change was also slightly greater than the van rijn formula for spring summer and winter conversely the riverbed topographic change in the van rijn formula was slightly higher in autumn with the value of 3 10 3 m riverbed topographic changes in spring and summer were mainly sedimentary while in autumn and winter they were mainly erosive in the individual rainfall simulation scenarios as peak discharge increased the riverbed variability first increased then decreased and finally increased again fig 8 c the riverbed variability for both formulas reached a minimum 7 10 3 m when peak discharge was 4540 m3 s and bed level change for the engelund and fredsøe and van rijn formulas reached a maximum 5 3 10 2 m when peak discharge was 2430 m3 s and 14600 m3 s respectively the riverbed topography changed mainly by sedimentation with both formulas when peak flow was 2900 m3 s 4540 m3 s and 5600 m3 s most noticeably total erosion and deposition volumes changed as discharge became higher with both two formulas the engelund and fredsøe formula produced high riverbed erosion capacity at low discharges but the van rijn formula produced high riverbed erosion capacity at high discharges this implied that discharge intensity had a significant influence on erosion strength the river flow carried a large amount of sediment and promoted materials as the main external force it was able to carry materials by shifting suspending and solution transport thus the bed material is the principal link between river hydraulics and river form which is responsible for maintaining and carving the channel morphology in comparing sediment transport results from two different formulas it is important to note that both the two equations are based on bed and suspended loads they both consider grain shear stress however the two sediment formulas still showed significant differences under various hydrological durations and peak flow scenarios results indicated that different equations provide different predictions even when the equations are calibrated using the same data an assumption in the use of sediment transport models is the selection of a transport formula this assumption introduces uncertainty in predictions because all sediment transport equations are simplifications and difficult to represent the complex natural processes perfectly therefore the choice of sediment transport equation can be very important and different equations should be used for a given study to obtain a range of possible applicability 4 discussion traditionally sediment transport is classified into three modes of transport bed load suspended load and wash load ashworth and ferguson 1989 parker and klingeman 1982 according to the mechanism of suspension bed load is complementary to suspended load and wash load in actual sediment transport which consists of the larger sediment which is transported by saltation rolling and dragging on the riverbed the suspended load is the middle layer that consists of the smaller sediment that s suspended the wash load is uppermost layer which consist of the smallest sediment it has no relation to the transport capacity of the stream horn and mason 1994 usually a grain diameter of around 0 06 mm divides the region of wash load and bed material load but the sand transport module only considers the bed material load in this study we didn t consider waves and include the influence of helical flow on sand transport we calculated the non equilibrium transport rates directly based on the actual conditions under pure current model types considering the conditions at previous time steps the inertia effects need to be considered more comprehensively in the future research especially at the small watershed scale due to the actual situation of water conservancy project construction areas data scarcity and the practical purposes of the model this study used only four years of data for model calibration and validation the simulation duration set in the simulation scenarios was less than 4 years including the simulation of multiple single rainfall events 10 days thus it s reasonable to study the impacts of different hydrological durations and sediment transport formulas on non cohesive sediment transport processes however this limitations of data availability may bring uncertainties in describing the flow and sediment simulation processes output of hydrological models always subject to uncertainty from different sources of errors which are originated from the input data for model forcing variables the model parameters and structure the channel geometry the quantification of uncertainty in hydrological modeling is an imperative scientific problem and require more in depth research we used measured flow and sediment data to develop the ssc rating curves the curves were used to calculate potential high and low sediment concentrations for the upstream boundary conditions suspended sediment concentrations can often be higher in the rising limb of the hydrograph than in the falling limb due to the hysteresis effect araujo et al 2012 the hysteresis effect of suspended sediment transport on calculated sediment concentration would likely cause higher deposition rates in the rising limb and lower deposition rates in the falling limb we did not consider hysteresis effects because these are highly dependent on variable upstream sediment supply conditions the model calculated bed level changes for different hydrological durations with the engelund and fredsøe and van rijn formulas during sediment transport this demonstrated the importance of a sediment transport model that can simulate feedbacks between hydraulics and topography it is credible when the model is used for ecological restoration river siltation prevention and sand control construction the river water with high sediment concentrations had stronger erosion capability the erosion rate of river bed was mainly affected by the temporal and vertical variations of shear stress turbulence flow velocity and sediment concentrations high sediment concentrations often occur in the rainy season accompanied by high discharge and velocity an accelerating flow is created causing an increasing sediment transport rate along the flume and subsequent erosion of the bed the high velocity with more hard impurities the water carries the stronger the scour ability the flow obtained besides results showed that the bed load was significantly lower than the suspended load this may be because the suspended material in the river was lighter and was more immediately and significantly affected by floods while the material carried by the riverbed was the opposite the results suggest that a larger flood would increase the carrying capacity of suspended material in the river but the mega peak was not necessarily accompanied by the maximum sediment load to gain a deeper understanding of sediment transport under different hydrological phases we added sediment simulation scenarios for individual rainfall events for comparison each event was simulated for 10 days this weakened the difference between different rainfall events to some extent on average the peak discharge value does not summarize all the characteristics of a rainfall event the duration of a rainfall event is also important heavy rainfall is often accompanied by high river flow but the duration is random in addition there is a lag in the response of river sediment load to discharge change to understand sediment erosion and sedimentation as a function of discharge and ssc it is equally important to analyze the results at different intermediate time steps instead of the last time step alone the long duration simulation in this study indicated that the sediment transport is a long term continuous and complex process flood simulation duration may be important for inferring changes in sediment transport so careful consideration is needed when modeling floodplain processes 5 conclusions a two dimensional 2d surface water flow model fm coupled with a sediment transport st model was developed in this study the characteristic difference on simulated non cohesive sediment transport with different sediment concentrations hydrological durations and sediment transport formulas were quantified by calculating the bed load suspended load and bed level change the model was found to be suitable for tracking observed hydrologic characteristics based on the evaluated results the suspended load change is more obvious in response to seasonal flood and discharge intensity had a significant influence on erosion strength total erosion and deposition volumes changed as discharge became higher with both two formulas furthermore high sediment concentrations were accompanied by higher bed load and lower suspension load for the engelund and fredsøe formula the van rijn formula produced high riverbed erosion capacity at high discharges but the engelund and fredsøe formula produced high riverbed erosion capacity at low discharges two sediment formulas showed obvious differences in the simulation of seasonal and long term hydrological periods which has important guiding significance for the selection of sediment formulas in the simulation of cross season or longer periods the coupled hd and st model was able to simulate non cohesive sediment transport as a function of ssc feedbacks between hydraulics and topography sediment deposition and erosion were discontinuous with river discharge and varied both spatially and temporally therefore a coupled hd and st model that accounts for feedback processes between topographies and the water sediment relationship should be a good choice for future watershed management and restoration efforts it can help identify erosion prone areas and determine potential measures to restore fluid ecosystems according to the change rate of riverbed topography output from the model combined with the degree of deposition and erosion besides different equations provide different predictions even when the equations are calibrated using the same data therefore the choice of sediment transport equation can be very important and different equations should be used for a given study to obtain a range of possible applicability furthermore river sediment transport is directly affected by changes in the water sediment relationship these changes are the synergistic results of multiple factors and the impacts of land use change the river hillslope connectivity geology and soil coverage require more in depth research declaration of competing

5094,river sediment transport is an important global environmental issue for it leads to waterway sedimentation ecological degradation and river geomorphologic evolution its quantification is of the highest importance for river and watershed management however it remains unclear what the applicability of different sediment transport formulas in sediment transport process and what the characteristics of non cohesive sediment transport processes with different hydrological durations this study developed a two dimensional 2d surface water flow model fm coupled with a sediment transport st model in the mike 21 modelling system the characteristic difference on simulated non cohesive sediment transport under different sediment concentrations hydrological durations and sediment transport formulas were quantified by calculating the bed load suspended load and bed level change results indicated that the bed load and suspended load using the engelund and fredsøe formula were significantly lower than the van rijn formula for individual rainfall simulation scenarios with the increase in peak flow both suspended load and bed load first increased and then decreased in the long term duration simulations high sediment concentrations were accompanied by higher bed load and lower suspension load for the engelund and fredsøe formula but by lower bed load and suspension load for the van rijn formula the high sediment concentrations resulted in a higher erosion rate and low sediment concentrations resulted in a higher deposition rate the two formulas had a high degree of consistency in seasonality and the bed level changes in spring and summer were mainly sedimentary while in autumn and winter they were mainly erosive the engelund and fredsøe formula produced high riverbed erosion capacity at low discharge but the van rijn formula had high erosion capacity at high discharge keywords mathematical modelling hydrological durations sediment transport formulas bed level change suspended sediment concentration erosion and sedimentary processes 1 introduction river is the link between land and sea and plays a major role in the material circulation of the biosphere hydrosphere lithosphere and atmosphere suspended sediment transport is important in fluvial hydraulics and applied hydrodynamics because it significantly impacts river ecosystems such as aquatic plant and animal health and river channel and estuary delta evolution which play a vital role in governing fluvial morphodynamics ecological management and nutrient transport benda and dunne 1997 it is also of vital importance for water infrastructure design channel control and evolution floodplain wetland protection disaster reduction land use planning and water resources decision making management best 1988 the sediment particles adhere to a variety of nutrient salts and parasites which are the food sources of many aquatic organisms panagopoulos et al 2019 the sediment concentration of the river directly affects the transparency and light conditions of the water body thus affecting the growth of the floating animals and plants sediment concentration also affects the river scour and carrying capacity which have great influence on the riverbed physiognomy evolution pähtz et al 2020 long term sediment transport change affects the energy conversion and nutrient transport between the hydrosphere biosphere and lithosphere which affects the biomass and biological species however sediment transport in rivers is complex due to the temporal and spatial variability of water and sediment loads which are controlled by a suite of factors whose individual effects are often difficult to disentangle prosser et al 2001 in addition the impacts of different hydrological durations on suspended sediment supply are still unclear because suspended sediment concentration ssc and suspension duration can be influenced by many factors such as fluvial geomorphology flood duration grain size and flow frequency zeiger and hubbart 2016 suspended sediment concentration depends mainly on flow hydraulics but is also controlled by the upstream sediment supply particle settling velocity and sediment carrying capacity ashmore and day 1988 horowitz 2003 rates of erosion and deposition can also differ during the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph richey et al 1986 effective discharge for suspended sediment transport is also not well understood although rapidly rising large flows are more effective for particle deposition than are slowly rising moderate flows roy and sinha 2014 additionally field measurements on some hydrological variables such as shear stress suspended load bed load flood depth and bed level change are difficult to obtain because of the limitations timeliness and uncertainty of floods and dangerous conditions therefore mathematical modelling can be an effective approach for this task numerous hydrodynamic hd models have been developed to simulate river flow and sediment transport salvadore et al 2015 these models can be divided as one dimensional 1d two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d the 1d models are mostly based on finite difference and finite element methods while they are simple to use they do not provide detailed information on the flow field gharari and razavi 2018 1d hydraulic models provide cross sectional averaged velocity distribution and water surface elevation at selected longitudinal locations along a river carling et al 2010 crispino et al 2015 the progression of the peak flood level down the system is not considered in these models but the flood is assumed to peak instantaneously and simultaneously at all sections leandro et al 2009 tunnicliffe et al 2012 the steady state 1d models do not provide the transversal structure of downstream directed flow properties let alone cross stream or vertically directed components of flow properties castellarin et al 2009 leandro et al 2011 mark et al 2004 masood and takeuchi 2012 2d models may represent flow properties in two dimensions along the longitudinal and the transversal or the longitudinal and the vertical directions in complex rivers a 2d model allows transverse variations in water level so that features such as diagonal riffles can be modelled hung et al 2009 abderrezzak et al 2016 ouillon and le guennec 1996 the advantage of 2d models over 1d models is that they predict current directions and changes in the pattern of velocity distribution vargas luna et al 2015 3d models will also predict the vertical velocity distributions however 3d models are rarely employed to river scale problems due to their huge computational and input data requirements 2d hydraulic modelling is currently a more affordable approach compared to 3d modelling because of its computational running time requirements salvadore et al 2015 the 2d hd models have been used extensively to simulate hydrodynamics water quality flood forecasting and solute transport in rivers lakes estuaries harbours and constructed wetlands crowder and diplas 2000 ekama and marais 2004 horritt and bates 2002 zhang et al 2017 additionally simulated sediment transport may differ depending on the sediment transport equations used because the suitability of a given formula can vary lópez and garcía 1998 walling 1983 a number of sediment transport formulas for bed load suspended load and total load have been developed over the years and have been used to estimate sediment transport ackers and white 1973 engelund and fredsøe 1976 meyer peter and müller 1948 van rijn 1984 these formulas were developed for specific systems and correspond to a limited set of field or experimental data different formulas may be adapted for different rivers and different hydrological periods the uncertainty and differences between them are still worthy of attention gomez and church 1989 there is no universal formula that is valid for all cases because many parameters influence sediment transport at the same time the sediment transport processes at these high or low concentrations may be significantly different wu et al 2008 a large number of comparison studies have been done to test the predictability of various sediment transport methods covering a wide range of flow conditions and sediment types berg and gelder 1993 liu et al 2002 tayfur and singh 2012 ulses et al 2008 vachtman et al 2013 however none of few studies have been devoted to the difference of the application and selection of sediment formula under different hydrological periods and sediment concentrations ulses et al 2008 scholars pay more attention to the sediment transport processes under extreme weather events such as extreme storms and floods therefore the applicability of the sediment formula under different hydrological duration and concentrations in different regions is still worth studying in this study we used a software package that incorporated sediment transport st model coupled with a mike 21 flow model fm modelling system for spatially distributed 2d surface water flow simulation which was developed by the danish hydraulic institute dhi the mike 21 fm is a new modelling system based on a flexible mesh approach which has a user friendly interface good visualization and flexibility to deal with complex terrain dhi 2012a the st model predicts sediment movement along a river the sand transport module describes sand erosion transport and deposition due to currents and waves or pure currents it calculates the transport of non cohesive materials based on flow conditions from hydrodynamic calculations dhi 2012b for the pure current model type the bed load and suspended load are calculated separately the combined currents and waves model use the total load the specific objectives and research questions for this study therefore were to 1 develop a suitable 2d surface water flow model including sediment transport using the mike 21 fm modelling system 2 evaluate the performance of the model and set up hydrological scenarios with different sediment transport formulas 3 calculate the bed load suspended load and bed level change for different hydrological durations ssc rating curves and sediment transport formulas 4 study the uncertainty and differences in the performances of transport formulas under different hydrological scenarios and 5 identify the characteristics of non cohesive sediment transport with different hydrological durations and sediment transport formulas 2 methodology 2 1 geographical setting the hanjiang river located between 106 and 114 e and 30 34 n fig 1 is about 1570 km long and is the longest tributary of the yangtze river with a basin area of about 170 400 km2 wei et al 2016 the basin is affected by the sub tropical monsoon and has average annual temperatures of 15 17 c annual precipitation ranges from 1200 mm in the southern plains to about 700 800 mm in the north hilly regions lu et al 2018a about 60 of annual precipitation occurs from april to july wang et al 2016 more than 70 of the elevation is below 1000 m in the basin and only 4 is above 2000 m the elevation gradually decreases from the upper to lower reaches danjiangkou reservoir was completed in 1974 separating the hanjiang river into higher and mid lower reaches danjiangkou to zhongxiang make up the middle reaches of the river and are located in hubei province of central china fig 1 danjiangkou reservoir is the principal water resources provider for china s central line of south to north water diversion project snwdp since 2010 9 5 109m3 of water has been extracted every year from the danjiangkou reservoir and 13 109m3 water will be extracted every year from 2030 onwards when the second phase is complete accounting for 27 and 37 of the respective current annual release from the reservoir downstream yang et al 2012 several projects have been built to mitigate the negative effects of the snwdp on the hanjiang river including the yangtze hanjiang water diversion project the xinglong water conservancy project and the wangfuzhou and cuijiaying dam 2 2 study site and data to better investigate sediment transport and model applicability in a small and medium watershed we chose the middle reach of the hanjiang river as the study site due to its complex geographical conditions and high level of human disturbance the river bed of the middle reach is wide and shallow and the water flow is scattered which belongs to wandering river channel the width of the narrow reach is about 300 400 m it can reach 2 3 km in the wet period and the maximum width can reach 5 6 km the operation of cuijiaying dam altered the peak flow sediment transport riparian vegetation and aquatic habitat in the middle hanjiang river the post dam peak discharge inundation extent and sediment load decreased significantly from pre dam conditions lu et al 2018b there are two hydrological stations xiangyang and huangzhuang in the middle part of the hanjiang river fig 1 daily discharge and water level data were obtained from the hubei province hydrology and water resources bureau while cross sectional topographic data and daily sediment data were obtained from the china yangtze river water resources commission 2 3 model development 2 3 1 hydrodynamic model the hd module is the basic computational component of the mike 21 fm modelling system and provides the hydrodynamic basis for the transport eco lab particle tracking mud transport and sand transport modules dhi 2012a in this study we coupled the sand transport module with the flow model to evaluate the impacts of different hydrological durations and sediment transport formulas on simulated non cohesive sediment transport the hd module is based on the numerical solution of 2d shallow water equations the depth integrated incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations both cartesian and spherical coordinates can be used in the horizontal domain the spatial discretization of the primary equations is performed using a cell centered finite volume method the spatial domain is discretized by subdividing the continuum into non overlapping cells paliwal and patra 2011 to solve these equations using finite volume numerical methods unstructured grids were used to define the topography of the study site an approximate riemann solver was used to calculate the convective fluxes which made it possible to handle discontinuous solutions warren and bach 1992 flow

sand erosion transport and deposition under the action of pure currents the hydrodynamic basis for the st module must be calculated using the hd module the st module calculates sediment transport capacity the initial rates of bed level changes and morphological changes for non cohesive sediment based on hydrodynamic flow conditions dhi 2012b bed load and suspended load transport are calculated separately the bed load is mainly controlled by the bed shear stress or stream power per unit area and reacts instantaneously with flow the suspended load on the other hand is characterized by a phase lag in transport compared to flow because it takes some time or distance to adapt the vertical concentration profile to the flow for the pure current model type sediment transport rates are calculated continuously throughout the simulation based on sediment transport formulae derived from either empirical or deterministic principles in this study we didn t consider waves and non equilibrium transport rates were calculated considering the conditions at previous time steps we also did not include the influence of helical flow on sand transport the non cohesive suspended sediment in a fluid can be described by a transport equation for the volumetric sediment concentration two sediment theories that take bed load and suspended load into account are presently available in the model van rijn van rijn 1984 and engelund and fredsoe engelund and fredsøe 1976 the van rijn formula is given by the following two equations 4 s bl 0 053 t 2 1 d 0 3 s 1 g d 50 3 5 s sl f c a v h where sbl is

huangzhuang gage station were used to generate the ssc rating curves eqs 11 14 according to the construction time of the dam we divided the original data into two parts before and after the dam construction eqs 11 and 12 were solved by fitting ssc data and corresponding discharges during the pre dam pre 2010 and post dam post 2011 periods respectively fig 2 the ssc data above the line were selected as high sediment concentrations component according to the data before the dam construction and the data located below the line is selected as low sediment concentrations component for the data after dam construction therefore the ssc data were classified into values greater and less than these linear regressions to develop eqs 13 and 14 eq 13 was fitted to the data located above the linear regression of ssc in the pre dam period and eq 14 represented the data located below the linear regression from the post dam period eqs 13 and 14 were used to calculate potential high and low sediment concentrations for the upstream boundary conditions respectively the main reason for adopting these equations was that they provided the maximum possible differences in ssc for a given discharge level these two sediment concentrations were used to simulate differences in sediment transport processes for different hydrographic duration scenarios as a function of sediment supply using the van rijn 1984 and engelund and fredsøe 1976 sediment transport equations 11 ssc 0 0437 q 0 6381 r 2 0 863 12 ssc 0 0051 q 1 3372 r 2 0 712 13 ssc 0 0545 q 0 8293 r 2 0 647 14 ssc 0 0034 q 1 4212 r

providing the mike 21 fm with a suitable mesh grid is essential for obtaining reliable results setting up the mesh included selecting the appropriate area to be modelled setting adequate bathymetry and flow field resolutions and defining codes for open and closed boundaries in this study two open boundary conditions were defined from the mesh file specified in the domain parameters a south boundary code 3 and a north boundary code 4 one for the upstream boundary conditions consisting of daily water level time series at xiangyang station code 4 another for the downstream boundary conditions consisting of daily river flow time series at huangzhuang station code 3 furthermore the simulated river reach should have similar geographical characteristics and minimum geographical heterogeneity as much as possible in this study the mesh file was generated in the mike zero mesh generator which is a tool for generating and handling unstructured meshes including the definition and editing of boundaries each boundary section must contain at least 2 nodes the mesh file is an ascii file that contains information on the geographical position and bathymetry for each node point in the mesh the file also includes information of the order relationship between nodes in the mesh the bathymetry and mesh file described the water depths in the model area based on valid xyz data we used a 2018 landsat tm image as the background for creating the mesh the topographic data file xyz was extracted by arcmap based on the dem data with thespatialresolutionof30 m the grid a and bathymetry b files are shown in fig 3 2 3 4 model parameter setting and calibration the model was validated using water level discharge and suspended sediment load data measured data obtained between january 1 2013 and december 31 2014 were used for validation and data from january 1 2011 to december 31 2012 were used for calibration the calibration and validation fits were evaluated statistically using several indicators in this study nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr were calculated to estimate errors between the simulated and the measured value moriasi et al 2015 li et al 2018 noori and kalin 2016 the bed resistance is the most effective parameter for the calibration result of hydrodynamic modeling the manning s n roughness coefficients that were optimized during the model calibration and a value of 0 032 was finally specified as an overall resistance for the whole stretch of the river the porosity of sediment generally varies from 0 3 to 0 7 dhi 2012a and porosity of uniformly distributed grain sizes in the riverbed typically varies from 0 282 to 0 376 lane et al 2002 sulaiman and tsutsumi 2007 sediment transport is relatively insensitive to porosity but is very sensitive to manning s roughness coefficient ding and wang 2005 therefore porosity value of 0 4 was specified in this study the minimum grain size 0 007 mm considered in this study was greater than the maximum size 0 002 mm of cohesive soil folk 1966 we assumed values for grain size distribution dimensionless critical shear stress manning s roughness coefficient porosity cohesion less sediment and bare floodplain without vegetation the dimensionless critical shear stress was specified to be 0 056 wiberg and smith 1987 sediment transport calculations are sensitive to the dimensionless critical shear stress value which may vary by an order of magnitude léonard and richard 2004 critical shear stresses for incipient motion may also vary significantly within mixed sized and poorly sorted sediments kirchner et al 1990 wilcock 1988 in addition after trying different time steps higher than 1 min the optimal time step was found to be 5 min initial condition of surface level was set up with a value of 0 0 m eddy viscosity of 0 28 was specified the model parameters setting are listed in table 1 after the calibration and validation of the model we set up the relevant research scenarios to study the difference and applicability of the two different sediment formulas we use two formulas to simulate different hydrological durations we divide the simulation duration into three types long term short term and seasonal short term scenarios refer to a single rainfall event with different peak discharge seasonal scenarios included four seasons of summer autumn and winter for each scenario two formulas are tried respectively rainfall events with maximum annual discharge values from 2009 to 2015 were selected seven different hydrographic rainfall events were considered in this study two discharges occurred prior to cuijiaying dam operation 2009 and 2010 and five followed operations 2011 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 each event was simulated for 10 days five days before and after the peak flood at the study site details of the rainfall events are shown in table 2 to study seasonal differences in sediment transport we added a phased simulation for spring summer autumn and winter to compare simulations between different hydrological durations table 2 3 results 3 1 performance evaluation of the model the errors associated with calibration and validation of the hd and st models are shown in table 4 for calibration at the huangzhuang station the rsr and nsce for discharge were 0 55 and 0 89 respectively the same values were 0 63 and 0 15 for water level and 0 69 and 0 83 for sediment load the pbias values of 3 87 2 89 and 9 32 were recorded for discharge water level and sediment load respectively the best rsr and nsce performance occurred during the discharge calibration additionally during the validation phase the rsr values of 0 63 0 69 and 0 55 the nsce values of 0 91 0 25 and 0 71 the pbias values of 3 46 5 97 and 12 85 were observed for discharge water level and sediment load respectively the best nsce value 0 91 and pbias value 3 46 occurred during the discharge validation but the best rsr performance occurred during the sediment load validation in general during the calibration phase the discharge simulation performed better while the water level and sediment load simulations were better during the validation phase table 3 showed the performance evaluation criteria for recommended statistical performance measures specifically for discharge results the performance rating was considered to be good in the calibration phase and in the validation phase the performance rating for rsr nsce and pbias were satisfactory very good and very good respectively for sediment results in the calibration phase the performance rating for rsr nsce and pbias were satisfactory good and good respectively in the validation phase good performance rating was obtained for three statistical measures beside simulation of water level obtained negative nsce value of 0 15 or a low value of 0 25 during calibration and validation phases but the performance rating for rsr and pbias were satisfactory considering what will be doing with the model output and may be used to draw conclusions the relatively poor performance of the water level has no significant impact on the research objectives and is in the acceptable range a scatter plot of the observed and simulated values of the hydrological time series is shown fig 4 to compare the calibration and validation model results the simulated values were slightly lower than the measured value for low water levels during the calibration and validation phases during the validation stage the simulated values of the high water level component were significantly lower than the measured values especially when the water level is more than 43 m fig 4 a fig 4 b shows that the simulated ssc values were slightly lower than the measured values in the part of high sediment concentration during the calibration and validation phases moderate and low ssc peaks were generally modelled well while high discharge peaks were underestimated compared with water level and sediment concentration the simulated and measured values for discharge had better agreement it can be seen in fig 4 c that the simulated and measured values matched in both high and low discharge parts in addition the scatter plot of observed and simulated values for discharge and suspend sediment concentrations are shown in fig 4 d the water sediment relationship had a positive correlation in the low value part but was not significant in the high value part the cumulative values of simulated hydrological time series data from calibration and validation were plotted with observed data in fig 5 fig 5 a shows that the relationship between simulated and observed cumulative values for discharge and water level had better agreement in the calibration phase as the accumulative value increased the observed values were slightly lower than the simulated values for the discharge sediment relationship in contrast the observed accumulative value was slightly higher than the simulated value in the validation phase the relationship between simulated and observed cumulative values for discharge and water level were similar to those in the calibration phase fig 5 b the simulated and observed cumulative curves for discharge and sediment load matched better than in the calibration phase however these results were considered to be satisfactory based on the performance results reported above and considering the quality and quantity of measured data the simulation time step and the project scope the model was therefore suitable for tracking the features of observed hydrologic characteristics 3 2 sediment concentration with different hydrological durations and sediment transport formulas the results for suspended load and bed load under different hydrological durations with two different sediment transport formulas are shown in fig 6 for the engelund and fredsøe sediment transport formula the bed load was the highest 3 10 4 m3 s in winter and the lowest 8 7 10 5 m3 s in summer and for van rijn formula the bed load was the highest 4 6 10 4 m3 s in summer and the lowest 1 7 10 4 m3 s in spring fig 6 a the suspended load was the highest 3 4 10 4 m3 s in autumn and the lowest 3 8 10 5 m3 s in spring for both sediment transport formulas there are obvious seasonal differences in the process of sediment transport and in the same season there are also differences in suspended load and bed load the seasonal bed load varied greatly under different sediment transport formulas but the seasonal suspended load was highly consistent thus give an indication on the different description characteristics of two sediment formulas in terms of suspended load and bed load the interaction between the bed load and the alluvial bed is one of the most fundamental aspects of the morphological behavior of a river bend engelund and fredsøe 1976 according to the scientific principles of two sediment transport formulas in contrast to the suspended load the bed load responds immediately to changes in local hydraulic conditions bed load material is composed of larger grains rate in which grains travel is dependent on the transporting capacity of the flow the results for suspended load and bed load in individual rainfall scenarios with two different sediment transport formulas are shown in fig 6 b overall the bed load was significantly lower than the suspended load and only when the flood peak reached 14 600 was the bed load 8 1 10 5m3 s slightly higher than the suspended load 3 9 10 5 m3 s for the engelund and fredsøe formula the riverbed and suspended loads for the engelund and fredsøe were significantly lower than for the van rijn formula the minimum bed load 1 3 10 5 m3 s occurred under the engelund and fredsøe formula when the flood peak reached 2030 m3 s and the maximum bed load 1 9 10 4 m3 s occurred under the van rijn formula when the flood peak reached 5600 m3 s in addition as the peak flow value increased both suspended and bed loads first increased and then decreased and the performance of the suspended load was more obvious the ratings exhibited that suspended load change is more obvious in response to seasonal flood the sediment balance contains contributions from the three transport mechanisms settling advection and diffusion there are different driving factors in the transport process of suspended load and bed load and the exchange mechanism existbetween suspended load and bed load for the long term 12 months simulations the suspended load and bed load results for the two sediment transport formulas with high and low sediment concentrations are shown in fig 7 a it is clear that for both formulas the riverbed load was significantly higher than the suspended load at both high and low concentrations for the engelund and fredsøe formula high sediment concentrations were accompanied by higher bed load and lower suspension load while for the van rijn formula high sediment concentrations were accompanied by lower bed load and suspension load the ssc results for long term seasonal and individual rainfall simulation scenarios for different sediment transport formulas and sediment concentrations are shown in fig 7 b for seasonal simulation scenarios the van rijn formula sediment concentrations were higher than with the engelund and fredsøe formula for individual rainfall simulation scenarios the minimum ssc 32 g m3 occurred under the engelund and fredsøe formula with the flood peak value of 2900 m3 s and the maximum ssc 87 g m3 occurred under the van rijn formula whit the flood peak value of 2430 m3 s furthermore ssc from the engelund and fredsøe formula were significantly lower than that from the van rijn formula with peak values of 14200 m3 s and 14600 m3 s for long term simulation scenarios the ssc obtained by van rijn formula was higher than that of engelund and fredsøe formula in both high and low sediment concentrations besides there is a large spatial difference in suspended sediment concentration fig 9 a the reason is that the spatial variability in suspended sediment concentration largely depends on the differences in topography flow rate and sediment source of different river sections and these factors are characterized by a high heterogeneity most noticeably the two sediment formulas show obvious differences in the simulation of seasonal and long term hydrological periods but show similar rules in a short term single rainfall event which has important guiding significance for the selection of sediment formulas in the simulation of cross season or longer periods two sediment transport formulas used herein exclude the effect of riverbed porosity which is included in the continuity equation for update of bed level instead due to the non uniform vertical distribution of the suspended sediment concentration the effective fall height of grains will be different from the mean fall height 3 3 changes in bed topography during sediment transport bed level changes over different hydrological durations during sediment transport are shown in fig 8 in the long term simulation scenarios the riverbed variability from the van rijn formula was significantly greater than from the engelund and fredsøe formula fig 8 a the effects of different sediment concentrations on riverbed topography were clear for the two different formulas the minimum and maximum bed level change under the engelund and fredsøe formula and van rijn formula was 3 2 10 4 m and 1 32 10 3 m respectively our study also shows that there is large spatial variability in bed level change under long term simulation scenarios fig 9 b diversity in river ecosystems largely depends on the spatial and temporal diversity of physical processes such as precipitation magnitude frequency and duration leitch et al 2014 furthermore high sediment concentrations resulted in high erosion volume and low sediment concentrations resulted in higher deposition volume the lower erosion depth was not caused by decreased sediment transport capacity with higher flows but was because the erosion volume was spread over a progressively larger area as flow increased the van rijn and engelund and fredsøe formula results were highly consistent with the highest bed level variability 7 5 10 3 m in summer and the lowest bed level variability 4 10 3 m in spring fig 8 b the contribution of the engelund and fredsøe formula to riverbed topographic change was also slightly greater than the van rijn formula for spring summer and winter conversely the riverbed topographic change in the van rijn formula was slightly higher in autumn with the value of 3 10 3 m riverbed topographic changes in spring and summer were mainly sedimentary while in autumn and winter they were mainly erosive in the individual rainfall simulation scenarios as peak discharge increased the riverbed variability first increased then decreased and finally increased again fig 8 c the riverbed variability for both formulas reached a minimum 7 10 3 m when peak discharge was 4540 m3 s and bed level change for the engelund and fredsøe and van rijn formulas reached a maximum 5 3 10 2 m when peak discharge was 2430 m3 s and 14600 m3 s respectively the riverbed topography changed mainly by sedimentation with both formulas when peak flow was 2900 m3 s 4540 m3 s and 5600 m3 s most noticeably total erosion and deposition volumes changed as discharge became higher with both two formulas the engelund and fredsøe formula produced high riverbed erosion capacity at low discharges but the van rijn formula produced high riverbed erosion capacity at high discharges this implied that discharge intensity had a significant influence on erosion strength the river flow carried a large amount of sediment and promoted materials as the main external force it was able to carry materials by shifting suspending and solution transport thus the bed material is the principal link between river hydraulics and river form which is responsible for maintaining and carving the channel morphology in comparing sediment transport results from two different formulas it is important to note that both the two equations are based on bed and suspended loads they both consider grain shear stress however the two sediment formulas still showed significant differences under various hydrological durations and peak flow scenarios results indicated that different equations provide different predictions even when the equations are calibrated using the same data an assumption in the use of sediment transport models is the selection of a transport formula this assumption introduces uncertainty in predictions because all sediment transport equations are simplifications and difficult to represent the complex natural processes perfectly therefore the choice of sediment transport equation can be very important and different equations should be used for a given study to obtain a range of possible applicability 4 discussion traditionally sediment transport is classified into three modes of transport bed load suspended load and wash load ashworth and ferguson 1989 parker and klingeman 1982 according to the mechanism of suspension bed load is complementary to suspended load and wash load in actual sediment transport which consists of the larger sediment which is transported by saltation rolling and dragging on the riverbed the suspended load is the middle layer that consists of the smaller sediment that s suspended the wash load is uppermost layer which consist of the smallest sediment it has no relation to the transport capacity of the stream horn and mason 1994 usually a grain diameter of around 0 06 mm divides the region of wash load and bed material load but the sand transport module only considers the bed material load in this study we didn t consider waves and include the influence of helical flow on sand transport we calculated the non equilibrium transport rates directly based on the actual conditions under pure current model types considering the conditions at previous time steps the inertia effects need to be considered more comprehensively in the future research especially at the small watershed scale due to the actual situation of water conservancy project construction areas data scarcity and the practical purposes of the model this study used only four years of data for model calibration and validation the simulation duration set in the simulation scenarios was less than 4 years including the simulation of multiple single rainfall events 10 days thus it s reasonable to study the impacts of different hydrological durations and sediment transport formulas on non cohesive sediment transport processes however this limitations of data availability may bring uncertainties in describing the flow and sediment simulation processes output of hydrological models always subject to uncertainty from different sources of errors which are originated from the input data for model forcing variables the model parameters and structure the channel geometry the quantification of uncertainty in hydrological modeling is an imperative scientific problem and require more in depth research we used measured flow and sediment data to develop the ssc rating curves the curves were used to calculate potential high and low sediment concentrations for the upstream boundary conditions suspended sediment concentrations can often be higher in the rising limb of the hydrograph than in the falling limb due to the hysteresis effect araujo et al 2012 the hysteresis effect of suspended sediment transport on calculated sediment concentration would likely cause higher deposition rates in the rising limb and lower deposition rates in the falling limb we did not consider hysteresis effects because these are highly dependent on variable upstream sediment supply conditions the model calculated bed level changes for different hydrological durations with the engelund and fredsøe and van rijn formulas during sediment transport this demonstrated the importance of a sediment transport model that can simulate feedbacks between hydraulics and topography it is credible when the model is used for ecological restoration river siltation prevention and sand control construction the river water with high sediment concentrations had stronger erosion capability the erosion rate of river bed was mainly affected by the temporal and vertical variations of shear stress turbulence flow velocity and sediment concentrations high sediment concentrations often occur in the rainy season accompanied by high discharge and velocity an accelerating flow is created causing an increasing sediment transport rate along the flume and subsequent erosion of the bed the high velocity with more hard impurities the water carries the stronger the scour ability the flow obtained besides results showed that the bed load was significantly lower than the suspended load this may be because the suspended material in the river was lighter and was more immediately and significantly affected by floods while the material carried by the riverbed was the opposite the results suggest that a larger flood would increase the carrying capacity of suspended material in the river but the mega peak was not necessarily accompanied by the maximum sediment load to gain a deeper understanding of sediment transport under different hydrological phases we added sediment simulation scenarios for individual rainfall events for comparison each event was simulated for 10 days this weakened the difference between different rainfall events to some extent on average the peak discharge value does not summarize all the characteristics of a rainfall event the duration of a rainfall event is also important heavy rainfall is often accompanied by high river flow but the duration is random in addition there is a lag in the response of river sediment load to discharge change to understand sediment erosion and sedimentation as a function of discharge and ssc it is equally important to analyze the results at different intermediate time steps instead of the last time step alone the long duration simulation in this study indicated that the sediment transport is a long term continuous and complex process flood simulation duration may be important for inferring changes in sediment transport so careful consideration is needed when modeling floodplain processes 5 conclusions a two dimensional 2d surface water flow model fm coupled with a sediment transport st model was developed in this study the characteristic difference on simulated non cohesive sediment transport with different sediment concentrations hydrological durations and sediment transport formulas were quantified by calculating the bed load suspended load and bed level change the model was found to be suitable for tracking observed hydrologic characteristics based on the evaluated results the suspended load change is more obvious in response to seasonal flood and discharge intensity had a significant influence on erosion strength total erosion and deposition volumes changed as discharge became higher with both two formulas furthermore high sediment concentrations were accompanied by higher bed load and lower suspension load for the engelund and fredsøe formula the van rijn formula produced high riverbed erosion capacity at high discharges but the engelund and fredsøe formula produced high riverbed erosion capacity at low discharges two sediment formulas showed obvious differences in the simulation of seasonal and long term hydrological periods which has important guiding significance for the selection of sediment formulas in the simulation of cross season or longer periods the coupled hd and st model was able to simulate non cohesive sediment transport as a function of ssc feedbacks between hydraulics and topography sediment deposition and erosion were discontinuous with river discharge and varied both spatially and temporally therefore a coupled hd and st model that accounts for feedback processes between topographies and the water sediment relationship should be a good choice for future watershed management and restoration efforts it can help identify erosion prone areas and determine potential measures to restore fluid ecosystems according to the change rate of riverbed topography output from the model combined with the degree of deposition and erosion besides different equations provide different predictions even when the equations are calibrated using the same data therefore the choice of sediment transport equation can be very important and different equations should be used for a given study to obtain a range of possible applicability furthermore river sediment transport is directly affected by changes in the water sediment relationship these changes are the synergistic results of multiple factors and the impacts of land use change the river hillslope connectivity geology and soil coverage require more in depth research declaration of competing
