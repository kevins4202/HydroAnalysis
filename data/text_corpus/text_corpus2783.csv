to the dissolved oxygen and redox potential of wastewater but it was positively related with the bacteroidetes and flavobacterium abundance the results indicated that microbial community structure and abundance are distinct between epiphyton and bacterioplankton this study also demonstrate that epiphytic biofilms play an important role in denitrification during the treatment of swine wastewater in constructed wetlands finally since swine wastewater serves as an excellent source for nutrients possible technological options including periphyton techniques for resource recovery from wastewater and future research prospective have been suggested keywords epiphyton bacterioplankton microbial community constructed wetland myriophyllum aquaticum 1 introduction rapid development of breeding industry

surface flow cws sfcws accounting for 67 5 of the total n removal in high strength wastewater treatment 4 microorganisms tend to adhere to the carrier surface and form structures known as biofilms 6 biofilms are the most common living model for microorganisms in all habitats with a complex matrix of living algae bacteria fungi and protozoa and non living components 7 8 wetland plants could provide efficacious attachment sites for microbial communities and regulate microbial activities by releasing oxygen and organic compounds 9 10 the biofilm attached to plant tissues is referred as epiphyton many studies have demonstrated that epiphyton in wetlands is considered to be a n transformation hot zone 11 12 and has an important contribution to n removal 8 11 on the other hand the biofilms in water column is called bacterioplankton which plays a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycle of nutrients and contaminants 13 14 the bacterioplankton community has been reported to be beneficial for n removal and prevention of eutrophication in coastal and marine ecosystems 13 15 although characteristics of denitrifiers and bacterial communities of biofilms in natural conditions have been reported by many researchers 16 17 the functions of biofilms are always determined by their composition which were largely affected by environmental factors however the population characteristics of denitrifiers and bacterial communities of epiphyton and bacterioplankton remain largely unexplored in cws treating swine wastewater previous studies have found that a fast growing aquatic plant myriophyllum aquaticum can be used to treat swine wastewater and malodorous black river water since it is able to withstand high concentration of nh4 n 200 mg l 2 4 18 the microbial community structure and diversity in sediments of m aquaticum cws have been characterized and reported 5 19 20 during biological treatment of wastewater for n removal nirk and nirs genes are the most important functional genes linked to the denitrification pathway for example microbial n removal mass and potential denitrification rate were significantly correlated with nirk and nirs genes in sediments of m aquaticum cws 5 18 there is still little knowledge about the denitrifying functional genes from the bacterioplankton in water column and epiphytic biofilm in wastewater treatment wetlands hence in this study to ascertain denitrifying genes abundance bacterial community characteristics and community structure divergence in m aquaticum wetlands bacterioplankton and epiphytic biofilm samples were collected from pilot scale sfcws treating different strengths of swine wastewater on the other hand the swine wastewater can be used for recovering valuable products resources such as fertilizers and energy 21 22 resource recovery from wastewater could offset the construction and maintain costs of cws and improve sustainability of cws in the field engineering application 22

the r foundation vienna austria https cran r project org web packages corrplot vignettes corrplot intro html a rarefaction analysis based on mothur v 1 21 1 software was conducted to reveal the community richness sobs and chao1 evenness ace diversity shannon and simpson and coverage coverage diversity indices 30 non metric multidimensional scaling nmds and adonis anosim analysis based on the bray curtis matrix were applied to estimate the β diversity matrix and evaluate the dissimilarities between epiphyton and bacterioplankton respectively 19 30 the wilcoxon rank sum test was utilized to assess the contributions of these two samples by performing fisher s exact test with multiple bonferroni correction p 0 01 nominal coverage of 99 using stamp software 31 3 results and discussion 3 1 abundances of total bacteria and denitrifying genes total bacterial abundance was quantified based on the copy number of 16s rrna and the nirk and nirs genes were most frequently adopted as gene markers to evaluate the denitrifying bacteria their presence are critical to the denitrification pathway since they encode the nitrite reductase 29 32 the abundances of 16s rrna and denitrifying genes were significantly higher in epiphyton than bacterioplankton fig 1 the average abundance of 16s rrna of epiphyton 7 4 107 2 2 108 copies ng dna outnumbered bacterioplankton 3 0 106 4 6 106 copies ng dna p 0 01 t test this finding may suggest that epiphyton was much more important in n conversion than bacterioplankton körner et al 33 observed that the abundances of denitrifiers in epiphyton from six submerged macrophytes 8 7 107 1 107 mpn g plant dw were much higher than those in water 9 4 104 7 104 mpn ml extensive denitrification activity existed in the epiphytic biofilm of submerged plants 34 and the denitrification level in epiphytic microbial communities was comparable with those observed in sediments i e 0 21 7 0 and 4 7 mg n h m2 in epiphytic communities and sediments respectively 35 in many wetland systems treating high strength wastewater the epiphytic bacteria displayed obvious n transformation functions 36 37 and played a major role in determining the proliferation of bacterial communities and the contaminant removal process 38 in the present study the average abundance of the nirk gene was approximately 3 4 orders of magnitude higher in epiphyton 1 6 107 4 5 107 copies ng dna than in bacterioplankton 2 3 103 1 5 104 copies ng dna p 0 01 t test the abundance of nirs in epiphyton 2 3 103 3 6 104 copies ng dna was also higher than those observed in bacterioplankton 1 5 103 3 2 104 copies ng dna p 0 01 t test the nirs and nirk genes were used to reveal the abundance of denitrifying microorganism denitrification capacity is usually associated with the abundance of denitrifying genes and the abundance of these functional genes were previously investigated to elaborate n transformation mechanisms in cw 16 the nitrite reductase encoded by nirk and nirs denitrifying genes can convert nitrite to no or n2o and thereby contribute to n removal 4 5 18 therefore increasing abundance of the nirk and nirs promoted by the higher n supply may help the removal of n in cws 4 5 18 20 the epiphyton containing higher abundance of 16s rrna and denitrifying genes than bacterioplankton can be briefly explained as follows i macrophytes can offer a large number of biological active attachment surfaces roots and stems for both nitrifiers and denitrifiers growth 9 ii macrophytes also supply photosynthetic o2 and organic carbon for the epiphytic biofilms 17 compared with artificial plants in cws submerged plants perform better total n removal and it can be partially ascribed to the synergistic interactions of submerged macrophyte biofilm system 17 on the other hand 16s rrna and denitrifying genes abundance in epiphyton and bacterioplankton were higher in h than l and m treatments which may be attributed to the nutrient contents of swine wastewater 17 39 the abundance of denitrifiers was higher in pools with higher n 40 an early study demonstrated that the denitrifying capacity of epiphyton was about a hundred times higher in high nutrient loadings than low nutrient levels 35 more nutrients and organics in high strength swine wastewater can provide enough carbon sources for heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria 3 2 diversity and structure of bacterial communities the α diversity indices including sobs chao1 ace shannon simpson and coverage index were calculated for bacterioplankton and epiphyton from cws with different wastewater loadings table 2 and fig s1 the otu numbers of bacterioplankton and epiphyton ranged from 698 to 1259 and from 674 to 890 respectively the shannon s diversity index of the bacterioplankton and epiphyton were 3 10 4 70 and 3 81 4 67 respectively significant differences of α diversity i e chao1 and ace indices were obtained between bacterioplankton and epiphyton p 0 01 t test indicating that the α diversity of the bacterioplankton was higher than that of epiphyton although the genera shared by epiphyton and bacterioplankton reached 71 8 a marked divergence in these two assemblages among different wastewater loadings was also reflected by the anosim test r2 0 9153 p 0 001 in addition the nmds ordination based on bray curtis matrix indicated that the bacterioplankton samples were clearly separated from the epiphyton samples stress 0 082 figs 2 and s2 this indicated the fact that different habitat shaped the community structure of epiphyton and bacterioplankton the difference in taxonomic units between epiphyton and bacterioplankton was defined by the wilcoxon rank sum test using the stamp software at the genus level fig s3 previous studies have also found that there exhibited distinct differences of genus between planktonic bacteria and epibiotic bacterial communities attached to potamogeton crispus and wolffia australiana in freshwater lakes 25 37 38 the differentiation of microbial community structure between epiphyton and bacterioplankton may be ascribed to the following reasons firstly the plants were able to recruit bacteria from ambient air soil water and other sources for selective colonization 41 the plant dwelling bacterial community was also shown to be somewhat host specific 12 since microbes were not passive inhabitants and could interact with the host plants 42 secondly the composition of epiphytic biofilms may be also affected by allelopathic effects of aquatic plants 43 44 thirdly it is noteworthy to mention that biofilm formation on attached surfaces can be adapted internally to the prevailing environmental conditions by its inhabitants 7 furthermore the α diversity of both habitats in high strength wastewater was slightly higher than that of low strength samples table 2 suggesting n strength participated in shaping the epiphyton and bacterioplankton 17 3 3 dominant species in epiphyton and bacterioplankton the classification of the sequences at the phylum level is shown in fig 3 the bacterial otus belonged to 53 different phyla and 940 genera on a 97 similarity level overall all the epiphyton samples were dominated by proteobacteria bacteroidetes cyanobacteria and actinobacteria while proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes and patescibacteria dominated the bacterioplankton proteobacteria as the most dominant phyla accounted for more than 51 5 maximum 79 9 in epiphyton and ranged from 34 1 to 72 4 in bacterioplankton proteobacteria possessing bacterial lipopolysaccharides located on its outer surface as the major components was easy to attach to the surface of the carriers 45 and it was also observed to be the most abundant in epiphytic and planktonic bacteria in freshwater environments 37 38 46 the relative abundance of phylum and genera varied significantly depending on the n concentration in the swine wastewater as elevating strength of swine wastewater the relative abundance of phylum bacteroidetes and firmicutes in both bacterioplankton and epiphyton varied significantly the major phyla namely actinobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes were commonly observed in natural aquatic environments 47 and were the dominant phyla in the m aquaticum wetlands 19 40 zhou et al 48 also reported that because of their thick cell wall structures proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes became dominant communities in harsh environmental conditions firmicutes was able to survive under toxic environments and anaerobic conditions and could use nitrate for denitrification 49 concerning the genus level figs 4 and s4 epiphyton was dominated by pseudomonas serratia and flavobacterium while in bacterioplankton the genus c39 limnohabitans polynucleobacter and flavobacterium were the dominant species pseudomonas within phylum proteobacteria dominated in epiphyton 11 6 33 5 has flagella to improve its mobility and adhesion capacity and they could produce a large number of extracellular polysaccharides to facilitate biofilm formation and also use nitrate as an alternate electron acceptor allowing anaerobic growth 50 the relative abundance of genus flavobacterium affiliated with phylum bacteroidetes ranged from 0 04 ck to 18 0 hw and from 5 2 ck to 14 8 hw in bacterioplankton and epiphyton respectively relevant studies have indicated that flavobacterium harboring denitrifying genes plays an important role in denitrification and has been widely detected in wastewater treatment stystems 19 51 52 3 4 correlations between microbial composition and environmental factors the impact of wastewater parameters on the abundance of denitrifying genes and microbial composition are shown in the form of a pearson s correlation matrix fig 5 the abundance of nir genes was positively correlated with nh4 n tn and tp values of wastewater in both epiphyton and bacterioplankton respectively zhang et al 16 reported that the relative abundances of denitrifying genes were correlated with the eh and no3 n concentrations do substrate type and concentration of tn nh4 n and no3 n are important limiting factors in denitrification rates 28 the nirs and nirk bearing denitrifiers showed negative relationship with eh generally negative eh can provide electron to promote nitrate reduction the eh values in this study decreased from 31 to 15 9 mv with increasing wastewater strength in the present study nirs and nirk bearing denitrifiers bacteroidetes firmicutes serratia and flavobacterium showed positive correlations with tn nh4 n and tp and a negative relationship with do during correlation analysis in the epiphyton samples nirs abundance was positively related to gammaproteobacteria and serratia while in the bacterioplankton samples nirs showed a positive relationship with bacteroidetes firmicutes chloroflexi and the genus flavobacterium however when the do concentration decreased the abundance of firmicutes increased according to some previous studies 47 48 the occurrence of firmicutes was correlated with do depletion and may contribute to the degradation of natural organic matter and the production of low molecular weight organic acids in strictly anaerobic environments these results could explain the rising trend of firmicutes abundance with an increase in the n concentrations the positive relationship among the denitrifying genes nh4 n and the gammaproteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and flavobacterium suggests the fact that these microorganisms had good denitrification capacity and also exhibited a reliable tolerance to the high nh4 n concentrations present in swine wastewater for example gammaproteobacteria are scientifically ecologically and medically important groups which can rapidly proliferate in water environments specifically when the water is rich in carbon and nutrients firmicutes have been reported to be dominant water and soil sediment layers and they are sensitive to changes in water ph do tn tp and dissolved organic carbon flavobacterium is present in a wide range of habitats from sediments to wastewater treatment plants and wetlands and can tolerate fluctuating climatic conditions e g temperature the results of this study suggest that prior knowledge of microbial community structures and their distributions of epiphytic biofilms and bacterioplankton in m aquaticum wetlands are helpful for understanding the mechanism of microbe mediated n transformation nevertheless the diversity and function of microbial communities in complex wetland systems has never been fully understood compared to the existing information on soil sediments and other aquatic environments hence further studies should investigate the relative contributions of nirk and nirs gene bearing denitrifiers on the denitrification process in the epiphytic and planktonic biofilms 3 5 practical options for resource recovery from swine wastewater swine wastewater can serve as a raw material for recovering valuable resources in the form of carbon nitrogen phosphorus and value added products thereby contributing to creating a bioeconomy in some countries swine wastewater is directly used as a fertilizer because it has high organic content due to its relatively good and balance ratio of c n p 21 some chemical engineering technologies such as precipitation adsorption and membrane reactors are recommended for nutrients recovery for swine wastewater 21 53 54 however chemical engineering technologies e g phosphorus recovery using struvite and calcium require construction costs for chemical process operating costs for chemicals and harbor potential secondary pollution risk 54 55 from an economical and environmentally friendly perspective ecological technologies including cws and biofilm techniques should be low cost and energy efficient for wastewater treatment and nutrient recovery 6 22 23 56 biofilm techniques e g phototrophic periphyton technique have been used for nutrients removal and recovery from non point source wastewater 6 for example periphyton could remove and recover more than 90 of phosphorus from artificial non point source wastewater using a micro bioreactor 57 zamalloa et al 58 used microalgae biofilm to remove phosphorus from domestic wastewater and found that about 95 of tp was recovered in the algae biomass further studies are needed to provide insights into nutrients recovery potentials and engineering parameters in field application of cws periphyton technique for swine wastewater treatment in addition because the biofilms generally comprise bacteria algae fungi and non living components synergistic interactions of bacteria and other components are also deserved to be further studied in wastewater treatment 4 conclusions the total bacteria and denitrifying genes abundance in epiphyton and bacterioplankton and microbial community structure were investigated using the high throughput sequencing different habitat epiphyton and bacterioplankton shaped different community structures the abundance of denitrifying genes nirk and nirs in the epiphytic biofilm outnumbered the bacterioplankton significantly and displayed increasing trend with nh4 n concentrations some denitrifying species such as bacteroidetes firmicutes and flavobacterium were positively correlated with the strength of swine wastewater and denitrifying genes these results demonstrate that submersed plant biofilm system may have high denitrifying potential in high n loading in cws further research should test nutrients recovery potentials of epiphytic biofilms for swine wastewater treatment and integrate different hybrid biotechnologies to recover valuable resources in order to close the loop and facilitate bio based economy

the r foundation vienna austria https cran r project org web packages corrplot vignettes corrplot intro html a rarefaction analysis based on mothur v 1 21 1 software was conducted to reveal the community richness sobs and chao1 evenness ace diversity shannon and simpson and coverage coverage diversity indices 30 non metric multidimensional scaling nmds and adonis anosim analysis based on the bray curtis matrix were applied to estimate the β diversity matrix and evaluate the dissimilarities between epiphyton and bacterioplankton respectively 19 30 the wilcoxon rank sum test was utilized to assess the contributions of these two samples by performing fisher s exact test with multiple bonferroni correction p 0 01 nominal coverage of 99 using stamp software 31 3 results and discussion 3 1 abundances of total bacteria and denitrifying genes total bacterial abundance was quantified based on the copy number of 16s rrna and the nirk and nirs genes were most frequently adopted as gene markers to evaluate the denitrifying bacteria their presence are critical to the denitrification pathway since they encode the nitrite reductase 29 32 the abundances of 16s rrna and denitrifying genes were significantly higher in epiphyton than bacterioplankton fig 1 the average abundance of 16s rrna of epiphyton 7 4 107 2 2 108 copies ng dna outnumbered bacterioplankton 3 0 106 4 6 106 copies ng dna p 0 01 t test this finding may suggest that epiphyton was much more important in n conversion than bacterioplankton körner et al 33 observed that the abundances of denitrifiers in epiphyton from six submerged macrophytes 8 7 107 1 107 mpn g plant dw were much higher than those in water 9 4 104 7 104 mpn ml extensive denitrification activity existed in the epiphytic biofilm of submerged plants 34 and the denitrification level in epiphytic microbial communities was comparable with those observed in sediments i e 0 21 7 0 and 4 7 mg n h m2 in epiphytic communities and sediments respectively 35 in many wetland systems treating high strength wastewater the epiphytic bacteria displayed obvious n transformation functions 36 37 and played a major role in determining the proliferation of bacterial communities and the contaminant removal process 38 in the present study the average abundance of the nirk gene was approximately 3 4 orders of magnitude higher in epiphyton 1 6 107 4 5 107 copies ng dna than in bacterioplankton 2 3 103 1 5 104 copies ng dna p 0 01 t test the abundance of nirs in epiphyton 2 3 103 3 6 104 copies ng dna was also higher than those observed in bacterioplankton 1 5 103 3 2 104 copies ng dna p 0 01 t test the nirs and nirk genes were used to reveal the abundance of denitrifying microorganism denitrification capacity is usually associated with the abundance of denitrifying genes and the abundance of these functional genes were previously investigated to elaborate n transformation mechanisms in cw 16 the nitrite reductase encoded by nirk and nirs denitrifying genes can convert nitrite to no or n2o and thereby contribute to n removal 4 5 18 therefore increasing abundance of the nirk and nirs promoted by the higher n supply may help the removal of n in cws 4 5 18 20 the epiphyton containing higher abundance of 16s rrna and denitrifying genes than bacterioplankton can be briefly explained as follows i macrophytes can offer a large number of biological active attachment surfaces roots and stems for both nitrifiers and denitrifiers growth 9 ii macrophytes also supply photosynthetic o2 and organic carbon for the epiphytic biofilms 17 compared with artificial plants in cws submerged plants perform better total n removal and it can be partially ascribed to the synergistic interactions of submerged macrophyte biofilm system 17 on the other hand 16s rrna and denitrifying genes abundance in epiphyton and bacterioplankton were higher in h than l and m treatments which may be attributed to the nutrient contents of swine wastewater 17 39 the abundance of denitrifiers was higher in pools with higher n 40 an early study demonstrated that the denitrifying capacity of epiphyton was about a hundred times higher in high nutrient loadings than low nutrient levels 35 more nutrients and organics in high strength swine wastewater can provide enough carbon sources for heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria 3 2 diversity and structure of bacterial communities the α diversity indices including sobs chao1 ace shannon simpson and coverage index were calculated for bacterioplankton and epiphyton from cws with different wastewater loadings table 2 and fig s1 the otu numbers of bacterioplankton and epiphyton ranged from 698 to 1259 and from 674 to 890 respectively the shannon s diversity index of the bacterioplankton and epiphyton were 3 10 4 70 and 3 81 4 67 respectively significant differences of α diversity i e chao1 and ace indices were obtained between bacterioplankton and epiphyton p 0 01 t test indicating that the α diversity of the bacterioplankton was higher than that of epiphyton although the genera shared by epiphyton and bacterioplankton reached 71 8 a marked divergence in these two assemblages among different wastewater loadings was also reflected by the anosim test r2 0 9153 p 0 001 in addition the nmds ordination based on bray curtis matrix indicated that the bacterioplankton samples were clearly separated from the epiphyton samples stress 0 082 figs 2 and s2 this indicated the fact that different habitat shaped the community structure of epiphyton and bacterioplankton the difference in taxonomic units between epiphyton and bacterioplankton was defined by the wilcoxon rank sum test using the stamp software at the genus level fig s3 previous studies have also found that there exhibited distinct differences of genus between planktonic bacteria and epibiotic bacterial communities attached to potamogeton crispus and wolffia australiana in freshwater lakes 25 37 38 the differentiation of microbial community structure between epiphyton and bacterioplankton may be ascribed to the following reasons firstly the plants were able to recruit bacteria from ambient air soil water and other sources for selective colonization 41 the plant dwelling bacterial community was also shown to be somewhat host specific 12 since microbes were not passive inhabitants and could interact with the host plants 42 secondly the composition of epiphytic biofilms may be also affected by allelopathic effects of aquatic plants 43 44 thirdly it is noteworthy to mention that biofilm formation on attached surfaces can be adapted internally to the prevailing environmental conditions by its inhabitants 7 furthermore the α diversity of both habitats in high strength wastewater was slightly higher than that of low strength samples table 2 suggesting n strength participated in shaping the epiphyton and bacterioplankton 17 3 3 dominant species in epiphyton and bacterioplankton the classification of the sequences at the phylum level is shown in fig 3 the bacterial otus belonged to 53 different phyla and 940 genera on a 97 similarity level overall all the epiphyton samples were dominated by proteobacteria bacteroidetes cyanobacteria and actinobacteria while proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes and patescibacteria dominated the bacterioplankton proteobacteria as the most dominant phyla accounted for more than 51 5 maximum 79 9 in epiphyton and ranged from 34 1 to 72 4 in bacterioplankton proteobacteria possessing bacterial lipopolysaccharides located on its outer surface as the major components was easy to attach to the surface of the carriers 45 and it was also observed to be the most abundant in epiphytic and planktonic bacteria in freshwater environments 37 38 46 the relative abundance of phylum and genera varied significantly depending on the n concentration in the swine wastewater as elevating strength of swine wastewater the relative abundance of phylum bacteroidetes and firmicutes in both bacterioplankton and epiphyton varied significantly the major phyla namely actinobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes were commonly observed in natural aquatic environments 47 and were the dominant phyla in the m aquaticum wetlands 19 40 zhou et al 48 also reported that because of their thick cell wall structures proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes became dominant communities in harsh environmental conditions firmicutes was able to survive under toxic environments and anaerobic conditions and could use nitrate for denitrification 49 concerning the genus level figs 4 and s4 epiphyton was dominated by pseudomonas serratia and flavobacterium while in bacterioplankton the genus c39 limnohabitans polynucleobacter and flavobacterium were the dominant species pseudomonas within phylum proteobacteria dominated in epiphyton 11 6 33 5 has flagella to improve its mobility and adhesion capacity and they could produce a large number of extracellular polysaccharides to facilitate biofilm formation and also use nitrate as an alternate electron acceptor allowing anaerobic growth 50 the relative abundance of genus flavobacterium affiliated with phylum bacteroidetes ranged from 0 04 ck to 18 0 hw and from 5 2 ck to 14 8 hw in bacterioplankton and epiphyton respectively relevant studies have indicated that flavobacterium harboring denitrifying genes plays an important role in denitrification and has been widely detected in wastewater treatment stystems 19 51 52 3 4 correlations between microbial composition and environmental factors the impact of wastewater parameters on the abundance of denitrifying genes and microbial composition are shown in the form of a pearson s correlation matrix fig 5 the abundance of nir genes was positively correlated with nh4 n tn and tp values of wastewater in both epiphyton and bacterioplankton respectively zhang et al 16 reported that the relative abundances of denitrifying genes were correlated with the eh and no3 n concentrations do substrate type and concentration of tn nh4 n and no3 n are important limiting factors in denitrification rates 28 the nirs and nirk bearing denitrifiers showed negative relationship with eh generally negative eh can provide electron to promote nitrate reduction the eh values in this study decreased from 31 to 15 9 mv with increasing wastewater strength in the present study nirs and nirk bearing denitrifiers bacteroidetes firmicutes serratia and flavobacterium showed positive correlations with tn nh4 n and tp and a negative relationship with do during correlation analysis in the epiphyton samples nirs abundance was positively related to gammaproteobacteria and serratia while in the bacterioplankton samples nirs showed a positive relationship with bacteroidetes firmicutes chloroflexi and the genus flavobacterium however when the do concentration decreased the abundance of firmicutes increased according to some previous studies 47 48 the occurrence of firmicutes was correlated with do depletion and may contribute to the degradation of natural organic matter and the production of low molecular weight organic acids in strictly anaerobic environments these results could explain the rising trend of firmicutes abundance with an increase in the n concentrations the positive relationship among the denitrifying genes nh4 n and the gammaproteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and flavobacterium suggests the fact that these microorganisms had good denitrification capacity and also exhibited a reliable tolerance to the high nh4 n concentrations present in swine wastewater for example gammaproteobacteria are scientifically ecologically and medically important groups which can rapidly proliferate in water environments specifically when the water is rich in carbon and nutrients firmicutes have been reported to be dominant water and soil sediment layers and they are sensitive to changes in water ph do tn tp and dissolved organic carbon flavobacterium is present in a wide range of habitats from sediments to wastewater treatment plants and wetlands and can tolerate fluctuating climatic conditions e g temperature the results of this study suggest that prior knowledge of microbial community structures and their distributions of epiphytic biofilms and bacterioplankton in m aquaticum wetlands are helpful for understanding the mechanism of microbe mediated n transformation nevertheless the diversity and function of microbial communities in complex wetland systems has never been fully understood compared to the existing information on soil sediments and other aquatic environments hence further studies should investigate the relative contributions of nirk and nirs gene bearing denitrifiers on the denitrification process in the epiphytic and planktonic biofilms 3 5 practical options for resource recovery from swine wastewater swine wastewater can serve as a raw material for recovering valuable resources in the form of carbon nitrogen phosphorus and value added products thereby contributing to creating a bioeconomy in some countries swine wastewater is directly used as a fertilizer because it has high organic content due to its relatively good and balance ratio of c n p 21 some chemical engineering technologies such as precipitation adsorption and membrane reactors are recommended for nutrients recovery for swine wastewater 21 53 54 however chemical engineering technologies e g phosphorus recovery using struvite and calcium require construction costs for chemical process operating costs for chemicals and harbor potential secondary pollution risk 54 55 from an economical and environmentally friendly perspective ecological technologies including cws and biofilm techniques should be low cost and energy efficient for wastewater treatment and nutrient recovery 6 22 23 56 biofilm techniques e g phototrophic periphyton technique have been used for nutrients removal and recovery from non point source wastewater 6 for example periphyton could remove and recover more than 90 of phosphorus from artificial non point source wastewater using a micro bioreactor 57 zamalloa et al 58 used microalgae biofilm to remove phosphorus from domestic wastewater and found that about 95 of tp was recovered in the algae biomass further studies are needed to provide insights into nutrients recovery potentials and engineering parameters in field application of cws periphyton technique for swine wastewater treatment in addition because the biofilms generally comprise bacteria algae fungi and non living components synergistic interactions of bacteria and other components are also deserved to be further studied in wastewater treatment 4 conclusions the total bacteria and denitrifying genes abundance in epiphyton and bacterioplankton and microbial community structure were investigated using the high throughput sequencing different habitat epiphyton and bacterioplankton shaped different community structures the abundance of denitrifying genes nirk and nirs in the epiphytic biofilm outnumbered the bacterioplankton significantly and displayed increasing trend with nh4 n concentrations some denitrifying species such as bacteroidetes firmicutes and flavobacterium were positively correlated with the strength of swine wastewater and denitrifying genes these results demonstrate that submersed plant biofilm system may have high denitrifying potential in high n loading in cws further research should test nutrients recovery potentials of epiphytic biofilms for swine wastewater treatment and integrate different hybrid biotechnologies to recover valuable resources in order to close the loop and facilitate bio based economy

13916,developing an effective interface interaction between photoanode and electrolyte is crucial for achieving superior photocatalytic fuel cell pfc performance in this aspect the contribution of the medium or electrolyte properties in the pfc system such as dye concentration ionic nature and active radicals play a decisive role herein we constructed a pfc with zno loaded nickel foam zno ni photoanode to study the influence of initial dye concentration ph and supporting electrolytes of different polyatomic anions on the pfc performance the optimum initial dye concentration and ph for the pfc with reactive red 120 as organic pollutants were found to be 30 mg l 1 and 7 5 respectively the pfc performance can be synergistically enhanced by the addition of three types of polyatomic anions na3po4 na2so4 and nano3 as supporting electrolytes in turn po4 3 had the greatest influence on the reduction of internal resistance highest short circuit current jsc which corresponded to the conductivity of dye solution eventually the higher charge of polyatomic ions could contribute to higher energy conversion efficiency in pfc nonetheless so4 2 anions favoured the cleavage of aromatic compounds by the advantage of recycling between so4 2 and so4 through hole scavenging activity comprehensively our findings provided new insight into the selection of supporting electrolyte as well as the proposed mechanism of active radicals involved in pfc additionally the zno ni photoanode demonstrated its excellent recyclability as it retained high pfc performance after five consecutive runs keywords photocatalytic fuel cell pfc degradation conductivity polyatomic ions electrolytes 1 introduction water pollution has reached an alarming stage with the rapid growth of urbanization and industrialization according to sustainable development goals sdg environmental degradation and clean energy are two of the major global challenges hence the elimination of hazardous contaminants and producing renewable energy sources or conversion of energy from a sustainable system are necessary fuel cell a potential candidate to convert chemical energy into electrical energy through a pollutant free way is promising to address those challenges 1 among the fuel cell technologies photocatalytic fuel cell pfc which merges the technologies of photoelectrocatalysis solar cells and fuel cells has become one of the research hotspots by effectively perform wastewater treatment and electricity generation synchronously 2 6 photoanode can be considered as the main component in the pfc system because it is the initiator for the cell operation in most pfcs studies tio2 is the most commonly employed semiconductor by virtue of its excellent catalytic activity and high chemical stability 7 9 although tio2 photoanode shows high performance in pfc system it is only limited in the uv region 10 11 hence a variety of semiconductors are employed as alternative materials for pfc applications extensively recently multitudinous photoanode composed of different photocatalysts such as bismuth oxychloride biocl 12 14 bismuth oxyiodide bioi 15 silver chloride agcl 16 cadmium sulfide cds 17 tungsten trioxide wo3 18 19 bismuth vanadate bivo4 5 20 and z scheme structured ag3po4 g c3n4 21 have been studied among the photoanode materials zno was found to be a promising photocatalyst due to its ease of availability cost effective and high photocatalytic activity 22 23 specifically the performance of pfc is not only strongly dependent on the employed photoanode materials but also on the operating parameters in pfc the fuel cell voltage axis was similar to the efficiency axis where the voltage output is directly proportional to the amount of organic pollutant consumed thus previous studies have reported that organic pollutants played an important role as a sacrificial agent in the pfc system 22 24 moreover the redox reaction happens in the pfc also depends on the ph value of the fuel 12 25 hence the study on the effect of ph in pfc is essential as it can provide useful information for further optimization in wastewater treatment as well as electricity generation generally it was believed that the coexisted ions present in industrial wastewater are beneficial to enhance the degradation of dye 26 hence intense research interest has been devoted to determine the influence of supporting electrolytes on the performance of pfc among the supporting electrolytes sodium sulfate na2so4 is the most broadly used supporting electrolyte due to its stable chemical properties 5 27 xie and ouyang 19 reported that a pmax of 27 8 μw cm 2 was obtained by adding 0 2 m of na2so4 in the pfc which was 6 8 times higher than the pfc without supporting electrolyte besides that a comparative study on neutral na2so4 and alkaline potassium hydroxide koh supporting electrolyte was reported by li et al 28 who found that the pfc performance can be significantly improved by koh previously several researchers also reported that the degradation efficiency could be enhanced by adding magnesium sulfate mgso4 and sodium chloride nacl 29 30 to the best of our knowledge the comparative study of pfc efficiency on the influence of different types of polyatomic sodium supporting electrolytes such as sodium nitrate nano3 sodium sulfate na2so4 and sodium phosphate na3po4 have not yet been reported elsewhere up to date the understanding of the influence of different supporting electrolytes is crucial for the acceleration of the pfc reaction in our previous study zno loaded carbon plate has been studied in a pfc with 10 mg l 1 of reactive red 120 rr120 and free of supporting electrolyte 23 however the decolourization efficiency only reached about 89 86 after 8 h hence the present work aims to fabricate immobilized zno on nickel foam as photoanode and to investigate the effect of some operating parameters including initial dye concentration ph and different supporting electrolytes on the decolourization efficiency on rr120 and power output of the pfc 2 experimental 2 1 materials and chemicals commercial zno powder was supplied by hmbg chemicals and applied as the photocatalyst while nickel foam dimension 40 mm x 40 mm thickness 2 mm was employed as the substrate in this study an organic pollutant azo dye rr120 c44h30cl2n14o20s6 was purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa ethanol c2h5oh 95 purity was supplied by hmbg chemicals nano3 na2so4 na3po4 hmbg chemicals were used as the supporting electrolytes all the chemicals and deionized water were used as received and prepared the standard solutions respectively 2 2 fabrication and characterization of photoanode the nickel foam was ultrasonically pre cleaned with an ethanol solution rinsed with deionized water then dried in the oven at 60 c 2 h at the same time 1 0 g of zno powder was dispersed in 30 ml deionized water under ultrasonication next the dried clean nickel foam was then ultrasonically dipped in the zno sol for 1 h after that the immobilized zno ni foam was taken out and dried in hot oven at 60 c for 4 h followed by heat attachment at 300 c for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 c min 1 the zno ni photoanode was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd from bruker model d2 phaser under cu kα radiation λ 1 54184 å with a scan rate of 0 5 s step scan range 2θ 20 90 the band gap of the zno was determined by uv vis spectrometer model cary 100 agilent while the morphology of the zno ni photoanode was characterized by using scanning electron microscopy sem from jeol model jsm 6460la equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx 2 3 pfc configuration the setup of zno ni pfc is shown in fig sm 1 the zno ni photoanode 4 cm 4 cm and platinum loaded carbon pt c cathode were connected through an external circuit with 1 kω resistance in a 1 l pyrex glass cell which filled with 500 ml of rr120 the reactor was irradiated by ultraviolet a uva lamps osram dulux 36 w 78 2g11 315 400 nm and the distance between the lamp and the photoanode was 100 mm sampling of the rr120 was performed every hour and its concentration was determined by using the photometric method with a uv vis spectrophotometer me uv1300pc mesulab china a series of standard rr120 solutions 0 15 30 45 60 mg l 1 were prepared for the calibration purpose after that a photometric mode was used to measure the absorbance of all standard rr120 solutions at a maximum wavelength of 522 nm the absorbance of the standard solutions obeyed the beer lambert law and a quantitative calibration curve was produced as a reference to determine the concentration of the rr120 the colour removal efficiency was calculated using eq 1 1 colour removal efficiency c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 is the initial concentration and ct is the concentration at reaction time t in hours the voltage output was recorded by using a data logger midi logger gl240 graphtec and the current voltage characteristic measurement details of the pfc system were reported in supplementary data each study was repeated three times the results were averaged and the measure of variability of the experiments was presented by using standard deviation error bars the used photoanode was exposed under sunlight for self cleaning after each cycle 3 results and discussion 3 1 materials characterization the xrd patterns of ni foam zno and zno loaded ni foam zno ni photoanode are presented in fig 1 in fig 1b the three sharp diffraction peaks attributed to ni foam icsd 98 009 0200 were detected at 2θ values of 44 13 51 45 and 76 00 corresponding to the 111 002 and 022 lattice plane respectively all diffraction peaks in fig 1d could be indexed as hexagonal wurtzite structure of zno icsd 98 006 5188 and it was successfully immobilized on ni foam as shown in fig 1e all the dominant diffraction peaks of zno ni photoanode are presented in good agreements with ni foam and zno to clarify the photoresponsive of the zno towards the uva light irradiation the band gap of zno was determined by uv vis spectrometer fig sm 2 shows the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra uv drs and the tauc plot of the zno used in this study it was noted that the range of the most intense light adsorption of the zno was observed in wavelengths less than 375 nm fig sm 2a the result indicated that the zno was photoresponded to the uva light source λ 315 400 nm in this study 31 specifically the light absorption characteristic was attributed to the band gap of the zno 3 22 ev which measured from the tauc plot fig sm 2b according to smijs and pavel 32 zno with band gap of 3 22 ev has belonged to crystalline hexagonal wurtzite zno which also affirmed the xrd analysis from the sem images of ni foam fig 2 a and c it could be observed that the porous structure of ni foam has an average strut diameter of 72 8 μm with a rough surface after immobilization of zno particles fig 2b and d the surface of the ni foam was fully covered by the zno particles as attested in the edx analysis results in fig sm 3 the severe agglomerations of zno yellow circles from the morphological observation might be attributed to the bumpy surface of ni foam red circles fig 2e shows the morphology of the zno ni photoanode at 20 000x magnification generally the surface of ni foam was fully covered by the submicron sized zno particles with an average particle size of 0 42 μm 3 2 effect of initial dye concentration the influence of initial dye concentration 0 10 20 30 and 40 mg l 1 on the performance of aerated pfc was evaluated fig 3 a shows the colour removal efficiency of pfc over 6 h of irradiation time under different initial dye concentrations the results revealed that there were almost complete decolourizations observed for all the initial dye concentration except for 40 mg l 1 of rr120 it is worth noting that the colour removal efficiency trend of 40 mg l 1 kept increasing over irradiation time the possible explanation of this phenomenon was more photons were able to reach the surface of the photoanode as the dye concentration decreased over irradiation time hence more active sites were available to degrade the remaining dye molecules in the pfc when the concentration of dye decreased over reaction time meanwhile fig 3b demonstrates the kinetic photocatalytic degradation of rr120 under different initial dye concentration by using the langmuir hinshelwood l h kinetic model as tabulated in fig 3b the increasing of dye concentrations was inversely proportional to the pseudo first order rate constant the pfc with 10 mg l 1 of rr120 achieved the highest degradation rate with k 0 7742 h 1 this could be assigned to the higher production of photogenerated electron hole pairs as more photons were able to reach the surface of the photoanode consequently the higher hydroxyl radicals oh were produced as the holes reacted with water molecules or hydroxide ions and accelerated the degradation of rr120 33 34 however the rate constant decreased as the initial dye concentration increased this can be explained by the fact that the light transmittance of the solution decreased at a higher initial dye concentration resulting in the reduction of the amount and path length of the photons reaching the photoanode 35 37 furthermore there were more dye molecules absorbed on the surface of photoanode leading to a decrease in the generation of oh and the probability of the oh reacting with the dye molecules 8 38 39 besides a high amount of complexing dye molecules was also thought to have a competing impact on the rate of transportation and the reaction of hydrogen ion h to the cathode hence fewer active sites available in the pfc and consequently reduced the degradation rate fig 3c demonstrates the power density curves of different initial dye concentrations the results revealed that the voltage could be produced even in the absence of dye 0 mg l 1 because water splitting could occur in the pfc 24 in this case water molecules were oxidized into oxygen by the photogenerated holes while electrons were transferred through external circuit towards the cathode 23 40 in the presence of oxygen hydroxide ions were produced from the interaction of water molecules with oxygen and electrons however the produced oxygen and hydroxide ions will tend to interact with hydrogen ions to regenerate water molecules hence the spontaneous power output can be generated when there was only water in the pfc after all it has a lower power output as compared in the presence of dye this result revealed that rr120 played the role as a sacrificial agent which ease for oxidation as compared to water 12 thus dye was able to enhance the separation of electron hole at photoanode and more electrons were channelled to the pt c cathode as the initial dye concentration was increased from 0 to 30 mg l 1 the voc 347 0000 2 6458 384 3333 3 5119 mv jsc 0 0028 0 0001 0 0090 0 0004 ma cm 2 and pmax 0 3193 0 0098 0 8571 0 0118 μw cm 2 were enhanced due to the higher rate of oxidation process required for degrading more dye molecules in this case 30 mg l 1 has the highest electricity performance due to the efficient hole scavenging in the pfc however the power output decreased when the initial dye concentration increased up to 40 mg l 1 in essence as the dye concentration increased the photons were either absorbed or refracted by the dye molecules 38 as a result the photoexcitation of the electrons in the photoanode was limited and led to inferior electricity generation as compared to 30 mg l 1 furthermore the lower spontaneous flow of electrons to the cathode side in 40 mg l 1 might reduce the production of superoxide radicals o2 these radicals belong to reactive oxygen species ros which are capable to deteriorate various types of organic compounds efficiently 41 42 therefore the colour removal rate and efficiency in pfc with 40 mg l 1 were relatively low as compared to the pfc with 30 mg l 1 a similar finding was reported by lee et al 22 who investigated the degradation of reactive green 19 in an aerated single chambered pfc 3 3 effect of solution ph in pfc study the effect of ph has to be elucidated as the wastewaters usually presented in a wide range of ph values 43 to investigate the influence of ph on the pfc performance the study was performed in the ph range of 4 5 12 8 with dye concentration of 20 mg l 1 fig 4 a shows the colour removal efficiency of different ph in the pfc and the results indicated that the increase of ph from 4 5 7 5 led to an increase in the decolourization of dye from 85 92 4 05 to 99 00 0 96 after 6 h of uva irradiation time however the colour removal efficiency decreased from 99 00 0 96 to 84 43 3 32 when further increased the ph from 7 5 12 8 fig 4b and c shows ph 7 5 has the highest pseudo first order rate constant k 0 7187 h 1 jsc 0 0088 ma cm 2 voc 395 6667 47 6970 mv and pmax 0 9666 0 0244 μw cm 2 the adsorption of dye on the photoanode was one of the crucial factors which affected by the zero point charge ph phzpc of the photocatalyst and the ionic nature of the dye below the phzpc of zno 9 0 0 3 the surface charge of zno was positive while rr120 which has six sulfonic groups of negative ions at ph 7 37 at neutral condition with ph 7 5 the electrostatic attraction between the positive charge of zno and negative charge of the rr120 could facilitate the strong adsorption of rr120 on zno and result in effective electron hole pair separation 35 subsequently the spontaneous flow of electrons to pt c cathode could yield o2 which assisted in the oxidation of rr120 thus the highest decolourization rate of rr120 was observed at neutral condition at ph 7 5 the lowest decolourization rate and efficiency of rr120 at low ph ph 4 5 might be attributed to the corrosion of zno where the dissolution of zn2 happens eq 2 44 in acidic conditions zno could react with acid to produce the corresponding salt hence restricted the photocatalytic properties of zno 38 43 moreover the poorest electricity performance of ph 4 5 fig 4c with voc 275 6667 4 0415 mv jsc 0 0077 0 0003 ma cm 2 and pmax 0 6092 0 1099 μw cm 2 indicated that the high recombination rate of electron hole pairs of the photoanode happened in the acidic condition by virtue of less hydroxyl group in the dye solution it is believed that oh plays a major role in the fission of the n n conjugated system in azo dye at lower ph conditions a high amount of h ions tend to cooperate with azo linkage thus diminishing the azo group electron densities 45 46 consequently this may reduce the hydroxyl reactivity of oh and directly affect the power output and decolourization efficiency of the pfc 47 as can be seen from fig 4b the pseudo first order rate constants for ph 12 8 achieved an almost similar value k 0 3304 h 1 with ph 4 5 k 0 3293 h 1 this phenomenon may be assigned to the dissolution of zno to form complexes in alkaline medium such as zn oh 4 2 eq 3 when the ph was too high the negatively charged zno would repel rr120 anions and hinder the oxidation of dye at the photoanode 25 in addition the high concentration of oh ions could ensure the production of oh at high ph conditions 28 however the depletion of protons might happen in highly alkaline condition and cathodic oxygen reduction reaction orr was hindered 2 zno 2h zn2 h2o 3 zno 2oh h2o zn oh 4 2 3 4 effect of supporting electrolytes 3 4 1 performance of pfc wastewater discharged from the textile industries commonly contains various anions such as no3 so4 2 po4 3 and so on which can greatly influence the photocatalytic decolourization of dye 26 48 in this study the pfcs with the addition of different supporting electrolytes 0 1 m of nano3 na2so4 and na3po4 were carried out using 20 mg l 1 of rr120 and compared with the pfc without supporting electrolyte fig 5 a indicates the pfc without supporting electrolyte exhibited the lowest jsc 0 0077 0 0004 ma cm 2 voc 374 6667 1 5275 mv and pmax 0 7277 0 0036 μw cm 2 after the addition of nano3 na2so4 and na3po4 as supporting electrolytes respectively there was a significant increase in voc jsc and pmax this could be attributed to the enhancement of ion mobility with the presence of supporting electrolytes in pfc consequently the reduction of internal resistance could lead to the enhancement of the potential difference between the electrodes and the transportation of electrons to the pt c cathode 49 therefore the highest jsc 0 0788 0 0033 ma cm 2 voc 455 0000 28 2130 mv and pmax 9 1779 0 5142 μw cm 2 were observed in the pfc with na3po4 followed by na2so4 and nano3 this result was supported by the conductivity of rr120 as shown in fig 5b the conductivity of rr120 supported by different supporting electrolytes depleted in the following order na3po4 na2so4 nano3 no supporting electrolyte among the polyatomic ions po4 3 with triple negative charge possessed the highest conductivity followed by so4 2 double negative charge and no3 single negative charge this phenomenon indicated that po4 3 could carry more electrons through the dye therefore it was able to reduce internal resistance and resulted in the highest jsc 47 fig 5c shows the colour removal efficiency with different supporting electrolytes within 3 h of the reaction with illumination of light a total colour removal of 81 27 1 29 was achieved by the pfc without supporting electrolyte however a total dye decolourization of 98 44 1 03 94 65 0 81 88 70 0 79 was achieved by the pfcs supported by na3po4 na2so4 and nano3 respectively fig 5d shows the rate constant of each system according to langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model the rate constant of different supporting electrolytes depleted in the following order na3po4 k 1 2307 h 1 na2so4 k 0 9852 h 1 nano3 k 0 8203 h 1 no supporting electrolyte k 0 6638 h 1 as mentioned above the spontaneous flow of electrons was enhanced in the presence of supporting electrolyte this could lead to a higher cathodic orr and produce more powerful oxidizing holes in the valence band of zno therefore a significant enhancement in decolourization efficiency and rate were observed after the addition of supporting electrolyte this phenomenon also indicated that the enrichment of radicals in the pfc could be achieved with the presence of supporting electrolyte ions 50 the mechanism of different supporting electrolytes was further discussed hereinafter 3 4 2 uv vis spectra analysis fig 6 shows the uv vis absorption spectra recorded at different supporting electrolytes in the pfc the uv vis spectra of untreated rr120 dye solutions are characterized by doublet bands in the visible range around 522 nm and 545 nm azo bonds and by two bands in the uv region around 248 nm benzene rings and 302 nm naphthalene ring 23 it can be clearly seen that all the absorbance bands decreased rapidly over irradiation time in pfc without supporting electrolyte fig 6a at 1 h the absorbance of pfc with 0 1 m of nano3 around 522 nm and 545 nm decreased in a higher ratio 1 2 65 as compared to pfc without supporting electrolyte 1 1 79 fig 6b this phenomenon suggests that the cleavage of azo bonds in rr120 could be accelerated in the presence of no3 this acceleration of decolourization may be attributed to the direct or indirect formation of oh as shown in the following equations 51 52 4 no3 hv no2 o 5 o h2o oh oh 6 no3 hv h2o no2 oh oh 7 zno h vb oh ads zno oh however there might be a drawback by using nano3 in pfc due to the adsorption of photons by the supporting electrolyte itself thus there would be fewer photons adsorbed by the surface of the photoanode and led to a reduction in electricity generation when so4 2 was introduced to rr120 a higher ratio of decrement at 1 h 1 3 53 was observed in the visible region fig 6c remarkably the breakdown of benzene 1 1 62 and naphthalene rings 1 2 31 at 1 h in this case was obviously higher than the others these significant differences indicated that the separation of electron hole pairs can be retained by so4 2 while so4 can be produced which is a very strong oxidant redox potential 2 6 v that can promote the degradation of dye 26 8 so4 2 h vb so4 9 so4 h2o so4 2 oh h the overall equation of eq 8 and 9 indicated that the so4 2 could be recycled in the form of so4 2 so4 so4 2 without addition of extra so4 2 53 therefore na2so4 is extensively used for the application of pfc 39 54 55 it is observed that there was a hypsochromic shift blue shift of the maximum absorbance band in the initial dye solution after the addition of na3po4 fig 6d the blue shift was observed from 522 nm and 545 nm λmax to shorter wavelengths of 485 nm and 515 nm respectively this phenomenon can be elucidated by the deprotonation of the dye molecule at a highly alkaline condition 56 the ph value of the initial dye solution was measured to be 12 8 which indicated that phosphate presented as po4 3 in the initial condition 57 after 1 h the maximum absorbance band was bathochromic shifted red shift to the original maximum wavelength position this might be attributed to the protonation from the water ionization process of the photogenerated holes in this case there was almost complete decomposition of rr120 took place in the pfc the highly efficient of decolourization might be attributed to the predominant species of po4 3 which might react with water molecules to produce hydroxide ions eq 10 thus the formation of oh can be ensured eq 7 10 po4 3 h2o hpo4 2 oh at the same time po4 3 can be strongly bound to the photoanode surface thus leads to a strong interaction between zno and rr120 58 59 furthermore there were some phosphates might be trapped by zinc ions to form zn3 po4 2 as zno cannot withstand in this harsh chemical environment 60 62 in this case zn3 po4 2 might act as a catalyst which enhanced the degradation of dye 63 64 3 4 3 energy conversion efficiency and reusability the main parameters of pfc based on different supporting electrolytes were evaluated under same light irradiation condition table 1 almost identical value of fill factor ff 25 28 was obtained and the energy conversion efficiency η was calculated using eq 11 11 η jsc x voc x ff x 100 iinc where iinc is the incident light intensity expressed in w cm 2 it can be seen that the jsc and voc are the crucial factors that affect the energy conversion efficiency of pfc overall the energy conversion efficiencies of pfcs with supporting electrolytes were higher than the pfc without supporting electrolytes the occurrence could be due to the high charge mobility high jsc as the internal resistance reduced from 3000 to 400 ω after the addition of supporting electrolytes this also could be due to the low recombination rate high voc and great interfacial contact between the photoelectrodes and rr120 in the pfcs with supporting electrolytes 65 as aforementioned in methodology the used zno ni photoanode was exposed under sunlight after each cycle and then reused in the next cycle to evaluate the reusability of zno ni photoanode pfc na3po4 and 20 mg l 1 of rr120 was carried out for five cyclic runs which also indicated that the photoanode had been immersed in the dye for total time up to 30 h table sm 1 shows the colour removal efficiency was still sustained at 96 550 99 176 five consecutive cycles with a low standard deviation of pmax 8 8893 0 5807 μw cm 2 this phenomenon revealed that zno ni photoanode exhibited good stability as there was no appreciable loss even at the fifth cycle meanwhile it can be noticed that only a slight reduction in the intensity of xrd peaks observed in the zno but there was virtually unchanged in its morphology even after five cycles fig 7 additionally fig 8 shows the transient photocurrent responses of the pfc with light on off cycles in five consecutive cycles obviously the proposed pfc showed a good reproducible photocurrent generation separation efficiency of photogenerated electron hole pairs which also revealed that the zno ni photoanode had a good photoresponse to the uva light as discussed in section 3 1 subsequently it also reflected that the zno ni photoanode exhibited excellent photostability property under uva light illumination as the photocurrent densities had no significant decay in the continuous light cycling test lastly it can be noticed that there were only small differences in the photocurrent densities even after five cycles therefore it can be concluded that the highly efficient zno ni photoanode was reusable after self cleaning under sunlight exposure table 2 presents the comparison of the performance of current study with the previous studies the results showed that the colour removal efficiency achieved in this study was higher than most of the listed pfcs by comparing the pfcs operated within 6 h it was found that the colour removal efficiency of zno ni foam was higher than zno c felt 25 this phenomenon might be attributed to the difference of fabrication method and substrate used to prepare the photoanode meanwhile it was noted that the degradation rate k 0 7742 h 1 of pfc in this study was the highest as compared with our previous study k 0 2769 h 1 23 and the others the improved performance might be attributed to the increased number of zno which distributed on a higher surface area due to the three dimensional porous structure of ni foam instead of the two dimensional smooth surface of carbon plate in our previous study 23 hence a larger amount of zno could be photoexcited and reacted with more dye molecules leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity of zno ni foam although same photocatalyst zno was applied in the photoanode the optimum ph value obtained from this study was different from lee et al 22 and khalik et al 25 studies this might be attributed to the different types of the dye acted as the electrolyte fuel which had different molecular structures and functional groups 4 conclusions in summary a sustainable single chambered pfc based on zno ni photoanode was successfully established to decolourize rr120 and generate electricity simultaneously the result revealed that the presence of rr120 sacrificial agent could enhance the power performance of the pfc due to fact that dye can be oxidized more easily as compared to water moreover the different initial dye concentration demonstrated that almost fully decolourization in 6 h and the highest pmax of 0 8571 0 0118 μw cm 2 could be achieved by using 30 mg l 1 of rr120 in the pfc free of supporting electrolyte besides it also can be concluded that the rr120 could be decolourized more efficiently in neutral conditions ph 7 5 moreover the presence of no3 so4 2 and po4 3 had significantly accelerated the decolourization of rr120 at the same time these polyatomic ions had led to high conductivity of rr120 and increased the jsc lower internal resistance in the pfc overall the pfc with po4 3 yielded the highest decolourization rate k 1 2307 h 1 jsc of 0 0788 0 0033 ma cm 2 and pmax of 9 1779 0 5142 μw cm 2 alternatively the pfc with so4 2 was more efficient for the cleavage of aromatic compounds in rr120 the zno ni photoanode was reusable after self cleaning under sunlight exposure finally continual studies on pfc technology are essential for

13916,developing an effective interface interaction between photoanode and electrolyte is crucial for achieving superior photocatalytic fuel cell pfc performance in this aspect the contribution of the medium or electrolyte properties in the pfc system such as dye concentration ionic nature and active radicals play a decisive role herein we constructed a pfc with zno loaded nickel foam zno ni photoanode to study the influence of initial dye concentration ph and supporting electrolytes of different polyatomic anions on the pfc performance the optimum initial dye concentration and ph for the pfc with reactive red 120 as organic pollutants were found to be 30 mg l 1 and 7 5 respectively the pfc performance can be synergistically enhanced by the addition of three types of polyatomic anions na3po4 na2so4 and nano3 as supporting electrolytes in turn po4 3 had the greatest influence on the reduction of internal resistance highest short circuit current jsc which corresponded to the conductivity of dye solution eventually the higher charge of polyatomic ions could contribute to higher energy conversion efficiency in pfc nonetheless so4 2 anions favoured the cleavage of aromatic compounds by the advantage of recycling between so4 2 and so4 through hole scavenging activity comprehensively our findings provided new insight into the selection of supporting electrolyte as well as the proposed mechanism of active radicals involved in pfc additionally the zno ni photoanode demonstrated its excellent recyclability as it retained high pfc performance after five consecutive runs keywords photocatalytic fuel cell pfc degradation conductivity polyatomic ions electrolytes 1 introduction water pollution has reached an alarming stage with the rapid growth of urbanization and industrialization according to sustainable development goals sdg environmental degradation and clean energy are two of the major global challenges hence the elimination of hazardous contaminants and producing renewable energy sources or conversion of energy from a sustainable system are necessary fuel cell a potential candidate to convert chemical energy into electrical energy through a pollutant free way is promising to address those challenges 1 among the fuel cell technologies photocatalytic fuel cell pfc which merges the technologies of photoelectrocatalysis solar cells and fuel cells has become one of the research hotspots by effectively perform wastewater treatment and electricity generation synchronously 2 6 photoanode can be considered as the main component in the pfc system because it is the initiator for the cell operation in most pfcs studies tio2 is the most commonly employed semiconductor by virtue of its excellent catalytic activity and high chemical stability 7 9 although tio2 photoanode shows high performance in pfc system it is only limited in the uv region 10 11 hence a variety of semiconductors are employed as alternative materials for pfc applications extensively recently multitudinous photoanode composed of different photocatalysts such as bismuth oxychloride biocl 12 14 bismuth oxyiodide bioi 15 silver chloride agcl 16 cadmium sulfide cds 17 tungsten trioxide wo3 18 19 bismuth vanadate bivo4 5 20 and z scheme structured ag3po4 g c3n4 21 have been studied among the photoanode materials zno was found to be a promising photocatalyst due to its ease of availability cost effective and high photocatalytic activity 22 23 specifically the performance of pfc is not only strongly dependent on the employed photoanode materials but also on the operating parameters in pfc the fuel cell voltage axis was similar to the efficiency axis where the voltage output is directly proportional to the amount of organic pollutant consumed thus previous studies have reported that organic pollutants played an important role as a sacrificial agent in the pfc system 22 24 moreover the redox reaction happens in the pfc also depends on the ph value of the fuel 12 25 hence the study on the effect of ph in pfc is essential as it can provide useful information for further optimization in wastewater treatment as well as electricity generation generally it was believed that the coexisted ions present in industrial wastewater are beneficial to enhance the degradation of dye 26 hence intense research interest has been devoted to determine the influence of supporting electrolytes on the performance of pfc among the supporting electrolytes sodium sulfate na2so4 is the most broadly used supporting electrolyte due to its stable chemical properties 5 27 xie and ouyang 19 reported that a pmax of 27 8 μw cm 2 was obtained by adding 0 2 m of na2so4 in the pfc which was 6 8 times higher than the pfc without supporting electrolyte besides that a comparative study on neutral na2so4 and alkaline potassium hydroxide koh supporting electrolyte was reported by li et al 28 who found that the pfc performance can be significantly improved by koh previously several researchers also reported that the degradation efficiency could be enhanced by adding magnesium sulfate mgso4 and sodium chloride nacl 29 30 to the best of our knowledge the comparative study of pfc efficiency on the influence of different types of polyatomic sodium supporting electrolytes such as sodium nitrate nano3 sodium sulfate na2so4 and sodium phosphate na3po4 have not yet been reported elsewhere up to date the understanding of the influence of different supporting electrolytes is crucial for the acceleration of the pfc reaction in our previous study zno loaded carbon plate has been studied in a pfc with 10 mg l 1 of reactive red 120 rr120 and free of supporting electrolyte 23 however the decolourization efficiency only reached about 89 86 after 8 h hence the present work aims to fabricate immobilized zno on nickel foam as photoanode and to investigate the effect of some operating parameters including initial dye concentration ph and different supporting electrolytes on the decolourization efficiency on rr120 and power output of the pfc 2 experimental 2 1 materials and chemicals commercial zno powder was supplied by hmbg chemicals and applied as the photocatalyst while nickel foam dimension 40 mm x 40 mm thickness 2 mm was employed as the substrate in this study an organic pollutant azo dye rr120 c44h30cl2n14o20s6 was purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa ethanol c2h5oh 95 purity was supplied by hmbg chemicals nano3 na2so4 na3po4 hmbg chemicals were used as the supporting electrolytes all the chemicals and deionized water were used as received and prepared the standard solutions respectively 2 2 fabrication and characterization of photoanode the nickel foam was ultrasonically pre cleaned with an ethanol solution rinsed with deionized water then dried in the oven at 60 c 2 h at the same time 1 0 g of zno powder was dispersed in 30 ml deionized water under ultrasonication next the dried clean nickel foam was then ultrasonically dipped in the zno sol for 1 h after that the immobilized zno ni foam was taken out and dried in hot oven at 60 c for 4 h followed by heat attachment at 300 c for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 c min 1 the zno ni photoanode was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd from bruker model d2 phaser under cu kα radiation λ 1 54184 å with a scan rate of 0 5 s step scan range 2θ 20 90 the band gap of the zno was determined by uv vis spectrometer model cary 100 agilent while the morphology of the zno ni photoanode was characterized by using scanning electron microscopy sem from jeol model jsm 6460la equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx 2 3 pfc configuration the setup of zno ni pfc is shown in fig sm 1 the zno ni photoanode 4 cm 4 cm and platinum loaded carbon pt c cathode were connected through an external circuit with 1 kω resistance in a 1 l pyrex glass cell which filled with 500 ml of rr120 the reactor was irradiated by ultraviolet a uva lamps osram dulux 36 w 78 2g11 315 400 nm and the distance between the lamp and the photoanode was 100 mm sampling of the rr120 was performed every hour and its concentration was determined by using the photometric method with a uv vis spectrophotometer me uv1300pc mesulab china a series of standard rr120 solutions 0 15 30 45 60 mg l 1 were prepared for the calibration purpose after that a photometric mode was used to measure the absorbance of all standard rr120 solutions at a maximum wavelength of 522 nm the absorbance of the standard solutions obeyed the beer lambert law and a quantitative calibration curve was produced as a reference to determine the concentration of the rr120 the colour removal efficiency was calculated using eq 1 1 colour removal efficiency c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 is the initial concentration and ct is the concentration at reaction time t in hours the voltage output was recorded by using a data logger midi logger gl240 graphtec and the current voltage characteristic measurement details of the pfc system were reported in supplementary data each study was repeated three times the results were averaged and the measure of variability of the experiments was presented by using standard deviation error bars the used photoanode was exposed under sunlight for self cleaning after each cycle 3 results and discussion 3 1 materials characterization the xrd patterns of ni foam zno and zno loaded ni foam zno ni photoanode are presented in fig 1 in fig 1b the three sharp diffraction peaks attributed to ni foam icsd 98 009 0200 were detected at 2θ values of 44 13 51 45 and 76 00 corresponding to the 111 002 and 022 lattice plane respectively all diffraction peaks in fig 1d could be indexed as hexagonal wurtzite structure of zno icsd 98 006 5188 and it was successfully immobilized on ni foam as shown in fig 1e all the dominant diffraction peaks of zno ni photoanode are presented in good agreements with ni foam and zno to clarify the photoresponsive of the zno towards the uva light irradiation the band gap of zno was determined by uv vis spectrometer fig sm 2 shows the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra uv drs and the tauc plot of the zno used in this study it was noted that the range of the most intense light adsorption of the zno was observed in wavelengths less than 375 nm fig sm 2a the result indicated that the zno was photoresponded to the uva light source λ 315 400 nm in this study 31 specifically the light absorption characteristic was attributed to the band gap of the zno 3 22 ev which measured from the tauc plot fig sm 2b according to smijs and pavel 32 zno with band gap of 3 22 ev has belonged to crystalline hexagonal wurtzite zno which also affirmed the xrd analysis from the sem images of ni foam fig 2 a and c it could be observed that the porous structure of ni foam has an average strut diameter of 72 8 μm with a rough surface after immobilization of zno particles fig 2b and d the surface of the ni foam was fully covered by the zno particles as attested in the edx analysis results in fig sm 3 the severe agglomerations of zno yellow circles from the morphological observation might be attributed to the bumpy surface of ni foam red circles fig 2e shows the morphology of the zno ni photoanode at 20 000x magnification generally the surface of ni foam was fully covered by the submicron sized zno particles with an average particle size of 0 42 μm 3 2 effect of initial dye concentration the influence of initial dye concentration 0 10 20 30 and 40 mg l 1 on the performance of aerated pfc was evaluated fig 3 a shows the colour removal efficiency of pfc over 6 h of irradiation time under different initial dye concentrations the results revealed that there were almost complete decolourizations observed for all the initial dye concentration except for 40 mg l 1 of rr120 it is worth noting that the colour removal efficiency trend of 40 mg l 1 kept increasing over irradiation time the possible explanation of this phenomenon was more photons were able to reach the surface of the photoanode as the dye concentration decreased over irradiation time hence more active sites were available to degrade the remaining dye molecules in the pfc when the concentration of dye decreased over reaction time meanwhile fig 3b demonstrates the kinetic photocatalytic degradation of rr120 under different initial dye concentration by using the langmuir hinshelwood l h kinetic model as tabulated in fig 3b the increasing of dye concentrations was inversely proportional to the pseudo first order rate constant the pfc with 10 mg l 1 of rr120 achieved the highest degradation rate with k 0 7742 h 1 this could be assigned to the higher production of photogenerated electron hole pairs as more photons were able to reach the surface of the photoanode consequently the higher hydroxyl radicals oh were produced as the holes reacted with water molecules or hydroxide ions and accelerated the degradation of rr120 33 34 however the rate constant decreased as the initial dye concentration increased this can be explained by the fact that the light transmittance of the solution decreased at a higher initial dye concentration resulting in the reduction of the amount and path length of the photons reaching the photoanode 35 37 furthermore there were more dye molecules absorbed on the surface of photoanode leading to a decrease in the generation of oh and the probability of the oh reacting with the dye molecules 8 38 39 besides a high amount of complexing dye molecules was also thought to have a competing impact on the rate of transportation and the reaction of hydrogen ion h to the cathode hence fewer active sites available in the pfc and consequently reduced the degradation rate fig 3c demonstrates the power density curves of different initial dye concentrations the results revealed that the voltage could be produced even in the absence of dye 0 mg l 1 because water splitting could occur in the pfc 24 in this case water molecules were oxidized into oxygen by the photogenerated holes while electrons were transferred through external circuit towards the cathode 23 40 in the presence of oxygen hydroxide ions were produced from the interaction of water molecules with oxygen and electrons however the produced oxygen and hydroxide ions will tend to interact with hydrogen ions to regenerate water molecules hence the spontaneous power output can be generated when there was only water in the pfc after all it has a lower power output as compared in the presence of dye this result revealed that rr120 played the role as a sacrificial agent which ease for oxidation as compared to water 12 thus dye was able to enhance the separation of electron hole at photoanode and more electrons were channelled to the pt c cathode as the initial dye concentration was increased from 0 to 30 mg l 1 the voc 347 0000 2 6458 384 3333 3 5119 mv jsc 0 0028 0 0001 0 0090 0 0004 ma cm 2 and pmax 0 3193 0 0098 0 8571 0 0118 μw cm 2 were enhanced due to the higher rate of oxidation process required for degrading more dye molecules in this case 30 mg l 1 has the highest electricity performance due to the efficient hole scavenging in the pfc however the power output decreased when the initial dye concentration increased up to 40 mg l 1 in essence as the dye concentration increased the photons were either absorbed or refracted by the dye molecules 38 as a result the photoexcitation of the electrons in the photoanode was limited and led to inferior electricity generation as compared to 30 mg l 1 furthermore the lower spontaneous flow of electrons to the cathode side in 40 mg l 1 might reduce the production of superoxide radicals o2 these radicals belong to reactive oxygen species ros which are capable to deteriorate various types of organic compounds efficiently 41 42 therefore the colour removal rate and efficiency in pfc with 40 mg l 1 were relatively low as compared to the pfc with 30 mg l 1 a similar finding was reported by lee et al 22 who investigated the degradation of reactive green 19 in an aerated single chambered pfc 3 3 effect of solution ph in pfc study the effect of ph has to be elucidated as the wastewaters usually presented in a wide range of ph values 43 to investigate the influence of ph on the pfc performance the study was performed in the ph range of 4 5 12 8 with dye concentration of 20 mg l 1 fig 4 a shows the colour removal efficiency of different ph in the pfc and the results indicated that the increase of ph from 4 5 7 5 led to an increase in the decolourization of dye from 85 92 4 05 to 99 00 0 96 after 6 h of uva irradiation time however the colour removal efficiency decreased from 99 00 0 96 to 84 43 3 32 when further increased the ph from 7 5 12 8 fig 4b and c shows ph 7 5 has the highest pseudo first order rate constant k 0 7187 h 1 jsc 0 0088 ma cm 2 voc 395 6667 47 6970 mv and pmax 0 9666 0 0244 μw cm 2 the adsorption of dye on the photoanode was one of the crucial factors which affected by the zero point charge ph phzpc of the photocatalyst and the ionic nature of the dye below the phzpc of zno 9 0 0 3 the surface charge of zno was positive while rr120 which has six sulfonic groups of negative ions at ph 7 37 at neutral condition with ph 7 5 the electrostatic attraction between the positive charge of zno and negative charge of the rr120 could facilitate the strong adsorption of rr120 on zno and result in effective electron hole pair separation 35 subsequently the spontaneous flow of electrons to pt c cathode could yield o2 which assisted in the oxidation of rr120 thus the highest decolourization rate of rr120 was observed at neutral condition at ph 7 5 the lowest decolourization rate and efficiency of rr120 at low ph ph 4 5 might be attributed to the corrosion of zno where the dissolution of zn2 happens eq 2 44 in acidic conditions zno could react with acid to produce the corresponding salt hence restricted the photocatalytic properties of zno 38 43 moreover the poorest electricity performance of ph 4 5 fig 4c with voc 275 6667 4 0415 mv jsc 0 0077 0 0003 ma cm 2 and pmax 0 6092 0 1099 μw cm 2 indicated that the high recombination rate of electron hole pairs of the photoanode happened in the acidic condition by virtue of less hydroxyl group in the dye solution it is believed that oh plays a major role in the fission of the n n conjugated system in azo dye at lower ph conditions a high amount of h ions tend to cooperate with azo linkage thus diminishing the azo group electron densities 45 46 consequently this may reduce the hydroxyl reactivity of oh and directly affect the power output and decolourization efficiency of the pfc 47 as can be seen from fig 4b the pseudo first order rate constants for ph 12 8 achieved an almost similar value k 0 3304 h 1 with ph 4 5 k 0 3293 h 1 this phenomenon may be assigned to the dissolution of zno to form complexes in alkaline medium such as zn oh 4 2 eq 3 when the ph was too high the negatively charged zno would repel rr120 anions and hinder the oxidation of dye at the photoanode 25 in addition the high concentration of oh ions could ensure the production of oh at high ph conditions 28 however the depletion of protons might happen in highly alkaline condition and cathodic oxygen reduction reaction orr was hindered 2 zno 2h zn2 h2o 3 zno 2oh h2o zn oh 4 2 3 4 effect of supporting electrolytes 3 4 1 performance of pfc wastewater discharged from the textile industries commonly contains various anions such as no3 so4 2 po4 3 and so on which can greatly influence the photocatalytic decolourization of dye 26 48 in this study the pfcs with the addition of different supporting electrolytes 0 1 m of nano3 na2so4 and na3po4 were carried out using 20 mg l 1 of rr120 and compared with the pfc without supporting electrolyte fig 5 a indicates the pfc without supporting electrolyte exhibited the lowest jsc 0 0077 0 0004 ma cm 2 voc 374 6667 1 5275 mv and pmax 0 7277 0 0036 μw cm 2 after the addition of nano3 na2so4 and na3po4 as supporting electrolytes respectively there was a significant increase in voc jsc and pmax this could be attributed to the enhancement of ion mobility with the presence of supporting electrolytes in pfc consequently the reduction of internal resistance could lead to the enhancement of the potential difference between the electrodes and the transportation of electrons to the pt c cathode 49 therefore the highest jsc 0 0788 0 0033 ma cm 2 voc 455 0000 28 2130 mv and pmax 9 1779 0 5142 μw cm 2 were observed in the pfc with na3po4 followed by na2so4 and nano3 this result was supported by the conductivity of rr120 as shown in fig 5b the conductivity of rr120 supported by different supporting electrolytes depleted in the following order na3po4 na2so4 nano3 no supporting electrolyte among the polyatomic ions po4 3 with triple negative charge possessed the highest conductivity followed by so4 2 double negative charge and no3 single negative charge this phenomenon indicated that po4 3 could carry more electrons through the dye therefore it was able to reduce internal resistance and resulted in the highest jsc 47 fig 5c shows the colour removal efficiency with different supporting electrolytes within 3 h of the reaction with illumination of light a total colour removal of 81 27 1 29 was achieved by the pfc without supporting electrolyte however a total dye decolourization of 98 44 1 03 94 65 0 81 88 70 0 79 was achieved by the pfcs supported by na3po4 na2so4 and nano3 respectively fig 5d shows the rate constant of each system according to langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model the rate constant of different supporting electrolytes depleted in the following order na3po4 k 1 2307 h 1 na2so4 k 0 9852 h 1 nano3 k 0 8203 h 1 no supporting electrolyte k 0 6638 h 1 as mentioned above the spontaneous flow of electrons was enhanced in the presence of supporting electrolyte this could lead to a higher cathodic orr and produce more powerful oxidizing holes in the valence band of zno therefore a significant enhancement in decolourization efficiency and rate were observed after the addition of supporting electrolyte this phenomenon also indicated that the enrichment of radicals in the pfc could be achieved with the presence of supporting electrolyte ions 50 the mechanism of different supporting electrolytes was further discussed hereinafter 3 4 2 uv vis spectra analysis fig 6 shows the uv vis absorption spectra recorded at different supporting electrolytes in the pfc the uv vis spectra of untreated rr120 dye solutions are characterized by doublet bands in the visible range around 522 nm and 545 nm azo bonds and by two bands in the uv region around 248 nm benzene rings and 302 nm naphthalene ring 23 it can be clearly seen that all the absorbance bands decreased rapidly over irradiation time in pfc without supporting electrolyte fig 6a at 1 h the absorbance of pfc with 0 1 m of nano3 around 522 nm and 545 nm decreased in a higher ratio 1 2 65 as compared to pfc without supporting electrolyte 1 1 79 fig 6b this phenomenon suggests that the cleavage of azo bonds in rr120 could be accelerated in the presence of no3 this acceleration of decolourization may be attributed to the direct or indirect formation of oh as shown in the following equations 51 52 4 no3 hv no2 o 5 o h2o oh oh 6 no3 hv h2o no2 oh oh 7 zno h vb oh ads zno oh however there might be a drawback by using nano3 in pfc due to the adsorption of photons by the supporting electrolyte itself thus there would be fewer photons adsorbed by the surface of the photoanode and led to a reduction in electricity generation when so4 2 was introduced to rr120 a higher ratio of decrement at 1 h 1 3 53 was observed in the visible region fig 6c remarkably the breakdown of benzene 1 1 62 and naphthalene rings 1 2 31 at 1 h in this case was obviously higher than the others these significant differences indicated that the separation of electron hole pairs can be retained by so4 2 while so4 can be produced which is a very strong oxidant redox potential 2 6 v that can promote the degradation of dye 26 8 so4 2 h vb so4 9 so4 h2o so4 2 oh h the overall equation of eq 8 and 9 indicated that the so4 2 could be recycled in the form of so4 2 so4 so4 2 without addition of extra so4 2 53 therefore na2so4 is extensively used for the application of pfc 39 54 55 it is observed that there was a hypsochromic shift blue shift of the maximum absorbance band in the initial dye solution after the addition of na3po4 fig 6d the blue shift was observed from 522 nm and 545 nm λmax to shorter wavelengths of 485 nm and 515 nm respectively this phenomenon can be elucidated by the deprotonation of the dye molecule at a highly alkaline condition 56 the ph value of the initial dye solution was measured to be 12 8 which indicated that phosphate presented as po4 3 in the initial condition 57 after 1 h the maximum absorbance band was bathochromic shifted red shift to the original maximum wavelength position this might be attributed to the protonation from the water ionization process of the photogenerated holes in this case there was almost complete decomposition of rr120 took place in the pfc the highly efficient of decolourization might be attributed to the predominant species of po4 3 which might react with water molecules to produce hydroxide ions eq 10 thus the formation of oh can be ensured eq 7 10 po4 3 h2o hpo4 2 oh at the same time po4 3 can be strongly bound to the photoanode surface thus leads to a strong interaction between zno and rr120 58 59 furthermore there were some phosphates might be trapped by zinc ions to form zn3 po4 2 as zno cannot withstand in this harsh chemical environment 60 62 in this case zn3 po4 2 might act as a catalyst which enhanced the degradation of dye 63 64 3 4 3 energy conversion efficiency and reusability the main parameters of pfc based on different supporting electrolytes were evaluated under same light irradiation condition table 1 almost identical value of fill factor ff 25 28 was obtained and the energy conversion efficiency η was calculated using eq 11 11 η jsc x voc x ff x 100 iinc where iinc is the incident light intensity expressed in w cm 2 it can be seen that the jsc and voc are the crucial factors that affect the energy conversion efficiency of pfc overall the energy conversion efficiencies of pfcs with supporting electrolytes were higher than the pfc without supporting electrolytes the occurrence could be due to the high charge mobility high jsc as the internal resistance reduced from 3000 to 400 ω after the addition of supporting electrolytes this also could be due to the low recombination rate high voc and great interfacial contact between the photoelectrodes and rr120 in the pfcs with supporting electrolytes 65 as aforementioned in methodology the used zno ni photoanode was exposed under sunlight after each cycle and then reused in the next cycle to evaluate the reusability of zno ni photoanode pfc na3po4 and 20 mg l 1 of rr120 was carried out for five cyclic runs which also indicated that the photoanode had been immersed in the dye for total time up to 30 h table sm 1 shows the colour removal efficiency was still sustained at 96 550 99 176 five consecutive cycles with a low standard deviation of pmax 8 8893 0 5807 μw cm 2 this phenomenon revealed that zno ni photoanode exhibited good stability as there was no appreciable loss even at the fifth cycle meanwhile it can be noticed that only a slight reduction in the intensity of xrd peaks observed in the zno but there was virtually unchanged in its morphology even after five cycles fig 7 additionally fig 8 shows the transient photocurrent responses of the pfc with light on off cycles in five consecutive cycles obviously the proposed pfc showed a good reproducible photocurrent generation separation efficiency of photogenerated electron hole pairs which also revealed that the zno ni photoanode had a good photoresponse to the uva light as discussed in section 3 1 subsequently it also reflected that the zno ni photoanode exhibited excellent photostability property under uva light illumination as the photocurrent densities had no significant decay in the continuous light cycling test lastly it can be noticed that there were only small differences in the photocurrent densities even after five cycles therefore it can be concluded that the highly efficient zno ni photoanode was reusable after self cleaning under sunlight exposure table 2 presents the comparison of the performance of current study with the previous studies the results showed that the colour removal efficiency achieved in this study was higher than most of the listed pfcs by comparing the pfcs operated within 6 h it was found that the colour removal efficiency of zno ni foam was higher than zno c felt 25 this phenomenon might be attributed to the difference of fabrication method and substrate used to prepare the photoanode meanwhile it was noted that the degradation rate k 0 7742 h 1 of pfc in this study was the highest as compared with our previous study k 0 2769 h 1 23 and the others the improved performance might be attributed to the increased number of zno which distributed on a higher surface area due to the three dimensional porous structure of ni foam instead of the two dimensional smooth surface of carbon plate in our previous study 23 hence a larger amount of zno could be photoexcited and reacted with more dye molecules leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity of zno ni foam although same photocatalyst zno was applied in the photoanode the optimum ph value obtained from this study was different from lee et al 22 and khalik et al 25 studies this might be attributed to the different types of the dye acted as the electrolyte fuel which had different molecular structures and functional groups 4 conclusions in summary a sustainable single chambered pfc based on zno ni photoanode was successfully established to decolourize rr120 and generate electricity simultaneously the result revealed that the presence of rr120 sacrificial agent could enhance the power performance of the pfc due to fact that dye can be oxidized more easily as compared to water moreover the different initial dye concentration demonstrated that almost fully decolourization in 6 h and the highest pmax of 0 8571 0 0118 μw cm 2 could be achieved by using 30 mg l 1 of rr120 in the pfc free of supporting electrolyte besides it also can be concluded that the rr120 could be decolourized more efficiently in neutral conditions ph 7 5 moreover the presence of no3 so4 2 and po4 3 had significantly accelerated the decolourization of rr120 at the same time these polyatomic ions had led to high conductivity of rr120 and increased the jsc lower internal resistance in the pfc overall the pfc with po4 3 yielded the highest decolourization rate k 1 2307 h 1 jsc of 0 0788 0 0033 ma cm 2 and pmax of 9 1779 0 5142 μw cm 2 alternatively the pfc with so4 2 was more efficient for the cleavage of aromatic compounds in rr120 the zno ni photoanode was reusable after self cleaning under sunlight exposure finally continual studies on pfc technology are essential for

13917,planting macrophytes can increase the contribution of plant uptake to pollutant removal in ecological floating bed efb however the low system stability of traditional efb often causes large area plant lodging during the rainy season this phenomenon not only reduces the ornamental value of efb but also causes the problem of secondary pollution furthermore the reduction of removal rate under low temperature condition is also an inevitable defect in the application of efb therefore a composite efb cefb was built by suspending inorganic functional filler below the traditional efb to remedy these defects results of a two year field test showed that the suspension of inorganic functional filler not only enhanced the system stability plant lodging resistance and removal efficiency of cefb but also fundamentally resolved the problem of low purification efficiency of the traditional efb during the low temperature season compared with efb cefb could increase the average removal rates of total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n total phosphorus tp phosphate po4 3 p turbidity algae density and chlorophyll a chl a by 46 85 53 97 44 45 54 55 53 63 42 16 and 29 79 respectively in addition cefb effectively avoided the great increase in organic matter concentration and the decline in sensory effects of the scenic water caused by plant lodging and plant tissue decomposition in general the suspension of inorganic functional filler could enhance the plant lodging resistance and purification efficiency of cefb evidently which is expected to become a feasible approach for eutrophic water restoration keywords inorganic functional filler composite ecological floating bed plant lodging resistance low temperature stability dissolved organic matter 1 introduction ecological floating bed efb is an environmental friendly water remediation technology that is evolved on the basis of traditional constructed wetland 1 this technology can remove the pollutants in water through plant uptake microbial transformation and natural sedimentation 2 compared with physical and chemical remediation methods efb has attracted increasing attention due to its advantages such as environmental friendly economical efficient safe and high ornamental characteristics and has been applied in the purification of eutrophic scenic water 3 in order to enhance the contribution of plant uptake to the removal of nutrients in water the researchers and environmental engineers tend to choose large aquatic plants such as canna calamus reeds iris etc to construct efb 4 7 however the system stability of traditional efb is usually low due to the difficulty of fixing buoyancy carriers in the actual application this difficulty makes the large plants prone to large scale lodging under strong wind or rainy conditions due to the raised centre of efb gravity plant lodging not only reduces the purification efficiency and ornamental value of efb but also easily causes secondary pollution due to the decomposition of plant tissues 8 therefore some measures need be taken to increase the system stability of efb during the application of large plants in the efb construction nevertheless there are few relevant studies nowadays plant uptake and microbial degradation are the main mechanisms of pollutant removal in efb 9 the plant growth and microbial activity would sharply decrease during the low temperature season this decrease would result in a decline in the purification efficiency of efb 10 11 many scholars developed various strengthening efb by introducing aeration device elastic packing submerged plants and additional bacteria in the traditional efb system to solve the aforementioned problem of efb 12 13 in most cases these strengthening methods belonged to biological enhancement and their removal efficiencies were still affected by temperature 14 15 in addition the existing studies on efb mainly focused on the changes in inorganic nutrients in water most of these studies were conducted during the high temperature season through small scale laboratory experiments 16 17 however there were few long term field studies on the plant lodging resistance of efb during windy and rainy seasons the purification efficiency of efb in low temperature condition and the impacts of efb application on organic matter in water the current research aims to develop a new composite efb cefb based on the above discussion to enhance the system stability and removal efficiency of the traditional efb zeolite and sponge iron are common inorganic functional fillers which can efficiently remove ammonia nh4 and phosphate po4 3 in water by adsorption cation exchange interception and co precipitation 18 19 in addition the removal effect of zeolite and sponge iron is less affected by environmental conditions such as temperature 20 meanwhile the counterweight effect of inorganic fillers could theoretically enhance the stability of efb and plant lodging resistance moreover the suspended fillers could provide attachment sites for microbial propagation thereby promoting the pollutant removal in water by strengthening microbial transformation and pollutant interception 4 therefore a novel cefb was constructed by suspending the nylon mesh filled with zeolite and sponge iron below the traditional efb system in this study a two year field test was also conducted to compare the differences in the performances of efb and cefb in terms of purifying the actual scenic water supplied with reclaimed water the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to explore the effects of suspended inorganic functional fillers on the plant lodging resistance and purification efficiency of cefb 2 to study the influences of plant lodging plant tissue decomposition and functional filler suspension on the organic matter in water 3 to provide a feasible strategy for guaranteeing the system stability and purification efficiency of efb in the actual water remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the experiment was conducted in an urban park of north western china a closed zone with an area of 326 m2 and an effective water depth of 0 65 m was enclosed and divided into three equal zones by using foam filled steel plates the zone without any processing was regarded as the control and the two other zones with additional efb and cefb systems were treated as the experimental groups the efb was constructed by planting four native aquatic plants calamus iris lythrum and hydrocotyle vulgaris on the polyethylene buoyancy carrier and the corresponding plant coverage and density were 45 and 10 plants m 2 respectively the nylon mesh loaded with zeolite and sponge iron was suspended below the efb to construct the cefb and the suspended amounts of the inorganic functional fillers were 5 5 kg zeolite m 2 cefb and 6 5 kg sponge iron m 2 cefb respectively the filler characteristics are summarised in table 1 the water injected firstly and supplemented later in the test was the reclaimed water after the advanced treatment of domestic sewage the water quality parameters of the reclaimed water are listed in table s1 throughout the test the frequency and quantity of every water replenishment in different zones were similar and the corresponding mean values were every 25 2 2 1 days and 16 2 0 8 m3 respectively as shown in fig s1 the experiment lasted 600 days from july 19 2016 to march 16 2018 in order to comprehensively study the effects of filler suspension on the system stability and removal efficiency of the cefb as well as the impacts of plant lodging and plant decomposition on water quality the completely withered stems and leaves of calamus and lythrum in the efb and cefb systems were harvested until the end of the chinese lunar year january 15 and december 20 2017 due to the requirement of park management meanwhile those of iris and hydrocotyle vulgaris remained green all year round without harvesting 2 2 sampling the conventional water samples were collected twice a month and each sampling was performed at 9 00 am the samples located 30 cm below the water surface at the centre and surrounding locations of each zone were collected and the average value of the analysis results for every five sampling points was taken as the representative value of water quality in each zone the ph dissolved oxygen do and temperature t were measured on site meanwhile other indicators namely total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n total phosphorus tp phosphate po4 3 p chemical oxygen demand cod algal density chlorophyll a chl a and turbidity were analysed in the key laboratory of northwest water resource environment and ecology moe all abbreviations of nouns and the corresponding full names in the manuscript are listed in table s2 furthermore the concentrations of total organic carbon toc and the main components of dissolved organic matter dom in different zones were respectively measured on july 15 september 15 and november 15 2017 to analyse the impacts of plant lodging on the concentration and species of organic matter in water the specific method of water sample collection was the same as mentioned above 2 3 sample analysis t do and ph were monitored using a hach portable multifunctional water quality meter hq 30d tn nh4 n tp po4 3 p chl a and turbidity were analysed using a uv vis spectrophotometer xinmao752 n cod was tested through potassium dichromate oxidation and ammonium ferrous sulphate titration while the algae density was measured through microscopic examination and counting toc was measured via a german element toc analyser vario toc cube and the main composition of dom in the water was analysed using a fluorescence spectrophotometer fp6500 2 4 removal efficiency the removal efficiency e of efb and cefb for various pollutants in water was calculated as follows 1 e e f b c e f b c c o n t r o l c e f b c e f b c c o n t r o l 100 where ccontrol cefb and ccefb are the measurement values of pollutants concentrations in the control efb and cefb zones at the same sampling time respectively 2 5 statistical analysis excel and origin 9 0 software were used to process the test data and plot the figures meanwhile the ibm spss statistics 22 0 software was used to test the significance of the mean values and homogeneity of the variance the latter was further investigated using the f test method and the values of the former were compared using paired sample t tests with a significance level of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 difference in plant lodging resistances between the efb and cefb systems fig 1 shows the field photos of plant growth in efb and cefb systems during mid september 2016 and early august 2017 corresponding to the 2nd and 13th months of the experiment as mentioned previously the plant species density and plant coverage in both the cefb and efb systems were same however the former was constructed by suspending the nylon mesh loaded with inorganic fillers below the efb system as shown in fig 1 the plants in the efb and cefb systems exhibited satisfactory growth and no plant lodging occurred in 2016 due to the relatively small plant height after the adaptation period of the hydroponic culture the plants vigorously grew during the summer and autumn of 2017 in which an obvious increase in plant height and tiller number was observed however the large plant height increased the plant lodging potential and the system stability of traditional efb declined due to the raised centre of the efb gravity this phenomenon eventually resulted in large area plant lodging in the efb system during the rainy season of 2017 june to september despite experiencing the same wind and rain disturbances as those of the plants in the efb system the plants in the cefb system exhibited excellent growth and only a few plant lodging phenomena occurred throughout the test according to the statistics after the heavy rains in early august 2017 the plant lodging percentage in the efb system could reach 83 26 while the corresponding value in the cefb system was only 2 17 table 1 shows that the densities of zeolite and sponge iron used in this experiment were 1 96 and 2 38 g cm 3 these fillers played an important role in balancing the raised centre of bed system due to plant growth consequently the inorganic filler in the cefb system acted as a counterweight to stabilise the bed system thereby resisting plant lodging in the windy and rainy seasons in other words enhancing the plant lodging resistance during windy and rainy seasons is feasible by suspending the inorganic filler below the buoyancy carrier to serve as the counterweight this method could also guarantee the operation stability of the cefb system 3 2 difference in physicochemical parameters of the different zones fig 2 shows the time course of physicochemical parameters t do ph and turbidity in different zones as shown in fig 2 the water temperature in different zones was similar compared with the control efb effectively reduced the turbidity and did not affect the do and ph before july 2017 however the do concentration and ph value in the efb zone drastically decreased after this period while the turbidity increased by contrast the do concentration and ph value in the cefb zone were close to those of the control zone throughout the test and the turbidity was steadily lower than those in the control and efb zones fig 2 a shows that the water temperature in different zones was similar and the maximum and minimum values during the experiment were 30 2 c and 3 4 c respectively throughout the test the average values of water temperature in the control efb and cefb zones were 16 4 8 63 15 8 7 12 and 15 6 6 96 c respectively thus efb and cefb had no significant impact on water temperature p 0 768 fig 2 b indicates that the do concentrations in the control and cefb zones fluctuated with the changes in water supply and environmental conditions however these values were generally close p 0 520 and higher than 5 00 mg l 1 in the whole experiment meanwhile the do concentration in the cefb zone was slightly higher than that in the control during the vigorous period of plant growth march september 2017 while slightly lower than control during the stagnant period of plant growth october 2017 february 2018 this phenomenon could be attributed to the oxygen produced by plant photosynthesis and transmitted to water through root system in the plant vigorous stage while the plant photosynthesis was weak in the plant stagnant period and the buoyancy carrier hindered oxygen enrichment from the atmosphere 21 22 the do concentration in the efb zone was close to those in the control and cefb zones before july 2017 but the value continuously decreased due to plant lodging and reached the lowest value of 2 77 mg l 1 in the mid december 2017 although the do concentration in the efb zone showed an upward trend due to plant harvesting in the later period i e december 20 2017 the value was still lower than those in the control and cefb zones the average do concentrations in the control efb and cefb zones were 8 23 1 35 5 85 2 01 and 8 52 1 26 mg l 1 respectively which indicated that the average do concentration in the efb zone was significantly lower than those in the control p 0 003 and cefb p 0 000 zones therefore the suspension of the inorganic filler avoided the plant lodging during the rainy season and ensured the do concentration in water at a high level for a long time fig 2 c shows that the plant uptake of carbon dioxide and the ionization of sodium aluminosilicate in zeolite resulted in a slightly higher ph value of cefb zone than that of the control 23 however plants also secrete protons and organic acids during their growth thus yielding marginally lower ph values of efb than those of control especially in the period of plant lodging the low do concentration promoted the decomposition and decay of plant tissues thus accelerating the decline in ph in the efb zone 24 the normal ph of scenic water is in a weak alkaline condition whilst that in the efb zone was in a weak acid environment due to plant tissue decomposition reaching the minimum value 6 43 on december 15 2017 25 the average ph values in the control efb and cefb zones were 7 82 0 33 7 38 0 51 and 8 01 0 26 respectively which showed the standard deviation value of ph in the cefb zone was minimum amongst the three zones therefore cefb could stably maintain the ph of the water system in a normal range while the ph value in efb decreased due to plant lodging and plant decomposition fig 2 d shows that the turbidity in the control and efb zones considerably fluctuated with the changes in water supply environmental conditions and plant growth whilst that in the cefb zone was stable at a low level throughout the test the turbidity in efb was lower than that in control before july 2017 due to the interception of plant roots and the adsorption of biofilms attached to the plant roots 26 afterwards the turbidity in the efb system was continuously increased due to plant lodging and decomposition of decaying tissue and was higher than that of control from september 2017 to the end of the experiment by contrast the suspension of inorganic fillers in cefb effectively avoided plant lodging in the rainy season at the same time as an excellent flocculant the fe3 and fe2 from the sponge iron respectively promoted the flocculation and sedimentation of suspended solids in water and reduced the turbidity in the cefb zone 27 throughout the test the mean values of turbidity in the control efb and cefb zones were 14 47 4 08 11 02 5 13 and 3 26 1 28 ntu respectively therefore the average removal efficiencies of turbidity in the efb and cefb zones were 23 84 and 77 47 p 0 002 and p 0 000 respectively and the purification efficiency of cefb on turbidity was significantly higher than that of efb p 0 000 in general the suspension of inorganic fillers in the cefb system could stably maintain the do concentration in water at a high level efficiently reduce the turbidity and maintain the ph value in the normal range throughout the test 3 3 difference in nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations of the different zones fig 3 shows the variation trends of tn nh4 n tp and po4 3 p concentrations in the same zone were similar and the concentrations of these parameters in the three zones followed the sequence of control efb cefb fig 3 shows the concentrations of tn nh4 n tp and po4 3 p in the efb zone were always lower than those of control before july 2017 and then the nutrients concentration substantially increased and exceeded that in control due to plant lodging and plant tissue decomposition by contrast the high stability of cefb system could effectively avoid plant lodging and the functional fillers of zeolite and sponge iron could promote the removal of nh4 and po4 3 in water through adsorption ion exchange and coprecipitation 28 meanwhile the suspended fillers in cefb could provide the attachment sites for microbial propagation thus increasing the contribution of microbial transformation and filler interception to pollutant removal 29 furthermore the purification effect of efb in high temperature seasons july to october 2016 and april to june 2017 was better than that in low temperature seasons january to march 2017 this phenomenon is due to the high plant uptake rate and microbial activity in high temperature conditions 30 however the purification efficiency of cefb remained stable at a high level throughout the test during the entire experiment the average tn concentrations in the control efb and cefb zones were 2 19 0 61 1 87 0 73 and 0 84 0 22 mg l 1 respectively while the average nh4 n concentrations were 1 26 0 15 1 03 0 33 and 0 35 0 08 mg l 1 respectively on the other side the average tp concentrations in the control efb and cefb zones were 0 18 0 07 0 14 0 05 and 0 06 0 01 mg l 1 respectively while the corresponding po4 3 p concentrations were 0 11 0 06 0 09 0 04 and 0 03 0 01 mg l 1 respectively therefore the average removal efficiencies of tn nh4 n tp and po4 3 p in the cefb zone were 61 46 72 22 66 67 and 72 73 respectively which were correspondingly 46 85 53 97 44 45 and 54 55 higher than the corresponding values in the efb zone p 0 01 in conclusion the counterweight function of inorganic fillers resisted plant lodging of the cefb in the windy and rainy season which further ensured a high and stable removal of nutrients in water through the synergistic actions of adsorption ion exchange interception and coprecipitation of the functional fillers 3 4 difference in algae density and chl a concentration of the different zones fig 4 shows the change trends of algae density and chl a concentration in different zones where both the algae density and chl a concentration in the cefb zone were the lowest figs 1 and 4 indicate that the changing trends in algae density and chl a concentration in different zones were similar to temperature variation and those in the cefb zone were far less than those in the control and efb zones the high nutrients concentration and sufficient light condition in the control zone promoted the reproduction of phytoplankton 31 these conditions simultaneously resulted in significantly higher algae density and chl a concentration in the control zone than those in the efb and cefb zones p 0 03 the light shielding effects of buoyancy carrier and aquatic plant in the efb and cefb zones could inhibit the phytoplankton growth to a certain extent and the low nutrients concentration in the cefb zone had evident inhibitory effect on algae growth 32 in addition the algae density and chl a concentration of the control and efb zones in 2017 were all higher than those in 2016 this finding is due to some tolerance of algae for the residual chlorine in the reclaimed water with the experiment processing 33 throughout the test the average values of algae density in the control efb and cefb zones were 1120 19 105 1144 799 21 105 762 and 326 86 105 268 cells l 1 while the corresponding values of chl a concentration were 49 88 28 19 28 53 16 21 and 13 67 4 32 μg l 1 respectively the average value of algae density in the cefb zone was 29 18 p 0 000 and 40 90 p 0 001 in the control and efb zones and the corresponding chl a concentration accounted for 27 41 p 0 000 and 47 91 p 0 000 respectively therefore the light shielding effect of the buoyancy carrier and the low nutrients concentration in the cefb zone could effectively inhibit the algae growth in water thereby keeping the water eutrophication at a low level in the whole test 3 5 difference in organic matter of the different zones 3 5 1 cod and toc concentrations fig 5 shows the concentration changes in cod and toc in different zones where cod and toc in the cefb zone maintained the lowest concentration as shown in fig 5 a the cod concentration in the efb zone was higher than that in control during the decay and decomposition periods of plant tissue october 2016 to february 2017 and september 2017 to february 2018 respectively while lower than that in control in the vigorous period of plant growth the developed plant roots could remove part of the suspended organic matter in water by interception and sedimentation during the plant growth process 34 meanwhile the microorganisms in the biofilm attached to plant roots would also consume part of the organic matter through assimilation and transformation thereby achieving the removal of cod in water 29 however the plant lodging and decomposition of decaying plant tissues resulted in the sharp increase in cod concentration in efb zone and exceeded control because twice plant harvesting were conducted in winter january 15 2017 and december 20 2017 in this experiment although the cod concentration in the cefb zone was also raised in winter the increased extent was much smaller than that of efb due to the strong resistance of plant lodging moreover the suspended inorganic functional filler further increased the removal of cod in the cefb zone by combining the adsorption of dissolved organic matter interception of suspended organic matter and transformation of biofilm microorganisms 35 during the entire experiment the average cod concentrations in the control efb and cefb zones were 45 58 9 37 49 54 13 94 and 33 20 9 62 mg l 1 respectively therefore the cefb zone maintained the lowest cod concentration in water and avoided the obvious increase of cod concentration caused by plant lodging and plant tissue decomposition fig 5 b shows the toc concentration of three zones in mid july mid september and mid november of 2017 all the toc concentrations in different zones demonstrated an upward trend with time however the increasing trend of toc concentration in the efb zone was considerably larger than those in the control and cefb zones plant lodging in efb resulted in the earlier decay period of plant tissue than that of the cefb zone meanwhile the decrease in do concentration due to plant lodging substantially accelerated the decomposition of decaying plant tissue thus the toc concentration in the water of the efb zone significantly increased in the autumn and winter of 2017 by contrast the strong resistance to plant lodging in cefb and the adsorption of functional fillers effectively avoided the aforementioned phenomenon in the cefb zone the average toc concentrations in the control efb and cefb zones were 12 09 0 86 17 21 2 53 and 10 07 0 67 mg l 1 respectively therefore the mean value of toc concentration in the cefb zone was 83 29 p 0 046 and 58 51 p 0 028 of those in control and efb zones respectively although the decomposition of decaying plant tissues would increase the cod and toc concentrations in water the strong plant lodging resistance in cefb effectively delayed the decay period of plants meanwhile the adsorption sedimentation and interception of functional fillers also promoted the removal of organics thus the concentrations of cod and toc in the cefb zone were stably lower than those in the control and efb zones 3 5 2 dom species fig 6 shows the eem fluorescence spectra of dom in different zones at various stages the figure demonstrates that protein was the main component of dom in control while humic acid was the main form of dom in the efb and cefb zones in addition the intensity changes of the various fluorescence peaks indicate the dom concentration in water increased with time fig 6 a1 a2 and a3 shows two main fluorescence peaks in control the corresponding excitation e x and emission e m wavelengths were e x e m 230 340 nm t1 peak and e x e m 280 340 nm t2 peak respectively among them the t1 peak is the common protein tryptophan fluorescence peak and the corresponding fluorescence intensities in a1 a2 and a3 were 317 3 329 6 and 387 1 respectively meanwhile the t2 peak is the fluorescence peak of proteolytic microbial metabolites and the corresponding fluorescence intensities in a1 a2 and a3 were 211 1 219 3 and 276 8 respectively 36 in addition a fulvic acid fluorescence peak e x e m 235 410 nm appeared in control on november 15 2017 corresponding to a fluorescence intensity of 283 1 37 therefore the protein was the main component of dom in control from july to november 2017 and the protein concentration in water was increased with time ly et al reported that the protein components produced by biological sources in water mainly came from the catabolism of plankton aquatic bacteria and algae 38 as mentioned previously the high nutrients concentration in control promoted the growth of phytoplankton and the catabolism of algae increased protein concentration in water three fluorescence peaks e x e m 240 435 nm the fulvic acid fluorescence peak in the ultraviolet light area e x e m 325 430 nm the fulvic acid fluorescence peak in the visible light area and e x e m 230 345 nm the protein tryptophan fluorescence peak appeared in fig 6 b1 and their corresponding fluorescence intensities were 278 1 229 9 and 246 3 respectively in fig 6 b2 four fluorescence peaks e x e m 230 340 nm e x e m 235 430 nm e x e m 250 430 nm and e x e m 335 435 nm were the protein tryptophan fluorescence peak the fulvic acid fluorescence peak in the ultraviolet light area the fulvic acid fluorescence peak in the ultraviolet light area and the fulvic acid fluorescence peak in the visible light area respectively 39 the corresponding fluorescence intensities were 349 3 375 8 361 5 and 302 2 in fig 6 b3 three fluorescence peaks e x e m 240 435 nm e x e m 355 435 nm and e x e m 230 340 nm were the fulvic acid fluorescence peak in the ultraviolet light area the fulvic acid fluorescence peak in the visible light area and the protein tryptophan fluorescence peak and the corresponding fluorescence intensities were 399 7 342 3 and 501 5 respectively therefore the dom in the efb zone was mainly humic acid fulvic acid and its concentration in water was also increased with time the poor stability of efb resulted in plant lodging in early july 2017 due to heavy rain this condition increased the humic acid concentration in water due to the decay and decomposition of plant tissues only one fluorescence peak was presented in fig 6 c1 and the corresponding substance and fluorescence intensity were the fulvic acid fluorescence peak in the ultraviolet light area e x e m 235 410 nm and 263 2 the fulvic acid in the ultraviolet light area e x e m 240 410 nm and that in the visible light area e x e m 335 415 nm in fig 6 c2 and c3 were the main forms of dom in cefb of mid september 2017 and mid november 2017 and the corresponding fluorescence intensities were 265 1 and 267 3 for fulvic acid in the ultraviolet light area 217 5 and 223 1 for fulvic acid in the visible light area the low nutrients concentration in the cefb zone resulted in a low algae density thereby reducing the contribution of phytoplankton catabolism to the protein concentration in water meanwhile the high stability of the cefb system avoided plant lodging and delayed plant decay thereby slowing the increase in humic acid concentration in water therefore the suspension of inorganic fillers avoided a substantial increase in the humic acid concentration in water which was usually caused by plant lodging and plant tissue decomposition meanwhile the introduction of functional filler decreased the contribution of algae catabolism to protein concentration in water due to the reduction of the nutrient concentration in water 3 6 advantages of cefb in actual scenic water purification 3 6 1 high stability of cefb system the large plant is often selected to construct the efb system thus enhancing the contribution of plant uptake to pollutants removal in water 40 however the relatively large velocity of the actual water the complex environmental conditions and the difficulty in anchoring result in low system stability of traditional efb in practical applications thus large plants and low efb stability often cause large area plant lodging during the windy and rainy seasons as shown in fig s2 a large area of plant lodging occurred in efb in the rainy summer of 2017 due to its low system stability which resulted in a sharp drop in the do concentration plant lodging caused the early decay period of plant tissues while low do concentration accelerated the decomposition of withered plant tissues this phenomenon not only obviously reduced the purification efficiency of efb but also obviously increased the nutrients concentration in water especially organic matter concentration the organic matter produced by plant tissue decomposition is mainly fulvic acid as a common chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom fulvic acid would increase the turbidity and chroma while reduce the transparency of water thereby greatly reducing the sensory effect of the scenic water as shown in fig s3 41 in addition the high concentration of organic matter in efb led to the large scale reproduction of azolla which would aggravate the anoxic phenomenon and plant tissue decomposition in water thereby resulting in the collapse of water ecosystems in serious cases in comparison the large density of inorganic filler enhanced the stability of the cefb system and the plant lodging resistance through the counterweight effect of inorganic filler therefore despite experiencing the same disturbance of wind and rain in summer the plants in cefb still grew well and very few of plant lodging occurred throughout the test the better plant growth ensured the high level of do concentration in cefb and delayed the coming of the decay period of plant tissues previous research has shown that the plant roots still had a certain activity even with the entrance of plant stems and leaves into the stagnation period 26 in this experiment the strong plant lodging resistance in cefb avoided the direct contact between the ground tissues of decaying plants and water thus greatly reducing the contribution of plant decomposition to the increase in pollutant concentration in water although dom sources in the cefb zone included endogenous production and exogenous influx its strong plant lodging resistance low algae density less plant tissue decomposition and adsorption of organic matter by functional fillers resulted in the lowest concentrations of cod toc dom and cdom in the cefb zone therefore the cefb system guaranteed the ornamental value of the scenic water while the lower organic matter concentration in water effectively avoided the reproduction of azolla overall the suspension of high density inorganic filler could effectively enhance the system stability of cefb and the plant lodging resistance thus avoiding the defects caused by the decomposition of decaying plant tissues such as the significant increase in the organic matter concentration the mass propagation of azolla and the obvious decline in the sensory effect of the scenic water 3 6 2 strong purification efficiency of cefb the reduction of removal efficiency caused by the stagnation of plant growth and the decrease of microbial activity in the low temperature condition is an inevitable defect in the application of traditional efb 42 at the same time the large area of plant lodging and the decomposition of decaying plant tissues would cause secondary pollution hence it is an urgent problem to improve the purification efficiency of the traditional efb in low temperature season when efb is applied in the practical engineering based on this many researchers have developed various methods to strengthen the efb system such as introducing the aeration device elastic filler fibre filler periphyton submerged plant aquatic animal and additional bacteria 43 44 however most of these strengthening methods still belonged to biological enhancements in essence which did not fundamentally solve the problem of efb purification efficiency decline caused by decreased biological activity in low temperature season in addition these methods also failed to avoid the secondary pollution caused by plant lodging and plant decomposition in efb as shown in table s3 the suspension of inorganic functional filler in this study greatly increased the system stability and purification efficiency of cefb and the improvement of removal efficiency was much higher than other strengthening methods as shown in fig s4 the inorganic functional fillers zeolite and sponge iron were suspended below the efb system to construct cefb in this study the high stability of cefb prevented the large area of plant lodging thereby reducing the contribution of plant tissue decomposition to the increase in pollutants concentration in water simultaneously the suspended functional filler could promote the removal of pollutants in water by adsorption cation exchange interception and coprecipitation and the removal effect was less affected by environmental conditions such as temperature moreover similar to other strengthening methods introduced with organic fillers the nylon mesh loaded with inorganic fillers in the cefb system provided the attachment sites for microbial reproduction thereby enhancing the removal of pollutants by microbial action 4 therefore the purification efficiency of the cefb system will still be better than that of the efb system under the combined action of multiple functions even if the adsorption of functional filler would reach saturation in a sufficiently long operation the nutrients concentration in the cefb zone was maintained at a low level throughout the test which was far less than the corresponding values in the control and efb zones the tn nh4 n and tp concentrations in the cefb zone could respectively reach the standard limit values of class iii 1 0 mg l 1 for tn ii 0 5 mg l 1 for nh4 n and iv 0 1 mg l 1 for tp chinese environmental quality standard for surface water gb3838 2002 except for the adaptation period of the plants at the beginning of the experiment in general the suspended inorganic functional fillers below the traditional efb could enhance the plant lodging resistance in the rainy season and the purification efficiency under low temperature condition thereby ensuring the stability efficiency and feasibility of the cefb system in the restoration of actual eutrophic water 3 7 suggestion for the future research and application of cefb as mentioned above the cefb constructed through suspending inorganic functional filler zeolite and sponge iron below efb could enhance the stability and plant lodging resistance of the cefb system meanwhile the adsorption cation exchange interception and co precipitation of the functional filler and the transformation of the microorganisms in the biofilm attached to the filler could increase the removal efficiency of the pollutants thus effectively avoiding the efb defect that the purification efficiency decline in the low temperature season on the other hand although the biological enhancement method has low adaptability to temperature it has the advantages of high safety and economy 45 therefore the combination of physicochemical and biological methods can be considered to improve the system stability and removal efficiency of traditional efb so as to reduce the subsequent management difficulty and economic cost under the premise of ensuring the purification efficiency of efb at low temperature condition 4 conclusions the effects of suspended inorganic functional fillers on the system stability and purification efficiency of cefb were studied through a two year field test the main conclusions were as follows 1 the suspension of inorganic fillers enhanced the system stability and plant lodging resistance of cefb and avoided the large area of plant lodging in the rainy season and secondary pollution caused by plant tissue decomposition 2 the introduction of functional fillers improved the purification efficiency of the cefb system compensated for the defect of low removal efficiency of traditional efb in the low temperature season and maintained the concentrations of tn nh4 n tp and po4 3 p in the cefb zone stably lower than 1 00 0 50 0 10 and 0 05 mg l 1 3 the average values of algae density and chl a concentration in the cefb zone were only 29 18 and 27 41 of those in the control zone which indicated that the water eutrophication was effectively controlled by cefb 4 unlike the significant increase in cod toc and dom concentrations mainly fulvic acid in the efb zone the organic matter concentration in the cefb zone was maintained at a low level throughout the test in summary the suspension of inorganic functional fillers enhanced the system stability plant lodging resistance and purification efficiency of cefb thus ensuring the feasibility efficiency and stability of cefb in the actual water restoration declaration of competing interest the authors do not have any possible conflicts of interest

13917,planting macrophytes can increase the contribution of plant uptake to pollutant removal in ecological floating bed efb however the low system stability of traditional efb often causes large area plant lodging during the rainy season this phenomenon not only reduces the ornamental value of efb but also causes the problem of secondary pollution furthermore the reduction of removal rate under low temperature condition is also an inevitable defect in the application of efb therefore a composite efb cefb was built by suspending inorganic functional filler below the traditional efb to remedy these defects results of a two year field test showed that the suspension of inorganic functional filler not only enhanced the system stability plant lodging resistance and removal efficiency of cefb but also fundamentally resolved the problem of low purification efficiency of the traditional efb during the low temperature season compared with efb cefb could increase the average removal rates of total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n total phosphorus tp phosphate po4 3 p turbidity algae density and chlorophyll a chl a by 46 85 53 97 44 45 54 55 53 63 42 16 and 29 79 respectively in addition cefb effectively avoided the great increase in organic matter concentration and the decline in sensory effects of the scenic water caused by plant lodging and plant tissue decomposition in general the suspension of inorganic functional filler could enhance the plant lodging resistance and purification efficiency of cefb evidently which is expected to become a feasible approach for eutrophic water restoration keywords inorganic functional filler composite ecological floating bed plant lodging resistance low temperature stability dissolved organic matter 1 introduction ecological floating bed efb is an environmental friendly water remediation technology that is evolved on the basis of traditional constructed wetland 1 this technology can remove the pollutants in water through plant uptake microbial transformation and natural sedimentation 2 compared with physical and chemical remediation methods efb has attracted increasing attention due to its advantages such as environmental friendly economical efficient safe and high ornamental characteristics and has been applied in the purification of eutrophic scenic water 3 in order to enhance the contribution of plant uptake to the removal of nutrients in water the researchers and environmental engineers tend to choose large aquatic plants such as canna calamus reeds iris etc to construct efb 4 7 however the system stability of traditional efb is usually low due to the difficulty of fixing buoyancy carriers in the actual application this difficulty makes the large plants prone to large scale lodging under strong wind or rainy conditions due to the raised centre of efb gravity plant lodging not only reduces the purification efficiency and ornamental value of efb but also easily causes secondary pollution due to the decomposition of plant tissues 8 therefore some measures need be taken to increase the system stability of efb during the application of large plants in the efb construction nevertheless there are few relevant studies nowadays plant uptake and microbial degradation are the main mechanisms of pollutant removal in efb 9 the plant growth and microbial activity would sharply decrease during the low temperature season this decrease would result in a decline in the purification efficiency of efb 10 11 many scholars developed various strengthening efb by introducing aeration device elastic packing submerged plants and additional bacteria in the traditional efb system to solve the aforementioned problem of efb 12 13 in most cases these strengthening methods belonged to biological enhancement and their removal efficiencies were still affected by temperature 14 15 in addition the existing studies on efb mainly focused on the changes in inorganic nutrients in water most of these studies were conducted during the high temperature season through small scale laboratory experiments 16 17 however there were few long term field studies on the plant lodging resistance of efb during windy and rainy seasons the purification efficiency of efb in low temperature condition and the impacts of efb application on organic matter in water the current research aims to develop a new composite efb cefb based on the above discussion to enhance the system stability and removal efficiency of the traditional efb zeolite and sponge iron are common inorganic functional fillers which can efficiently remove ammonia nh4 and phosphate po4 3 in water by adsorption cation exchange interception and co precipitation 18 19 in addition the removal effect of zeolite and sponge iron is less affected by environmental conditions such as temperature 20 meanwhile the counterweight effect of inorganic fillers could theoretically enhance the stability of efb and plant lodging resistance moreover the suspended fillers could provide attachment sites for microbial propagation thereby promoting the pollutant removal in water by strengthening microbial transformation and pollutant interception 4 therefore a novel cefb was constructed by suspending the nylon mesh filled with zeolite and sponge iron below the traditional efb system in this study a two year field test was also conducted to compare the differences in the performances of efb and cefb in terms of purifying the actual scenic water supplied with reclaimed water the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to explore the effects of suspended inorganic functional fillers on the plant lodging resistance and purification efficiency of cefb 2 to study the influences of plant lodging plant tissue decomposition and functional filler suspension on the organic matter in water 3 to provide a feasible strategy for guaranteeing the system stability and purification efficiency of efb in the actual water remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the experiment was conducted in an urban park of north western china a closed zone with an area of 326 m2 and an effective water depth of 0 65 m was enclosed and divided into three equal zones by using foam filled steel plates the zone without any processing was regarded as the control and the two other zones with additional efb and cefb systems were treated as the experimental groups the efb was constructed by planting four native aquatic plants calamus iris lythrum and hydrocotyle vulgaris on the polyethylene buoyancy carrier and the corresponding plant coverage and density were 45 and 10 plants m 2 respectively the nylon mesh loaded with zeolite and sponge iron was suspended below the efb to construct the cefb and the suspended amounts of the inorganic functional fillers were 5 5 kg zeolite m 2 cefb and 6 5 kg sponge iron m 2 cefb respectively the filler characteristics are summarised in table 1 the water injected firstly and supplemented later in the test was the reclaimed water after the advanced treatment of domestic sewage the water quality parameters of the reclaimed water are listed in table s1 throughout the test the frequency and quantity of every water replenishment in different zones were similar and the corresponding mean values were every 25 2 2 1 days and 16 2 0 8 m3 respectively as shown in fig s1 the experiment lasted 600 days from july 19 2016 to march 16 2018 in order to comprehensively study the effects of filler suspension on the system stability and removal efficiency of the cefb as well as the impacts of plant lodging and plant decomposition on water quality the completely withered stems and leaves of calamus and lythrum in the efb and cefb systems were harvested until the end of the chinese lunar year january 15 and december 20 2017 due to the requirement of park management meanwhile those of iris and hydrocotyle vulgaris remained green all year round without harvesting 2 2 sampling the conventional water samples were collected twice a month and each sampling was performed at 9 00 am the samples located 30 cm below the water surface at the centre and surrounding locations of each zone were collected and the average value of the analysis results for every five sampling points was taken as the representative value of water quality in each zone the ph dissolved oxygen do and temperature t were measured on site meanwhile other indicators namely total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n total phosphorus tp phosphate po4 3 p chemical oxygen demand cod algal density chlorophyll a chl a and turbidity were analysed in the key laboratory of northwest water resource environment and ecology moe all abbreviations of nouns and the corresponding full names in the manuscript are listed in table s2 furthermore the concentrations of total organic carbon toc and the main components of dissolved organic matter dom in different zones were respectively measured on july 15 september 15 and november 15 2017 to analyse the impacts of plant lodging on the concentration and species of organic matter in water the specific method of water sample collection was the same as mentioned above 2 3 sample analysis t do and ph were monitored using a hach portable multifunctional water quality meter hq 30d tn nh4 n tp po4 3 p chl a and turbidity were analysed using a uv vis spectrophotometer xinmao752 n cod was tested through potassium dichromate oxidation and ammonium ferrous sulphate titration while the algae density was measured through microscopic examination and counting toc was measured via a german element toc analyser vario toc cube and the main composition of dom in the water was analysed using a fluorescence spectrophotometer fp6500 2 4 removal efficiency the removal efficiency e of efb and cefb for various pollutants in water was calculated as follows 1 e e f b c e f b c c o n t r o l c e f b c e f b c c o n t r o l 100 where ccontrol cefb and ccefb are the measurement values of pollutants concentrations in the control efb and cefb zones at the same sampling time respectively 2 5 statistical analysis excel and origin 9 0 software were used to process the test data and plot the figures meanwhile the ibm spss statistics 22 0 software was used to test the significance of the mean values and homogeneity of the variance the latter was further investigated using the f test method and the values of the former were compared using paired sample t tests with a significance level of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 difference in plant lodging resistances between the efb and cefb systems fig 1 shows the field photos of plant growth in efb and cefb systems during mid september 2016 and early august 2017 corresponding to the 2nd and 13th months of the experiment as mentioned previously the plant species density and plant coverage in both the cefb and efb systems were same however the former was constructed by suspending the nylon mesh loaded with inorganic fillers below the efb system as shown in fig 1 the plants in the efb and cefb systems exhibited satisfactory growth and no plant lodging occurred in 2016 due to the relatively small plant height after the adaptation period of the hydroponic culture the plants vigorously grew during the summer and autumn of 2017 in which an obvious increase in plant height and tiller number was observed however the large plant height increased the plant lodging potential and the system stability of traditional efb declined due to the raised centre of the efb gravity this phenomenon eventually resulted in large area plant lodging in the efb system during the rainy season of 2017 june to september despite experiencing the same wind and rain disturbances as those of the plants in the efb system the plants in the cefb system exhibited excellent growth and only a few plant lodging phenomena occurred throughout the test according to the statistics after the heavy rains in early august 2017 the plant lodging percentage in the efb system could reach 83 26 while the corresponding value in the cefb system was only 2 17 table 1 shows that the densities of zeolite and sponge iron used in this experiment were 1 96 and 2 38 g cm 3 these fillers played an important role in balancing the raised centre of bed system due to plant growth consequently the inorganic filler in the cefb system acted as a counterweight to stabilise the bed system thereby resisting plant lodging in the windy and rainy seasons in other words enhancing the plant lodging resistance during windy and rainy seasons is feasible by suspending the inorganic filler below the buoyancy carrier to serve as the counterweight this method could also guarantee the operation stability of the cefb system 3 2 difference in physicochemical parameters of the different zones fig 2 shows the time course of physicochemical parameters t do ph and turbidity in different zones as shown in fig 2 the water temperature in different zones was similar compared with the control efb effectively reduced the turbidity and did not affect the do and ph before july 2017 however the do concentration and ph value in the efb zone drastically decreased after this period while the turbidity increased by contrast the do concentration and ph value in the cefb zone were close to those of the control zone throughout the test and the turbidity was steadily lower than those in the control and efb zones fig 2 a shows that the water temperature in different zones was similar and the maximum and minimum values during the experiment were 30 2 c and 3 4 c respectively throughout the test the average values of water temperature in the control efb and cefb zones were 16 4 8 63 15 8 7 12 and 15 6 6 96 c respectively thus efb and cefb had no significant impact on water temperature p 0 768 fig 2 b indicates that the do concentrations in the control and cefb zones fluctuated with the changes in water supply and environmental conditions however these values were generally close p 0 520 and higher than 5 00 mg l 1 in the whole experiment meanwhile the do concentration in the cefb zone was slightly higher than that in the control during the vigorous period of plant growth march september 2017 while slightly lower than control during the stagnant period of plant growth october 2017 february 2018 this phenomenon could be attributed to the oxygen produced by plant photosynthesis and transmitted to water through root system in the plant vigorous stage while the plant photosynthesis was weak in the plant stagnant period and the buoyancy carrier hindered oxygen enrichment from the atmosphere 21 22 the do concentration in the efb zone was close to those in the control and cefb zones before july 2017 but the value continuously decreased due to plant lodging and reached the lowest value of 2 77 mg l 1 in the mid december 2017 although the do concentration in the efb zone showed an upward trend due to plant harvesting in the later period i e december 20 2017 the value was still lower than those in the control and cefb zones the average do concentrations in the control efb and cefb zones were 8 23 1 35 5 85 2 01 and 8 52 1 26 mg l 1 respectively which indicated that the average do concentration in the efb zone was significantly lower than those in the control p 0 003 and cefb p 0 000 zones therefore the suspension of the inorganic filler avoided the plant lodging during the rainy season and ensured the do concentration in water at a high level for a long time fig 2 c shows that the plant uptake of carbon dioxide and the ionization of sodium aluminosilicate in zeolite resulted in a slightly higher ph value of cefb zone than that of the control 23 however plants also secrete protons and organic acids during their growth thus yielding marginally lower ph values of efb than those of control especially in the period of plant lodging the low do concentration promoted the decomposition and decay of plant tissues thus accelerating the decline in ph in the efb zone 24 the normal ph of scenic water is in a weak alkaline condition whilst that in the efb zone was in a weak acid environment due to plant tissue decomposition reaching the minimum value 6 43 on december 15 2017 25 the average ph values in the control efb and cefb zones were 7 82 0 33 7 38 0 51 and 8 01 0 26 respectively which showed the standard deviation value of ph in the cefb zone was minimum amongst the three zones therefore cefb could stably maintain the ph of the water system in a normal range while the ph value in efb decreased due to plant lodging and plant decomposition fig 2 d shows that the turbidity in the control and efb zones considerably fluctuated with the changes in water supply environmental conditions and plant growth whilst that in the cefb zone was stable at a low level throughout the test the turbidity in efb was lower than that in control before july 2017 due to the interception of plant roots and the adsorption of biofilms attached to the plant roots 26 afterwards the turbidity in the efb system was continuously increased due to plant lodging and decomposition of decaying tissue and was higher than that of control from september 2017 to the end of the experiment by contrast the suspension of inorganic fillers in cefb effectively avoided plant lodging in the rainy season at the same time as an excellent flocculant the fe3 and fe2 from the sponge iron respectively promoted the flocculation and sedimentation of suspended solids in water and reduced the turbidity in the cefb zone 27 throughout the test the mean values of turbidity in the control efb and cefb zones were 14 47 4 08 11 02 5 13 and 3 26 1 28 ntu respectively therefore the average removal efficiencies of turbidity in the efb and cefb zones were 23 84 and 77 47 p 0 002 and p 0 000 respectively and the purification efficiency of cefb on turbidity was significantly higher than that of efb p 0 000 in general the suspension of inorganic fillers in the cefb system could stably maintain the do concentration in water at a high level efficiently reduce the turbidity and maintain the ph value in the normal range throughout the test 3 3 difference in nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations of the different zones fig 3 shows the variation trends of tn nh4 n tp and po4 3 p concentrations in the same zone were similar and the concentrations of these parameters in the three zones followed the sequence of control efb cefb fig 3 shows the concentrations of tn nh4 n tp and po4 3 p in the efb zone were always lower than those of control before july 2017 and then the nutrients concentration substantially increased and exceeded that in control due to plant lodging and plant tissue decomposition by contrast the high stability of cefb system could effectively avoid plant lodging and the functional fillers of zeolite and sponge iron could promote the removal of nh4 and po4 3 in water through adsorption ion exchange and coprecipitation 28 meanwhile the suspended fillers in cefb could provide the attachment sites for microbial propagation thus increasing the contribution of microbial transformation and filler interception to pollutant removal 29 furthermore the purification effect of efb in high temperature seasons july to october 2016 and april to june 2017 was better than that in low temperature seasons january to march 2017 this phenomenon is due to the high plant uptake rate and microbial activity in high temperature conditions 30 however the purification efficiency of cefb remained stable at a high level throughout the test during the entire experiment the average tn concentrations in the control efb and cefb zones were 2 19 0 61 1 87 0 73 and 0 84 0 22 mg l 1 respectively while the average nh4 n concentrations were 1 26 0 15 1 03 0 33 and 0 35 0 08 mg l 1 respectively on the other side the average tp concentrations in the control efb and cefb zones were 0 18 0 07 0 14 0 05 and 0 06 0 01 mg l 1 respectively while the corresponding po4 3 p concentrations were 0 11 0 06 0 09 0 04 and 0 03 0 01 mg l 1 respectively therefore the average removal efficiencies of tn nh4 n tp and po4 3 p in the cefb zone were 61 46 72 22 66 67 and 72 73 respectively which were correspondingly 46 85 53 97 44 45 and 54 55 higher than the corresponding values in the efb zone p 0 01 in conclusion the counterweight function of inorganic fillers resisted plant lodging of the cefb in the windy and rainy season which further ensured a high and stable removal of nutrients in water through the synergistic actions of adsorption ion exchange interception and coprecipitation of the functional fillers 3 4 difference in algae density and chl a concentration of the different zones fig 4 shows the change trends of algae density and chl a concentration in different zones where both the algae density and chl a concentration in the cefb zone were the lowest figs 1 and 4 indicate that the changing trends in algae density and chl a concentration in different zones were similar to temperature variation and those in the cefb zone were far less than those in the control and efb zones the high nutrients concentration and sufficient light condition in the control zone promoted the reproduction of phytoplankton 31 these conditions simultaneously resulted in significantly higher algae density and chl a concentration in the control zone than those in the efb and cefb zones p 0 03 the light shielding effects of buoyancy carrier and aquatic plant in the efb and cefb zones could inhibit the phytoplankton growth to a certain extent and the low nutrients concentration in the cefb zone had evident inhibitory effect on algae growth 32 in addition the algae density and chl a concentration of the control and efb zones in 2017 were all higher than those in 2016 this finding is due to some tolerance of algae for the residual chlorine in the reclaimed water with the experiment processing 33 throughout the test the average values of algae density in the control efb and cefb zones were 1120 19 105 1144 799 21 105 762 and 326 86 105 268 cells l 1 while the corresponding values of chl a concentration were 49 88 28 19 28 53 16 21 and 13 67 4 32 μg l 1 respectively the average value of algae density in the cefb zone was 29 18 p 0 000 and 40 90 p 0 001 in the control and efb zones and the corresponding chl a concentration accounted for 27 41 p 0 000 and 47 91 p 0 000 respectively therefore the light shielding effect of the buoyancy carrier and the low nutrients concentration in the cefb zone could effectively inhibit the algae growth in water thereby keeping the water eutrophication at a low level in the whole test 3 5 difference in organic matter of the different zones 3 5 1 cod and toc concentrations fig 5 shows the concentration changes in cod and toc in different zones where cod and toc in the cefb zone maintained the lowest concentration as shown in fig 5 a the cod concentration in the efb zone was higher than that in control during the decay and decomposition periods of plant tissue october 2016 to february 2017 and september 2017 to february 2018 respectively while lower than that in control in the vigorous period of plant growth the developed plant roots could remove part of the suspended organic matter in water by interception and sedimentation during the plant growth process 34 meanwhile the microorganisms in the biofilm attached to plant roots would also consume part of the organic matter through assimilation and transformation thereby achieving the removal of cod in water 29 however the plant lodging and decomposition of decaying plant tissues resulted in the sharp increase in cod concentration in efb zone and exceeded control because twice plant harvesting were conducted in winter january 15 2017 and december 20 2017 in this experiment although the cod concentration in the cefb zone was also raised in winter the increased extent was much smaller than that of efb due to the strong resistance of plant lodging moreover the suspended inorganic functional filler further increased the removal of cod in the cefb zone by combining the adsorption of dissolved organic matter interception of suspended organic matter and transformation of biofilm microorganisms 35 during the entire experiment the average cod concentrations in the control efb and cefb zones were 45 58 9 37 49 54 13 94 and 33 20 9 62 mg l 1 respectively therefore the cefb zone maintained the lowest cod concentration in water and avoided the obvious increase of cod concentration caused by plant lodging and plant tissue decomposition fig 5 b shows the toc concentration of three zones in mid july mid september and mid november of 2017 all the toc concentrations in different zones demonstrated an upward trend with time however the increasing trend of toc concentration in the efb zone was considerably larger than those in the control and cefb zones plant lodging in efb resulted in the earlier decay period of plant tissue than that of the cefb zone meanwhile the decrease in do concentration due to plant lodging substantially accelerated the decomposition of decaying plant tissue thus the toc concentration in the water of the efb zone significantly increased in the autumn and winter of 2017 by contrast the strong resistance to plant lodging in cefb and the adsorption of functional fillers effectively avoided the aforementioned phenomenon in the cefb zone the average toc concentrations in the control efb and cefb zones were 12 09 0 86 17 21 2 53 and 10 07 0 67 mg l 1 respectively therefore the mean value of toc concentration in the cefb zone was 83 29 p 0 046 and 58 51 p 0 028 of those in control and efb zones respectively although the decomposition of decaying plant tissues would increase the cod and toc concentrations in water the strong plant lodging resistance in cefb effectively delayed the decay period of plants meanwhile the adsorption sedimentation and interception of functional fillers also promoted the removal of organics thus the concentrations of cod and toc in the cefb zone were stably lower than those in the control and efb zones 3 5 2 dom species fig 6 shows the eem fluorescence spectra of dom in different zones at various stages the figure demonstrates that protein was the main component of dom in control while humic acid was the main form of dom in the efb and cefb zones in addition the intensity changes of the various fluorescence peaks indicate the dom concentration in water increased with time fig 6 a1 a2 and a3 shows two main fluorescence peaks in control the corresponding excitation e x and emission e m wavelengths were e x e m 230 340 nm t1 peak and e x e m 280 340 nm t2 peak respectively among them the t1 peak is the common protein tryptophan fluorescence peak and the corresponding fluorescence intensities in a1 a2 and a3 were 317 3 329 6 and 387 1 respectively meanwhile the t2 peak is the fluorescence peak of proteolytic microbial metabolites and the corresponding fluorescence intensities in a1 a2 and a3 were 211 1 219 3 and 276 8 respectively 36 in addition a fulvic acid fluorescence peak e x e m 235 410 nm appeared in control on november 15 2017 corresponding to a fluorescence intensity of 283 1 37 therefore the protein was the main component of dom in control from july to november 2017 and the protein concentration in water was increased with time ly et al reported that the protein components produced by biological sources in water mainly came from the catabolism of plankton aquatic bacteria and algae 38 as mentioned previously the high nutrients concentration in control promoted the growth of phytoplankton and the catabolism of algae increased protein concentration in water three fluorescence peaks e x e m 240 435 nm the fulvic acid fluorescence peak in the ultraviolet light area e x e m 325 430 nm the fulvic acid fluorescence peak in the visible light area and e x e m 230 345 nm the protein tryptophan fluorescence peak appeared in fig 6 b1 and their corresponding fluorescence intensities were 278 1 229 9 and 246 3 respectively in fig 6 b2 four fluorescence peaks e x e m 230 340 nm e x e m 235 430 nm e x e m 250 430 nm and e x e m 335 435 nm were the protein tryptophan fluorescence peak the fulvic acid fluorescence peak in the ultraviolet light area the fulvic acid fluorescence peak in the ultraviolet light area and the fulvic acid fluorescence peak in the visible light area respectively 39 the corresponding fluorescence intensities were 349 3 375 8 361 5 and 302 2 in fig 6 b3 three fluorescence peaks e x e m 240 435 nm e x e m 355 435 nm and e x e m 230 340 nm were the fulvic acid fluorescence peak in the ultraviolet light area the fulvic acid fluorescence peak in the visible light area and the protein tryptophan fluorescence peak and the corresponding fluorescence intensities were 399 7 342 3 and 501 5 respectively therefore the dom in the efb zone was mainly humic acid fulvic acid and its concentration in water was also increased with time the poor stability of efb resulted in plant lodging in early july 2017 due to heavy rain this condition increased the humic acid concentration in water due to the decay and decomposition of plant tissues only one fluorescence peak was presented in fig 6 c1 and the corresponding substance and fluorescence intensity were the fulvic acid fluorescence peak in the ultraviolet light area e x e m 235 410 nm and 263 2 the fulvic acid in the ultraviolet light area e x e m 240 410 nm and that in the visible light area e x e m 335 415 nm in fig 6 c2 and c3 were the main forms of dom in cefb of mid september 2017 and mid november 2017 and the corresponding fluorescence intensities were 265 1 and 267 3 for fulvic acid in the ultraviolet light area 217 5 and 223 1 for fulvic acid in the visible light area the low nutrients concentration in the cefb zone resulted in a low algae density thereby reducing the contribution of phytoplankton catabolism to the protein concentration in water meanwhile the high stability of the cefb system avoided plant lodging and delayed plant decay thereby slowing the increase in humic acid concentration in water therefore the suspension of inorganic fillers avoided a substantial increase in the humic acid concentration in water which was usually caused by plant lodging and plant tissue decomposition meanwhile the introduction of functional filler decreased the contribution of algae catabolism to protein concentration in water due to the reduction of the nutrient concentration in water 3 6 advantages of cefb in actual scenic water purification 3 6 1 high stability of cefb system the large plant is often selected to construct the efb system thus enhancing the contribution of plant uptake to pollutants removal in water 40 however the relatively large velocity of the actual water the complex environmental conditions and the difficulty in anchoring result in low system stability of traditional efb in practical applications thus large plants and low efb stability often cause large area plant lodging during the windy and rainy seasons as shown in fig s2 a large area of plant lodging occurred in efb in the rainy summer of 2017 due to its low system stability which resulted in a sharp drop in the do concentration plant lodging caused the early decay period of plant tissues while low do concentration accelerated the decomposition of withered plant tissues this phenomenon not only obviously reduced the purification efficiency of efb but also obviously increased the nutrients concentration in water especially organic matter concentration the organic matter produced by plant tissue decomposition is mainly fulvic acid as a common chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom fulvic acid would increase the turbidity and chroma while reduce the transparency of water thereby greatly reducing the sensory effect of the scenic water as shown in fig s3 41 in addition the high concentration of organic matter in efb led to the large scale reproduction of azolla which would aggravate the anoxic phenomenon and plant tissue decomposition in water thereby resulting in the collapse of water ecosystems in serious cases in comparison the large density of inorganic filler enhanced the stability of the cefb system and the plant lodging resistance through the counterweight effect of inorganic filler therefore despite experiencing the same disturbance of wind and rain in summer the plants in cefb still grew well and very few of plant lodging occurred throughout the test the better plant growth ensured the high level of do concentration in cefb and delayed the coming of the decay period of plant tissues previous research has shown that the plant roots still had a certain activity even with the entrance of plant stems and leaves into the stagnation period 26 in this experiment the strong plant lodging resistance in cefb avoided the direct contact between the ground tissues of decaying plants and water thus greatly reducing the contribution of plant decomposition to the increase in pollutant concentration in water although dom sources in the cefb zone included endogenous production and exogenous influx its strong plant lodging resistance low algae density less plant tissue decomposition and adsorption of organic matter by functional fillers resulted in the lowest concentrations of cod toc dom and cdom in the cefb zone therefore the cefb system guaranteed the ornamental value of the scenic water while the lower organic matter concentration in water effectively avoided the reproduction of azolla overall the suspension of high density inorganic filler could effectively enhance the system stability of cefb and the plant lodging resistance thus avoiding the defects caused by the decomposition of decaying plant tissues such as the significant increase in the organic matter concentration the mass propagation of azolla and the obvious decline in the sensory effect of the scenic water 3 6 2 strong purification efficiency of cefb the reduction of removal efficiency caused by the stagnation of plant growth and the decrease of microbial activity in the low temperature condition is an inevitable defect in the application of traditional efb 42 at the same time the large area of plant lodging and the decomposition of decaying plant tissues would cause secondary pollution hence it is an urgent problem to improve the purification efficiency of the traditional efb in low temperature season when efb is applied in the practical engineering based on this many researchers have developed various methods to strengthen the efb system such as introducing the aeration device elastic filler fibre filler periphyton submerged plant aquatic animal and additional bacteria 43 44 however most of these strengthening methods still belonged to biological enhancements in essence which did not fundamentally solve the problem of efb purification efficiency decline caused by decreased biological activity in low temperature season in addition these methods also failed to avoid the secondary pollution caused by plant lodging and plant decomposition in efb as shown in table s3 the suspension of inorganic functional filler in this study greatly increased the system stability and purification efficiency of cefb and the improvement of removal efficiency was much higher than other strengthening methods as shown in fig s4 the inorganic functional fillers zeolite and sponge iron were suspended below the efb system to construct cefb in this study the high stability of cefb prevented the large area of plant lodging thereby reducing the contribution of plant tissue decomposition to the increase in pollutants concentration in water simultaneously the suspended functional filler could promote the removal of pollutants in water by adsorption cation exchange interception and coprecipitation and the removal effect was less affected by environmental conditions such as temperature moreover similar to other strengthening methods introduced with organic fillers the nylon mesh loaded with inorganic fillers in the cefb system provided the attachment sites for microbial reproduction thereby enhancing the removal of pollutants by microbial action 4 therefore the purification efficiency of the cefb system will still be better than that of the efb system under the combined action of multiple functions even if the adsorption of functional filler would reach saturation in a sufficiently long operation the nutrients concentration in the cefb zone was maintained at a low level throughout the test which was far less than the corresponding values in the control and efb zones the tn nh4 n and tp concentrations in the cefb zone could respectively reach the standard limit values of class iii 1 0 mg l 1 for tn ii 0 5 mg l 1 for nh4 n and iv 0 1 mg l 1 for tp chinese environmental quality standard for surface water gb3838 2002 except for the adaptation period of the plants at the beginning of the experiment in general the suspended inorganic functional fillers below the traditional efb could enhance the plant lodging resistance in the rainy season and the purification efficiency under low temperature condition thereby ensuring the stability efficiency and feasibility of the cefb system in the restoration of actual eutrophic water 3 7 suggestion for the future research and application of cefb as mentioned above the cefb constructed through suspending inorganic functional filler zeolite and sponge iron below efb could enhance the stability and plant lodging resistance of the cefb system meanwhile the adsorption cation exchange interception and co precipitation of the functional filler and the transformation of the microorganisms in the biofilm attached to the filler could increase the removal efficiency of the pollutants thus effectively avoiding the efb defect that the purification efficiency decline in the low temperature season on the other hand although the biological enhancement method has low adaptability to temperature it has the advantages of high safety and economy 45 therefore the combination of physicochemical and biological methods can be considered to improve the system stability and removal efficiency of traditional efb so as to reduce the subsequent management difficulty and economic cost under the premise of ensuring the purification efficiency of efb at low temperature condition 4 conclusions the effects of suspended inorganic functional fillers on the system stability and purification efficiency of cefb were studied through a two year field test the main conclusions were as follows 1 the suspension of inorganic fillers enhanced the system stability and plant lodging resistance of cefb and avoided the large area of plant lodging in the rainy season and secondary pollution caused by plant tissue decomposition 2 the introduction of functional fillers improved the purification efficiency of the cefb system compensated for the defect of low removal efficiency of traditional efb in the low temperature season and maintained the concentrations of tn nh4 n tp and po4 3 p in the cefb zone stably lower than 1 00 0 50 0 10 and 0 05 mg l 1 3 the average values of algae density and chl a concentration in the cefb zone were only 29 18 and 27 41 of those in the control zone which indicated that the water eutrophication was effectively controlled by cefb 4 unlike the significant increase in cod toc and dom concentrations mainly fulvic acid in the efb zone the organic matter concentration in the cefb zone was maintained at a low level throughout the test in summary the suspension of inorganic functional fillers enhanced the system stability plant lodging resistance and purification efficiency of cefb thus ensuring the feasibility efficiency and stability of cefb in the actual water restoration declaration of competing interest the authors do not have any possible conflicts of interest

13918,the performance of a continuous system that sequentially couples a column filled with zero valent iron with a photo fenton reactor was evaluated under mild acidic conditions studies were conducted to evaluate the better coupling strategy between each treatment module and to analyze the effects of several operational parameters on the system behaviour the azo dye acid black 1 was chosen as model pollutant decolourization degrees and decreases of toc values were used for the evaluation of the treatment performance under different conditions whereas steady state concentrations of fe ii fe iii and h2o2 together with spectral features in the uv vis region were analysed to elucidate mechanistic issues the response surface methodology approach based on a central composite design was used to evaluate and model the effects of key factors on the decolourization degrees results show that the spatial separation between the zvi and h2o2 may lead to substantial improvements of treatment efficiencies provided that configurations involving recirculation loops are avoided besides a strict and continuous ph control during the oxidative stage is critical for obtaining a stable operation and acceptable decolourization efficiencies through the coupled system the simple parameters developed from uv vis spectra allowed monitoring the extent of reductive and oxidative transformation pathways in addition the statistical analysis shows that reactor ph and hydraulic residence time are the key factors influencing the system response whereas initial ph and added oxidant concentration are much less significant the conclusions drawn are relevant from a technological viewpoint since allow a rational design of cost effective treatments keywords zvi fenton continuous flow mode azo dye response surface methodology 1 introduction wastewater treatment techniques based on zero valent iron zvi are promising strategies due to the low cost of involved materials the versatility for treating a wide variety of pollutants and the possibility to design efficient systems for continuous operation 1 in particular zvi related treatments have proven to successfully eliminate azo dyes 2 4 which are among the most common organic pollutants present in textile wastewater 3 5 azo dyes are difficult to degrade by means of biological methods because of their complex structure and recalcitrant nature 6 7 the elimination of organic compounds in the presence of zvi may proceed through reductive and or oxidative pathways depending on the chemical nature of the substrate and the operative conditions 3 8 pollutant reduction is driven by the electrochemical corrosion of iron in which a two electrons transfer yields fe ii species in the case of azo compounds the transformation involves the following stoichiometry 9 1 r n n r 2 fe 4 h r nh2 h2n r 2 fe ii despite reductive processes may lead to important decolourization degrees mineralization cannot be achieved and the resulting amines are usually more toxic for aquatic organisms than the parent compounds 10 11 to circumvent this problem several authors have suggested coupling the reductive transformation to a subsequent step of biological or chemical oxidation 12 14 fenton processes are a family of well known techniques for chemical oxidation based on the transformation of organic pollutants in the presence of h2o2 and iron salts the latter processes are driven by the production of hydroxyl radicals ho 2 fe ii h2o2 fe iii ho ho 3 h o organic substrates o 2 o 2 oxidation products as iron salts are usually added in catalytic amounts treatment performance is limited by fe ii regeneration through different fe iii reducing pathways 4 fe iii h2o2 fe ii ho2 h 5 fe iii hv oh fe ii ho reactions 4 and 5 are rate limiting steps for fenton like and photo fenton processes respectively photo fenton processes are frequently preferred since they are faster and achieve much higher mineralization degrees than fenton like processes 15 however the major drawback of both techniques is the drastic reduction of catalytic activity at ph values above 3 5 due to the insolubility of fe iii species therefore many strategies have been explored to minimize the costs associated with ph adjustments by extending the operative ph range 16 17 several authors have proposed to use zvi corrosion as source of fe ii species in combination with externally added h2o2 the process is usually called zvi assisted fenton reaction 18 21 as fe ii is continuously generated it was suggested that zvi assisted fenton processes could effectively work at ph values where homogeneous fenton techniques are limited 18 moreover since the transformation of organic contaminants may occur through both reductive and oxidative reaction pathways pollutants difficult to oxidize may be initially reduced to yield less recalcitrant structures and subsequently oxidized by ho radicals 12 the latter strategy resulted particularly important for aromatic compounds bearing strong deactivation groups 12 19 22 25 despite the potential advantages of zvi assisted fenton processes upon increasing ph zvi air and zvi h2o2 systems exhibited important decreases in both degradation efficiencies and pollutant transformation rates 2 11 20 21 26 28 recent mechanistic studies have shown that the simultaneous use of zvi and h2o2 substantially decreases the overall treatment performance at ph values above 4 5 3 briefly with increasing ph the corrosion layer developed on the zvi surface substantially decreases the release of aqueous fe ii species thus dropping the homogeneous production of ho radicals reaction 2 moreover due to the low fe ii concentration the heterogeneous reaction between h2o2 and the zvi surface becomes the major pathway of peroxide consumption 3 6 2fe0 2h2o2 4h 2fe ii 4h2o noteworthy this reaction leads to a significant decrease of treatment rates due to both a drastic inhibition of oxidative transformation pathways 3 and to an early exhaustion of zvi reductive capacity in order to avoid this worthless consumption of reactants the overall process may be spatially split into two stages a reduction step where the contaminated solution is exposed to zvi and an oxidative step where iron ions released by zvi corrosion are used to trigger fenton processes moreover since the continuous flow operation mode may facilitate the process scaling up direct coupling between both stages seems advisable relatively few articles have focused their research in this direction moon et al 25 demonstrated that spacing in time zvi corrosion and h2o2 addition leads to an improvement of orange ii degradation efficiency in comparison with the simultaneous use of zvi and h2o2 le et al 19 coupled a zvi reduction batch with a fenton oxidation batch for degrading chloronitrobenzene using a similar strategy jiang 29 proposed an integrated system for nitrobenzene degradation where reduction and oxidation steps take place in separated batch reactors other authors 12 14 used recirculation systems that continuously pumped the effluent between a zvi filled column for reductive transformations and a fenton reactor for oxidative processes upon h2o2 addition unfortunately a small number of setup designs coupling zvi column beds with fenton reactors in a continuous flow mode were reported 22 30 some authors used the passage through a zvi column for a reductive treatment but did not completely exploit the iron ions produced during corrosion since they added ferrous salts on the oxidation step 23 30 to the best of our knowledge barreto rodriguez et al 22 published the only work that profited from zvi corrosion for driving a latter fenton stage in a strictly continuous flow operation mode with the latter strategy an effective treatment of tnt was achieved however since the model effluents exhibited ph values around 1 5 treatment efficiency was evaluated under rather strong acidic conditions this is not the case for other types of effluents such as textile ones that are typically neutral or even basic 31 the objective of the present work was to assess a continuous flow treatment setup that integrates a zvi induced reduction stage followed by a photo fenton driven oxidation stage under steady state conditions at mild ph values the azo dye acid black 1 ab1 widely used for the production of textiles and leather was chosen as model pollutant since it can cause genotoxic and mutagenic effects 32 coupling strategies concerning oxidant exploitation and ph control scheme were studied in addition several parameters were investigated to explore mechanistic issues and to optimize process efficiency optimal experimental design and response surface methodology were applied to develop a simple model capable of quantitatively describing the system performance within the experimental domain studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents commercial steel wool

presented in sections 3 1 to 3 3 were obtained from the average of at least two measurements 2 3 analytical methods fe ii and fe iii concentrations were determined by colorimetric procedures in the presence of o phenanthroline and scn respectively as described elsewhere 3 both filtered and unfiltered samples yielded within experimental error the same fe ii concentrations showing that insoluble fe ii species are negligible for the conditions tested in contrast due to the insolubility of ferric species within the ph range studied fe iii levels significantly decreased upon filtration hence total fe iii levels reported herein are based on the results obtained from unfiltered samples h2o2 concentration was measured by an enzymatic colorimetric method employing a commercial kit from wiener

presents the application of the surface response methodology srm for assessing the decolourization performance through the integrated system under different reaction conditions 3 1 coupling strategy 3 1 1 column performance in the presence of h2o2 as stated in the introduction some authors 36 37 have pointed out that the reaction between zvi and h2o2 eq 6 can be advantageous for zvi assisted fenton systems since it provides an additional pathway for fe ii generation however recent studies performed in batch systems 3 have shown that the latter reaction may be undesirable because it consumes the oxidant in processes which do not contribute to the oxidation of target pollutants in fenton systems therefore some recirculation systems have been proposed 12 14 to physically separate reductive and oxidative pathways of pollutant transformation despite the latter configuration improves the treatment performance with respect to batch designs unless h2o2 is completely consumed during the fenton stage an excess of peroxide may reach the zvi bed in order to assess the potential effect of the occurrence of reaction 6 within zvi columns that are coupled to fenton reactors by setups that involve recirculation among both modules solutions containing 5 mm na2so4 and different h2o2 concentrations 0 0 1 0 mm were pumped through the zvi column until stabilization about 40 min steady state fe ii and h2o2 concentrations monitored at the column outlet cout are shown in fig 1 in all cases most of the feeding h2o2 80 was consumed during its passage through the column fig 1a in addition as the inlet h2o2 concentration increases the concentration of fe ii species recorded at the column outlet decreases fig 1b a closer inspection of fig 1b reveals that in the absence of h2o2 concentrations of fe ii of about 0 15 mm are recorded at the column outlet it is important to note that under the working ph conditions dissolved oxygen not only reacts with zvi to produce fe ii species but also may participate in the subsequent oxidation of fe ii to yield fe iii species consequently the significant fe ii levels recorded at the column outlet in the absence of h2o2 indicate that an important fraction of the fe ii produced by the o2 mediated corrosion of zvi remains as soluble ferrous species in contrast for h2o2 concentrations of 1 mm at the column inlet negligible fe ii levels were recorded at the column effluent hence in the presence of h2o2 ferrous ions produced during the first steps of zvi corrosion mediated by either o2 or h2o2 are almost quantitatively oxidized to ferric species moreover under the studied ph conditions fe iii species are mostly retained within the zvi bed due to their rather low solubility this is clearly evidenced by the high generation of reddish brown oxides within the zvi column after pumping a solution 8 mm in h2o2 during 1 h fig s2a this behaviour was not observed when only water was pumped for the same time period fig s2b briefly the latter results indicate that the dominant process resulting from the heterogeneous reaction between zvi and h2o2 under the studied conditions may be represented by the following overall stoichiometry 8 2fe0 3h2o2 6h 2fe iii cl 6h2o where fe iii cl stands for the ferric species that are accumulated in the corrosion layer formed onto zvi surface hence a setup that allows the occurrence of the heterogeneous reaction between zvi and h2o2 not only leads to a decrease of both fe ii production and the efficiency of oxidant use but also to a substantial reduction of the column lifespan due the enhanced zvi consumption and the accumulation of large amounts of insoluble fe iii species within the fixed bed therefore from now on only results obtained with the sequential setup fig s1 that avoids recirculation will be addressed 3 1 2 ph evolution and system performance another important issue regarding the system performance is related with the ph evolution that may occur during each treatment stage given the adopted setup it is important to take into account that reductive processes driven by zvi corrosion usually lead to an increase of ph within the column 2 3 12 27 38 40 whereas oxidative processes driven by the presence of h2o2 may result in a decrease of ph within the photo fenton reactor 41 42 for this reason a set of experiments was performed to assess the ph changes that may occur within each module briefly ab1 solutions fed the system inlet at various flow rates different initial ph values of the raw untreated solutions were tested but no attempt to control the ph within the photo reactor was made upon reaching relatively constant values ph readings at both the column outlet cout and within the photo reactor rout were recorded interestingly within the experimental range studied ph values recorded at the column outlet were rather independent of both the initial solution ph phcin and the hydraulic retention time hrtbed in all cases the phcout values being within the range 6 5 0 4 fig s3a the latter ph increase may be ascribed to the corrosion of zvi mainly driven by presence of the dissolved oxygen 26 43 it is worth noting that as the corrosion proceeds the increase of ph within the column substantially decreases the rate of zvi oxidation moreover the results obtained suggest that for the range of hrtbed tested iron corrosion becomes practically negligible at ph values above 6 8 on the other hand ph values recorded at the photo reactor outlet phrout exhibited a slight but non negligible decrease with respect to those obtained at the column outlet with an average value of 5 8 the latter ph decrease may be explained by taking into account that fe ii species produced during zvi corrosion in the column are readily oxidized to fe3 by the presence of h2o2 within the photo reactor reaction 2 the fe3 species formed undergo hydrolysis reactions that yield h and cause a ph decrease it is important to note that the observed ph decrease could also be related to the formation of organic acids resulting from the oxidation of the target substrate triggered by the ho radicals produced by reaction 2 however for ph values around 5 8 this contribution may be neglected since the comparison of the spectra at the column outlet with those at the reactor outlet treated solutions revealed relatively small oxidation degrees data not shown under these ph conditions fe iii species are rather insoluble so their participation in reactions 4 and 5 which are rate limiting steps of the overall oxidation processes is substantially hindered and limits the progress of oxidative transformation pathways in a first attempt to improve the performance of the oxidative stage an automatic acid feeder was implemented to keep the photo reactor ph below a desired limiting value through the addition of h2so4 tests were conducted by setting different limiting ph values from 4 0 to 6 0 as expected higher conversion degrees were achieved by lowering the limiting ph values however for the tests performed with limiting ph values below 5 0 important ph drops were observed similar ph trends reported for other fenton systems initiated at mild ph conditions 41 42 44 have been ascribed to the production of organic acids consequently for high oxidation degrees of the target substrate steady state conditions for the continuous setup were difficult to achieve due to the variability of the ph within the reactor the results of this section indicate that depending on both the operating conditions and the transformation extent of the target substrate several processes such as zvi corrosion fe ii oxidation fe iii hydrolysis and organic acids production may affect the ph value within the photo reactor moreover given the key role of ph for fenton chemistry it is desirable to reduce the variability of the system performance due to ph fluctuations within the photo reactor to this end the entire set of experiments presented hereinafter was conducted with the automatic ph controller described in section 2 2 which dosed stock solutions of h2so4 or naoh to hold the photo reactor ph at desired values 3 2 evaluation of colour removal and changes in spectral features uv vis spectroscopy is being increasingly applied to improve the knowledge base on operational parameters and to provide early warnings concerning the quality of treated water 11 20 22 25 27 30 in this context the treatment progress associated to each stage was evaluated by comparing the uv vis spectrum of the initial solution cin with those recorded at both the column outlet cout and the reactor outlet rout under steady state operation in order to compare the main spectral changes associated to each treatment stage representative spectra are shown in fig 2 regardless of the differences associated to the individual operative conditions used the trends associated to the reductive stage clearly differ from those associated to the oxidative stage inspection of the spectra recorded at the column outlet fig 2a suggests that in line with the behaviour observed for batch systems conducted under purely reductive conditions 3 the spectra of cout solutions show relatively well conserved features since they result from the contribution of the unreacted ab1 and a few reduction products generated during solution contact with zvi as previously reported 3 9 11 38 reductive transformation of ab1 induced by zvi yields different amines derived from the reduction of both azo and nitro groups in particular aniline and p nitroaniline were identified as the main products in batch experiments conducted under equivalent conditions 3 despite the latter reduction products contribute to the observed spectrum in the uv vis region they exhibit lower absorption coefficients in the visible region than those of ab1 thus resulting in an important colour removal upon the passage through the zvi column on the other hand the spectra recorded at the reactor outlet fig 2b are associated to much more complex mixtures usually composed by small amounts of a large set of transformation products with different oxidation degrees formed within the photo fenton reactor previous gc ms analysis confirmed the presence of phenol p nitrophenol aniline p nitroaniline hydroquinone resorcinol and p benzoquinone among the reaction products 3 despite some of the by products formed during the reductive stage i e aniline and p nitroaniline are more harmful than the reagent itself we have previously shown that oxidative pathways occurring during fenton stage are rather efficient for limiting both the levels of the amines formed and the toxicity of treated solutions 3 although most of the primary oxidation products retain the aromatic structure and absorb in the uv vis region as the oxidation progresses ring opening reactions lead to a loss of aromaticity and a substantial decrease in the absorption within both visible and uva regions 3 consequently solutions at the photo fenton reactor outlet reach much higher degrees of colour removal and retain much less spectral features than those observed after the reductive steps that take place within the zvi column it is important to mention that the latter analysis relies on the fact that both h2o2 and iron species exhibit relatively small absorptivities in the analysed spectral domains so their contribution to the recorded spectra can be disregarded in order to quantitatively assess the system performance under different experimental conditions the areas below the absorption spectra between 400 700 nm were used to evaluate the decolourization degrees dd associated to each treatment stage by the following equation 9 d d 100 1 400 700 a λ o u t d λ 400 700 a λ i n d λ several studies focused on decolourization treatments of different dyes have been performed by following the absorbance value at a single wavelength usually that of the centre of the lower energy absorption band to monitor the efficiency of the treatment process 20 25 27 45 47 although this strategy is simpler than using numerical integration it may lead to overestimations of the decolourization degrees hence we have integrated the total area under the spectrum in the visible domain because it is a single parameter that takes into account the overall contribution of the most important reaction products to the total solution colour moreover it has been reported that the area under the spectrum in the visible region is one of the best parameters for measuring total colour of a given sample since it exhibits a good correlation with admi colour index 48 dd values calculated by eq 9 allow the estimation of the overall reaction progress but do not take into account changes in the shapes of the spectra associated to each transformation stage given that two different pathways contribute to the pollutant transformation we have also focused on the analysis of the particular spectral features associated to both the reductive transformation within the zvi column and the oxidative transformation within the photo fenton reactor inspection of fig 2 shows that a simple parameter may be used as a rough indicator of the progress of each transformation pathway briefly the spectrum of the ab1 initial solution cin shows an absorption band located in the 300 350 nm range as well as a valley in the 450 525 nm range by defining δ as the shift between the wavelength of the minimum absorption value in the latter visible region and the wavelength of the maximum absorption value in the former the uv region we obtain for the raw untreated solution a value of δcin 152 nm interestingly in all cases fig 2 shows that the spectra obtained at the column outlet exhibit a decrease of the δ value i e δcout δcin whereas the spectra obtained at the photo reactor outlet show an increase of the δ value i e δrout δcin since the latter trend was observed for all the tested conditions in addition to dd values we have defined the parameters δcol 100 x δcout δcin δcin and δreac 100 x δrout δcout δcin as alternative indicators of the treatment progress during the reductive and the oxidative stages respectively the usefulness of δcol and δreact parameters for assessing the effects of the operating conditions on the substrate transformation pathways is discussed in the following section 3 3 effects of the operational variables on the individual treatment stages different tests were performed to identify the main variables affecting the overall process efficiency as well as the individual contributions of the reductive and the oxidative stages the tested parameters include initial solution ph phcin hydraulic residence time hrt initial dye concentration hydrogen peroxide concentration added to the oxidative stage h2o2 rin reactor ph phrout and the use of irradiation the effect of each factor was evaluated independently by fixing the values of the remaining operative variables which are indicated in the respective figure legends 3 3 1 effect of phcin the effect of initial ph phcin on color removal after each treatment stage was analysed in a set of experiments conducted with a constant ph value within the photo reactor i e phrout 5 0 results presented in fig 3 show that decreasing phcin values leads to an increase of both dd cout and dd rout the higher colour removal at the column outlet dd cout at low phcin values was something expected because the reduction of ab1 by zvi is favoured under acidic conditions 3 in addition since dd rout values reflect the total decolourization associated to both treatment stages higher dd rout values lower ph were also expected in order to assess the colour removal exclusively associated to the oxidation stage the difference between the decolourization degrees achieved at the photo reactor outlet and the column outlet is also represented in fig 3 and labelled as rout cout i e dd rout dd cout interestingly although the phrout value was fixed upon decreasing phcin the latter difference also increases this result shows that the increase of the overall colour removal upon decreasing phcin is not only due to an improvement of reductive decolourization but it is also consequence of an enhancement of the efficiency of the oxidation stage this enhancement of the oxidative transformation cannot be ascribed to a more acidic condition within the photochemical reactor because phrout was fixed however as phcin is decreased a higher release of iron species at the column outlet should be expected due to the increase of zvi corrosion to confirm this hypothesis fe ii and fe iii levels were recorded at the column outlet fig s3b sup mat results show that the concentration of fe ii species produced during zvi corrosion increases from 0 01 mm up to 0 53 mm as phcin decreases from 7 0 to 3 0 whereas fe iii levels at the column outlet show a moderate decrease within the same ph range noteworthy within the ph range tested fe ii species are soluble whereas the recorded fe iii levels are mostly associated to insoluble ferric species that are suspended in the column effluent hence upon entering in the photo reactor soluble fe ii species may readily trigger the production of ho due to the presence of h2o2 reaction 2 moreover comparison of fe ii and fe iii profiles fig s3b with the decolourization degrees presented in fig 3 indicates that fe ii values exert a more pronounced effect on both the performance of the photo fenton reactor and the overall process efficiency than fe iii levels 3 3 2 effect of irradiation and phrout fig 4 shows dd and δreac values along with the mineralization degrees achieved under both steady irradiation and dark conditions for reactors operated at ph 4 0 and 5 0 the combination of irradiation with a low reactor ph i e phrout 4 0 leads to an almost complete colour removal 98 and a very high toc decrease 65 with only 1 h of treatment in contrast despite reasonable decolourization degrees may be achieved at phrout of 5 0 under dark conditions the degree of mineralization was negligible for the same timescale a closer inspection of fig 4 reveals that the irradiation of the reactor solution has a positive effect on treatment efficiency at both ph values especially regarding toc removal this improvement is a well known effect and may be ascribed to the contribution of photo induced processes such as reaction 5 that provide additional pathways for homogeneous fe ii regeneration and ho radical production on the other hand as expected an increase in the working ph within the reactor leads to a significant decrease of the treatment performance the mineralization degree being the most affected parameter as previously discussed this behaviour may be explained by taking into account the decrease of the catalytic activity of ferric species with increasing the ph of the reaction mixture briefly upon homogeneous fe ii oxidation by h2o2 the produced fe iii ions readily undergo hydrolysis reactions that lead to the formation of polymeric ferric species which ultimately yield insoluble forms that are much less active for fe ii regeneration through reactions 4 and 5 than fe iii aq species noteworthy despite the overall performances at both ph values decrease under dark conditions results of fig 4 show that the decreases of dd values under dark conditions are relatively small moreover the decolourization degree achieved under dark conditions at ph 4 0 was rather good i e about 77 this result suggests that non irradiated systems may be a good alternative for a decolourization pre treatment of highly coloured solutions for which irradiation may useless or very inefficient however given the low mineralization degrees recorded under dark conditions it is advisable to always consider a final irradiation stage in order to achieve the minimum mineralization degree necessary for an acceptable effluent detoxification finally the comparison of the behaviour of dd and δreac parameters defined in section 3 2 with the recorded toc decreases suggests that δreac values are better indicators of the progress of ab1 oxidation than dd levels which are only slightly enhanced upon irradiation 3 3 3 effects of h2o2 and hrt the effect of the added hydrogen peroxide concentration h2o2 rin on the system behaviour was assessed through the decolourization degrees and the decrease of total organic carbon a moderate increase of the overall system performance is observed upon increasing the added h2o2 the effect being more pronounced for toc values than for dd ones fig s4a sup mat in order to further analyze the latter trend both the spectral shifts δreac and the degrees of h2o2 consumption δh2o2 were evaluated in another set of experiments performed within the same range of added oxidant concentration fig s4b sup mat in line with the abovementioned toc decrease both δreac and δh2o2 values show a moderate increase as the feeding oxidant concentration is increased this supports the hypothesis that δreac is a good indicator of the progress of the oxidative transformation furthermore δreac values recorded for different levels of the working parameters spanned in the present work see section 3 4 show a fairly good positive correlation with the degree of oxidant consumption inset to fig s4b sup mat taking into account that uv vis techniques are usually cheaper and less time consuming than toc or h2o2 measurements δreac values may be helpful for real time monitoring and control of the treatment progress at last but not least control experiments performed in the absence of added h2o2 showed no significant differences between the spectra of cout and rout solutions therefore oxidation pathways directly triggered by o2 or by photolytic processes involving the organic targets may be considered negligible on the other hand fig 5 a shows the effect of the mean residence time within the reactor hrt on both dd and toc decrease values the results show that both the decolourization rates and the mineralization degrees are enhanced upon decreasing the flow rate the effect being more pronounced for toc values than for colour levels it is important to bear in mind that while added h2o2 concentration only influences the reactor behaviour the working flow rate is a parameter that affects the total decolourization degree by controlling both the photo reactor and the zvi column performances therefore in order to assess the contribution of each treatment stage the trends associated to both δcol and δreac values we also analysed in an independent set of experiments fig 5b as expected the results reveal an important increase in the contribution of both reductive and oxidative transformations pathways as the mean residence times within each stage are increased 3 3 4 effect of initial dye concentration the effect of initial dye loading was analysed for ab1 concentrations ranging from 25 to 250 mg l 1 the results show that the absolute decolourization rate steadily increases with increasing the dye loading fig s5a sup mat in contrast the percentages of decolourization remain practically constant up to 100 ppm while for the highest dye concentration tested a clear decrease of the removal efficiency is observed fig 6 a noteworthy a similar trend is obtained from the analysis of δreac values fig s5b sup mat the behaviour of dd values may be partially ascribed to the inner filter effects exerted by the unreacted parent dye and its transformation products within the photo reactor for the highest ab1 concentration tested the spectra recorded for the reaction mixtures within the reactor obtained upon feeding the system inlet with different initial concentrations of ab1 are compared in fig 6b it is important to note that the rout solution obtained for the highest ab1 initial concentration i e 250 ppm exhibits average absorbance values of around 1 88 in the wavelength range active for the photo fenton process i e 300 450 nm this represents an average optical density at least 25 times higher than that estimated for the ferric species which are the photo active species involved in reaction 5 hence for the highest ab1 concentration tested a rather high fraction of the incoming photons are absorbed by ab1 and several of its transformation products thus substantially decreasing the contribution of photo induced transformation pathways 3 4 response surface methodology rsm for assessing the overall decolourization with the objective of evaluating possible interactions between important operational parameters and in order to assess the treatment efficiency under different reaction conditions a rotatable four parameter central cubic design ccd with 4 replications of central point was used ccd is commonly used to develop response surfaces for dye decolorization because this design allows to obtain second order models by investigating five levels of the factors with considerably less experimental runs than full factorial designs 34 49 the values of dd were selected as response variable based on the results of the previous sections it was decided to fix ab1 0 at 50 mg l 1 and to apply irradiation in all cases in this context the initial ph phcin the reactor ph phrout the feeding oxidant dose h2o2 rin and the hydraulic residence time hrt were chosen as relevant factors for the present study as already discussed both zvi induced reduction and fenton assisted oxidation of the target pollutants are favoured in acidic media however most textile effluents have relatively high ph values and the addition of large amount of acids to achieve moderate acidic conditions together with the further use of alkaline reagents required for the neutralization of the final effluent poses a serious limitation regarding treatment costs in order to minimize the costs associated with the ph correction and given that fenton like systems usually exhibit a large decrease in their performance beyond ph 5 0 37 the working ph values were independently varied from 4 0 6 0 for each treatment stage on the other hand hydrogen peroxide concentrations dosed within the photo reactor were varied between 1 and 15 mm the latter range was selected by taking into account that the stoichiometric h2o2 rin required of a complete mineralization of 50 mg l of ab1 is 5 2 mm i e h2o2 ab1 64 finally given that the overall decolourization degrees as well as the mineralization rates increase with increasing the hydraulic residence times hrt values were varied from 20 to 100 min the working conditions and the response recorded for each experimental run are shown as supplementary material table s1 in a first modelling step the recorded responses were fitted with a full second order model by using linear regression 10 d d β 0 i β 1 i x i i β 2 i x i 2 i j i β 3 i j x i x j the relative contributions of each model term to the observed responses as well as their statistical significances are easily visualized as a standardized pareto chart fig 7 the reactor ph is certainly the most important variable affecting system performance followed by htr although h2o2 and initial ph also have significant effects the presence of a quadratic term for htr suggests the possible occurrence of an optimum working flow rate whereas the crossed term between htr and reactor ph that suggests a non negligible interaction between them fig 7 also shows that model parameters on the left of the vertical line on the pareto diagram have no statistical significance in order to avoid over parameterization non significant terms were taken away from the analysis in a process known as model refinement hence the less significant parameters were excluded from the analysis and the model was re evaluated with the remaining parameters i e new regression steps using refined models were performed this procedure was supported by the analysis of the marginal sum of squares associated to each term and by the lack of fit test which is designed to evaluate whether a model is adequate to describe observed results model refinement was repeated until all remaining model terms were statistical significant the analysis of variance anova presented as supplementary material table s2 shows that the complete second order model failed the lack of fit test but the refined model adequately describes the functional relationship between the experimental factors and the response variable the adjusted formula obtained for the refined second order model was 11 dd 292 5 58 x phcin 49 8 x phrout 0 0491 x hrt 0 773 x h2o2 rin 0 226 x phrout x hrt 0 00627 x hrt2 the values calculated by the model equation closely match the experimentally observed responses fig s6 sup mat with a r2 of 0 9283 moreover upon taking the number of degrees of freedom into account an adjusted r2 of 0 9078 was obtained this implies that the model is able to explain a 90 78 of the recorded variability in dd this is an excellent value considering the simplicity of the model the complexity of the system and the number of physicochemical processes involved on the other hand given that a complete randomization of the design was not possible the durbin watson dw statistic was calculated to test whether the run order had a significant effect over the recorded responses a value of 2 115 was obtained for the dw statistic p value of 0 6026 indicating that serial autocorrelation may be disregarded with a 95 of confidence hence there is no statistical evidence of some effect due to the execution order of the experiments the refined model predicts that within the experimental domain studied the highest dd may be obtained by using the following conditions phcin 4 0 phrout 4 0 hrt 75 9 min and h2o2 15 mm however economical issues related with ph adjustments electrical energy demand and the amount of oxidant consumed should be taken into account for designing efficient as well as cost effective treatment systems as one of the objectives of the present work was the evaluation of the system performance under mild ph conditions it is important to note that dd of at least 60 may be obtained for reactor ph values of around 5 0 and residence times between 45 and 60 min moreover the proposed setup allowed obtaining a much higher ab1 transformation than that recorded for zvi assisted fenton systems operated in batch mode at mild ph 3 in order to visualize the combined effects of the studied factors response surfaces calculated with the refined model equation are shown in fig 8 given the tetra dimensional nature of the experimental domain spanned each 3d representation was constructed by varying two factors and holding the remaining two factors in their central values it is important to note that some of the predicted values are slightly above 100 which is a consequence of the fact that a simple second order polynomial is incapable of foreseeing the asymptotic like trend expected for conditions that allow almost complete decolourization the inspection of fig 8 shows that the reactor ph and the hydraulic residence time are the key factors influencing the system response the added oxidant concentration and the initial ph being much less important noteworthy surfaces involving variable hrt values fig 8a c and d bear a clear curvature whereas surfaces obtained by fixing hrt are completely flat this is a consequence of the refined mathematical model obtained by the statistical analysis fig 7 and table s2 which showed that hrt is the only factor bearing a significant quadratic term in addition fig 8c evidences the contribution of the interaction term between reactor ph and hrt the decrease of the system performance with increasing the ph is not surprising as both photo fenton assisted oxidation of the target organics and zvi corrosion are favoured at low ph values however the individual evaluation of the factors phcin and phrout allows the selection of the better strategy for ph adjustment for the ranges studied the reactor ph is clearly the most important factor to take into account while the initial ph practically shows no impact on the overall decolourization efficiency this has technological relevance since it suggests that it is much more efficient to adjust the working ph after the solution passage through zvi column than controlling the ph of the raw solution moreover the rather low influence of h2o2 rin on dd values suggests that for the conditions studied in order to improve the overall system performance is much better to adjust the reactor ph than to increase the feeding oxidant concentration the presence of an important curvature of the response surface with respect to hrt was something unexpected moreover within the ph range from 4 0 5 0 optimal hrt values between 75 and 94 min are predicted by the refined model intuitive thinking suggests that increasing hrt values would allow for higher reaction advances within both the zvi column and the photo fenton reactor but no decrease in dd should be expected in order to assess the origin of the unforeseen behaviour the concentration of fe ii species at the reactor inlet for different residence times were investigated fig s7 sup mat the results show that fe ii levels represented against hrt go through a maximum value and then decrease the latter trend might be related with the increase of the time spent by the solution between the end of the zvi bed and the reactor inlet as hrt is increased briefly under the relatively high ph conditions achieved due to zvi corrosion partial oxidation of fe ii species by o2 is likely to occur before the discharge of the column effluent into the photo reactor given that the overall system performance is substantially influenced by fe ii concentrations at the reactor inlet the results presented in fig s7 are in line with the behaviour predicted by the refined model finally it is important to take into account that once the solution reaches photo reactor the oxidation of fe ii species is mostly driven by h2o2 rather than by o2 this hypothesis is supported by the results of fig 1b which show that the use of h2o2 concentrations similar to those of dissolved oxygen i e 0 26 mm for air saturated solutions at ph 7 0 leads to a substantial decrease of fe ii levels in comparison of the one observed in the absence of h2o2 the latter results together with the relatively high h2o2 concentrations fed in the photo reactor and the fact that the rate of ferrous species oxidation driven by dissolved oxygen substantially decreases below ph 6 0 clearly indicate that even under near neutral ph values fe ii within the reactor is mainly oxidized by h2o2 through the fenton reaction eq 2 4 conclusions a setup that integrates a column filled with zvi and a photo fenton reactor in a strictly continuous flow mode was used for the treatment of an azo dye under steady state conditions the spatial separation between the reductive and the oxidative transformation stages results in a better exploitation of both the zvi bed and the hydrogen peroxide consumption several issues were addressed including the coupling strategy the spectroscopic changes associated to both reductive and oxidative transformation pathways the effects of individual operating parameters on the behaviour of each treatment stage and the overall system performance for an experimental domain centred at mild acidic conditions i e ph 5 0 the analysis of the coupling strategy showed that recirculation systems are not encouraged because unless h2o2 is completely consumed during the fenton stage an excess of hydrogen peroxide may reach the zvi surface the reaction between the metallic iron and hydrogen peroxide negatively affects not only the oxidant usage but also the column lifetime and the production of fe ii species capable of triggering oxidative processes in the photo fenton reactor on the other hand since several processes related with zvi corrosion and fenton chemistry may substantially affect the ph values within the photo reactor a strict and continuous ph control during the oxidative stage is critical for obtaining a stable operation and acceptable decolourization efficiencies through the coupled system the joint analysis of the decolourization degrees and the evolution of spectral features at the end of each treatment stage allowed obtaining important information regarding the influence of different operational variables on both reductive and oxidative transformation pathways the study of the operating factors revealed that a decrease of the initial ph leads to an enhancement of the overall performance not only by the increase of the reductive transformation but also due to the increase of fe ii levels at the column outlet which lead to higher rates of the oxidative transformation within the photo reactor the application of rsm methodology allowed the development of a simple polynomial equation which is able to accurately predict the efficiency of colour removal over a wide range of experimental conditions comparison of the relative importance of the operational parameters studied shows that the reactor ph and the hydraulic residence time are the key factors influencing the system response whereas the initial ph and the added oxidant concentration are much less significant the latter finding is of major importance for designing cost effective treatments since it shows that it is much more efficient to control the ph within the reactor than adjusting the initial solution ph or increasing the feeding oxidant concentration to the best of our knowledge this is the first study describing a strictly continuous system operated at mild ph and under steady state conditions which couples a zvi induced reduction stage followed by a photo fenton oxidative stage the decolourization degrees obtained with the proposed setup were much higher than those obtained for zvi assisted fenton systems operated in batch mode at the same ph and using the same model pollutant some challenges still remain for the process implementation in practical applications among them the evaluation of matrix effects associated with the complex and fluctuating composition of actual industrial effluents as well as the disposal or potential utilization of the iron containing sludge generated from the process however the here presented results suggest that the proposed strategy may be a good technological alternative

13918,the performance of a continuous system that sequentially couples a column filled with zero valent iron with a photo fenton reactor was evaluated under mild acidic conditions studies were conducted to evaluate the better coupling strategy between each treatment module and to analyze the effects of several operational parameters on the system behaviour the azo dye acid black 1 was chosen as model pollutant decolourization degrees and decreases of toc values were used for the evaluation of the treatment performance under different conditions whereas steady state concentrations of fe ii fe iii and h2o2 together with spectral features in the uv vis region were analysed to elucidate mechanistic issues the response surface methodology approach based on a central composite design was used to evaluate and model the effects of key factors on the decolourization degrees results show that the spatial separation between the zvi and h2o2 may lead to substantial improvements of treatment efficiencies provided that configurations involving recirculation loops are avoided besides a strict and continuous ph control during the oxidative stage is critical for obtaining a stable operation and acceptable decolourization efficiencies through the coupled system the simple parameters developed from uv vis spectra allowed monitoring the extent of reductive and oxidative transformation pathways in addition the statistical analysis shows that reactor ph and hydraulic residence time are the key factors influencing the system response whereas initial ph and added oxidant concentration are much less significant the conclusions drawn are relevant from a technological viewpoint since allow a rational design of cost effective treatments keywords zvi fenton continuous flow mode azo dye response surface methodology 1 introduction wastewater treatment techniques based on zero valent iron zvi are promising strategies due to the low cost of involved materials the versatility for treating a wide variety of pollutants and the possibility to design efficient systems for continuous operation 1 in particular zvi related treatments have proven to successfully eliminate azo dyes 2 4 which are among the most common organic pollutants present in textile wastewater 3 5 azo dyes are difficult to degrade by means of biological methods because of their complex structure and recalcitrant nature 6 7 the elimination of organic compounds in the presence of zvi may proceed through reductive and or oxidative pathways depending on the chemical nature of the substrate and the operative conditions 3 8 pollutant reduction is driven by the electrochemical corrosion of iron in which a two electrons transfer yields fe ii species in the case of azo compounds the transformation involves the following stoichiometry 9 1 r n n r 2 fe 4 h r nh2 h2n r 2 fe ii despite reductive processes may lead to important decolourization degrees mineralization cannot be achieved and the resulting amines are usually more toxic for aquatic organisms than the parent compounds 10 11 to circumvent this problem several authors have suggested coupling the reductive transformation to a subsequent step of biological or chemical oxidation 12 14 fenton processes are a family of well known techniques for chemical oxidation based on the transformation of organic pollutants in the presence of h2o2 and iron salts the latter processes are driven by the production of hydroxyl radicals ho 2 fe ii h2o2 fe iii ho ho 3 h o organic substrates o 2 o 2 oxidation products as iron salts are usually added in catalytic amounts treatment performance is limited by fe ii regeneration through different fe iii reducing pathways 4 fe iii h2o2 fe ii ho2 h 5 fe iii hv oh fe ii ho reactions 4 and 5 are rate limiting steps for fenton like and photo fenton processes respectively photo fenton processes are frequently preferred since they are faster and achieve much higher mineralization degrees than fenton like processes 15 however the major drawback of both techniques is the drastic reduction of catalytic activity at ph values above 3 5 due to the insolubility of fe iii species therefore many strategies have been explored to minimize the costs associated with ph adjustments by extending the operative ph range 16 17 several authors have proposed to use zvi corrosion as source of fe ii species in combination with externally added h2o2 the process is usually called zvi assisted fenton reaction 18 21 as fe ii is continuously generated it was suggested that zvi assisted fenton processes could effectively work at ph values where homogeneous fenton techniques are limited 18 moreover since the transformation of organic contaminants may occur through both reductive and oxidative reaction pathways pollutants difficult to oxidize may be initially reduced to yield less recalcitrant structures and subsequently oxidized by ho radicals 12 the latter strategy resulted particularly important for aromatic compounds bearing strong deactivation groups 12 19 22 25 despite the potential advantages of zvi assisted fenton processes upon increasing ph zvi air and zvi h2o2 systems exhibited important decreases in both degradation efficiencies and pollutant transformation rates 2 11 20 21 26 28 recent mechanistic studies have shown that the simultaneous use of zvi and h2o2 substantially decreases the overall treatment performance at ph values above 4 5 3 briefly with increasing ph the corrosion layer developed on the zvi surface substantially decreases the release of aqueous fe ii species thus dropping the homogeneous production of ho radicals reaction 2 moreover due to the low fe ii concentration the heterogeneous reaction between h2o2 and the zvi surface becomes the major pathway of peroxide consumption 3 6 2fe0 2h2o2 4h 2fe ii 4h2o noteworthy this reaction leads to a significant decrease of treatment rates due to both a drastic inhibition of oxidative transformation pathways 3 and to an early exhaustion of zvi reductive capacity in order to avoid this worthless consumption of reactants the overall process may be spatially split into two stages a reduction step where the contaminated solution is exposed to zvi and an oxidative step where iron ions released by zvi corrosion are used to trigger fenton processes moreover since the continuous flow operation mode may facilitate the process scaling up direct coupling between both stages seems advisable relatively few articles have focused their research in this direction moon et al 25 demonstrated that spacing in time zvi corrosion and h2o2 addition leads to an improvement of orange ii degradation efficiency in comparison with the simultaneous use of zvi and h2o2 le et al 19 coupled a zvi reduction batch with a fenton oxidation batch for degrading chloronitrobenzene using a similar strategy jiang 29 proposed an integrated system for nitrobenzene degradation where reduction and oxidation steps take place in separated batch reactors other authors 12 14 used recirculation systems that continuously pumped the effluent between a zvi filled column for reductive transformations and a fenton reactor for oxidative processes upon h2o2 addition unfortunately a small number of setup designs coupling zvi column beds with fenton reactors in a continuous flow mode were reported 22 30 some authors used the passage through a zvi column for a reductive treatment but did not completely exploit the iron ions produced during corrosion since they added ferrous salts on the oxidation step 23 30 to the best of our knowledge barreto rodriguez et al 22 published the only work that profited from zvi corrosion for driving a latter fenton stage in a strictly continuous flow operation mode with the latter strategy an effective treatment of tnt was achieved however since the model effluents exhibited ph values around 1 5 treatment efficiency was evaluated under rather strong acidic conditions this is not the case for other types of effluents such as textile ones that are typically neutral or even basic 31 the objective of the present work was to assess a continuous flow treatment setup that integrates a zvi induced reduction stage followed by a photo fenton driven oxidation stage under steady state conditions at mild ph values the azo dye acid black 1 ab1 widely used for the production of textiles and leather was chosen as model pollutant since it can cause genotoxic and mutagenic effects 32 coupling strategies concerning oxidant exploitation and ph control

presented in sections 3 1 to 3 3 were obtained from the average of at least two measurements 2 3 analytical methods fe ii and fe iii concentrations were determined by colorimetric procedures in the presence of o phenanthroline and scn respectively as described elsewhere 3 both filtered and unfiltered samples yielded within experimental error the same fe ii concentrations showing that insoluble fe ii species are negligible for the conditions tested in contrast due to the insolubility of ferric species within the ph range studied fe iii levels significantly decreased upon filtration hence total fe iii levels reported herein are based on the results obtained from unfiltered samples h2o2 concentration was measured by an enzymatic colorimetric method employing a commercial kit from wiener colestat for cholesterol quantization the degrees of h2o2 consumption within the photochemical reactor were calculated as δh2o2 h2o2 rin h2o2 rout h2o2 rin for measuring solution decolourization

centurion xvi was used for model fitting by least squares regression and for the statistical assessment of both the effects of the operating parameters as well as their interactions on the recorded response 3 results and discussion the presentation of the results is structured in four sections section 3 1 describes the experiments performed to establish the coupling strategy between both treatment stages section 3 2 deals with the analysis of the spectral information for characterizing the treatment progress with special focus on the differences between reductive and oxidative transformation pathways section 3 3 evaluates the effect of the individual operating factors on each treatment stage using the traditional one factor at a time oat approach finally section 3 4 presents the application of the surface response methodology srm for assessing the decolourization performance through the integrated system under different reaction conditions 3 1 coupling strategy 3 1 1 column performance in the presence of h2o2 as stated in the introduction some authors 36 37 have pointed out that the reaction between zvi and h2o2 eq 6 can be advantageous for zvi assisted fenton systems since it provides an additional pathway for fe ii generation however recent studies performed in batch systems 3 have shown that the latter reaction may be undesirable because it consumes the oxidant in processes which do not contribute to the oxidation of target pollutants in fenton systems therefore some recirculation systems have been proposed 12 14 to physically separate reductive and oxidative pathways of pollutant transformation despite the latter configuration improves the treatment performance with respect to batch designs unless h2o2 is completely consumed during the fenton stage an excess of peroxide may reach the zvi bed in order to assess the potential effect of the occurrence of reaction 6 within zvi columns that are coupled to fenton reactors by setups that involve recirculation among both modules solutions containing 5 mm na2so4 and different h2o2 concentrations 0 0 1 0 mm were pumped through the zvi column until stabilization about 40 min steady state fe ii and h2o2 concentrations monitored at the column outlet cout are shown in fig 1 in all cases most of the feeding h2o2 80 was consumed during its passage through the column fig 1a in addition as the inlet h2o2 concentration increases the concentration of fe ii species recorded at the column outlet decreases fig 1b a closer inspection of fig 1b reveals that in the absence of h2o2 concentrations of fe ii of about 0 15 mm are recorded at the column outlet it is important to note that under the working ph conditions dissolved oxygen not only reacts with zvi to produce fe ii species but also may participate in the subsequent oxidation of fe ii to yield fe iii species consequently the significant fe ii levels recorded at the column outlet in the absence of h2o2 indicate that an important fraction of the fe ii produced by the o2 mediated corrosion of zvi remains as soluble ferrous species in contrast for h2o2 concentrations of 1 mm at the column inlet negligible fe ii levels were recorded at the column effluent hence in the presence of h2o2 ferrous ions produced during the first steps of zvi corrosion mediated by either o2 or h2o2 are almost quantitatively oxidized to ferric species moreover under the studied ph conditions fe iii species are mostly retained within the zvi bed due to their rather low solubility this is clearly evidenced by the high generation of reddish brown oxides within the zvi column after pumping a solution 8 mm in h2o2 during 1 h fig s2a this behaviour was not observed when only water was pumped for the same time period fig s2b briefly the latter results indicate that the dominant process resulting from the heterogeneous reaction between zvi and h2o2 under the studied conditions may be represented by the following overall stoichiometry 8 2fe0 3h2o2 6h 2fe iii cl 6h2o where fe iii cl stands for the ferric species that are accumulated in the corrosion layer formed onto zvi surface hence a setup that allows the occurrence of the heterogeneous reaction between zvi and h2o2 not only leads to a decrease of both fe ii production and the efficiency of oxidant use but also to a substantial reduction of the column lifespan due the enhanced zvi consumption and the accumulation of large amounts of insoluble fe iii species within the fixed bed therefore from now on only results obtained with the sequential setup fig s1 that avoids recirculation will be addressed 3 1 2 ph evolution and system performance another important issue regarding the system performance is related with the ph evolution that may occur during each treatment stage given the adopted setup it is important to take into account that reductive processes driven by zvi corrosion usually lead to an increase of ph within the column 2 3 12 27 38 40 whereas oxidative processes driven by the presence of h2o2 may result in a decrease of ph within the photo fenton reactor 41 42 for this reason a set of experiments was performed to assess the ph changes that may occur within each module briefly ab1 solutions fed the system inlet at various flow rates different initial ph values of the raw untreated solutions were tested but no attempt to control the ph within the photo reactor was made upon reaching relatively constant values ph readings at both the column outlet cout and within the photo reactor rout were recorded interestingly within the experimental range studied ph values recorded at the column outlet were rather independent of both the initial solution ph phcin and the hydraulic retention time hrtbed in all cases the phcout values being within the range 6 5 0 4 fig s3a the latter ph increase may be ascribed to the corrosion of zvi mainly driven by presence of the dissolved oxygen 26 43 it is worth noting that as the corrosion proceeds the increase of ph within the column substantially decreases the rate of zvi oxidation moreover the results obtained suggest that for the range of hrtbed tested iron corrosion becomes practically negligible at ph values above 6 8 on the other hand ph values recorded at the photo reactor outlet phrout exhibited a slight but non negligible decrease with respect to those obtained at the column outlet with an average value of 5 8 the latter ph decrease may be explained by taking into account that fe ii species produced during zvi corrosion in the column are readily oxidized to fe3 by the presence of h2o2 within the photo reactor reaction 2 the fe3 species formed undergo hydrolysis reactions that yield h and cause a ph decrease it is important to note that the observed ph decrease could also be related to the formation of organic acids resulting from the oxidation of the target substrate triggered by the ho radicals produced by reaction 2 however for ph values around 5 8 this contribution may be neglected since the comparison of the spectra at the column outlet with those at the reactor outlet treated solutions revealed relatively small oxidation degrees data not shown under these ph conditions fe iii species are rather insoluble so their participation in reactions 4 and 5 which are rate limiting steps of the overall oxidation processes is substantially hindered and limits the progress of oxidative transformation pathways in a first attempt to improve the performance of the oxidative stage an automatic acid feeder was implemented to keep the photo reactor ph below a desired limiting value through the addition of h2so4 tests were conducted by setting different limiting ph values from 4 0 to 6 0 as expected higher conversion degrees were achieved by lowering the limiting ph values however for the tests performed with limiting ph values below 5 0 important ph drops were observed similar ph trends reported for other fenton systems initiated at mild ph conditions 41 42 44 have been ascribed to the production of organic acids consequently for high oxidation degrees of the target substrate steady state conditions for the continuous setup were difficult to achieve due to the variability of the ph within the reactor the results of this section indicate that depending on both the operating conditions and the transformation extent of the target substrate several processes such as zvi corrosion fe ii oxidation fe iii hydrolysis and organic acids production may affect the ph value within the photo reactor moreover given the key role of ph for fenton chemistry it is desirable to reduce the variability of the system performance due to ph fluctuations within the photo reactor to this end the entire set of experiments presented hereinafter was conducted with the automatic ph controller described in section 2 2 which dosed stock solutions of h2so4 or naoh to hold the photo reactor ph at desired values 3 2 evaluation of colour removal and changes in spectral features uv vis spectroscopy is being increasingly applied to improve the knowledge base on operational parameters and to provide early warnings concerning the quality of treated water 11 20 22 25 27 30 in this context the treatment progress associated to each stage was evaluated by comparing the uv vis spectrum of the initial solution cin with those recorded at both the column outlet cout and the reactor outlet rout under steady state operation in order to compare the main spectral changes associated to each treatment stage representative spectra are shown in fig 2 regardless of the differences associated to the individual operative conditions used the trends associated to the reductive stage clearly differ from those associated to the oxidative stage inspection of the spectra recorded at the column outlet fig 2a suggests that in line with the behaviour observed for batch systems conducted under purely reductive conditions 3 the spectra of cout solutions show relatively well conserved features since they result from the contribution of the unreacted ab1 and a few reduction products generated during solution contact with zvi as previously reported 3 9 11 38 reductive transformation of ab1 induced by zvi yields different amines derived from the reduction of both azo and nitro groups in particular aniline and p nitroaniline were identified as the main products in batch experiments conducted under equivalent conditions 3 despite the latter reduction products contribute to the observed spectrum in the uv vis region they exhibit lower absorption coefficients in the visible region than those of ab1 thus resulting in an important colour removal upon the passage through the zvi column on the other hand the spectra recorded at the reactor outlet fig 2b are associated to much more complex mixtures usually composed by small amounts of a large set of transformation products with different oxidation degrees formed within the photo fenton reactor previous gc ms analysis confirmed the presence of phenol p nitrophenol aniline p nitroaniline hydroquinone resorcinol and p benzoquinone among the reaction products 3 despite some of the by products formed during the reductive stage i e aniline and p nitroaniline are more harmful than the reagent itself we have previously shown that oxidative pathways occurring during fenton stage are rather efficient for limiting both the levels of the amines formed and the toxicity of treated solutions 3 although most of the primary oxidation products retain the aromatic structure and absorb in the uv vis region as the oxidation progresses ring opening reactions lead to a loss of aromaticity and a substantial decrease in the absorption within both visible and uva regions 3 consequently solutions at the photo fenton reactor outlet reach much higher degrees of colour removal and retain much less spectral features than those observed after the reductive steps that take place within the zvi column it is important to mention that the latter analysis relies on the fact that both h2o2 and iron species exhibit relatively small absorptivities in the analysed spectral domains so their contribution to the recorded spectra can be disregarded in order to quantitatively assess the system performance under different experimental conditions the areas below the absorption spectra between 400 700 nm were used to evaluate the decolourization degrees dd associated to each treatment stage by the following equation 9 d d 100 1 400 700 a λ o u t d λ 400 700 a λ i n d λ several studies focused on decolourization treatments of different dyes have been performed by following the absorbance value at a single wavelength usually that of the centre of the lower energy absorption band to monitor the efficiency of the treatment process 20 25 27 45 47 although this strategy is simpler than using numerical integration it may lead to overestimations of the decolourization degrees hence we have integrated the total area under the spectrum in the visible domain because it is a single parameter that takes into account the overall contribution of the most important reaction products to the total solution colour moreover it has been reported that the area under the spectrum in the visible region is one of the best parameters for measuring total colour of a given sample since it exhibits a good correlation with admi colour index 48 dd values calculated by eq 9 allow the estimation of the overall reaction progress but do not take into account changes in the shapes of the spectra associated to each transformation stage given that two different pathways contribute to the pollutant transformation we have also focused on the analysis of the particular spectral features associated to both the reductive transformation within the zvi column and the oxidative transformation within the photo fenton reactor inspection of fig 2 shows that a simple parameter may be used as a rough indicator of the progress of each transformation pathway briefly the spectrum of the ab1 initial solution cin shows an absorption band located in the 300 350 nm range as well as a valley in the 450 525 nm range by defining δ as the shift between the wavelength of the minimum absorption value in the latter visible region and the wavelength of the maximum absorption value in the former the uv region we obtain for the raw untreated solution a value of δcin 152 nm interestingly in all cases fig 2 shows that the spectra obtained at the column outlet exhibit a decrease of the δ value i e δcout δcin whereas the spectra obtained at the photo reactor outlet show an increase of the δ value i e δrout δcin since the latter trend was observed for all the tested conditions in addition to dd values we have defined the parameters δcol 100 x δcout δcin δcin and δreac 100 x δrout δcout δcin as alternative indicators of the treatment progress during the reductive and the oxidative stages respectively the usefulness of δcol and δreact parameters for assessing the effects of the operating conditions on the substrate transformation pathways is discussed in the following section 3 3 effects of the operational variables on the individual treatment stages different tests were performed to identify the main variables affecting the overall process efficiency as well as the individual contributions of the reductive and the oxidative stages the tested parameters include initial solution ph phcin hydraulic residence time hrt initial dye concentration hydrogen peroxide concentration added to the oxidative stage h2o2 rin reactor ph phrout and the use of irradiation the effect of each factor was evaluated independently by fixing the values of the remaining operative variables which are indicated in the respective figure legends 3 3 1 effect of phcin the effect of initial ph phcin on color removal after each treatment stage was analysed in a set of experiments conducted with a constant ph value within the photo reactor i e phrout 5 0 results presented in fig 3 show that decreasing phcin values leads to an increase of both dd cout and dd rout the higher colour removal at the column outlet dd cout at low phcin values was something expected because the reduction of ab1 by zvi is favoured under acidic conditions 3 in addition since dd rout values reflect the total decolourization associated to both treatment stages higher dd rout values lower ph were also expected in order to assess the colour removal exclusively associated to the oxidation stage the difference between the decolourization degrees achieved at the photo reactor outlet and the column outlet is also represented in fig 3 and labelled as rout cout i e dd rout dd cout interestingly although the phrout value was fixed upon decreasing phcin the latter difference also increases this result shows that the increase of the overall colour removal upon decreasing phcin is not only due to an improvement of reductive decolourization but it is also consequence of an enhancement of the efficiency of the oxidation stage this enhancement of the oxidative transformation cannot be ascribed to a more acidic condition within the photochemical reactor because phrout was fixed however as phcin is decreased a higher release of iron species at the column outlet should be expected due to the increase of zvi corrosion to confirm this hypothesis fe ii and fe iii levels were recorded at the column outlet fig s3b sup mat results show that the concentration of fe ii species produced during zvi corrosion increases from 0 01 mm up to 0 53 mm as phcin decreases from 7 0 to 3 0 whereas fe iii levels at the column outlet show a moderate decrease within the same ph range noteworthy within the ph range tested fe ii species are soluble whereas the recorded fe iii levels are mostly associated to insoluble ferric species that are suspended in the column effluent hence upon entering in the photo reactor soluble fe ii species may readily trigger the production of ho due to the presence of h2o2 reaction 2 moreover comparison of fe ii and fe iii profiles fig s3b with the decolourization degrees presented in fig 3 indicates that fe ii values exert a more pronounced effect on both the performance of the photo fenton reactor and the overall process efficiency than fe iii levels 3 3 2 effect of irradiation and phrout fig 4 shows dd and δreac values along with the mineralization degrees achieved under both steady irradiation and dark conditions for reactors operated at ph 4 0 and 5 0 the combination of irradiation with a low reactor ph i e phrout 4 0 leads to an almost complete colour removal 98 and a very high toc decrease 65 with only 1 h of treatment in contrast despite reasonable decolourization degrees may be achieved at phrout of 5 0 under dark conditions the degree of mineralization was negligible for the same timescale a closer inspection of fig 4 reveals that the irradiation of the reactor solution has a positive effect on treatment efficiency at both ph values especially regarding toc removal this improvement is a well known effect and may be ascribed to the contribution of photo induced processes such as reaction 5 that provide additional pathways for homogeneous fe ii regeneration and ho radical production on the other hand as expected an increase in the working ph within the reactor leads to a significant decrease of the treatment performance the mineralization degree being the most affected parameter as previously discussed this behaviour may be explained by taking into account the decrease of the catalytic activity of ferric species with increasing the ph of the reaction mixture briefly upon homogeneous fe ii oxidation by h2o2 the produced fe iii ions readily undergo hydrolysis reactions that lead to the formation of polymeric ferric species which ultimately yield insoluble forms that are much less active for fe ii regeneration through reactions 4 and 5 than fe iii aq species noteworthy despite the overall performances at both ph values decrease under dark conditions results of fig 4 show that the decreases of dd values under dark conditions are relatively small moreover the decolourization degree achieved under dark conditions at ph 4 0 was rather good i e about 77 this result suggests that non irradiated systems may be a good alternative for a decolourization pre treatment of highly coloured solutions for which irradiation may useless or very inefficient however given the low mineralization degrees recorded under dark conditions it is advisable to always consider a final irradiation stage in order to achieve the minimum mineralization degree necessary for an acceptable effluent detoxification finally the comparison of the behaviour of dd and δreac parameters defined in section 3 2 with the recorded toc decreases suggests that δreac values are better indicators of the progress of ab1 oxidation than dd levels which are only slightly enhanced upon irradiation 3 3 3 effects of h2o2 and hrt the effect of the added hydrogen peroxide concentration h2o2 rin on the system behaviour was assessed through the decolourization degrees and the decrease of total organic carbon a moderate increase of the overall system performance is observed upon increasing the added h2o2 the effect being more pronounced for toc values than for dd ones fig s4a sup mat in order to further analyze the latter trend both the spectral shifts δreac and the degrees of h2o2 consumption δh2o2 were evaluated in another set of experiments performed within the same range of added oxidant concentration fig s4b sup mat in line with the abovementioned toc decrease both δreac and δh2o2 values show a moderate increase as the feeding oxidant concentration is increased this supports the hypothesis that δreac is a good indicator of the progress of the oxidative transformation furthermore δreac values recorded for different levels of the working parameters spanned in the present work see section 3 4 show a fairly good positive correlation with the degree of oxidant consumption inset to fig s4b sup mat taking into account that uv vis techniques are usually cheaper and less time consuming than toc or h2o2 measurements δreac values may be helpful for real time monitoring and control of the treatment progress at last but not least control experiments performed in the absence of added h2o2 showed no significant differences between the spectra of cout and rout solutions therefore oxidation pathways directly triggered by o2 or by photolytic processes involving the organic targets may be considered negligible on the other hand fig 5 a shows the effect of the mean residence time within the reactor hrt on both dd and toc decrease values the results show that both the decolourization rates and the mineralization degrees are enhanced upon decreasing the flow rate the effect being more pronounced for toc values than for colour levels it is important to bear in mind that while added h2o2 concentration only influences the reactor behaviour the working flow rate is a parameter that affects the total decolourization degree by controlling both the photo reactor and the zvi column performances therefore in order to assess the contribution of each treatment stage the trends associated to both δcol and δreac values we also analysed in an independent set of experiments fig 5b as expected the results reveal an important increase in the contribution of both reductive and oxidative transformations pathways as the mean residence times within each stage are increased 3 3 4 effect of initial dye concentration the effect of initial dye loading was analysed for ab1 concentrations ranging from 25 to 250 mg l 1 the results show that the absolute decolourization rate steadily increases with increasing the dye loading fig s5a sup mat in contrast the percentages of decolourization remain practically constant up to 100 ppm while for the highest dye concentration tested a clear decrease of the removal efficiency is observed fig 6 a noteworthy a similar trend is obtained from the analysis of δreac values fig s5b sup mat the behaviour of dd values may be partially ascribed to the inner filter effects exerted by the unreacted parent dye and its transformation products within the photo reactor for the highest ab1 concentration tested the spectra recorded for the reaction mixtures within the reactor obtained upon feeding the system inlet with different initial concentrations of ab1 are compared in fig 6b it is important to note that the rout solution obtained for the highest ab1 initial concentration i e 250 ppm exhibits average absorbance values of around 1 88 in the wavelength range active for the photo fenton process i e 300 450 nm this represents an average optical density at least 25 times higher than that estimated for the ferric species which are the photo active species involved in reaction 5 hence for the highest ab1 concentration tested a rather high fraction of the incoming photons are absorbed by ab1 and several of its transformation products thus substantially decreasing the contribution of photo induced transformation pathways 3 4 response surface methodology rsm for assessing the overall decolourization with the objective of evaluating possible interactions between important operational parameters and in order to assess the treatment efficiency under different reaction conditions a rotatable four parameter central cubic design ccd with 4 replications of central point was used ccd is commonly used to develop response surfaces for dye decolorization because this design allows to obtain second order models by investigating five levels of the factors with considerably less experimental runs than full factorial designs 34 49 the values of dd were selected as response variable based on the results of the previous sections it was decided to fix ab1 0 at 50 mg l 1 and to apply irradiation in all cases in this context the initial ph phcin the reactor ph phrout the feeding oxidant dose h2o2 rin and the hydraulic residence time hrt were chosen as relevant factors for the present study as already discussed both zvi induced reduction and fenton assisted oxidation of the target pollutants are favoured in acidic media however most textile effluents have relatively high ph values and the addition of large amount of acids to achieve moderate acidic conditions together with the further use of alkaline reagents required for the neutralization of the final effluent poses a serious limitation regarding treatment costs in order to minimize the costs associated with the ph correction and given that fenton like systems usually exhibit a large decrease in their performance beyond ph 5 0 37 the working ph values were independently varied from 4 0 6 0 for each treatment stage on the other hand hydrogen peroxide concentrations dosed within the photo reactor were varied between 1 and 15 mm the latter range was selected by taking into account that the stoichiometric h2o2 rin required of a complete mineralization of 50 mg l of ab1 is 5 2 mm i e h2o2 ab1 64 finally given that the overall decolourization degrees as well as the mineralization rates increase with increasing the hydraulic residence times hrt values were varied from 20 to 100 min the working conditions and the response recorded for each experimental run are shown as supplementary material table s1 in a first modelling step the recorded responses were fitted with a full second order model by using linear regression 10 d d β 0 i β 1 i x i i β 2 i x i 2 i j i β 3 i j x i x j the relative contributions of each model term to the observed responses as well as their statistical significances are easily visualized as a standardized pareto chart fig 7 the reactor ph is certainly the most important variable affecting system performance followed by htr although h2o2 and initial ph also have significant effects the presence of a quadratic term for htr suggests the possible occurrence of an optimum working flow rate whereas the crossed term between htr and reactor ph that suggests a non negligible interaction between them fig 7 also shows that model parameters on the left of the vertical line on the pareto diagram have no statistical significance in order to avoid over parameterization non significant terms were taken away from the analysis in a process known as model refinement hence the less significant parameters were excluded from the analysis and the model was re evaluated with the remaining parameters i e new regression steps using refined models were performed this procedure was supported by the analysis of the marginal sum of squares associated to each term and by the lack of fit test which is designed to evaluate whether a model is adequate to describe observed results model refinement was repeated until all remaining model terms were statistical significant the analysis of variance anova presented as supplementary material table s2 shows that the complete second order model failed the lack of fit test but the refined model adequately describes the functional relationship between the experimental factors and the response variable the adjusted formula obtained for the refined second order model was 11 dd 292 5 58 x phcin 49 8 x phrout 0 0491 x hrt 0 773 x h2o2 rin 0 226 x phrout x hrt 0 00627 x hrt2 the values calculated by the model equation closely match the experimentally observed responses fig s6 sup mat with a r2 of 0 9283 moreover upon taking the number of degrees of freedom into account an adjusted r2 of 0 9078 was obtained this implies that the model is able to explain a 90 78 of the recorded variability in dd this is an excellent value considering the simplicity of the model the complexity of the system and the number of physicochemical processes involved on the other hand given that a complete randomization of the design was not possible the durbin watson dw statistic was calculated to test whether the run order had a significant effect over the recorded responses a value of 2 115 was obtained for the dw statistic p value of 0 6026 indicating that serial autocorrelation may be disregarded with a 95 of confidence hence there is no statistical evidence of some effect due to the execution order of the experiments the refined model predicts that within the experimental domain studied the highest dd may be obtained by using the following conditions phcin 4 0 phrout 4 0 hrt 75 9 min and h2o2 15 mm however economical issues related with ph adjustments electrical energy demand and the amount of oxidant consumed should be taken into account for designing efficient as well as cost effective treatment systems as one of the objectives of the present work was the evaluation of the system performance under mild ph conditions it is important to note that dd of at least 60 may be obtained for reactor ph values of around 5 0 and residence times between 45 and 60 min moreover the proposed setup allowed obtaining a much higher ab1 transformation than that recorded for zvi assisted fenton systems operated in batch mode at mild ph 3 in order to visualize the combined effects of the studied factors response surfaces calculated with the refined model equation are shown in fig 8 given the tetra dimensional nature of the experimental domain spanned each 3d representation was constructed by varying two factors and holding the remaining two factors in their central values it is important to note that some of the predicted values are slightly above 100 which is a consequence of the fact that a simple second order polynomial is incapable of foreseeing the asymptotic like trend expected for conditions that allow almost complete decolourization the inspection of fig 8 shows that the reactor ph and the hydraulic residence time are the key factors influencing the system response the added oxidant concentration and the initial ph being much less important noteworthy surfaces involving variable hrt values fig 8a c and d bear a clear curvature whereas surfaces obtained by fixing hrt are completely flat this is a consequence of the refined mathematical model obtained by the statistical analysis fig 7 and table s2 which showed that hrt is the only factor bearing a significant quadratic term in addition fig 8c evidences the contribution of the interaction term between reactor ph and hrt the decrease of the system performance with increasing the ph is not surprising as both photo fenton assisted oxidation of the target organics and zvi corrosion are favoured at low ph values however the individual evaluation of the factors phcin and phrout allows the selection of the better strategy for ph adjustment for the ranges studied the reactor ph is clearly the most important factor to take into account while the initial ph practically shows no impact on the overall decolourization efficiency this has technological relevance since it suggests that it is much more efficient to adjust the working ph after the solution passage through zvi column than controlling the ph of the raw solution moreover the rather low influence of h2o2 rin on dd values suggests that for the conditions studied in order to improve the overall system performance is much better to adjust the reactor ph than to increase the feeding oxidant concentration the presence of an important curvature of the response surface with respect to hrt was something unexpected moreover within the ph range from 4 0 5 0 optimal hrt values between 75 and 94 min are predicted by the refined model intuitive thinking suggests that increasing hrt values would allow for higher reaction advances within both the zvi column and the photo fenton reactor but no decrease in dd should be expected in order to assess the origin of the unforeseen behaviour the concentration of fe ii species at the reactor inlet for different residence times were investigated fig s7 sup mat the results show that fe ii levels represented against hrt go through a maximum value and then decrease the latter trend might be related with the increase of the time spent by the solution between the end of the zvi bed and the reactor inlet as hrt is increased briefly under the relatively high ph conditions achieved due to zvi corrosion partial oxidation of fe ii species by o2 is likely to occur before the discharge of the column effluent into the photo reactor given that the overall system performance is substantially influenced by fe ii concentrations at the reactor inlet the results presented in fig s7 are in line with the behaviour predicted by the refined model finally it is important to take into account that once the solution reaches photo reactor the oxidation of fe ii species is mostly driven by h2o2 rather than by o2 this hypothesis is supported by the results of fig 1b which show that the use of h2o2 concentrations similar to those of dissolved oxygen i e 0 26 mm for air saturated solutions at ph 7 0 leads to a substantial decrease of fe ii levels in comparison of the one observed in the absence of h2o2 the latter results together with the relatively high h2o2 concentrations fed in the photo reactor and the fact that the rate of ferrous species oxidation driven by dissolved oxygen substantially decreases below ph 6 0 clearly indicate that even under near neutral ph values fe ii within the reactor is mainly oxidized by h2o2 through the fenton reaction eq 2 4 conclusions a setup that integrates a column filled with zvi and a photo fenton reactor in a strictly continuous flow mode was used for the treatment of an azo dye under steady state conditions the spatial separation between the reductive and the oxidative transformation stages results in a better exploitation of both the zvi bed and the hydrogen peroxide consumption several issues were addressed including the coupling strategy the spectroscopic changes associated to both reductive and oxidative transformation pathways the effects of individual operating parameters on the behaviour of each treatment stage and the overall system performance for an experimental domain centred at mild acidic conditions i e ph 5 0 the analysis of the coupling strategy showed that recirculation systems are not encouraged because unless h2o2 is completely consumed during the fenton stage an excess of hydrogen peroxide may reach the zvi surface the reaction between the metallic iron and hydrogen peroxide negatively affects not only the oxidant usage but also the column lifetime and the production of fe ii species capable of triggering oxidative processes in the photo fenton reactor on the other hand since several processes related with zvi corrosion and fenton chemistry may substantially affect the ph values within the photo reactor a strict and continuous ph control during the oxidative stage is critical for obtaining a stable operation and acceptable decolourization efficiencies through the coupled system the joint analysis of the decolourization degrees and the evolution of spectral features at the end of each treatment stage allowed obtaining important information regarding the influence of different operational variables on both reductive and oxidative transformation pathways the study of the operating factors revealed that a decrease of the initial ph leads to an enhancement of the overall performance not only by the increase of the reductive transformation but also due to the increase of fe ii levels at the column outlet which lead to higher rates of the oxidative transformation within the photo reactor the application of rsm methodology allowed the development of a simple polynomial equation which is able to accurately predict the efficiency of colour removal over a wide range of experimental conditions comparison of the relative importance of the operational parameters studied shows that the reactor ph and the hydraulic residence time are the key factors influencing the system response whereas the initial ph and the added oxidant concentration are much less significant the latter finding is of major importance for designing cost effective treatments since it shows that it is much more efficient to control the ph within the reactor than adjusting the initial solution ph or increasing the feeding oxidant concentration to the best of our knowledge this is the first study describing a strictly continuous system operated at mild ph and under steady state conditions which couples a zvi induced reduction stage followed by a photo fenton oxidative stage the decolourization degrees obtained with the proposed setup were much higher than those obtained for zvi assisted fenton systems operated in batch mode at the same ph and using the same model pollutant some challenges still remain for the process implementation in practical applications among them the evaluation of matrix effects associated with the complex and fluctuating composition of actual industrial effluents as well as the disposal or potential utilization of the iron containing sludge generated from the process however the here presented results suggest that the proposed strategy may be a good technological alternative

13919,this study aimed at understanding how bacterial communities fluctuate and correlate with wastewater treatment plant wwtp efficiency over a ten month period illumina sequencing of 16 s rrna gene variable regions was performed on genomic dna extracted from aeration tank samples collected twice a week and analyzed using the bioinformatics tool quantitative insights into microbial ecology 2 qiime2 this was done in order to track and relate changes in the bacterial community in the aeration tank to the performance of the plant the results revealed that the most dominant bacterial phyla present in the aeration tank were proteobacteria 15 40 of total sequences in all samples and bacteroidetes 14 41 followed by planctomycetes 2 23 patescibacteria 2 13 chloroflexi 3 12 and nitrospirae 1 9 beta analysis revealed clear shifts in the bacterial communities with an overall cyclic pattern that correlated well with the month of the year the aeration tank samples were collected through which samples clustered in groups with samples taken in the same month clustering closer together planctomycetes and bacteroidetes were enriched during the colder while chloroflexi and nitrospirae were enriched during the warmer months lastly it was also found that the efficiency of biological oxygen demand bod and ammonia n removals were significantly correlated p 0 05 with the occurrence of bdellovibrio bacterial genus and members of hydrogenophilaceae respectively this study is the first to provide this level of temporal resolution on bacterial community fluctuations in a full scale wwtp in the uae keywords wastewater treatment activated sludge bacterial community illumina 16s rrna sequencing seasonal variations 1 introduction the biological treatment of wastewater is a multibillion dollar industry and one of the largest industries in the world that uses biotechnology 1 activated sludge processes asps have high treatment efficiency with relatively low operating costs and are commonly used to treat municipal and industrial wastewater microorganisms play a key role in wastewater treatment and over 95 of the total microbes found in wastewater treatment reactors are bacterial 2 over the past years engineers have designed wastewater treatment plants wwtps based on clear chemical and physical principles in contrast the principles that govern the types of microbes present and how their interactions affect reactor function are less clear therefore a better understanding of wastewater treatment microbiology will usher in the next phase of improvements made to the wwtp design and operation there are many factors affecting the bacterial communities in wwtps such as influent wastewater composition operational parameters and environmental conditions 3 4 characteristics of influent wastewater such as total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod and alkalinity could also influence the bacterial communities present in a reactor 4 in addition other environmental parameters such as dissolved oxygen do temperature and solid retention time srt may also affect the resident bacterial community as previously explored in other studies 5 6 finally seasonal variations have also been shown to play a role in the bacterial community composition in various industrial systems 7 9 11 all these parameters should be studied in order to determine which of them significantly affect the bacterial composition and ultimately the performance of the wwtp we believe that as the bacterial population structure varies the pollutant removal level will also differ to date the association between the operational parameters and efficiency of full scale wwtps and the resulting bacterial community diversity has received limited attention in this research study 16 s rrna gene illumina sequencing data from bacterial communities residing in the aeration tank of a full scale wwtp were used to track the changes in the community over a ten month period and relate that to the performance of the wwtp therefore the main objectives of this study were to i determine the temporal dynamics of the bacterial community structure that existed in the aeration tank of the wwtp and ii investigate the relationship between different environmental parameters the wwtp bacterial community and variations in the wwtp performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and dna extraction sampling was performed over a ten month period between july and may and was designed to consider the seasonal variations in the wastewater quality furthermore it was performed on the same days that the wwtp s laboratory carried out sludge analysis as well as physical biological and chemical analysis of both raw wastewater and final treated effluent briefly 50 ml samples were collected in 50 ml sterile conical tubes from the aeration tank of a local wwtp in the united arab emirates uae twice a week and processed in our laboratory on the same day to avoid any changes in the physico chemical and microbiological characteristics 12 dna was extracted using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc carlsbad ca usa using the protocol provided with the kit with some modifications as detailed here samples in the 50 ml conical tubes were mixed by inversion before transferring 10 ml into a 15 ml conical tube the 15 ml conical tubes were centrifuged at 4 500xg for 15 min to pellet bacterial cells the supernatant was removed and the pellet was suspended in the buffer contained in the powerbead tubes provided with the dna extraction kit 500 μl of the pellet suspension was transferred to the powerbead tubes where 60 μl of c1 solution containing sds and other disruption agents was added the powerbead tubes were vortexed at maximum speed for 10 min using the mobio vortex adapter tube holder in order to lyse microbial cells the concentration and purity of extracted gdna was measured using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer and stored at 20 c until all the samples were collected and sequenced together at the end of the sampling period 2 2 16s rrna gene variable region illumina sequencing genomic dna extracted from the samples was shipped to macrogen inc seoul republic of korea for illumina miseq 16s rrna gene sequencing at macrogen inc 16s rrna gene libraries were constructed using herculase ii fusion dna polymerase nextera xt index kits by agilent technologies santa clara ca usa the amplicons were generated using the 337 f and 805r 16s v3 v4 rrna universal primers gactcctacgggaggcwgcag and gactaccagggtatctaatc the raw 16s v3 v4 sequences were uploaded as fastq files to the us national center for biotechnology information ncbi database bioproject accession prjna634990 2 3 influent wastewater and treated effluent physico chemical characterization data regarding the physico chemical characteristics of influent wastewater and treated effluent were provided by the wwtp analytical laboratory further analyses on both samples were conducted to ensure reproducibility of the results tss were analyzed according to the american public health association apha do conductivity and ph were measured using the do meter hq40d multi meter hach bod cod ammonia n and phosphorus p fractions were analyzed using lck vials hach lange dr3900 spectrophotometer comprehensive raw wastewater data analyses are available as metadata that accompanies the raw sequence files uploaded to ncbi bioproject accession prjna634990 2 4 bioinformatics and diversity analysis after receiving the fastq files they were analyzed using quantitative insights into microbial ecology ii qiime 2 software version 2018 6 13 the following approach was used as adapted from the user manual of the software i import raw data and examine sequence read quality fastq files were converted into a qiime2 artifact qza file using the import command the quality data for all the sequences were visualized using the demux summarize which generates a qzv file based on the quality plots we determined how many bases we want to remove from the forward and reverse reads a parameter in the next filtering and denoising step of the pipeline in our analysis sequence bases with quality score less than 20 base call accuracy 99 were eliminated from both ends of the reads ii filtering and denoising the qiime2 dada2 denoise paired command was used to trim and filter the reads after importing them into a qza file 16 bases and 20 bases were trimmed from the beginning and end of the forward reads respectively total read length 264 0 and 60 bases were trimmed from the beginning and end of the reverse reads respectively total read length 240 iii generating a phylogenetic tree first a multiple sequence alignment was generated by running the qiime2 alignment mafft command next the alignment mask command was run in order to filter the sequence alignment and remove highly variable positions that can add noise to a resulting phylogenetic tree once the sequenced were aligned and filtered an unrooted tree was generated using the qiime2 phylogeny fasttree in the final step the phylogenic tree was rooted by running the qiime2 phylogeny midpoint root v performing diversity analyses the qiime2 diversity core metrics phylogenetic command was used to calculate a series of diversity metrics including several alpha and beta diversity metrics rarefaction analysis was also carried using the used the command diversity alpha rarefaction in order to confirm sufficient sequencing depth iv assigning taxonomy to sequence reads a trained classifier file for 16s rrna sequences which uses the latest silva database silva 132 99 515 806 naive bayesian was downloaded from the qiime2 website the classifier was used to run the qiime2 feature classifier classify sklearn command and assign taxonomies to the sequence reads taxonomy plots were then visualized using the taxa barplot command 2 5 binning methods for sample metadata the manifest csv file used in the bioinformatics pipeline contained binned data that we generated based on the raw data provided by the wwtp laboratory in all cases binning was performed by looking at the range and distribution of the data for ambient temperature hot was assigned if the temperature was greater than 25 c and cold if less than 25 c for phosphorus p concentrations in the influent values less than 5 mg l were coded as low values between 5 and 8 where coded medium and values greater than 8 mg l were coded as high all the raw data related to influent wastewater characteristics including ph conductivity alkalinity total hardness bod cod ammonia n and tss were approximately normally distributed as visualized in a histogram for this reason they were categorized into three groups high medium and low if the value fell within one standard deviation of the mean it was considered medium greater than one standard deviation above the mean was high and greater than one standard deviation below the mean was considered low 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater treatment plant performance the weather in abu dhabi is characterized by mainly 2 seasons summer and winter the ambient temperature readings during our sampling period indicate that our study covered both of these seasons with temperatures ranging between approximately 19 c winter and 41 c summer fig 1 a the municipal wwtp that was studied was very effective at organic matter removal as the bod removal percentage was greater than 98 for all samples over the testing period fig 1b while cod removal percentage was consistently around 98 fig 1c although the wwtp was receiving influent wastewater with high concentrations of bod maximum bod 400 mg l and cod maximum cod 600 mg l the bod and cod levels in the treated effluent always met the regulation and supervision bureau rsb in the emirate of abu dhabi uae indeed during the entire study period all treated effluent samples had bod level less than 3 mg l rsb limit 10 mg l and cod level less than 25 mg l rsb limit 100 mg l moreover tss removal was consistently greater than 96 fig 1d the tss levels in the effluent for all samples tested also fell within rsb limits 10 mg l removing nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus is critical for treating wastewater ammonia n was effectively eliminated from the wwtp influent with removal percentages consistently being greater than 99 fig 1e the influent wastewater during the study had ammonia n concentrations ranging between 20 and 40 mg l with concentrations in the discharged effluent being reduced to less than 2 mg l thus meeting the rsb regulatory limits conversely phosphorus p removal fluctuated over the sampling period the wwtp s ability to remove phosphorus p was better in cold months compared to hot months indeed the highest phosphorus p removal percentage was observed in march 65 while the lowest phosphorus p removal was recorded in september 14 fig 1f it has been reported that temperature is an important factor which influences phosphorus accumulating organism pao and glycogen accumulation non polyp organism gao competition 14 17 in an enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr water treatment system similar to most biological reactions a low temperature decreases biochemical transformation rates including growth phosphorus release and uptake acetate uptake and poly b hydroxyalkanoate pha oxidation 14 in other cases some lab scale studies found that a lower temperature enhances the performance of ebpr 15 17 for example one study revealed that optimal ebpr performance was observed at 20 c while lower phosphorus removal was achieved at 30 c where gaos were dominant 15 furthermore it has been reported that organic loading plays a pivotal role in the removal of nutrients from wastewater for instance carbon to phosphorus c p ratio has a great effect on the removal of phosphorus such that high removal rates of phosphorus are achieved when c p ratio is low in the course of this study it was observed that c p ratio was higher in summer than in winter this would favor the growth of pao over the gao which indeed resulted in higher removal of phosphorus p from wastewater these findings were in line with previous studies that showed a low c p ratio of 10 20 mg cod mg p in wastewater influent favors the growth of paos while a high c p ratio is more favorable for gaos resulting in reduced efficiency of phosphorus removal 18 in addition it has been reported that excessive aeration has a negative impact on phosphorus removal due to depletion of poly hydroxy butyrate phb which limits the phosphorus uptake rate 19 20 accordingly do could be a factor that is affecting the incomplete phosphorous removal in this study where do levels were consistently greater than 3 mg l 3 2 bacterial population structure in aeration tank samples phylogenetic analysis of the bacterial communities in aeration tank samples at the phylum level is summarized in fig 2 the most dominant bacterial phyla present in all samples were proteobacteria 15 40 of total sequences in all samples and bacteroidetes 14 41 followed by planctomycetes 2 23 patescibacteria 2 13 chloroflexi 3 12 and nitrospirae 1 9 these results are consistent with previous studies that found proteobacteria is the most dominant phylum in activated sludge collected from various places worldwide followed by divergent proportions of mainly bacteroidetes chloroflexi actinobacteria planctomycetes and firmicutes 21 22 proteobacteria the largest and most diverst bacterial phylum includes species with massive physiological morphological and metabolic diversity and are though to play a critical role in global carbon nitrogen and sulphur cycles 23 25 the main role of bacteroidetes and chloroflexi is complex organic substances and polymers degradation 26 they decompose dead cells and exopolysaccharides eps into simpler organic matter such as lactate and ethanol which can be utilized by other species in their metabolism 26 additionally nitrospirae is the key phylum for nitrogen removal in activated sludge and is involved in nitrite oxidation 27 moving further down the taxonomy classification scheme the most abundant observed orders in the samples were bacteroidia belonging to bacteroidetes gammaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria belonging to proteobacteria anaerolineae belonging to chloroflexi and nitrospira belonging to nitrospirae the most abundant classes in the samples were betaproteobacteriales chitinophagales nitrospira and myxococcales finally saprospiraceae rhodocyclaceae microscillaceae and nitrospiraceae are the most abundant bacterial families observed in the aeration tank samples the bacterial community makeup determined in each sample is also provided at the other various taxonomic levels supplementary file 1 we also provided as supplementary data the qzv files generated by qiime2 with regards to the taxonomy assignments for each sample supplementary file 2 from a temporal perspective proteobacteria was the dominant phyla throughout the study with observed relative frequencies ranging between 18 and 39 and no obvious fluctuation patterns through the year fig 2 mirroring previous results for activated sludge process studies 9 28 on the other hand bacteroidetes was enriched during the colder months of january february and the beginning of march and actually took over as the dominant phyla during the month of january fig 2 the most obvious phylum to be enriched during the colder months was planctomycetes increasing from an average relative frequency of approximately 5 in the warmer months to a relative frequency of approximately 20 in the colder months fig 2 in addition chloroflexi and nitrospirae were enriched during the warmer months fig 2 notably these observations at the phylum level agree with other studies that assessed changes in microbial communities due to seasonal changes for example it was reported that nitrospirae and chlorflexi species are enriched during warmer months from studies conducted in hong kong 29 and mainland china 7 at the family and genus level the most obvious enrichment during the cold months was observed in species belonging to rubinisphaeraceae and genus planctomicrobium which is a member of the planctomycetes phylum supplementary file 2 not much is known about planctomycetes and the specific family rubinisphaeraceae but it has been reported that members of this phylum are typically associated with wetlands and bogs and bioinformatics analysis on sequenced genomes points to the presence of extremely high glycolytic potential in these bacteria 30 as far as the authors knowledge the abundance and temporal based enrichment or depletion of these species in bacterial communities detected in wwtps has not been reported similar to rubinisphaeraceae enrichment during the cold months was observed in species belonging to microscillaceae a member of the phylum bacteroidetes supplementary file 2 interestingly a previous report studying bacterial community evolution in a continuous flow moving bed biofilm reactor observed enrichment of this species as the reactor reached 110 days of operation and this coincided with improved phosphorus removal 31 the most obviously enriched species during the warmer months belong to the family hydrogenophilaceae supplementary file 2 members of this family have been associated with enhanced nitrogen removal in different studies 32 33 in order to investigate the relationship between the diversity of the bacterial community and parameters related to the environment and plant performance the faith phylogenetic diversity pd index 34 of the samples was analyzed after they were binned for every parameter the faith pd index for parameters that were determined to be significant p 0 05 by one way anova on ranks were plotted on bar graphs and are presented in fig 3 of note the phylogenetic diversity in the bacterial communities analyzed during the course of the study indicated that diversity decreases during the colder months december january and february compared to the warmer months fig 3a and b lower diversity was also observed when the levels of phosphorus in influent wastewater were at an intermediate level between 5 and 8 mg l compared to low and high levels fig 3c finally low bacterial diversity in the community was also associated with a more efficient removal of phosphorus by the wwtp fig 3d interestingly lower diversity was not correlated with more efficient nitrogen removal in this study p 0 34 but this might be due to a lack of sufficient differences in observed ammonia removal since the plant was able to remove at least 95 of influent ammonia throughout the study fig 1e not much is known about how bacterial diversity in activated sludge correlates with environmental parameters it is worth noting though that despite the lower diversity in the colder months the diversity of the microbial community in activated sludge is still relatively high compared to other environmental samples as over 800 genera were detected in these samples this diversity reflects the numerous nutrient and energy sources typically found in wastewater which provides an environment for diverse microbes to thrive in 3 3 beta diversity analysis of bacterial communities in aeration tank one of the main objectives of the study was to determine how bacterial communities in the aeration tank could vary over time and how they could be correlated with the metadata e g plant performance environmental conditions collected beta diversity analysis was carried out through which principle coordinate analysis pcoa plots were generated and visualized by emperor 35 the analysis revealed clear shifts in bacterial communities with an overall cyclic pattern that correlated well with the month of the year the aeration tank samples were taken fig 4 a as can be seen samples clustered in groups with samples taken in the same month clustering closer together remarkably the bacterial communities collected in july at the beginning of the study were closest to samples collected in may almost a year later thus our data clearly indicated a cyclical and possibly predictable seasonal variations in the bacterial community where the population structure experienced specific changes dependent on the season seasonality of bacterial communities in various industrial systems has also been described in the past 7 9 28 29 but the data presented here is the first to track these changes to this level of temporal resolution twice a week our pcoa analysis also indicated that the ambient temperature is a parameter that correlates with differences in the observed bacterial community structure indeed when the samples on the plot are color coded based on ambient temperature it is clear that bacterial communities in aeration tank samples collected on a hot day ambient temperature 25 c clustered together and were separate from samples collected on a cold day 25 c which also clustered together on the pcoa plot fig 4b the other environmental parameter that could influence the bacterial communities in the aeration tank is the concentration of nutrients that were delivered to the microbes in the form of influent wastewater we wanted to examine if distinct clusters of samples on a pcoa plot formed when samples were indicated based on nutrient concentrations in the influent food intake and effluent efficiency at degrading the nutrient it was observed that there was no correlation between the bacterial community in aeration tank samples and nitrogen removal throughout the year in addition there were no specific patterns that correlated with the amount of ammonia in the influent wastewater the ability to find these patterns could be attributed to the very small variability in ammonia found in influent 20 40 mg l and the very low variability observed in the effluent very low levels due to the efficiency of the wwtp conversely significant variations in phosphorus levels observed in the influent and treated effluent allowed us to determine correlations between bacterial populations and phosphorus levels in influents and effluents fig 5 a indeed there was a clear clustering of samples that were collected on days where the influent had low phosphorus p concentration 5 mg l blue samples with a clear separation from samples collected where influent had high phosphorus p concentration red spheres grouped separately similarly samples clustered together in correlation to whether removal of phosphorus p was high or low fig 5b taken together this data is the first to our knowledge to indicate a possible link between phosphorus levels in the wastewater influent and the bacterial community that develops in the treatment reactor this is not surprising as another study demonstrated a link between nitrogen levels in the influent and bacterial communities that developed in a granule based enhanced biological phosphorus removal system 36 3 4 regression analysis between genera of interest and sample metadata in order to determine if certain bacterial genera found in aeration tank samples correlated with influent and effluent water quality data regression analysis was performed specific bacterial genera were selected based on a litereature review summarized in table 1 the dependent variables we looked at included i removal efficiency of bod ii phosphourus p and iii ammonia n finally muliple regression analysis was performed for genera with significant correlations determined to be p 0 2 a priori for each of these dependent variables the regression analysis indicated that bdellovibrio was significantly correlated with bod removal performance p 0 05 while other genera such as streptococcus flavobacterium and members of the peptostreptococcaceae family were also correlated at a lower significance threshold p 0 2 table 2 all of these genera correlated negatively with bod removal efficiency table 3 the r squared value for bdellovibrio was 0 055 indicating that 5 5 of the variability in bod removal efficiency can be attributed to the abundance of this genus alone the other genera tested with p 0 2 had r squared values that ranged between 1 9 and 3 2 a multiple regression analysis was subsequently performed using the four genera determined to be statistically significantly correlated p 0 2 with bod removal efficiency this analysis indicated that the abundance of the four genera together can explain 10 of the variability observed in bod removal bdellovibrio are beneficial predatory bacteria that prey on other gram negative pathogens research proposed that they have an important role in pathogenic bacterial coliform bacteria and salmonella removal in a pretreatment process of domestic water that is used for irrigation purposes 37 streptococcus are a glucose fermenting genus and flavobacterium are heterotrophic bacteria which can remove bod from wastewater and degrade petroleum compounds such as naphthalene pyrene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 5 38 additionally peptostreptococcaceae include genera involved in fermentation and organic matter elimination during activated sludge processes based on a recent study they predominate during hydrolysis acidification 39 for phosphorus p removal the regression analysis demostrated that candidatus competibacter is the only species that statistically significantly correlated p 0 2 with phosphorus p removal efficiency table 4 interestingly candidatus competibacter was the first gao to be identified 40 finally members of the hydrogenophilaceae family were significantly correlated with ammonia n removal efficiency p 0 05 and 11 of the variability can be attrributed to the abundance of these genera alone additionally the abundance of nitrospira thauera and haliangium were also correlated with ammonia n removal efficiency at a lower signficance threshold p 0 2 table 5 a positive correlation was observed between ammonia n removal and hydrogenophilaceae and nitrospira while the other genera displated a negative correlation multiple regression analysis showed that these genera together contribute to 15 of the variability detected in ammonia n removal table 6 nitrospira are common dominant nitrite oxidizing bacteria in most wwtps which have an ability of performing a complete nitrification process 41 additionally nitrospira can outcompete other nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob due to their high affinity to nitrite and oxygen 42 conversely hydrogenophilaceae thauera and haliangium are denitrifiers these correlations have been observed in other studies as well 7 32 4 conclusions in this research study correlations between bacterial community structure and performance efficiency of a full scale wastewater treatment plant were investigated over ten months the results revealed that the most dominant bacterial phyla present in the aeration tank were proteobacteria 15 40 of total sequences in all samples and bacteroidetes 14 41 followed by planctomycetes 2 23 patescibacteria 2 13 chloroflexi 3 12 and nitrospirae 1 9 beta analysis revealed clear shifts in the bacterial communities with an overall cyclic pattern that correlated well with the month of the year the aeration tank samples were collected through which samples clustered in groups with samples taken in the same month clustering closer together lastly it was also found that the efficiency of bod and ammonia n removals were significantly correlated p 0 05 with the occurrence of bdellovibrio bacterial genus and

13919,this study aimed at understanding how bacterial communities fluctuate and correlate with wastewater treatment plant wwtp efficiency over a ten month period illumina sequencing of 16 s rrna gene variable regions was performed on genomic dna extracted from aeration tank samples collected twice a week and analyzed using the bioinformatics tool quantitative insights into microbial ecology 2 qiime2 this was done in order to track and relate changes in the bacterial community in the aeration tank to the performance of the plant the results revealed that the most dominant bacterial phyla present in the aeration tank were proteobacteria 15 40 of total sequences in all samples and bacteroidetes 14 41 followed by planctomycetes 2 23 patescibacteria 2 13 chloroflexi 3 12 and nitrospirae 1 9 beta analysis revealed clear shifts in the bacterial communities with an overall cyclic pattern that correlated well with the month of the year the aeration tank samples were collected through which samples clustered in groups with samples taken in the same month clustering closer together planctomycetes and bacteroidetes were enriched during the colder while chloroflexi and nitrospirae were enriched during the warmer months lastly it was also found that the efficiency of biological oxygen demand bod and ammonia n removals were significantly correlated p 0 05 with the occurrence of bdellovibrio bacterial genus and members of hydrogenophilaceae respectively this study is the first to provide this level of temporal resolution on bacterial community fluctuations in a full scale wwtp in the uae keywords wastewater treatment activated sludge bacterial community illumina 16s rrna sequencing seasonal variations 1 introduction the biological treatment of wastewater is a multibillion dollar industry and one of the largest industries in the world that uses biotechnology 1 activated sludge processes asps have high treatment efficiency with relatively low operating costs and are commonly used to treat municipal and industrial wastewater microorganisms play a key role in wastewater treatment and over 95 of the total microbes found in wastewater treatment reactors are bacterial 2 over the past years engineers have designed wastewater treatment plants wwtps based on clear chemical and physical principles in contrast the principles that govern the types of microbes present and how their interactions affect reactor function are less clear therefore a better understanding of wastewater treatment microbiology will usher in the next phase of improvements made to the wwtp design and operation there are many factors affecting the bacterial communities in wwtps such as influent wastewater composition operational parameters and environmental conditions 3 4 characteristics of influent wastewater such as total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod and alkalinity could also influence the bacterial communities present in a reactor 4 in addition other environmental parameters such as dissolved oxygen do temperature and solid retention time srt may also affect the resident bacterial community as previously explored in other studies 5 6 finally seasonal variations have also been shown to play a role in the bacterial community composition in various industrial systems 7 9 11 all these parameters should be studied in order to determine which of them significantly affect the bacterial composition and ultimately the performance of the wwtp we believe that as the bacterial population structure varies the pollutant removal level will also differ to date the association between the operational parameters and efficiency of full scale wwtps and the resulting bacterial community diversity has received limited attention in this research study 16 s rrna gene illumina sequencing data from bacterial communities residing in the aeration tank of a full scale wwtp were used to track the changes in the community over a ten month period and relate that to the performance of the wwtp therefore the main objectives of this study were to i determine the temporal dynamics of the bacterial community structure that existed in the aeration tank of the wwtp and ii investigate the relationship between different environmental parameters the wwtp bacterial community and variations in the wwtp performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and dna extraction sampling was performed over a ten month period between july and may and was designed to consider the seasonal variations in the wastewater quality furthermore it was performed on the same days that the wwtp s laboratory carried out sludge analysis as well as physical biological and chemical analysis of both raw wastewater and final treated effluent briefly 50 ml samples were collected in 50 ml sterile conical tubes from the aeration tank of a local wwtp in the united arab emirates uae twice a week and processed in our laboratory on the same day to avoid any changes in the physico chemical and microbiological characteristics 12 dna was extracted using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc carlsbad ca usa using the protocol provided with the kit with some modifications as detailed here samples in the 50 ml conical tubes were mixed by inversion before transferring 10 ml into a 15 ml conical tube the 15 ml conical tubes were centrifuged at 4 500xg for 15 min to pellet bacterial cells the supernatant was removed and the pellet was suspended in the buffer contained in the powerbead tubes provided with the dna extraction kit 500 μl of the pellet suspension was transferred to the powerbead tubes where 60 μl of c1 solution containing sds and other disruption agents was added the powerbead tubes were vortexed at maximum speed for 10 min using the mobio vortex adapter tube holder in order to lyse microbial cells the concentration and purity of extracted gdna was measured using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer and stored at 20 c until all the samples were collected and sequenced together at the end of the sampling period 2 2 16s rrna gene variable region illumina sequencing genomic dna extracted from the samples was shipped to macrogen inc seoul republic of korea for illumina miseq 16s rrna gene sequencing at macrogen inc 16s rrna gene libraries were constructed using herculase ii fusion dna polymerase nextera xt index kits by agilent technologies santa clara ca usa the amplicons were generated using the 337 f and 805r 16s v3 v4 rrna universal primers gactcctacgggaggcwgcag and gactaccagggtatctaatc the raw 16s v3 v4 sequences were uploaded as fastq files to the us national center for biotechnology information ncbi database bioproject accession prjna634990 2 3 influent wastewater and treated effluent physico chemical characterization data regarding the physico chemical characteristics of influent wastewater and treated effluent were provided by the wwtp analytical laboratory further analyses on both samples were conducted to ensure reproducibility of the results tss were analyzed according to the american public health association apha do conductivity and ph were measured using the do meter hq40d multi meter hach bod cod ammonia n and phosphorus p fractions were analyzed using lck vials hach lange dr3900 spectrophotometer comprehensive raw wastewater data analyses are available as metadata that accompanies the raw sequence files uploaded to ncbi bioproject accession prjna634990 2 4 bioinformatics and diversity analysis after receiving the fastq files they were analyzed using quantitative insights into microbial ecology ii qiime 2 software version 2018 6 13 the following approach was used as adapted from the user manual of the software i import raw data and examine sequence read quality fastq files were converted into a qiime2 artifact qza file using the import command the quality data for all the sequences were visualized using the demux summarize which generates a qzv file based on the quality plots we determined how many bases we want to remove from the forward and reverse reads a parameter in the next filtering and denoising step of the pipeline in our analysis sequence bases with quality score less than 20 base call accuracy 99 were eliminated from both ends of the reads ii filtering and denoising the qiime2 dada2 denoise paired command was used to trim and filter the reads after importing them into a qza file 16 bases and 20 bases were trimmed from the beginning and end of the forward reads respectively total read length 264 0 and 60 bases were trimmed from the beginning and end of the reverse reads respectively total read length 240 iii generating a phylogenetic tree first a multiple sequence alignment was generated by running the qiime2 alignment mafft command next the alignment mask command was run in order to filter the sequence alignment and remove highly variable positions that can add noise to a resulting phylogenetic tree once the sequenced were aligned and filtered an unrooted tree was generated using the qiime2 phylogeny fasttree in the final step the phylogenic tree was rooted by running the qiime2 phylogeny midpoint root v performing diversity analyses the qiime2 diversity core metrics phylogenetic command was used to calculate a series of diversity metrics including several alpha and beta diversity metrics rarefaction analysis was also carried using the used the command diversity alpha rarefaction in order to confirm sufficient sequencing depth iv assigning taxonomy to sequence reads a trained classifier file for 16s rrna sequences which uses the latest silva database silva 132 99 515 806 naive bayesian was downloaded from the qiime2 website the classifier was used to run the qiime2 feature classifier classify sklearn command and assign taxonomies to the sequence reads taxonomy plots were then visualized using the taxa barplot command 2 5 binning methods for sample metadata the manifest csv file used in the bioinformatics pipeline contained binned data that we generated based on the raw data provided by the wwtp laboratory in all cases binning was performed by looking at the range and distribution of the data for ambient temperature hot was assigned if the temperature was greater than 25 c and cold if less than 25 c for phosphorus p concentrations in the influent values less than 5 mg l were coded as low values between 5 and 8 where coded medium and values greater than 8 mg l were coded as high all the raw data related to influent wastewater characteristics including ph conductivity alkalinity total hardness bod cod ammonia n and tss were approximately normally distributed as visualized in a histogram for this reason they were categorized into three groups high medium and low if the value fell within one standard deviation of the mean it was considered medium greater than one standard deviation above the mean was high and greater than one standard deviation below the mean was considered low 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater treatment plant performance the weather in abu dhabi is characterized by mainly 2 seasons summer and winter the ambient temperature readings during our sampling period indicate that our study covered both of these seasons with temperatures ranging between approximately 19 c winter and 41 c summer fig 1 a the municipal wwtp that was studied was very effective at organic matter removal as the bod removal percentage was greater than 98 for all samples over the testing period fig 1b while cod removal percentage was consistently around 98 fig 1c although the wwtp was receiving influent wastewater with high concentrations of bod maximum bod 400 mg l and cod maximum cod 600 mg l the bod and cod levels in the treated effluent always met the regulation and supervision bureau rsb in the emirate of abu dhabi uae indeed during the entire study period all treated effluent samples had bod level less than 3 mg l rsb limit 10 mg l and cod level less than 25 mg l rsb limit 100 mg l moreover tss removal was consistently greater than 96 fig 1d the tss levels in the effluent for all samples tested also fell within rsb limits 10 mg l removing nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus is critical for treating wastewater ammonia n was effectively eliminated from the wwtp influent with removal percentages consistently being greater than 99 fig 1e the influent wastewater during the study had ammonia n concentrations ranging between 20 and 40 mg l with concentrations in the discharged effluent being reduced to less than 2 mg l thus meeting the rsb regulatory limits conversely phosphorus p removal fluctuated over the sampling period the wwtp s ability to remove phosphorus p was better in cold months compared to hot months indeed the highest phosphorus p removal percentage was observed in march 65 while the lowest phosphorus p removal was recorded in september 14 fig 1f it has been reported that temperature is an important factor which influences phosphorus accumulating organism pao and glycogen accumulation non polyp organism gao competition 14 17 in an enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr water treatment system similar to most biological reactions a low temperature decreases biochemical transformation rates including growth phosphorus release and uptake acetate uptake and poly b hydroxyalkanoate pha oxidation 14 in other cases some lab scale studies found that a lower temperature enhances the performance of ebpr 15 17 for example one study revealed that optimal ebpr performance was observed at 20 c while lower phosphorus removal was achieved at 30 c where gaos were dominant 15 furthermore it has been reported that organic loading plays a pivotal role in the removal of nutrients from wastewater for instance carbon to phosphorus c p ratio has a great effect on the removal of phosphorus such that high removal rates of phosphorus are achieved when c p ratio is low in the course of this study it was observed that c p ratio was higher in summer than in winter this would favor the growth of pao over the gao which indeed resulted in higher removal of phosphorus p from wastewater these findings were in line with previous studies that showed a low c p ratio of 10 20 mg cod mg p in wastewater influent favors the growth of paos while a high c p ratio is more favorable for gaos resulting in reduced efficiency of phosphorus removal 18 in addition it has been reported that excessive aeration has a negative impact on phosphorus removal due to depletion of poly hydroxy butyrate phb which limits the phosphorus uptake rate 19 20 accordingly do could be a factor that is affecting the incomplete phosphorous removal in this study where do levels were consistently greater than 3 mg l 3 2 bacterial population structure in aeration tank samples phylogenetic analysis of the bacterial communities in aeration tank samples at the phylum level is summarized in fig 2 the most dominant bacterial phyla present in all samples were proteobacteria 15 40 of total sequences in all samples and bacteroidetes 14 41 followed by planctomycetes 2 23 patescibacteria 2 13 chloroflexi 3 12 and nitrospirae 1 9 these results are consistent with previous studies that found proteobacteria is the most dominant phylum in activated sludge collected from various places worldwide followed by divergent proportions of mainly bacteroidetes chloroflexi actinobacteria planctomycetes and firmicutes 21 22 proteobacteria the largest and most diverst bacterial phylum includes species with massive physiological morphological and metabolic diversity and are though to play a critical role in global carbon nitrogen and sulphur cycles 23 25 the main role of bacteroidetes and chloroflexi is complex organic substances and polymers degradation 26 they decompose dead cells and exopolysaccharides eps into simpler organic matter such as lactate and ethanol which can be utilized by other species in their metabolism 26 additionally nitrospirae is the key phylum for nitrogen removal in activated sludge and is involved in nitrite oxidation 27 moving further down the taxonomy classification scheme the most abundant observed orders in the samples were bacteroidia belonging to bacteroidetes gammaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria belonging to proteobacteria anaerolineae belonging to chloroflexi and nitrospira belonging to nitrospirae the most abundant classes in the samples were betaproteobacteriales chitinophagales nitrospira and myxococcales finally saprospiraceae rhodocyclaceae microscillaceae and nitrospiraceae are the most abundant bacterial families observed in the aeration tank samples the bacterial community makeup determined in each sample is also provided at the other various taxonomic levels supplementary file 1 we also provided as supplementary data the qzv files generated by qiime2 with regards to the taxonomy assignments for each sample supplementary file 2 from a temporal perspective proteobacteria was the dominant phyla throughout the study with observed relative frequencies ranging between 18 and 39 and no obvious fluctuation patterns through the year fig 2 mirroring previous results for activated sludge process studies 9 28 on the other hand bacteroidetes was enriched during the colder months of january february and the beginning of march and actually took over as the dominant phyla during the month of january fig 2 the most obvious phylum to be enriched during the colder months was planctomycetes increasing from an average relative frequency of approximately 5 in the warmer months to a relative frequency of approximately 20 in the colder months fig 2 in addition chloroflexi and nitrospirae were enriched during the warmer months fig 2 notably these observations at the phylum level agree with other studies that assessed changes in microbial communities due to seasonal changes for example it was reported that nitrospirae and chlorflexi species are enriched during warmer months from studies conducted in hong kong 29 and mainland china 7 at the family and genus level the most obvious enrichment during the cold months was observed in species belonging to rubinisphaeraceae and genus planctomicrobium which is a member of the planctomycetes phylum supplementary file 2 not much is known about planctomycetes and the specific family rubinisphaeraceae but it has been reported that members of this phylum are typically associated with wetlands and bogs and bioinformatics analysis on sequenced genomes points to the presence of extremely high glycolytic potential in these bacteria 30 as far as the authors knowledge the abundance and temporal based enrichment or depletion of these species in bacterial communities detected in wwtps has not been reported similar to rubinisphaeraceae enrichment during the cold months was observed in species belonging to microscillaceae a member of the phylum bacteroidetes supplementary file 2 interestingly a previous report studying bacterial community evolution in a continuous flow moving bed biofilm reactor observed enrichment of this species as the reactor reached 110 days of operation and this coincided with improved phosphorus removal 31 the most obviously enriched species during the warmer months belong to the family hydrogenophilaceae supplementary file 2 members of this family have been associated with enhanced nitrogen removal in different studies 32 33 in order to investigate the relationship between the diversity of the bacterial community and parameters related to the environment and plant performance the faith phylogenetic diversity pd index 34 of the samples was analyzed after they were binned for every parameter the faith pd index for parameters that were determined to be significant p 0 05 by one way anova on ranks were plotted on bar graphs and are presented in fig 3 of note the phylogenetic diversity in the bacterial communities analyzed during the course of the study indicated that diversity decreases during the colder months december january and february compared to the warmer months fig 3a and b lower diversity was also observed when the levels of phosphorus in influent wastewater were at an intermediate level between 5 and 8 mg l compared to low and high levels fig 3c finally low bacterial diversity in the community was also associated with a more efficient removal of phosphorus by the wwtp fig 3d interestingly lower diversity was not correlated with more efficient nitrogen removal in this study p 0 34 but this might be due to a lack of sufficient differences in observed ammonia removal since the plant was able to remove at least 95 of influent ammonia throughout the study fig 1e not much is known about how bacterial diversity in activated sludge correlates with environmental parameters it is worth noting though that despite the lower diversity in the colder months the diversity of the microbial community in activated sludge is still relatively high compared to other environmental samples as over 800 genera were detected in these samples this diversity reflects the numerous nutrient and energy sources typically found in wastewater which provides an environment for diverse microbes to thrive in 3 3 beta diversity analysis of bacterial communities in aeration tank one of the main objectives of the study was to determine how bacterial communities in the aeration tank could vary over time and how they could be correlated with the metadata e g plant performance environmental conditions collected beta diversity analysis was carried out through which principle coordinate analysis pcoa plots were generated and visualized by emperor 35 the analysis revealed clear shifts in bacterial communities with an overall cyclic pattern that correlated well with the month of the year the aeration tank samples were taken fig 4 a as can be seen samples clustered in groups with samples taken in the same month clustering closer together remarkably the bacterial communities collected in july at the beginning of the study were closest to samples collected in may almost a year later thus our data clearly indicated a cyclical and possibly predictable seasonal variations in the bacterial community where the population structure experienced specific changes dependent on the season seasonality of bacterial communities in various industrial systems has also been described in the past 7 9 28 29 but the data presented here is the first to track these changes to this level of temporal resolution twice a week our pcoa analysis also indicated that the ambient temperature is a parameter that correlates with differences in the observed bacterial community structure indeed when the samples on the plot are color coded based on ambient temperature it is clear that bacterial communities in aeration tank samples collected on a hot day ambient temperature 25 c clustered together and were separate from samples collected on a cold day 25 c which also clustered together on the pcoa plot fig 4b the other environmental parameter that could influence the bacterial communities in the aeration tank is the concentration of nutrients that were delivered to the microbes in the form of influent wastewater we wanted to examine if distinct clusters of samples on a pcoa plot formed when samples were indicated based on nutrient concentrations in the influent food intake and effluent efficiency at degrading the nutrient it was observed that there was no correlation between the bacterial community in aeration tank samples and nitrogen removal throughout the year in addition there were no specific patterns that correlated with the amount of ammonia in the influent wastewater the ability to find these patterns could be attributed to the very small variability in ammonia found in influent 20 40 mg l and the very low variability observed in the effluent very low levels due to the efficiency of the wwtp conversely significant variations in phosphorus levels observed in the influent and treated effluent allowed us to determine correlations between bacterial populations and phosphorus levels in influents and effluents fig 5 a indeed there was a clear clustering of samples that were collected on days where the influent had low phosphorus p concentration 5 mg l blue samples with a clear separation from samples collected where influent had high phosphorus p concentration red spheres grouped separately similarly samples clustered together in correlation to whether removal of phosphorus p was high or low fig 5b taken together this data is the first to our knowledge to indicate a possible link between phosphorus levels in the wastewater influent and the bacterial community that develops in the treatment reactor this is not surprising as another study demonstrated a link between nitrogen levels in the influent and bacterial communities that developed in a granule based enhanced biological phosphorus removal system 36 3 4 regression analysis between genera of interest and sample metadata in order to determine if certain bacterial genera found in aeration tank samples correlated with influent and effluent water quality data regression analysis was performed specific bacterial genera were selected based on a litereature review summarized in table 1 the dependent variables we looked at included i removal efficiency of bod ii phosphourus p and iii ammonia n finally muliple regression analysis was performed for genera with significant correlations determined to be p 0 2 a priori for each of these dependent variables the regression analysis indicated that bdellovibrio was significantly correlated with bod removal performance p 0 05 while other genera such as streptococcus flavobacterium and members of the peptostreptococcaceae family were also correlated at a lower significance threshold p 0 2 table 2 all of these genera correlated negatively with bod removal efficiency table 3 the r squared value for bdellovibrio was 0 055 indicating that 5 5 of the variability in bod removal efficiency can be attributed to the abundance of this genus alone the other genera tested with p 0 2 had r squared values that ranged between 1 9 and 3 2 a multiple regression analysis was subsequently performed using the four genera determined to be statistically significantly correlated p 0 2 with bod removal efficiency this analysis indicated that the abundance of the four genera together can explain 10 of the variability observed in bod removal bdellovibrio are beneficial predatory bacteria that prey on other gram negative pathogens research proposed that they have an important role in pathogenic bacterial coliform bacteria and salmonella removal in a pretreatment process of domestic water that is used for irrigation purposes 37 streptococcus are a glucose fermenting genus and flavobacterium are heterotrophic bacteria which can remove bod from wastewater and degrade petroleum compounds such as naphthalene pyrene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 5 38 additionally peptostreptococcaceae include genera involved in fermentation and organic matter elimination during activated sludge processes based on a recent study they predominate during hydrolysis acidification 39 for phosphorus p removal the regression analysis demostrated that candidatus competibacter is the only species that statistically significantly correlated p 0 2 with phosphorus p removal efficiency table 4 interestingly candidatus competibacter was the first gao to be identified 40 finally members of the hydrogenophilaceae family were significantly correlated with ammonia n removal efficiency p 0 05 and 11 of the variability can be attrributed to the abundance of these genera alone additionally the abundance of nitrospira thauera and haliangium were also correlated with ammonia n removal efficiency at a lower signficance threshold p 0 2 table 5 a positive correlation was observed between ammonia n removal and hydrogenophilaceae and nitrospira while the other genera displated a negative correlation multiple regression analysis showed that these genera together contribute to 15 of the variability detected in ammonia n removal table 6 nitrospira are common dominant nitrite oxidizing bacteria in most wwtps which have an ability of performing a complete nitrification process 41 additionally nitrospira can outcompete other nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob due to their high affinity to nitrite and oxygen 42 conversely hydrogenophilaceae thauera and haliangium are denitrifiers these correlations have been observed in other studies as well 7 32 4 conclusions in this research study correlations between bacterial community structure and performance efficiency of a full scale wastewater treatment plant were investigated over ten months the results revealed that the most dominant bacterial phyla present in the aeration tank were proteobacteria 15 40 of total sequences in all samples and bacteroidetes 14 41 followed by planctomycetes 2 23 patescibacteria 2 13 chloroflexi 3 12 and nitrospirae 1 9 beta analysis revealed clear shifts in the bacterial communities with an overall cyclic pattern that correlated well with the month of the year the aeration tank samples were collected through which samples clustered in groups with samples taken in the same month clustering closer together lastly it was also found that the efficiency of bod and ammonia n removals were significantly correlated p 0 05 with the occurrence of bdellovibrio bacterial genus and members of hydrogenophilaceae respectively the results presented in this study are preliminary and are expected to attract other researchers in this field to explore such correlations at a wider scope
