10815,garlic is widely cultivated around the globe particularly in semi arid regions where limited water reservoirs are getting more valuable due to climate change and increasing demand in this context implementation of irrigation management techniques such as the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi are beginning to be explored ordi distributes the total available water based on the needs at each growing stage in the case of garlic establishment ky i crop development ky i bulbification ky ii and ripening ky iii to evaluate and improve deficit irrigation strategies leaf functional traits such as stomatal conductance gs net co2 assimilation rate an and the ratio of an and gs known as the intrinsic water use efficiency wuei can be reliable indicators of the functional response of the plant and its acclimation to deficit irrigation in this study five irrigation treatments were analyzed during 2016 and 2017 one without water limitation fullig and the other four with different irrigation water supplies corresponding to 100 90 80 and 70 of net irrigation needs of purple garlic for intermediate weather conditions of a typical meteorological year tmy in 2015 the same treatments except t100 were analyzed thus fullig and t100 were the same treatment up to the amount of water assigned to t100 was depleted in the case of t90 t80 and t70 the allocation of the amount of available irrigation water was optimized by using ordi garlic displayed acclimation to water deficits imposed by ordi ordi allowed the recovery of optimal physiological performance of garlic after water stressed and increased irrigation supply at the most drought sensitive stages however other environmental factors besides water deficit affected biomass increment and finally bulb yield throughout the studied years overall this study confirmed that ordi optimized irrigation water supply throughout the crop cycle minimizing yield losses in the most water limited treatments and supported the use of selected functional traits as early proxies of crop yield to assist and improve irrigation management of garlic in areas with restricted water availability keywords semiarid climate stomatal conductance net assimilation rate intrinsic water use efficiency irrigation management 1 introduction water supply for irrigation is becoming increasingly limiting for crop productivity in many parts of the world particularly the mediterranean region climate change driven acuter droughts and increased temperatures decreasing fresh water reserves increasing demand and costs of water and competition of economic sectors over its access and use tuberosa et al 2007 therefore there is a claim for a more efficient and sustainable use of agricultural water fischer et al 2007 ison et al 2007 vörösmarty et al 2000 in this context it is required to improve the efficiency of irrigation geerts and raes 2009 some management techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation rdi english 1990 can improve the use of water for agriculture rdi distributes irrigation water conditioned by the phenology and the growth requirements and it has been proved as an efficient methodology in several crops kirda 2002 the main limitation of rdi experiments was to determine the optimal level of deficit to be applied at each phenological stage in order to maximize yield in this sense the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi methodology maximizes the yield of annual crops when the objective is to reach a certain deficit for the whole growing period domínguez et al 2012 or when the amount of available irrigation water is lower than the requirements of the crop leite et al 2015 this methodology determines the optimal combination of deficit levels at phenological stages and was developed for the mopeco model ortega álvarez et al 2004 which was designed to maximize the profitability of irrigation farms through a more efficient use of irrigation water and cultivable area domínguez et al 2017 plant susceptibility to water stress depends on the duration and intensity of the water deficit mcdowell et al 2008 plants display different functional responses to water deficit and other environmental stresses that help the plants maintain vital functions for longer periods in adverse conditions levitt 1980 important physiological traits and functions such as stomatal conductance photosynthesis and different metabolic pathways are affected under water deficit chaves et al 2011 2009 understanding the physiological response related to carbon assimilation and water use under water deficit could be helpful to understand plant acclimation to this type of stress and assist deficit irrigation strategies aiming to optimize crop productivity and water use flexas et al 2004 leaf stomatal conductance gs is a key trait that determines the exchange of both co2 and water vapour with the atmosphere therefore it regulates the rates of transpiration water losses and carbon assimilation through photosynthesis and in turn crop growth and productivity fischer et al 1998 under moderate water deficits reduced gs coupled with relatively high assimilation rates can be observed chaves et al 2011 this effect enhance carbon fixation per unit of water loss chatterjee and solankey 2015 and can be evaluated as the ratio of net assimilation rate of co2 an and gs this ratio is known as the intrinsic water use efficiency wuei bunce 2016 evaluation of these leaf functional traits can be reliable methods to detect abiotic stress on plants and inform irrigation management cifre et al 2005 flexas et al 2004 complementarily traits such as total dry matter tdm and leaf area index lai are integrated descriptors of the plant functional response that are usually used to evaluate the plant response to water availability and other climatic factors ewert 2004 monteith 1977 patanè 2011 in any case dry matter production and final yield depend to a great extent on the phenological stage at which the water deficit is applied boonjung and fukai 1996 garcía tejero et al 2010 thus the study of the variation on the functional response across the different stages of the crop cycle is fundamental to identify the most sensitive stages of the crop to water deficit and manage irrigation methods accordingly to optimize the productivity and water use of the crop finally prolonged and or severe water deficits can produce chronic damage on the physiology of plants lichtenthaler 1996 in this sense the recovery of physiological performance after water deficit has also been highlighted as a key descriptor to evaluate the magnitude of the impact and the drought tolerance of the plant chaves et al 2009 nunes et al 2009 ramírez et al 2016 garlic is a traditional crop that has been used for thousands of years rivlin 2001 nowadays is the second most produced allium crop in the world food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2019 its economic importance rests on its cuisine and healthy properties leelarungrayub et al 2006 magaudda 2006 martins et al 2016 given the economic and social importance of garlic in the last 20 years an important effort has been devoted to improve the productivity of garlic under deficit irrigation fabeiro cortés et al 2003 hanson et al 2003 villalobos et al 2004 the specific methodology ordi was successfully calibrated for purple garlic under the semiarid conditions of castilla la mancha region spain domínguez et al 2013 available evidence has shown that impact of water deficit on garlic depends on its intensity and the growth stage in which it occurs sangsik et al 2007 stated that both the leaf development and the size of the bulb are affected by water deficit if the crop suffers water deficit during the formation of the bulb its size tends to decrease fabeiro cortés et al 2003 at very early stages water deficit causes dehydration of the bulbils yet overwatering either at early or late stages can lead to bulb clove rot de la cruz 2007 finally garlic development and physiology is also influenced by temperature and other climatic factors kim et al 2013 lopez bellido et al 2016 wu et al 2016a 2015 that vary across years the main objective of this study was to assess the influence of ordi methodology on key functional traits at different crop stages of the purple garlic of las pedroñeras such as stomatal conductance net assimilation rate wuei and other integrated descriptors of the plant functional performance such as tdm and lai and their influence on bulb yield the specific objectives were 1 evaluate the goodness of ordi to save water by increasing the water productivity and ensure physiological performance across the crop cycle especially at the most sensitive stages for bulb development 2 identify candidate traits that can be used as early and sensitive indicators of garlic water status to improve irrigation scheduling and 3 provide a mechanistic basis to understand how deficit irrigation at different crop stages impact on the final total dry mass and yield of the crop 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the climate of the experimental area is characterized as semi arid the average annual precipitation is approximately 400 mm year 1 registered mainly in spring and autumn and the reference evapotranspiration values can exceed 1 100 mm year 1 domínguez and de juan 2008 the soil of the experimental plots is classified as calcixerrollic petrocalcic xerochrepts usda ncrs 2006 it has clay loam texture in the upper 50 cm of the soil profile the effective depth of the root 40 cm is limited by the development of petrocalcic horizons which are partially fragmented camargo 2013 the soil of the plots had a very basic ph 8 5 and slightly saline characteristics electrical conductivity of saturated soil extract 0 81 ds m 1 the organic matter content is within the normal range 2 4 but it decreases with depth the dose of fertilizer was applied based on the expected yield for each treatment and following the basic extraction rates of garlic castellanos et al 2001 2 2 experimental design three seasons field experiment was conducted during the years 2015 2016 and 2017 in centro integral de formación profesional de aguas nuevas albacete spain situated in utm x 595368 y4311310 at 695 m a s l five irrigation treatments were distributed by ordi during 2016 and 2017 one without deficit fullig and the other four with different limited available irrigation water volumes corresponding to 100 t100 90 t90 80 t80 and 70 t70 of net irrigation needs of purple garlic for intermediate weather conditions of a typical meteorological year tmy established in 3400 m3 ha 1 t100 in 2015 the same treatments except t100 were analyzed thus fullig and t100 were the same treatment up to the amount of water assigned to t100 was depleted in the case of t90 t80 and t70 the allocation of the amount of available irrigation water was optimized by using ordi garlic bulbs were manually planted in january 14th 14th and 16th respectively with a space of 0 08 m between plants and 0 50 m between lines four experimental plots 2 5 18 0 m per deficit treatment were randomly distributed while in the case of the t100 and full ig treatments there were three plots due to both treatments received the same irrigation schedule until the available amount of water for t100 was exhausted therefore both treatments were the same and differences could occur at the end of the last development stage a drip irrigation system 0 5 0 5 m between pipes and emitters with self compensating emitters flow 3 8 l h 1 was used during the three seasons the quality of irrigation water in the area is suitable for irrigation ph 7 66 electrical conductivity 0 85 ds m 1 total

water potential swp during the experiments were installed watermark tensiometer sensors at 20 and 40 cm depth sensors were installed in the middle of the subplot and close to one of the two central planting lines between two consecutive plants soil water potential values for each year stage and treatment could be found in fig 1 during the field trials daily irrigation scheduling was performed by using the simplified water balance methodology in the root zone allen et al 1998 which is the one used by mopeco domínguez et al 2011 the climatic data table 1 were collected from the weather station albacete placed in the experimental farm which belongs to the national network of the agroclimatic information system for irrigation managed by the mapama http eportal magrama gob es websiar inicio aspx 2 3 optimized regulated deficit irrigation for limited volumes of irrigation water to determine the irrigation scheduling of each treatment at each development stage the ordi methodology for limited volumes of available irrigation water was used leite et al 2015 this methodology determines the deficit target in terms of the ratio between actual and maximum evapotranspiration eta etm at each growing stage in the case of garlic establishment ky i crop development ky i bulbification ky ii and ripening ky iii and estimates the amount of irrigation water to be applied at each stage during the real management of the crop the eta etm ratios proposed by the methodology must be updated in order to fit the real climatic conditions with the irrigation water available a more complete explanation of this methodology and its application in this experiment can be found in lellis 2017 irrigation supply and average eta etm values for each year stage and treatment could be found in table 2 2 4 physiological and growth parameters monitoring data of physiological traits were collected from two plots of each treatment in two representative plants of the central part of each plot measurements of net assimilation rates an and stomatal conductance gs were done under clear sky conditions on the third youngest and fully developed leaf which did not show deformities or diseases stomatal conductance was measured at natural incident photosynthetic flux density ppfd between 10 00 a m and 2 00 p m with a dynamic diffusion type porometer ap4 leaf porometer delta t devices ltd cambridge uk with a measuring interval between 5 and 1200 mmol m² s 1 depending on the climatic conditions gs was measured with a frequency of 7 14 days throughout the three seasons net assimilation rate an values were recorded by a portable photosynthesis system for gas exchange measurements li6400 tx model li cor bioscience ne usa the parameters of the leaf chamber for data collection were determined according to the characteristics of the test area 390 μmol mol 1 for co2 atmospheric concentration 25 0 5 c for air temperature 70 5 for air relative humidity a flow rate of 650 μmol s 1 of air and a ppfd of 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 measurements were made in the central part of the leaf and the whole area of the chamber 6 cm² was covered readings of an were made for each treatment at least once in every stage of 2016 and 2017 seasons concurrent with the an measurement gs values were recorded and the intrinsic water use efficiency wuei was calculated for each plant as the ratio of leaf assimilation rate an to leaf stomatal conductance gs in addition to physiological measurements samples of plant material were taken with a periodicity of 15 days to monitor total dry matter tdm and leaf area index lai evolution in two plots of each treatment four representative and consecutive plants located in the central part of the plot were collected biomass sampling was initiated from the establishment of the crop determined by the emergence of the third leaf the last sampling was carried out approximately 10 days before harvest which is considered as the final total dry matter a functional dynamic method was used to analyze the progression of the tdm and lai as a continuous process of growth adjusting the data obtained in the field to a mathematical model that represents the evolution of the growth parameters over time castrignano et al 1987 the evolution of tdm was adjusted to a sigmoidal type model by gompertz winsor 1932 while lai was adjusted to a peak gaussian model hao et al 2016 these models were chosen due to their goodness of fit r2 0 9 with the data obtained in the field where the independent variable is the duration of the period in days 2 5 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova with three factors irrigation treatment stage and year was carried out to evaluate the effect of these factors on an gs wuei tdm lai and final yield while stage and year were the factors analyzed on climatic variables afterwards a post hoc analysis fisher lsd was performed to identify homogeneous groups within each factor or combination of significant factors analyzed pearson s correlations were computed separately both for each year stages pooled and for each stage years pooled to explore the relationship between climatic variables and the studied functional traits the software statistica v 10 statsoft inc tulsa ok usa was used for data analysis 3 results 3 1 stomatal conductance to water vapor gs net assimilation rates an and intrinsic water use efficiency wuei throughout the crop stages stomatal conductance gs was very dynamic it differed significantly across the different combinations of treatments and stages tables 3 and 4 a similar pattern of variation across stages was found values of gs at ky i were lower than 200 mmol m 2 s 1 in all the years and a trend of higher gs values at ky ii was found after this stage at ky iii a general decline on gs occurred however the pattern differed across years since the interaction between year and stage was significant f 2 76 18 110 p 0 000 thus in 2016 lower gs values at ky i were found as compared to those in 2015 and 2017 in contrast at ky ii lower gs was found in 2017 while the longer and cooler stage ky iii in 2016 had particularly higher gs than those in 2015 and 2017 especially fullig which displayed the highest values of the whole season at this stage ky iii nevertheless treatments followed a similar pattern across years and stages fullig showed a trend of higher gs while the lowest values were found in t80 and t70 however these differences among treatments were less pronounced at stages ky i and ky iii table 3 however a tendency of highest gs values were found at ky ii especially in t80 and t70 compared to the other stages at ky iii fullig showed significant differences with the other treatments in every year while the rest of treatments were significantly different in 2016 at this stage net assimilation rate an and wuei showed variation among stages and years fig 2 the factors treatment stage and their interaction were significant for an in 2016 and 2017 the same occurred for wuei in 2017 yet only stage but not treatment was significant in 2016 table 4 a general increase of an in ky ii compared to those at ky i were found in 2016 and on t70 and t80 in 2017 afterwards a decrease of an at ky iii was found in both years for every treatment fig 2 at ky i the most marked differences among treatments were observed in both years in contrast at ky ii differences among treatments were reduced in both years with especially pronounced increment of an in t80 and t70 at ky iii all treatments had similar an values in both years with significant differences detected only between fullig and the rest of treatments in 2016 as occurred in gs fig 2 table 3 despite differences among treatments on wuei were only significant in 2017 a trend of increased values on the treatments with higher water deficit were found in both years especially at ky i higher wuei was found in 2017 than in 2016 at ky ii besides the lowest wuei values were found at ky ii in 2016 with non significant differences among treatments fig 2 while in 2017 at that stage significant differences for wuei were only found between fullig and t70 conversely at ky iii wuei tended to increase in 2016 yet to decrease in 2017 with respect to the previous stage significant differences in wuei among treatments were only found between t100 and t90 at this stage in both years fig 2 3 2 physiological variables in relation to soil water potential and climatic conditions the correlations found among physiological and environmental variables were stage and year dependent table 5 a and 5b at ky i strong correlations were found in the three physiological variables gs an and wuei with swp and eta etm while the other environmental factors were weakly correlated or not correlated at all at this stage conversely at ky ii when plants were submitted to higher water supply table 2 significant correlations of gs an and wuei with swp were not found however at this stage ky ii gs and wuei were correlated with other climatic factors such as vapour pressure deficit vpd and tmean non significant correlations were found between an with any environmental factor analysed at ky ii greater variation was found at ky iii and environmental factors affected differently to the physiological variables at this stage while gs and an were inversely correlated with swp no correlation was found between wuei and this factor in turn wuei was highly correlated with vpd as occurred to a lesser extent in gs at this warmer table 1 stage ky iii table 5 the impact of the climatic conditions on the physiology of garlic plants differed according to the year table 5b while gs was inversely correlated with swp the three years of the study the correlations of gs with vpd eta etm and tmean were year dependent in 2016 with the mildest climatic conditions table 1 vpd and tmean impacted positively on gs values in 2016 while in 2017 with higher temperatures table 1 these two climatic factors impacted negatively gs values in contrast the correlations found between an and the climatic factors in 2016 and 2017 followed a similar pattern and the only difference found between the two years in this variable was the inverse correlation with tmean in 2017 which was not significant in 2016 the same effect of tmean occurred for wuei which had high inter year variation in its response to the climatic factors between 2016 and 2017 in 2016 wuei was positively correlated with swp and vpd while in 2017 vpd affected negatively wuei table 5b 3 3 bulb yield leaf area index lai and total dry matter tdm progression across the growing stages evolution of lai and total dry matter showed significant differences across years treatments stages and their interactions p 0 000 in all cases in general lower biomass and lai were found in the treatments with the highest water deficit fig 3 however total dry biomass tdm did not differ among treatments before ky ii in 2015 and 2016 while in 2017 a significant effect of the treatment was not found until ky iii was reached table 6 treatment differences in lai were more pronounced and except for those at ky i in 2017 all the treatments were significantly different across years and stages since ky i table 6 in 2015 garlic growth was delayed at the beginning of the growth cycle as compared to the observed pattern in 2016 and 2017 yet once at ky i lai increased sharply in every treatment and reached the highest values at stages ky ii and ky iii as compared to those in the other years in 2016 the evolution of lai was slower but longer lai progressively increased this year until the end of ky ii furthermore treatment fullig maintained the increase of lai until the middle of ky iii in 2017 maximum lai reached similar values than those in 2016 however this maximum was achieved earlier and since the middle of ky ii lai showed a sharp decline in every treatment fig 3 significant inter year variation was observed in bulb yield f 1 32 1882 78 p 0 000 the effect of treatment f 3 32 103 70 p 0 000 and its interaction f 3 32 4 49 p 0 001 with the factor year were also significant besides the highest correlations between gs with tdm and bulb yield were found at ky ii followed by the mean of gs during the whole season fig 4 the highest yields were found in fullig treatments in 2015 and 2016 in 2017 the lowest bulb yields were found in all the treatments as compared to the rest of years for instance treatments t70 in 2015 and 2016 had higher yield than the highest yield treatments in 2017 fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 physiological response to ordi and climatic conditions the analysis of the physiological response to ordi is a novel approach to evaluate this irrigation methodology the results of this study show how functional traits in garlic such as gs an and wuei are regulated by water availability and climatic conditions nonetheless variation in this response can be modulated by other factors such as the phenological stages phenology is a dominant factor on the plant water carbon economy especially on seasonally dry climates such as mediterranean ecosystems vico et al 2015 in this study the garlic physiological response was stage dependent in both deficit and non deficit treatments from ky i onwards water demand rose progressively as a result of increased transpiration due to both higher et0 and higher leaf area index villalobos et al 2004 water deficit imposed by ordi at ky i decreased an and gs however this impact was higher in gs than in an resulting in high wuei at this stage especially in the most water stressed treatments high wuei reflect the capability of the plant to acclimate to early water deficits costa et al 2013 despite the higher wuei an decreased as well in response to water deficit nonetheless there is evidence that several crops have the capability to recover optimal physiological performance after being water stressed daryanto et al 2017 this recovery is conditioned by factors such as timing duration and intensity of water restriction before rehydration of the plant xu et al 2010 the stage ky ii of garlic occurs at late spring in the region of the study with mean temperatures around 20 c which are the optimum temperatures for garlic an kim et al 2013 moreover lai which is a trait related with phenology and water demand reached it maximum at ky ii this along with the favourable environmental conditions at ky ii supports the idea that irrigation should be maximized at this stage as ordi established high an values in all treatments and the small differences among fullig treatments with the rest observed at ky ii confirm that ordi optimized the limited water available with a minimum impact on an this is important to minimize bulb yield losses in garlic since most of the photosynthates are allocated to the bulb at this stage nackley et al 2016 rizzalli et al 2002 therefore deficit irrigation methodologies should consider how the water distribution affects the capability of recovery of functional performance of the crop after stress the stage of ripening ky iii is driven by elevated temperatures and leaf senescence brewster 2008 thus a decrease in gs and an is expected at this stage as found in this study at the ripening phase plant water needs are generally lower villalobos et al 2004 so little differences among treatments were expected in gs an an however we found significant differences among treatments in 2016 the reason for this finding was probably related with the milder temperatures that contributed to lengthen this last stage in contrast higher temperatures induced faster ripening in 2015 and especially in 2017 optimum temperatures for photosynthesis are lower than those for respiration larcher 2003 so at high temperatures increased respiration rates can reduce net assimilation rates despite minimum changes in photosynthesis this together with reduced leaf greenness could explain the lower an values at this stage besides increased vpd enhances gs rates till and inflection point from which vpd affects negatively gs kröber et al 2015 this pattern agrees with our findings we found a positive effect of vpd on gs in 2016 with mildest climatic conditions while in 2015 and 2017 when vpd was higher the correlation was the inverse stomatal conductance was also affected by temperature for example the lowest gs values were found at ky ii in 2017 matching the heat wave of this year despite gs increases with rising temperature once reached certain values higher temperatures begin to exert negative effects on plant functioning scorching premature senescence and metabolic alterations of the leaf bita and gerats 2013 can lead to reduced gs trueba et al 2019 at the same time heat oxidative damage often stimulates abscisic acid synthesis larkindale and knight 2002 which is in turn involved in the stomatal closure signalling vishwakarma et al 2017 however average temperature alone could not explain the observed differences in gs between 2015 and 2017 at ky ii since tmean at this stage were very similar between these years in 2017 the high number of windy days at ky ii could also have contributed itself to the observed low gs caldwell 1970 carvalho et al 2015 and accompanied by high temperatures contributed to magnify the impact of heat stress de boeck et al 2016 moreover along with the spring heat wave of 2017 several days with temperatures below 0 cat ky i could have had a negative impact on plant development these chilling temperatures on vegetative phases can also impair hydraulic conductivity and produce metabolic alterations which can result in reduced gs allen and ort 2001 4 2 lai evolution dry matter production and yield biomass production and lai evolution across the phenological stages were dependent on the watering scheduling established by ordi as expected the results provided evidence that increased water supply rendered greater biomass accumulation and yield in agreement with other studies in garlic carried out in the region fabeiro cortés et al 2003 sánchez virosta and sánchez gómez 2019 however ordi balanced irrigation differences among treatments in the most limiting periods reducing the variability of an among treatments nevertheless the accumulation of higher leaf area at previous stages in lower or non deficit treatments confers increased overall light interception and carbon fixation capability goudriaan and monteith 1990 maddonni and otegui 1996 which was finally translated into significant yield differences among treatments at the end of the crop cycle other climatic conditions especially temperature conditioned the duration of the stages and the total crop cycle length as reported in other assays in garlic wu et al 2016a 2016b mild temperatures like those of 2016 maintained the increase of lai for longer due to cool temperatures that slowed down the bulb ripening and senescence phases brewster 2008 temperature is a critical factor for garlic development and optimal growth temperatures explain to a great extent biomass accumulation and bulb yield domínguez et al 2013 kim et al 2013 lopez bellido et al 2016 tchórzewska et al 2017 wu et al 2016a temperatures above the optimal range can reduce plant growth as a consequence of biochemical damages on proteins enzymes and membranes and faster senescence fahad et al 2017 moreover the accumulation of proteins under high temperatures induce bulbification and are in turn involved in the stoppage of vegetative growth wu et al 2016a 2016b likewise reduced garlic growth could be the consequence of metabolic changes in acclimation to low temperatures wu et al 2016b both low temperatures at ky i and high temperatures at ky ii and ky iii in 2017 could explain the lower tdm and lai which are the final determinants of bulb yield bosch serra and currah 2002 villalobos et al 2004 anomalous temperatures in 2017 negatively impacted on plant growth regardless the irrigation scheduling established by ordi this finding is further supported by the fact that this year differences on tdm among treatments were not found till ky iii and differences on lai were not found till ky ii on the other hand the more favourable climatic conditions of 2015 enhanced the growth and biomass accumulation of garlic in terms of increased lai and final yield in particular the more frequent chilling temperatures registered at the early stages of the crop cycle in 2015 can stimulate garlic clove formation and bulb yield bandara et al 2011 at the same time warmer temperatures at the vegetative phase increased the number of days above the low umbral temperature domínguez et al 2013 and enhanced the vegetative growth moreover this was followed by optimal growth temperatures for garlic at stages ky ii and ky iii domínguez et al 2013 wu et al 2016a crop cycle length was shorter in 2015 than in 2016 however yield was similar or even higher in some treatments in 2015 this could be explained by the higher lai observed this year since bulbing in garlic and other allium crops is mediated by translocation of assimilates from leaves and pseudo stem to the bulbs brewster 1997 rabinowitch and currah 2002 rizzalli et al 2002 4 3 physiological parameters as a tool in optimized irrigation management in this study physiological monitoring has been proved as a reliable method to evaluate plant water status however the determination of an and wuei by infra red gas analysers is expensive and time consuming which can hardly be used as high throughput screening methods murchie et al 2018 moreover an require prolonged water deficit to show up while gs is a more dynamic trait and stomatal closure is a prompt response of the leaf to water deficit chaves et al 2002 besides stomatal conductance is often positively correlated with yield as found in this and other studies fischer et al 1998 roche 2015 thus gs has been proposed as an early and reliable indicator of plant water status and growth munns et al 2010 in this sense we suggest that the combination of ordi and the use of fast methods of indirect gs measurements such as thermography which can detect rapid changes in stomatal closure costa et al 2013 jones 1999 leinonen et al 2006 munns et al 2010 could be helpful and benefit seasonally optimized irrigation management cifre et al 2005 costa et al 2018 that take into account the different water needs across crop stages garcía tejero et al 2015 5 conclusions garlic downregulated its stomatal conductance in order to save water in response to both soil water deficit and air dryness restricted irrigation by ordi reduced gs rather than an while the increase in water availability on key stages increased an in every treatment to similar values therefore garlic could withstand well the moderate water deficit imposed by ordi and recover physiological performance denoting that previous water limitation did not produced chronic damage moreover ordi was able to distribute a fixed amount of irrigation water along the crop cycle to benefit physiological performance at bulbification which is the most sensitive crop stage for yield in garlic however it should be noted that water deficit and other environmental factors such as vpd or temperature also affected the plant biomass accumulation throughout the crop cycle which was finally reflected in bulb yield overall ordi is proposed as a tool to reduce yield losses under water deficit scenarios and selected physiological traits have been proved as reliable and high sensitive indicators of water deficit at the different growth stages of garlic this study supports the idea that characterization and monitoring of key physiological traits with fast and low cost effective methods along the crop cycle can assist regulated deficit irrigation methods and improve irrigation management of garlic in areas with restricted water availability

traits such as stomatal conductance gs net co2 assimilation rate an and the ratio of an and gs known as the intrinsic water use efficiency wuei can be reliable indicators of the functional response of the plant and its acclimation to deficit irrigation in this study five irrigation treatments were analyzed during 2016 and 2017 one without water limitation fullig and the other four with different irrigation water supplies corresponding to 100 90 80 and 70 of net irrigation needs of purple garlic for intermediate weather conditions of a typical meteorological year tmy in 2015 the same treatments except t100 were analyzed thus fullig and t100 were the same treatment up to the amount of water assigned to t100 was depleted in the case of t90 t80 and t70 the allocation of the amount of available irrigation water was optimized by using ordi garlic displayed acclimation to water deficits imposed by ordi ordi allowed the recovery of optimal physiological performance of garlic after water stressed and increased irrigation supply at the most drought sensitive stages however other environmental factors besides water deficit affected biomass increment and finally bulb yield throughout the studied years overall this study confirmed that ordi optimized irrigation water supply throughout the crop cycle minimizing yield losses in the most water limited treatments and supported the use of selected functional traits as early proxies of crop yield to assist and improve irrigation management of garlic in areas with restricted water availability keywords semiarid climate stomatal conductance net assimilation rate intrinsic water use efficiency irrigation management 1 introduction water supply for irrigation is becoming increasingly limiting for crop productivity in many parts of the world particularly the mediterranean region climate change driven acuter droughts and increased temperatures decreasing fresh water reserves increasing demand and costs of water and competition of economic sectors over its access and use tuberosa et al 2007 therefore there is a claim for a more efficient and sustainable use of agricultural water fischer et al 2007 ison et al 2007 vörösmarty et al 2000 in this context it is required to improve the efficiency of irrigation geerts and raes 2009 some management techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation rdi english 1990 can improve the use of water for agriculture rdi distributes irrigation water conditioned by the phenology and the growth requirements and it has been proved as an efficient methodology in several crops kirda 2002 the main limitation of rdi experiments was to determine the optimal level of deficit to be applied at each phenological stage in order to maximize yield in this sense the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi methodology maximizes the yield of annual crops when the objective is to reach a certain deficit for the whole growing period domínguez et al 2012 or when the amount of available irrigation water is lower than the requirements of the crop leite et al 2015 this methodology determines the optimal combination of deficit levels at phenological stages and was developed for the mopeco model ortega álvarez et al 2004 which was designed to maximize the profitability of irrigation farms through a more efficient use of irrigation water and cultivable area domínguez et al 2017 plant susceptibility to water stress depends on the duration and intensity of the water deficit mcdowell et al 2008 plants display different functional responses to water deficit and other environmental stresses that help the plants maintain vital functions for longer periods in adverse conditions levitt 1980 important physiological traits and functions such as stomatal conductance photosynthesis and different metabolic pathways are affected under water deficit chaves et al 2011 2009 understanding the physiological response related to carbon assimilation and water use under water deficit could be helpful to understand plant acclimation to this type of stress and assist deficit irrigation strategies aiming to optimize crop productivity and water use flexas et al 2004 leaf stomatal conductance gs is a key trait that determines the exchange of both co2 and water vapour with the atmosphere therefore it regulates the rates of transpiration water losses and carbon assimilation through photosynthesis and in turn crop growth and productivity fischer et al 1998 under moderate water deficits reduced gs coupled with relatively high assimilation rates can be observed chaves et al 2011 this effect enhance carbon fixation per unit of water loss chatterjee and solankey 2015 and can be evaluated as the ratio of net assimilation rate of co2 an and gs this ratio is known as the intrinsic water use efficiency wuei bunce 2016 evaluation of these leaf functional traits can be reliable methods to detect abiotic stress on plants and inform irrigation management cifre et al 2005 flexas et al 2004 complementarily traits such as total dry matter tdm and leaf area index lai are integrated descriptors of the plant functional response that are usually used to evaluate the plant response to water availability and other climatic factors ewert 2004 monteith 1977 patanè 2011 in any case dry matter production and final yield depend to a great extent on the phenological stage at which the water deficit is applied boonjung and fukai 1996 garcía tejero et al 2010 thus the study of the variation on the functional response across the different stages of the crop cycle is fundamental to identify the most sensitive stages of the crop to water deficit and manage irrigation methods accordingly to optimize the productivity and water use of the crop finally prolonged and or severe water deficits can produce chronic damage on the physiology of plants lichtenthaler 1996 in this sense the recovery of physiological performance after water deficit has also been highlighted as a key descriptor to evaluate the magnitude of the impact and the drought tolerance of the plant chaves et al 2009 nunes et al 2009 ramírez et al 2016 garlic is a traditional crop that has been used for thousands of years rivlin 2001 nowadays is the second most produced allium crop in the world food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2019 its economic importance rests on its cuisine and healthy properties leelarungrayub et al 2006 magaudda 2006 martins et al 2016 given the economic and social importance of garlic in the last 20 years an important effort has been devoted to improve the productivity of garlic under deficit irrigation fabeiro cortés et al 2003 hanson et al 2003 villalobos et al 2004 the specific methodology ordi was successfully calibrated for purple garlic under the semiarid conditions of castilla la mancha region spain domínguez et al 2013 available evidence has shown that impact of water deficit on garlic depends on its intensity and the growth stage in which it occurs sangsik et al 2007 stated that both the leaf development and the size of the bulb are affected by water deficit if the crop suffers water deficit during the formation of the bulb its size tends to decrease fabeiro cortés et al 2003 at very early stages water deficit causes dehydration of the bulbils yet overwatering either at early or late stages can lead to bulb clove rot de la cruz 2007 finally garlic development and physiology is also influenced by temperature and other climatic factors kim et al 2013 lopez bellido et al 2016 wu et al 2016a 2015 that vary across years the main objective of this study was to assess the influence of ordi methodology on key functional traits at different crop stages of the purple garlic of las pedroñeras such as stomatal conductance net assimilation rate wuei and other integrated descriptors of the plant functional performance such as tdm and lai and their influence on bulb yield the specific objectives were 1 evaluate the goodness of ordi to save water by increasing the water productivity and ensure physiological performance across the crop cycle especially at the most sensitive stages for bulb development 2 identify candidate traits that can be used as early and sensitive indicators of garlic water status to improve irrigation scheduling and 3 provide a mechanistic basis to understand how deficit irrigation at different crop stages impact on the final total dry mass and yield of the crop 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the climate of the experimental area is characterized as semi arid the average annual precipitation is approximately 400 mm year 1 registered mainly in spring and autumn and the reference evapotranspiration values can exceed 1 100 mm year 1 domínguez and de juan 2008 the soil of the experimental plots is classified as calcixerrollic petrocalcic xerochrepts usda ncrs 2006 it has clay loam texture in the upper 50 cm of the soil profile the effective depth of the root 40 cm is limited by the development of petrocalcic horizons which are partially fragmented camargo 2013 the soil of the plots had a very basic ph 8 5 and slightly saline characteristics electrical conductivity of saturated soil extract 0 81 ds m 1 the organic matter content is within the normal range 2 4 but it decreases with depth the dose of fertilizer was applied based on the expected yield for each treatment and following the basic extraction rates of garlic castellanos et al 2001 2 2 experimental design three seasons field experiment was conducted during the years 2015 2016 and 2017 in centro integral de formación profesional de aguas nuevas albacete spain situated in utm x 595368 y4311310 at 695 m a s l five irrigation treatments were distributed by ordi during 2016 and 2017 one without deficit fullig and the other four with different limited available irrigation water volumes corresponding to 100 t100 90 t90 80 t80 and 70 t70 of net irrigation needs of purple garlic for intermediate weather conditions of a typical meteorological year tmy established in 3400 m3 ha 1 t100 in 2015 the same treatments except t100 were analyzed thus fullig and t100 were the same treatment up to the amount of water assigned to t100 was depleted in the case of t90 t80 and t70 the allocation of the amount of available irrigation water was optimized by using ordi garlic bulbs were manually planted in january 14th 14th and 16th respectively with a space of 0 08 m between plants and 0 50 m between lines four experimental plots 2 5 18 0 m per deficit treatment were randomly distributed while in the case of the t100 and full ig treatments there were three plots due to both treatments received the same irrigation schedule until the available amount of water for t100 was exhausted therefore both treatments were the same and differences could occur at the end of the last development stage a drip irrigation system 0 5 0 5 m between pipes and emitters with

aspx 2 3 optimized regulated deficit irrigation for limited volumes of irrigation water to determine the irrigation scheduling of each treatment at each development stage the ordi methodology for limited volumes of available irrigation water was used leite et al 2015 this methodology determines the deficit target in terms of the ratio between actual and maximum evapotranspiration eta etm at each growing stage in the case of garlic establishment ky i crop development ky i bulbification ky ii and ripening ky iii and estimates the amount of irrigation water to be applied at each stage during the real management of the crop the eta etm ratios proposed by the methodology must be updated in order to fit the real climatic conditions with the irrigation water available a more complete explanation of this methodology and its application in this experiment can be found in lellis 2017 irrigation supply and average eta etm values for each year stage and treatment could be found in table 2 2 4 physiological and growth parameters monitoring data of physiological traits were collected from two plots of each treatment in two representative plants of the central part of each plot measurements of net assimilation rates an and stomatal conductance gs were done under clear sky conditions on the third youngest and fully developed leaf which did not show deformities or diseases stomatal conductance was measured at natural incident photosynthetic flux density ppfd between 10 00 a m and 2 00 p m with a dynamic diffusion type porometer ap4 leaf porometer delta t devices ltd cambridge uk with a measuring interval between 5 and 1200 mmol m² s 1 depending on the climatic conditions gs was measured with a frequency of 7 14 days throughout the three seasons net assimilation rate an values were recorded by a portable photosynthesis system for gas exchange measurements li6400 tx model li cor bioscience ne usa the parameters of the leaf chamber for data collection were determined according to the characteristics of the test area 390 μmol mol 1 for co2 atmospheric concentration 25 0 5 c for air temperature 70 5 for air relative humidity a flow rate of 650 μmol s 1 of air and a ppfd of 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 measurements were made in the central part of the leaf and the whole area of the chamber 6 cm² was covered readings of an were made for each treatment at least once in every stage of 2016 and 2017 seasons concurrent with the an measurement gs values were recorded and the intrinsic water use efficiency wuei was calculated for each plant as the ratio of leaf assimilation rate an to leaf stomatal conductance gs in addition to physiological measurements samples of plant material were taken with a periodicity of 15 days to monitor total dry matter tdm and leaf area index lai evolution in two plots of each treatment four representative and consecutive plants located in the central part of the plot were collected biomass sampling was initiated from the establishment of the crop determined by the emergence of the third leaf the last sampling was carried out approximately 10 days before harvest which is considered as the final total dry matter a functional dynamic method was used to analyze the progression of the tdm and lai as a continuous process of growth adjusting the data obtained in the field to a mathematical model that represents the evolution of the growth parameters over time castrignano et al 1987 the evolution of tdm was adjusted to a sigmoidal type model by gompertz winsor 1932 while lai was adjusted to a peak gaussian model hao et al 2016 these models were chosen due to their goodness of fit r2 0 9 with the data obtained in the field where the independent variable is the duration of the period in days 2 5 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova with three factors irrigation treatment stage and year was carried out to evaluate the effect of these factors on an gs wuei tdm lai and final yield while stage and year were the factors analyzed on climatic variables afterwards a post hoc analysis fisher lsd was performed to identify homogeneous groups within each factor or combination of significant factors analyzed pearson s correlations were computed separately both for each year stages pooled and for each stage years pooled to explore the relationship between climatic variables and the studied functional traits the software statistica v 10 statsoft inc tulsa ok usa was used for data analysis 3 results 3 1 stomatal conductance to water vapor gs net assimilation rates an and intrinsic water use efficiency wuei throughout the crop stages stomatal conductance gs was very dynamic it differed significantly across the different combinations of treatments and stages tables 3 and 4 a similar pattern of variation across stages was found values of gs at ky i were lower than 200 mmol m 2 s 1 in all the years and a trend of higher gs values at ky ii was found after this stage at ky iii a general decline on gs occurred however the pattern differed across years since the interaction between year and stage was significant f 2 76 18 110 p 0 000 thus in 2016 lower gs values at ky i were found as compared to those in 2015 and 2017 in contrast at ky ii lower gs was found in 2017 while the longer and cooler stage ky iii in 2016 had particularly higher gs than those in 2015 and 2017 especially fullig which displayed the highest values of the whole season at this stage ky iii nevertheless treatments followed a similar pattern across years and stages fullig showed a trend of higher gs while the lowest values were found in t80 and t70 however these differences among treatments were less pronounced at stages ky i and ky iii table 3 however a tendency of highest gs values were found at ky ii especially in t80 and t70 compared to the other stages at ky iii fullig showed significant differences with the other treatments in every year while the rest of treatments were significantly different in 2016 at this stage net assimilation rate an and wuei showed variation among stages and years fig 2 the factors treatment stage and their interaction were significant for an in 2016 and 2017 the same occurred for wuei in 2017 yet only stage but not treatment was significant in 2016 table 4 a general increase of an in ky ii compared to those at ky i were found in 2016 and on t70 and t80 in 2017 afterwards a decrease of an at ky iii was found in both years for every treatment fig 2 at ky i the most marked differences among treatments were observed in both years in contrast at ky ii differences among treatments were reduced in both years with especially pronounced increment of an in t80 and t70 at ky iii all treatments had similar an values in both years with significant differences detected only between fullig and the rest of treatments in 2016 as occurred in gs fig 2 table 3 despite differences among treatments on wuei were only significant in 2017 a trend of increased values on the treatments with higher water deficit were found in both years especially at ky i higher wuei was found in 2017 than in 2016 at ky ii besides the lowest wuei values were found at ky ii in 2016 with non significant differences among treatments fig 2 while in 2017 at that stage significant differences for wuei were only found between fullig and t70 conversely at ky iii wuei tended to increase in 2016 yet to decrease in 2017 with respect to the previous stage significant differences in wuei among treatments were only found between t100 and t90 at this stage in both years fig 2 3 2 physiological variables in relation to soil water potential and climatic conditions the correlations found among physiological and environmental variables were stage and year dependent table 5 a and 5b at ky i strong correlations were found in the three physiological variables gs an and wuei with swp and eta etm while the other environmental factors were weakly correlated or not correlated at all at this stage conversely at ky ii when plants were submitted to higher water supply table 2 significant correlations of gs an and wuei with swp were not found however at this stage ky ii gs and wuei were correlated with other climatic factors such as vapour pressure deficit vpd and tmean non significant correlations were found between an with any environmental factor analysed at ky ii greater variation was found at ky iii and environmental factors affected differently to the physiological variables at this stage while gs and an were inversely correlated with swp no correlation was found between wuei and this factor in turn wuei was highly correlated with vpd as occurred to a lesser extent in gs at this warmer table 1 stage ky iii table 5 the impact of the climatic conditions on the physiology of garlic plants differed according to the year table 5b while gs was inversely correlated with swp the three years of the study the correlations of gs with vpd eta etm and tmean were year dependent in 2016 with the mildest climatic conditions table 1 vpd and tmean impacted positively on gs values in 2016 while in 2017 with higher temperatures table 1 these two climatic factors impacted negatively gs values in contrast the correlations found between an and the climatic factors in 2016 and 2017 followed a similar pattern and the only difference found between the two years in this variable was the inverse correlation with tmean in 2017 which was not significant in 2016 the same effect of tmean occurred for wuei which had high inter year variation in its response to the climatic factors between 2016 and 2017 in 2016 wuei was positively correlated with swp and vpd while in 2017 vpd affected negatively wuei table 5b 3 3 bulb yield leaf area index lai and total dry matter tdm progression across the growing stages evolution of lai and total dry matter showed significant differences across years treatments stages and their interactions p 0 000 in all cases in general lower biomass and lai were found in the treatments with the highest water deficit fig 3 however total dry biomass tdm did not differ among treatments before ky ii in 2015 and 2016 while in 2017 a significant effect of the treatment was not found until ky iii was reached table 6 treatment differences in lai were more pronounced and except for those at ky i in 2017 all the treatments were significantly different across years and stages since ky i table 6 in 2015 garlic growth was delayed at the beginning of the growth cycle as compared to the observed pattern in 2016 and 2017 yet once at ky i lai increased sharply in every treatment and reached the highest values at stages ky ii and ky iii as compared to those in the other years in 2016 the evolution of lai was slower but longer lai progressively increased this year until the end of ky ii furthermore treatment fullig maintained the increase of lai until the middle of ky iii in 2017 maximum lai reached similar values than those in 2016 however this maximum was achieved earlier and since the middle of ky ii lai showed a sharp decline in every treatment fig 3 significant inter year variation was observed in bulb yield f 1 32 1882 78 p 0 000 the effect of treatment f 3 32 103 70 p 0 000 and its interaction f 3 32 4 49 p 0 001 with the factor year were also significant besides the highest correlations between gs with tdm and bulb yield were found at ky ii followed by the mean of gs during the whole season fig 4 the highest yields were found in fullig treatments in 2015 and 2016 in 2017 the lowest bulb yields were found in all the treatments as compared to the rest of years for instance treatments t70 in 2015 and 2016 had higher yield than the highest yield treatments in 2017 fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 physiological response to ordi and climatic conditions the analysis of the physiological response to ordi is a novel approach to evaluate this irrigation methodology the results of this study show how functional traits in garlic such as gs an and wuei are regulated by water availability and climatic conditions nonetheless variation in this response can be modulated by other factors such as the phenological stages phenology is a dominant factor on the plant water carbon economy especially on seasonally dry climates such as mediterranean ecosystems vico et al 2015 in this study the garlic physiological response was stage dependent in both deficit and non deficit treatments from ky i onwards water demand rose progressively as a result of increased transpiration due to both higher et0 and higher leaf area index villalobos et al 2004 water deficit imposed by ordi at ky i decreased an and gs however this impact was higher in gs than in an resulting in high wuei at this stage especially in the most water stressed treatments high wuei reflect the capability of the plant to acclimate to early water deficits costa et al 2013 despite the higher wuei an decreased as well in response to water deficit nonetheless there is evidence that several crops have the capability to recover optimal physiological performance after being water stressed daryanto et al 2017 this recovery is conditioned by factors such as timing duration and intensity of water restriction before rehydration of the plant xu et al 2010 the stage ky ii of garlic occurs at late spring in the region of the study with mean temperatures around 20 c which are the optimum temperatures for garlic an kim et al 2013 moreover lai which is a trait related with phenology and water demand reached it maximum at ky ii this along with the favourable environmental conditions at ky ii supports the idea that irrigation should be maximized at this stage as ordi established high an values in all treatments and the small differences among fullig treatments with the rest observed at ky ii confirm that ordi optimized the limited water available with a minimum impact on an this is important to minimize bulb yield losses in garlic since most of the photosynthates are allocated to the bulb at this stage nackley et al 2016 rizzalli et al 2002 therefore deficit irrigation methodologies should consider how the water distribution affects the capability of recovery of functional performance of the crop after stress the stage of ripening ky iii is driven by elevated temperatures and leaf senescence brewster 2008 thus a decrease in gs and an is expected at this stage as found in this study at the ripening phase plant water needs are generally lower villalobos et al 2004 so little differences among treatments were expected in gs an an however we found significant differences among treatments in 2016 the reason for this finding was probably related with the milder temperatures that contributed to lengthen this last stage in contrast higher temperatures induced faster ripening in 2015 and especially in 2017 optimum temperatures for photosynthesis are lower than those for respiration larcher 2003 so at high temperatures increased respiration rates can reduce net assimilation rates despite minimum changes in photosynthesis this together with reduced leaf greenness could explain the lower an values at this stage besides increased vpd enhances gs rates till and inflection point from which vpd affects negatively gs kröber et al 2015 this pattern agrees with our findings we found a positive effect of vpd on gs in 2016 with mildest climatic conditions while in 2015 and 2017 when vpd was higher the correlation was the inverse stomatal conductance was also affected by temperature for example the lowest gs values were found at ky ii in 2017 matching the heat wave of this year despite gs increases with rising temperature once reached certain values higher temperatures begin to exert negative effects on plant functioning scorching premature senescence and metabolic alterations of the leaf bita and gerats 2013 can lead to reduced gs trueba et al 2019 at the same time heat oxidative damage often stimulates abscisic acid synthesis larkindale and knight 2002 which is in turn involved in the stomatal closure signalling vishwakarma et al 2017 however average temperature alone could not explain the observed differences in gs between 2015 and 2017 at ky ii since tmean at this stage were very similar between these years in 2017 the high number of windy days at ky ii could also have contributed itself to the observed low gs caldwell 1970 carvalho et al 2015 and accompanied by high temperatures contributed to magnify the impact of heat stress de boeck et al 2016 moreover along with the spring heat wave of 2017 several days with temperatures below 0 cat ky i could have had a negative impact on plant development these chilling temperatures on vegetative phases can also impair hydraulic conductivity and produce metabolic alterations which can result in reduced gs allen and ort 2001 4 2 lai evolution dry matter production and yield biomass production and lai evolution across the phenological stages were dependent on the watering scheduling established by ordi as expected the results provided evidence that increased water supply rendered greater biomass accumulation and yield in agreement with other studies in garlic carried out in the region fabeiro cortés et al 2003 sánchez virosta and sánchez gómez 2019 however ordi balanced irrigation differences among treatments in the most limiting periods reducing the variability of an among treatments nevertheless the accumulation of higher leaf area at previous stages in lower or non deficit treatments confers increased overall light interception and carbon fixation capability goudriaan and monteith 1990 maddonni and otegui 1996 which was finally translated into significant yield differences among treatments at the end of the crop cycle other climatic conditions especially temperature conditioned the duration of the stages and the total crop cycle length as reported in other assays in garlic wu et al 2016a 2016b mild temperatures like those of 2016 maintained the increase of lai for longer due to cool temperatures that slowed down the bulb ripening and senescence phases brewster 2008 temperature is a critical factor for garlic development and optimal growth temperatures explain to a great extent biomass accumulation and bulb yield domínguez et al 2013 kim et al 2013 lopez bellido et al 2016 tchórzewska et al 2017 wu et al 2016a temperatures above the optimal range can reduce plant growth as a consequence of biochemical damages on proteins enzymes and membranes and faster senescence fahad et al 2017 moreover the accumulation of proteins under high temperatures induce bulbification and are in turn involved in the stoppage of vegetative growth wu et al 2016a 2016b likewise reduced garlic growth could be the consequence of metabolic changes in acclimation to low temperatures wu et al 2016b both low temperatures at ky i and high temperatures at ky ii and ky iii in 2017 could explain the lower tdm and lai which are the final determinants of bulb yield bosch serra and currah 2002 villalobos et al 2004 anomalous temperatures in 2017 negatively impacted on plant growth regardless the irrigation scheduling established by ordi this finding is further supported by the fact that this year differences on tdm among treatments were not found till ky iii and differences on lai were not found till ky ii on the other hand the more favourable climatic conditions of 2015 enhanced the growth and biomass accumulation of garlic in terms of increased lai and final yield in particular the more frequent chilling temperatures registered at the early stages of the crop cycle in 2015 can stimulate garlic clove formation and bulb yield bandara et al 2011 at the same time warmer temperatures at the vegetative phase increased the number of days above the low umbral temperature domínguez et al 2013 and enhanced the vegetative growth moreover this was followed by optimal growth temperatures for garlic at stages ky ii and ky iii domínguez et al 2013 wu et al 2016a crop cycle length was shorter in 2015 than in 2016 however yield was similar or even higher in some treatments in 2015 this could be explained by the higher lai observed this year since bulbing in garlic and other allium crops is mediated by translocation of assimilates from leaves and pseudo stem to the bulbs brewster 1997 rabinowitch and currah 2002 rizzalli et al 2002 4 3 physiological parameters as a tool in optimized irrigation management in this study physiological monitoring has been proved as a reliable method to evaluate plant water status however the determination of an and wuei by infra red gas analysers is expensive and time consuming which can hardly be used as high throughput screening methods murchie et al 2018 moreover an require prolonged water deficit to show up while gs is a more dynamic trait and stomatal closure is a prompt response of the leaf to water deficit chaves et al 2002 besides stomatal conductance is often positively correlated with yield as found in this and other studies fischer et al 1998 roche 2015 thus gs has been proposed as an early and reliable indicator of plant water status and growth munns et al 2010 in this sense we suggest that the combination of ordi and the use of fast methods of indirect gs measurements such as thermography which can detect rapid changes in stomatal closure costa et al 2013 jones 1999 leinonen et al 2006 munns et al 2010 could be helpful and benefit seasonally optimized irrigation management cifre et al 2005 costa et al 2018 that take into account the different water needs across crop stages garcía tejero et al 2015 5 conclusions garlic downregulated its stomatal conductance in order to save water in response to both soil water deficit and air dryness restricted irrigation by ordi reduced gs rather than an while the increase in water availability on key stages increased an in every treatment to similar values therefore garlic could withstand well the moderate water deficit imposed by ordi and recover physiological performance denoting that previous water limitation did not produced chronic damage moreover ordi was able to distribute a fixed amount of irrigation water along the crop cycle to benefit physiological performance at bulbification which is the most sensitive crop stage for yield in garlic however it should be noted that water deficit and other environmental factors such as vpd or temperature also affected the plant biomass accumulation throughout the crop cycle which was finally reflected in bulb yield overall ordi is proposed as a tool to reduce yield losses under water deficit scenarios and selected physiological traits have been proved as reliable and high sensitive indicators of water deficit at the different growth stages of garlic this study supports the idea that characterization and monitoring of key physiological traits with fast and low cost effective methods along the crop cycle can assist regulated deficit irrigation methods and improve irrigation management of garlic in areas with restricted water availability

crop performances are often constrained by water deficits and poor soil fertility in semiarid regions especially in the northwest loess plateau of china nolan et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 in this region when rainfall occurs it is either very low in intensity 5 mm and cannot be utilized by crops while a few annual extreme rainfall events are very intense and cannot be absorbed by the soil and thus are lost as runoff annual mean pan evaporation was 1445 mm and the average long term 1971 2015 annual precipitation was 385 mm wang et al 2015a in this region most crops are conventionally planted in flat plantings without ridges furrows and mulches and depend solely upon rainfall huang et al 2011 evapotranspiration et is high and the utilization of limited rainfall is low jung et al 2010 high et rates have caused soil desiccation in fields and most crops are particularly susceptible to soil desiccation nolan et al 2008 yang et al 2014 drought water loss and soil erosion are the main factors limiting agricultural production in dryland farming systems and therefore the importance of agronomic practices is to increase rainwater use efficiency and to ensure the sustainability of dryland farming systems especially in arid and semiarid regions such as southeast asia australia and southern africa wessels et al 2007 shi et al 2008 rotenberg and yakir 2010 wang et al 2010 huang et al 2016 to address these issues and the associated issue of low soil fertility a number of management practices have been attempted to improve water availability decrease water losses and increase crop production in semiarid regions chen et al 2013 guo et al 2014 ultimately improving food production these practices include terracing construction of dams and reservoirs and rainwater harvesting and mulching for increased water availability zhang et al 2013 ridge furrow rainwater harvesting rfrh is the most common water conservation measure in arable dryland farming systems in northwest china gu et al 2017 liu et al 2018a 2018b rfrh channels rainfall from ridges into furrows and enhances soil water content in furrow profiles resulting in significant increments in grain or fodder yields and water use efficiency wue liu et al 2018a 2018b wang et al 2018 in addition ridge mulching increases ridge soil temperature reduces unproductive evaporation and promotes rainfall infiltration mo et al 2016 li et al 2018 plastic film and straw mulches are the most common mulching materials used in rfrh li et al 2017 liang et al 2018 plastic film does not biodegrade readily in the field and large amounts of residual plastic film have detrimental effects on soil structure interfere with water and nutrient transport and reduce crop growth moreno and moreno 2008 liu et al 2014 straw mulch reduces evaporation and improves soil water content yu et al 2018 however the low soil temperature caused by the straw mulch during the seedling stage has negative impacts on germination and tiller development the beneficial effects of straw mulching are limited and have a short duration liu et al 2018a 2018b there is little research on the application of biodegradable mulching materials in rfrh especially applied to sorghum sorghum bicolor l production maize zea mays l and sorghum are considered the top cereal crops and forage crops pertinent for ensuring global food security kumar et al 2018 maize and sorghum silage are principally used for animal feed in many areas of china while maize and sorghum grains are used for human and animal consumption qu et al 2014 maize and sorghum appear similar in physiology developmental stages and morphological characteristics however sorghum is a suitable food and forage crop for poor soils and adverse climatic conditions whereas maize is a high yield crop for rich soils with favorable climate conditions inthapan and fukai 1988 mason et al 2008 therefore it is important to understand that both maize and sorghum productions are affected by tillage practices the rfrh system mulched with plastic film has been well evaluated and this system was strongly recommended for maize production in this area li et al 2001 wang et al 2009 zhou et al 2009 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 biodegradable film showed positive effects on increase production of maize zhang et al 2010 li et al 2013 sunflower li et al 2015 strawberry costa et al 2014 oats wang et al 2015a alfalfa wang et al 2015b however few studies have evaluated the suitability of biodegradable film for sorghum production in rfrh especially on focusing on comparing the effects of biodegradable film on soil temperature water storage yield and wue between maize and sorghum li et al 2013 previous research wang et al 2015a 2015b have found the optimum ridge furrow ratio for oats and alfalfa production in rfrh in this area therefore it is important to select appropriate furrow mulching materials for maize and sorghum production in rfrh systems this study investigated the effects of furrow mulching materials on soil temperature water storage yield and wue for maize and sorghum crops grown in semiarid regions of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 the experimental site field experiments were conducted at the dingxi arid meteorology and ecological environment experimental station of the institute of arid meteorology of china meteorological administration during three consecutive maize and sorghum growing seasons 2013 2014 and 2015 the experimental station latitude 35 35ʹn longitude 104 37ʹe and altitude 1896 7 m asl is located 2 3 km southeast of dingxi gansu province northwest china a description of the climate at the experiment site was presented in previous research wang et al 2015a soil chemical characteristics in the 0 40 cm layer were analyzed before the beginning of the experiment the total nitrogen total phosphorus total potassium organic matter ammonium nitrogen olsen phosphorus and available potassium were 0 90 1 65 23 59 11 76 54 3 14 8 and 245 mg kg 1 respectively the ph was 7 8 2 2 experimental design rfrh systems were prepared by shaping the soil surface into alternative ridges and furrows ridges 45 cm wide and 20 cm high were mulched with biodegradable film bf in all treatments while furrows 60 cm wide were mulched with three biodegradable materials with no mulching nm as a control the three furrow mulching materials were liquid film lf maize straw ms and bf there were 8 treatments 2 types of crops 3 furrow mulching materials control with 3 replications in a completely randomized design the ridges served as rainwater harvesting zones and the furrows served as planting zones individual plots 10 m long and 3 6 m wide had 4 ridges and 3 furrows each except for the controls a schematic diagram for the maize and sorghum production using this experimental setup is presented in fig 1 bf was manufactured by basf co ltd germany and lf was manufactured by beijing jinshanghe bio tech co ltd beijing china the biodegradable film is mainly made from starch blended with thermoplastic polyesters and its expected life span was 75 days the lf was mainly composed of fulvic acids and its expected life span was 45 days the lf was diluted 1 15 liquid product water for 5 10 min and sprayed using a hand pumped backpack sprayer on the furrow soil surface which received a total rate of 90 kg ha 1 of liquid product 1440 kg ha 1 of mixture the lf was sprayed twice after sowing and in late june ms was cut into 5 10 cm long segments and uniformly applied at a rate of 9000 kg ha 1 in the furrows li et al 2013 2 3 field management prior to 2013 the experimental field had been cultivated with potato without irrigation for 6 years after the potato harvesting in 2012 the land was ploughed once and harrowed before sowing ridges on the site were manually banked up with soil from 24 march to 9 april 2013 field management followed previous research wang et al 2015a 2015b one week before sowing ridges were banked up with soil and furrows were leveled ploughed and harrowed ridges were mulched with bf with the edges buried in 3 5 cm of soil along each ridge base a base fertilizer containing 140 kg n ha 1 41 kg p ha 1 and 39 kg k ha 1 was spread evenly over furrows and then ploughed into the soil at a depth of 25 30 cm annually according to local farming practice the sowing and fertility application rates were kept at the same levels based on planting areas within the rfrh and control fields no irrigation fertilizer or pesticides were applied during the sowing and vegetative periods during either the maize and sorghum growing seasons a local maize cultivar shendan 16 hybrid and a local sorghum cultivar tianliang 3 hybrid were used as indicator crops sowing was done on may 1 7 using a hand seedling dibbler two or three seeds were sown at a depth of 3 5 cm and their holes were then covered with fine soil furrows were mulched with one of the three mulching materials or left bare at the three leaf stage plants were thinned down to one per hole two rows of either maize or sorghum were planted at the side of the furrow with a 50 cm space between the two rows fig 1 the planting spaces for maize and sorghum were 32 and 15 cm respectively resulting in sowing densities of 5 25 104 plants ha 1 for maize and 1 05 105 plants ha 1 for sorghum the total planting areas were 18 m2 3 furrows 10 m length 0 6 m width with 6 rows of crops in each rfrh plot crops were harvested manually on october 1 10 during the study the ridge and furrow configuration was retained in the same location after the current crop was harvested and reused in the following years weeds were controlled manually as necessary during each crop s growth season lf ms and bf were buried in 20 30 cm of soil after harvesting 2 4 sampling and measurements 2 4 1 rainfall rainfall was measured at 5 min intervals using an automatic weather station ws std1 at the experimental station 2 4 2 soil moisture and soil temperature during the growing season of each crop soil moisture was determined gravimetrically at 20 day intervals beginning one day before sowing and ending at harvest soil moisture was measured to a depth of 140 cm with an increments of 20 cm at the middle of the furrow in each plot soil moisture content under the ridge was considered irrelevant as well as the regular measurements at 20 day intervals soil water content was measured approximately 24 h after each rainfall 5 mm the average soil bulk density was determined to be 1 33 g cm 3 sets of mercury in glass geothermometers with bent stems were placed in every plot at the furrow bottoms and at ridge tops at soil depths of 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm soil temperature was recorded at 5 day intervals between sowing and harvesting the mean daily soil temperature was calculated as the mean of the three daily recordings at 8 a m 2 pm and 6 pm approximately 2 4 3 silage yield grain yield and biomass yield at quarter milk stage grains with 30 40 moisture august 20 september 10 one furrow of crops in the middle of each treatment for three replicates was harvested manually the crops were chopped into particles with an average size of 3 5 cm approximately 1 kg of chopped crops were dried in an oven at 105 c for 1 h and then at 75 c for a minimum of 72 h to determine the dry matter of the silage yield sy at the maturity stage october 1 10 another 2 furrows of crops of each treatment for three replicates were hand harvested and grain yield gy and biomass yield by were determined based on 12 water content for the total land area used including the combined area of the ridges and furrows 2 4 4 water use efficiency and harvest index total actual et mm for crop growing seasons and the wue kg ha 1 mm 1 of crop gys were calculated using the following formula li and gong 2002 1 e t p r e p h 1 h 2 w 1 w 2 2 w u e n g y e t where p was the precipitation mm during the crop growing season re was the mean annual runoff efficiency for ridges mulched with bf wang et al 2015 h1 cm was ridge width h2 cm was furrow width w1 mm and w2 mm were the amount soil water storage at a 140 cm soil depth measured 1 day before sowing and 1 day after harvesting ngy was net grain yield based on only furrow areas percolation and recharge from groundwater was negligible in this region zhao et al 2012 w1 and w2 are based on the amount of soil moisture stored and were calculated as follows 3 w i 1 7 θ i b d i h 10 where θ was the soil water content h was the soil layer thickness 20 cm bd was the bulk density g cm 3 harvest index hi is defined as gy divided by by grain yield stover yield the main effects of treatments crops and mulching and year and the interaction effects between treatments and year were determined using univariate anova analysis of variance using the general linear models procedure all the data processing was conducted using the spss statistics program version 22 3 results 3 1 rainfall and air temperature mean monthly precipitations and air temperatures for the study period were compiled and compared with the mean records from the dingxi meteorological station for the period 1971 2015 fig 2 the annual precipitation was 492 8 457 2 and 298 2 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively while precipitation during the crop growing seasons from may 1 to october 7 was 447 2 353 0 and 245 6 mm respectively the 45 year mean annual precipitation was 385 3 mm while the 45 year average precipitation during the crop growing seasons was 334 0 mm compared with the 45 year mean annual record 2013 and 2014 were wet years while 2015 was a dry year the increase of annual precipitation was 107 5 mm in 2013 and was 71 9 mm in 2014 while the increase in precipitation during the crop growing seasons was 113 2 mm in 2013 and 19 0 mm in 2014 the decrease in annual precipitation was 87 1 mm in 2015 while the decrease in precipitation during the crop growing seasons was 88 4 mm compared with 45 year mean records the increase in air temperature was 1 6 2 8 5 5 2 2 1 2 1 4 0 2 1 9 0 7 2 3 0 4 and 0 1 c between january and december in 2013 respectively while it was 3 2 0 0 2 5 1 0 0 6 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 2 2 1 2 and 0 5 c between january and december in 2014 respectively and was 3 9 2 3 2 4 1 5 0 9 0 8 0 4 1 3 1 2 2 2 3 3 and 0 8 c between january and december in 2015 respectively the increases in annual air temperature were 1 6 1 2 and 1 7 c in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively 3 2 soil temperature soil is critical in maintaining plant life and offering mechanical support for plants soil temperature directly affects planting time germination growth development yield and disease control topsoil temperatures at furrow bottoms and at ridge tops increased as air temperatures increased from seeding to early summer but kept fluctuating during the summer soil temperatures decreased again with rainfall and a decrease in air temperature during early autumn fig 3 the differences of topsoil temperature between treatments were larger during the early growing seasons than that during the late growing seasons mean topsoil temperatures at ridge tops was clearly higher than that at the furrow bottoms for all treatments while the differences of soil temperature at the furrow bottoms between treatments was larger than that at ridge tops between treatments soil temperature at the furrow bottoms was the greatest using bf and was the lowest using ms the soil temperatures at the furrow bottoms for bf were clearly higher than those for lf and nm which were clearly higher than those for ms the differences in topsoil temperatures at the furrow bottoms were not clear between lf and nm during each crop s growing season compared with nm the increases in topsoil temperatures at the furrow bottoms of bf were 1 11 1 37 and 1 05 c for maize in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively while they were 1 07 1 19 and 1 25 c for sorghum respectively the increases in topsoil temperatures at the furrow bottoms of lf were 0 21 0 09 and 0 08 c for maize in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively while they were 0 23 0 13 and 0 15 c for sorghum respectively the decreases in topsoil temperatures at the furrow bottoms of ms were 1 22 1 45 and 1 81 c for maize production in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively while they were 1 34 1 53 and 1 59 c for sorghum respectively 3 3 soil water storage soil water storage is defined as the total amount of water that is stored in the soil within the plant s root zone soil water storage is determined by soil texture and crop rooting depth soil water storage increases due to rainfall and root development while it decreases due to et knowing soil water storage reduces the risk of applying too much water resulting in water lost to either deep percolation or runoff and avoids crop drought stress although the rainfall in 2013 and 2014 was higher than the 45 year mean record soil water storage kept fluctuating during crop growing seasons the rainfall in 2015 was lower than the 45 year mean record and the soil water storage decreased throughout the growing season especially in late september fig 4 in many cases the soil water storage in ms and bf was significantly higher than that in nm and lf while no significant differences were found between ms and bf or between nm and lf during the maize growing seasons mean soil water storages for nm lf ms and bf were 298 299 320 and 307 mm in 2013 respectively while they were 286 288 301 and 295 mm in 2014 respectively and were 260 264 286 and 268 mm in 2015 respectively compared to nm the increases in the soil water storage for lf ms and bf were 0 22 and 9 mm in 2013 respectively while they were 2 15 and 8 mm in 2014 respectively and were 4 26 and 8 mm in 2015 respectively during the sorghum growing seasons the mean soil water storages for nm lf ms and bf were 309 311 330 and 321 mm in 2013 respectively while they were 283 286 305 and 297 mm in 2014 respectively and were 272 275 295 and 280 mm in 2015 respectively compared to nm the increases in the soil water storage for lf ms and bf were 2 21 and 11 mm in 2013 respectively while they were 3 22 and 14 mm in 2014 respectively and were 3 23 and 8 mm in 2015 respectively 3 4 evapotranspiration et is the total water loss by evaporation from soil surface and by transpiration from plants to the atmosphere from a given area and this plays an important role in crop production in semiarid areas et trends in maize were similar to those in sorghum fig 5 the et increased with rainfall and increasing air temperature at the seeding 0 60 days after planting dap et was low due to low temperatures and small crop plants at the maturity stage 150 180 dap for maize or 150 160 dap for sorghum et was low due to low temperatures and low plant vigor during drought periods 30 60 dap and 90 120 dap in 2014 et was low due to low soil water content no significant differences of et were found between treatments after large rainfall events 10 mm during the maize growing seasons the total ets for nm lf ms and bf were 682 674 659 and 659 mm in 2013 respectively while they were 623 611 626 and 625 mm in 2014 respectively and were 465 461 449 and 458 mm in 2015 respectively during the sorghum growing seasons the total ets for nm lf ms and bf were 636 634 615 and 613 mm in 2013 respectively while they were 600 605 606 and 608 mm in 2014 respectively and were 451 442 431 and 448 mm in 2015 respectively there were no significant differences in the total et between treatments for maize and sorghum in rfrh although furrows mulching reduced soil evaporation ets for lf ms and bf were similar to those for nm maize and sorghum grew vigorously under the furrow mulching treatments especially for ms and bf during high rainfalls resulting in great water consumption by high crop transpiration 3 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis showed that the main effect of year for annual total sy annual total gy annual total by hi et and wue was significant p 0 05 table 1 the main effect of crops for sy gy by et and wue was significant while it was not significant for hi the main effect of mulching for sy gy by hi and wue was significant while it was not significant for et the interaction effect between crops and mulching was statistically significant for sy gy by and wue while it was not significant for hi and et the interaction effects between crops and years were statistically significant for sy gy by hi et and wue the interaction effects between mulching and year and between crop mulching and year were statistically significant for sy gy by hi and wue while they were not significant for et statistical results indicated that year and crop had higher f values than mulching differences in amounts of rainfall and its distribution between 2013 2014 and 2015 resulted that the years had significant effects for sy gy by hi et and wue differences in morphology physiology and phenology between maize and sorghum induced that the crops had significant effects for sy gy by et and wue furrow mulching reduced soil evaporation but did not reduce the transpiration from plants for the aforementioned reasons mulching had a lower f value than year and crop 3 6 silage yield grain yield and water use efficiency maize and sorghum are mainly used across china for silage as the primary forage in cow feeding programs there is renewed interest in sorghum silage because it requires less water and has a higher drought tolerance than maize however sorghum silage has been considered to be of lower quality forage compared with maize silage during maize production the sy for bf was significantly higher than that for ms which was significantly higher than that for nm and lf no significant differences were found between nm and lf table 2 the trends of gy by and wue changed with treatments and were similar to those of sy the hi for bf and ms was significantly higher than those for nm and lf no significant difference was found between bf and ms or between nm and lf compared with nm the mean maize sys in lf ms and bf increased by 2 3 9 3 and 17 0 respectively while the mean maize gys increased by 1 8 12 1 and 17 7 respectively and the mean maize bys increased by 0 9 8 0 and 13 7 respectively furrow mulching produced higher wue than control nm the mean wues in lf ms and bf significantly increased by 0 7 3 8 and 4 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively compared with nm the trends of sy gy by hi and wue of sorghum changed with treatments and the significant differences between treatments for sorghum were similar to those for maize and were ranked in the order of bf ms lf nm compared with nm the mean sorghum sys for lf ms and bf increased by 1 1 5 6 and 12 9 respectively while the mean sorghum gys increased by 1 4 14 3 and 17 0 and the mean sorghum bys increased by 1 9 6 7 and 11 7 respectively the mean wues of sorghum for lf ms and bf significantly increased by 0 3 2 8 and 2 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively compared with nm 4 discussion maize and sorghum are potential sources of energy for dairy and meat animals and are comparable in terms of energy content the grains of maize and sorghum serve as principal ingredients in the formulation of livestock rations whereas the silage of maize and sorghum is the predominant forage used in dairy producing diets to supply energy starch and forage neutral detergent fiber needs of high producing animals this is a key in influencing over 80 of silage production in china for livestock qu et al 2014 although research has shown sorghum grain to be comparable to maize grain in dairy cow diets the market often values sorghum less than maize inthapan and fukai 1988 in general sorghum has been grown in africa and asia in areas where precipitation and heat do not support the economical production of maize or other crops klocke et al 2014 the sy gy by hi and wue of maize and sorghum are likely to change due to the influence of climate genetics and agricultural practices sorghum is more deeply and densely rooted maintains physiological activity at higher levels than maize in low water conditions and has higher plasticity for hastening or delaying its phenological events under drought stress conditions inthapan and fukai 1988 kumar et al 2018 maize tends to have stronger stalks and relatively more leaves favoring greater yields than sorghum under rich conditions the sys gys bys and wues of maize were 1 75 1 87 1 82 and 1 76 times greater than those of sorghum respectively bf is a new compostable mulching material for enhancing crop production in semiarid regions wang et al 2015a li et al 2016 bf is usually buried into soil along with crop residues at the end of the crop cycle and is fully biodegraded within a various time depending on their chemical composition and additives under real field conditions furrow mulching worked as a buffer media between atmosphere and soil surface and consequently influenced soil temperature wang et al 2015b li et al 2018 differences in topsoil temperature between treatments were more evident at furrow bottoms than at ridge tops because ridges were mulched with the same material bf while furrows were mulched with different materials the differences of topsoil temperatures at furrow bottoms between treatments were more evident in the early growing seasons than in the late seasons because of high plant shading in the late crop seasons compared with nm the increase in topsoil temperatures at the furrow bottoms of bf was 1 05 1 37 c for maize while it was 1 07 1 25 c for sorghum the decrease in topsoil temperatures at the furrow bottoms of ms was 1 22 1 81 c for maize while it was 1 34 1 59 c for sorghum the soil temperatures for lf were slightly higher than those for nm during crop growing seasons and the difference of soil temperatures between lf and nm was not significant bf raised soil temperatures by trapping air between the soil and the mulch and reducing latent heat loss through evaporation ms protected the underlying soil from incoming solar radiation and kept the soil cool snyder et al 2015 explained that bf increased soil temperature by permitting the most of the solar spectrum to penetrate the film and by trapping long wavelength infrared radiation while ms reduced soil temperature due to its high reflectivity and low absorptivity and transmissivity subrahmaniyan and zhou 2008 demonstrated that the soil temperature for straw mulching was lower than that for nm during winter rape seed brassica napus l growing seasons water shortage is the major constraint for agricultural production in arid and semiarid areas zhang et al 2014 water retained in topsoil is easily lost by evaporation li et al 2018 bf and ms prevented water evaporation from furrow soil surfaces to the atmosphere and increased crop transpiration li et al 2013 consequently soil water storage at 0 140 cm depth increased for bf and mf mulching compared to nm the increases in mean soil water storage for ms and bf were 15 26 and 8 9 mm during maize growing seasons respectively while they were 21 23 and 8 14 mm during sorghum growing seasons soil water storage for lf was slightly higher than that for nm during crop growing seasons but the differences in soil water storage between lf and nm were not significant the differences in et between treatments were not significant ms had lower water vapor evaporation than bf resulting in ms having higher soil water storage than bf differences in environmental conditions and management practices may contribute to yield gaps liu et al 2012 crop type and furrow mulching had great impacts on sy gy by hi and wue analysis of variance showed that the main effect of mulching on et was not significant furrow mulching decreased furrow soil evaporation but increased crop transpiration thus it did not change the total water loss through et the sys gys bys his and wues of maize and sorghum varied under different furrow mulching materials because of the variations in soil temperatures and moisture regimes which modified soil water consumption rates li et al 2013 klocke et al 2014 the high soil temperatures and moisture status enhanced root proliferation and increased nutrient availability to the crop roots which improved crops yields sarkar 2005 sarkar and singh 2007 low temperatures in root zones severely impaired emergence and crop development and high soil water storage particularly during tasseling and milk stage however increased maize and sorghum sys gys and bys for ms bf and ms reduced soil evaporation and improved wue compared with nm the mean maize sys gys and bys for bf increased by 17 0 17 7 and 13 7 respectively while the mean sorghum sys gys and bys for bf increased by 12 9 17 0 and 11 7 respectively the mean wues of maize and sorghum for bf significantly increased by 4 8 and 2 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively compared with nm the mean maize sys gys and bys for ms increased by 9 3 12 1 and 8 0 respectively while the mean sorghum sys gys and bys for ms increased by 5 6 14 3 and 6 7 the mean wues of maize and sorghum for ms significantly increased by 3 8 and 2 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively previous studies have shown that furrow mulching decreased soil evaporation but increased crop transpiration shifted water consumption from invalid consumption soil evaporation to valid consumption crop transpiration thereby increased crop yield and wue li and gong 2002 wang and shangguan 2015 ms provided lower increases 12 1 for maize production and 14 3 for sorghum production in gys compared with bf 17 7 for maize production and 17 0 for sorghum production across the three years 5 conclusions the silage yields grain yields biomass yields and water use efficiencies of maize were greater than those of sorghum for the study period biodegradable film mulching increased topsoil temperature while maize straw mulching decreased it biodegradable film and maize straw mulching decreased soil evaporation and increased crop transpiration but did not shift the total water loss through et maize straw mulching had a greater effect on reducing soil evaporation than did biodegradable film mulching especially during drought biodegradable film and maize straw increased silage yields grain yields biomass yields harvest index and water use efficiencies of maize and sorghum while maize straw mulching provided a lower increasing effect compared with that for biodegradable film mulching liquid film kept similar soil temperatures and water moistures as did no mulching and did not significantly increase crop yields and water use efficiency acknowledgment this research was funded by the national natural science foundation of china 41661059 and 41461062 the

crop performances are often constrained by water deficits and poor soil fertility in semiarid regions especially in the northwest loess plateau of china nolan et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 in this region when rainfall occurs it is either very low in intensity 5 mm and cannot be utilized by crops while a few annual extreme rainfall events are very intense and cannot be absorbed by the soil and thus are lost as runoff annual mean pan evaporation was 1445 mm and the average long term 1971 2015 annual precipitation was 385 mm wang et al 2015a in this region most crops are conventionally planted in flat plantings without ridges furrows and mulches and depend solely upon rainfall huang et al 2011 evapotranspiration et is high and the utilization of limited rainfall is low jung et al 2010 high et rates have caused soil desiccation in fields and most crops are particularly susceptible to soil desiccation nolan et al 2008 yang et al 2014 drought water loss and soil erosion are the main factors limiting agricultural production in dryland farming systems and therefore the importance of agronomic practices is to increase rainwater use efficiency and to ensure the sustainability of dryland farming systems especially in arid and semiarid regions such as southeast asia australia and southern africa wessels et al 2007 shi et al 2008 rotenberg and yakir 2010 wang et al 2010 huang et al 2016 to address these issues and the associated issue of low soil fertility a number of management practices have been attempted to improve water availability decrease water losses and increase crop production in semiarid regions chen et al 2013 guo et al 2014 ultimately improving food production these practices include terracing construction of dams and reservoirs and rainwater harvesting and mulching for increased water availability zhang et al 2013 ridge furrow rainwater harvesting rfrh is the most common water conservation measure in arable dryland farming systems in northwest china gu et al 2017 liu et al 2018a 2018b rfrh channels rainfall from ridges into furrows and enhances soil water content in furrow profiles resulting in significant increments in grain or fodder yields and water use efficiency wue liu et al 2018a 2018b wang et al 2018 in addition ridge mulching increases ridge soil temperature reduces unproductive evaporation and promotes rainfall infiltration mo et al 2016 li et al 2018 plastic film and straw mulches are the most common mulching materials used in rfrh li et al 2017 liang et al 2018 plastic film does not biodegrade readily in the field and large amounts of residual plastic film have detrimental effects on soil structure interfere with water and nutrient transport and reduce crop growth moreno and moreno 2008 liu et al 2014 straw mulch reduces evaporation and improves soil water content yu et al 2018 however the low soil temperature caused by the straw mulch during the seedling stage has negative impacts on germination and tiller development the beneficial effects of straw mulching are limited and have a short duration liu et al 2018a 2018b there is little research on the application of biodegradable mulching materials in rfrh especially applied to sorghum sorghum bicolor l production maize zea mays l and sorghum are considered the top cereal crops and forage crops pertinent for ensuring global food security kumar et al 2018 maize and sorghum silage are principally used for animal feed in many areas of china while maize and sorghum grains are used for human and animal consumption qu et al 2014 maize and sorghum appear similar in physiology developmental stages and morphological characteristics however sorghum is a suitable food and forage crop for poor soils and adverse climatic conditions whereas maize is a high yield crop for rich soils with favorable climate conditions inthapan and fukai 1988 mason et al 2008 therefore it is important to understand that both maize and sorghum productions are affected by tillage practices the rfrh system mulched with plastic film has been well evaluated and this system was strongly recommended for maize production in this area li et al 2001 wang et al 2009 zhou et al 2009 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 biodegradable film showed positive effects on increase production of maize zhang et al 2010 li et al 2013 sunflower li et al 2015 strawberry costa et al 2014 oats wang et al 2015a alfalfa wang et al 2015b however few studies have evaluated the suitability of biodegradable film for sorghum production in rfrh especially on focusing on comparing the effects of biodegradable film on soil temperature water storage yield and wue between maize and sorghum li et al 2013 previous research wang et al 2015a 2015b have found the optimum ridge furrow ratio for oats and alfalfa production in rfrh in this area therefore it is important to select appropriate furrow mulching materials for maize and sorghum production in rfrh systems this study investigated the effects of furrow mulching materials on soil temperature water storage yield and wue for maize and sorghum crops grown in semiarid regions of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 the experimental site field experiments were conducted at the dingxi arid meteorology and ecological environment experimental station of the institute of arid meteorology of china meteorological administration during three consecutive maize and sorghum growing seasons 2013 2014 and 2015 the experimental station latitude 35 35ʹn longitude 104 37ʹe and altitude 1896 7 m asl is located 2 3 km southeast of dingxi gansu province northwest china a description of the climate at the experiment site was presented in previous research wang et al 2015a soil chemical characteristics in the 0 40 cm layer were analyzed before the beginning of the experiment the total nitrogen total phosphorus total potassium organic matter ammonium nitrogen olsen phosphorus and available potassium were 0 90 1 65 23 59 11 76 54 3 14 8 and 245 mg kg 1 respectively the ph was 7 8 2 2 experimental design rfrh systems were prepared by shaping the soil surface into alternative ridges and furrows ridges 45 cm wide and 20 cm high were mulched with biodegradable film bf in all treatments while furrows 60 cm wide were mulched with three biodegradable materials with no mulching nm as a control the three furrow mulching materials were liquid film lf maize straw ms and bf there were 8 treatments 2 types of crops 3 furrow mulching materials control with 3 replications in a completely randomized design the ridges served as rainwater harvesting zones and the furrows served as planting zones individual plots 10 m long and 3 6 m wide had 4 ridges and 3 furrows each except for the controls a schematic diagram for the maize and sorghum production using this experimental setup is presented in fig 1 bf was manufactured by basf co ltd germany and lf was manufactured by beijing jinshanghe bio tech co ltd beijing china the biodegradable film is mainly made from starch blended with thermoplastic polyesters and its expected life span was 75 days the lf was mainly composed of fulvic acids and its expected life span was 45 days the lf was diluted 1 15 liquid product water for 5 10 min and sprayed using a hand pumped backpack sprayer on the furrow soil surface which received a total rate of 90 kg ha 1 of liquid product 1440 kg ha 1 of mixture the lf was sprayed twice after sowing and in late june ms was cut into 5 10 cm long segments and uniformly applied at a rate of 9000 kg ha 1 in the furrows li et al 2013 2 3 field management prior to 2013 the experimental field had been cultivated with potato without irrigation for 6 years after the potato harvesting in 2012 the land was ploughed once and harrowed before sowing ridges on the site were manually banked up with soil from 24 march to 9 april 2013 field management followed previous research wang et al 2015a 2015b one week before sowing ridges were banked up with soil and furrows were leveled ploughed and harrowed ridges were mulched with bf with the edges buried in 3 5 cm of soil along each ridge base a base fertilizer containing 140 kg n ha 1 41 kg p ha 1 and 39 kg k ha 1 was spread evenly over furrows and then ploughed into the soil at a depth of 25 30 cm annually according to local farming practice the sowing and fertility application rates were kept at the same levels based on planting areas within the rfrh and control fields no irrigation fertilizer or pesticides were applied during the sowing and vegetative periods during either the maize and sorghum growing seasons a local maize cultivar shendan 16 hybrid and a local sorghum cultivar tianliang 3 hybrid were used as indicator crops sowing was done on may 1 7 using a hand seedling dibbler two or three seeds were sown at a depth of 3 5 cm and their holes were then covered with fine soil furrows were mulched with one of the three mulching materials or left bare at the three leaf stage plants were thinned down to one per hole two rows of either maize or sorghum were planted at the side of the furrow with a 50 cm space between the two rows fig 1 the planting spaces for maize and sorghum were 32 and 15 cm respectively resulting in sowing densities of 5 25 104 plants ha 1 for maize and 1 05 105 plants ha 1 for sorghum the total planting areas were 18 m2 3 furrows 10 m length 0 6 m width with 6 rows of crops in each rfrh plot crops were harvested manually on october 1 10 during the study the ridge and furrow configuration was retained in the same location after the current crop was harvested and reused in the following years weeds were controlled manually as necessary during each crop s growth season lf ms and bf were buried in 20 30 cm of soil after harvesting 2 4 sampling and measurements 2 4 1 rainfall rainfall was measured at 5 min intervals using an automatic weather station ws std1 at the experimental station 2 4 2 soil moisture and soil temperature during the growing season of each crop soil moisture was determined gravimetrically at 20 day intervals beginning one day before sowing and ending at harvest soil moisture was measured to a depth of 140 cm with an increments of 20 cm at the middle of the furrow in each plot soil moisture content under the ridge was considered irrelevant as well as the regular measurements at 20 day intervals soil water content was measured approximately 24 h after each rainfall 5 mm the average soil bulk density was determined to be 1 33 g cm 3 sets of mercury in glass geothermometers with bent stems were placed in every plot at the furrow bottoms and at ridge tops at soil depths of 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm soil temperature was recorded at 5 day intervals between sowing and harvesting the mean daily soil temperature was calculated as the mean of the three daily recordings at 8 a m 2 pm and 6 pm approximately 2 4 3 silage yield grain yield and biomass yield at quarter milk stage grains with 30 40 moisture august 20 september 10 one furrow of crops in the middle of each treatment for three replicates was harvested manually the crops were chopped into particles with an average size of 3 5 cm approximately 1 kg of chopped crops were dried in an oven at 105 c for 1 h and then at 75 c for a minimum of 72 h to determine the dry matter of the silage yield sy at the maturity stage october 1 10 another 2 furrows of crops of each treatment for three replicates were hand harvested and grain yield gy and biomass yield by were determined based on 12 water content for the total land area used including the combined area of the ridges and furrows 2 4 4 water use efficiency and harvest index total actual et mm for crop growing seasons and the wue kg ha 1 mm 1 of crop gys were calculated using the following formula li and gong 2002 1 e t p r e p h 1 h 2 w 1 w 2 2 w u e n g y e t where p was the precipitation mm during the crop growing season re was the mean annual runoff efficiency for ridges mulched with bf wang et al 2015 h1 cm was ridge width h2 cm was furrow width w1 mm and w2 mm were the amount soil water storage at a 140 cm soil depth measured 1 day before sowing and 1 day after harvesting ngy was net grain yield based on only furrow areas percolation and recharge from groundwater was negligible in this region zhao et al 2012 w1 and w2 are based on the amount of soil moisture stored and were calculated as follows 3 w i 1 7 θ i b d i h 10 where θ was the soil water content h was the soil layer thickness 20 cm bd was the bulk density g cm 3 harvest index hi is defined as gy divided by by grain yield stover yield the main effects of treatments crops and mulching and year and the interaction effects between treatments and year were determined using univariate anova analysis of variance using the general linear models procedure all the data processing was conducted using the spss statistics program version 22 3 results 3 1 rainfall and air temperature mean monthly precipitations and air temperatures for the study period were compiled and compared with the mean records from the dingxi meteorological station for the period 1971 2015 fig 2 the annual precipitation was 492 8 457 2 and 298 2 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively while precipitation during the crop growing seasons from may 1 to october 7 was 447 2 353 0 and 245 6 mm respectively the 45 year mean annual precipitation was 385 3 mm while the 45 year average precipitation during the crop growing seasons was 334 0 mm compared with the 45 year mean annual record 2013 and 2014 were wet years while 2015 was a dry year the increase of annual precipitation was 107 5 mm in 2013 and was 71 9 mm in 2014 while the increase in precipitation during the crop growing seasons was 113 2 mm in 2013 and 19 0 mm in 2014 the decrease in annual precipitation was 87 1 mm in 2015 while the decrease in precipitation during the crop growing seasons was 88 4 mm compared with 45 year mean records the increase in air temperature was 1 6 2 8 5 5 2 2 1 2 1 4 0 2 1 9 0 7 2 3 0 4 and 0 1 c between january and december in 2013 respectively while it was 3 2 0 0 2 5 1 0 0 6 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 2 2 1 2 and 0 5 c between january and december in 2014 respectively and was 3 9 2 3 2 4 1 5 0 9 0 8 0 4 1 3 1 2 2 2 3 3 and 0 8 c between january and december in 2015 respectively the increases in annual air temperature were 1 6 1 2 and 1 7 c in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively 3 2 soil temperature soil is critical in maintaining plant life and offering mechanical support for plants soil temperature directly affects planting time germination growth development yield and disease control topsoil temperatures at furrow bottoms and at ridge tops increased as air temperatures increased from seeding to early summer but kept fluctuating during the summer soil temperatures decreased again with rainfall and a decrease in air temperature during early autumn fig 3 the differences of topsoil temperature between treatments were larger during the early growing seasons than that during the late growing seasons mean topsoil temperatures at ridge tops was clearly higher than that at the furrow bottoms for all treatments while the differences of soil temperature at the furrow bottoms between treatments was larger than that at ridge tops between treatments soil temperature at the furrow bottoms was the greatest using bf and was the lowest using ms the soil temperatures at the furrow bottoms for bf were clearly higher than those for lf and nm which were clearly higher than those for ms the differences in topsoil temperatures at the furrow bottoms were not clear between lf and nm during each crop s growing season compared with nm the increases in topsoil temperatures at the furrow bottoms of bf were 1 11 1 37 and 1 05 c for maize in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively while they were 1 07 1 19 and 1 25 c for sorghum respectively the increases in topsoil temperatures at the furrow bottoms of lf were 0 21 0 09 and 0 08 c for maize in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively while they were 0 23 0 13 and 0 15 c for sorghum respectively the decreases in topsoil temperatures at the furrow bottoms of ms were 1 22 1 45 and 1 81 c for maize production in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively while they were 1 34 1 53 and 1 59 c for sorghum respectively 3 3 soil water storage soil water storage is defined as the total amount of water that is stored in the soil within the plant s root zone soil water storage is determined by soil texture and crop rooting depth soil water storage increases due to rainfall and root development while it decreases due to et knowing soil water storage reduces the risk of applying too much water resulting in water lost to either deep percolation or runoff and avoids crop drought stress although the rainfall in 2013 and 2014 was higher than the 45 year mean record soil water storage kept fluctuating during crop growing seasons the rainfall in 2015 was lower than the 45 year mean record and the soil water storage decreased throughout the growing season especially in late september fig 4 in many cases the soil water storage in ms and bf was significantly higher than that in nm and lf while no significant differences were found between ms and bf or between nm and lf during the maize growing seasons mean soil water storages for nm lf ms and bf were 298 299 320 and 307 mm in 2013 respectively while they were 286 288 301 and 295 mm in 2014 respectively and were 260 264 286 and 268 mm in 2015 respectively compared to nm the increases in the soil water storage for lf ms and bf were 0 22 and 9 mm in 2013 respectively while they were 2 15 and 8 mm in 2014 respectively and were 4 26 and 8 mm in 2015 respectively during the sorghum growing seasons the mean soil water storages for nm lf ms and bf were 309 311 330 and 321 mm in 2013 respectively while they were 283 286 305 and 297 mm in 2014 respectively and were 272 275 295 and 280 mm in 2015 respectively compared to nm the increases in the soil water storage for lf ms and bf were 2 21 and 11 mm in 2013 respectively while they were 3 22 and 14 mm in 2014 respectively and were 3 23 and 8 mm in 2015 respectively 3 4 evapotranspiration et is the total water loss by evaporation from soil surface and by transpiration from plants to the atmosphere from a given area and this plays an important role in crop production in semiarid areas et trends in maize were similar to those in sorghum fig 5 the et increased with rainfall and increasing air temperature at the seeding 0 60 days after planting dap et was low due to low temperatures and small crop plants at the maturity stage 150 180 dap for maize or 150 160 dap for sorghum et was low due to low temperatures and low plant vigor during drought periods 30 60 dap and 90 120 dap in 2014 et was low due to low soil water content no significant differences of et were found between treatments after large rainfall events 10 mm during the maize growing seasons the total ets for nm lf ms and bf were 682 674 659 and 659 mm in 2013 respectively while they were 623 611 626 and 625 mm in 2014 respectively and were 465 461 449 and 458 mm in 2015 respectively during the sorghum growing seasons the total ets for nm lf ms and bf were 636 634 615 and 613 mm in 2013 respectively while they were 600 605 606 and 608 mm in 2014 respectively and were 451 442 431 and 448 mm in 2015 respectively there were no significant differences in the total et between treatments for maize and sorghum in rfrh although furrows mulching reduced soil evaporation ets for lf ms and bf were similar to those for nm maize and sorghum grew vigorously under the furrow mulching treatments especially for ms and bf during high rainfalls resulting in great water consumption by high crop transpiration 3 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis showed that the main effect of year for annual total sy annual total gy annual total by hi et and wue was significant p 0 05 table 1 the main effect of crops for sy gy by et and wue was significant while it was not significant for hi the main effect of mulching for sy gy by hi and wue was significant while it was not significant for et the interaction effect between crops and mulching was statistically significant for sy gy by and wue while it was not significant for hi and et the interaction effects between crops and years were statistically significant for sy gy by hi et and wue the interaction effects between mulching and year and between crop mulching and year were statistically significant for sy gy by hi and wue while they were not significant for et statistical results indicated that year and crop had higher f values than mulching differences in amounts of rainfall and its distribution between 2013 2014 and 2015 resulted that the years had significant effects for sy gy by hi et and wue differences in morphology physiology and phenology between maize and sorghum induced that the crops had significant effects for sy gy by et and wue furrow mulching reduced soil evaporation but did not reduce the transpiration from plants for the aforementioned reasons mulching had a lower f value than year and crop 3 6 silage yield grain yield and water use efficiency maize and sorghum are mainly used across china for silage as the primary forage in cow feeding programs there is renewed interest in sorghum silage because it requires less water and has a higher drought tolerance than maize however sorghum silage has been considered to be of lower quality forage compared with maize silage during maize production the sy for bf was significantly higher than that for ms which was significantly higher than that for nm and lf no significant differences were found between nm and lf table 2 the trends of gy by and wue changed with treatments and were similar to those of sy the hi for bf and ms was significantly higher than those for nm and lf no significant difference was found between bf and ms or between nm and lf compared with nm the mean maize sys in lf ms and bf increased by 2 3 9 3 and 17 0 respectively while the mean maize gys increased by 1 8 12 1 and 17 7 respectively and the mean maize bys increased by 0 9 8 0 and 13 7 respectively furrow mulching produced higher wue than control nm the mean wues in lf ms and bf significantly increased by 0 7 3 8 and 4 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively compared with nm the trends of sy gy by hi and wue of sorghum changed with treatments and the significant differences between treatments for sorghum were similar to those for maize and were ranked in the order of bf ms lf nm compared with nm the mean sorghum sys for lf ms and bf increased by 1 1 5 6 and 12 9 respectively while the mean sorghum gys increased by 1 4 14 3 and 17 0 and the mean sorghum bys increased by 1 9 6 7 and 11 7 respectively the mean wues of sorghum for lf ms and bf significantly increased by 0 3 2 8 and 2 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively compared with nm 4 discussion maize and sorghum are potential sources of energy for dairy and meat animals and are comparable in terms of energy content the grains of maize and sorghum serve as principal ingredients in the formulation of livestock rations whereas the silage of maize and sorghum is the predominant forage used in dairy producing diets to supply energy starch and forage neutral detergent fiber needs of high producing animals this is a key in influencing over 80 of silage production in china for livestock qu et al 2014 although research has shown sorghum grain to be comparable to maize grain in dairy cow diets the market often values sorghum less than maize inthapan and fukai 1988 in general sorghum has been grown in africa and asia in areas where precipitation and heat do not support the economical production of maize or other crops klocke et al 2014 the sy gy by hi and wue of maize and sorghum are likely to change due to the influence of climate genetics and agricultural practices sorghum is more deeply and densely rooted maintains physiological activity at higher levels than maize in low water conditions and has higher plasticity for hastening or delaying its phenological events under drought stress conditions inthapan and fukai 1988 kumar et al 2018 maize tends to have stronger stalks and relatively more leaves favoring greater yields than sorghum under rich conditions the sys gys bys and wues of maize were 1 75 1 87 1 82 and 1 76 times greater than those of sorghum respectively bf is a new compostable mulching material for enhancing crop production in semiarid regions wang et al 2015a li et al 2016 bf is usually buried into soil along with crop residues at the end of the crop cycle and is fully biodegraded within a various time depending on their chemical composition and additives under real field conditions furrow mulching worked as a buffer media between atmosphere and soil surface and consequently influenced soil temperature wang et al 2015b li et al 2018 differences in topsoil temperature between treatments were more evident at furrow bottoms than at ridge tops because ridges were mulched with the same material bf while furrows were mulched with different materials the differences of topsoil temperatures at furrow bottoms between treatments were more evident in the early growing seasons than in the late seasons because of high plant shading in the late crop seasons compared with nm the increase in topsoil temperatures at the furrow bottoms of bf was 1 05 1 37 c for maize while it was 1 07 1 25 c for sorghum the decrease in topsoil temperatures at the furrow bottoms of ms was 1 22 1 81 c for maize while it was 1 34 1 59 c for sorghum the soil temperatures for lf were slightly higher than those for nm during crop growing seasons and the difference of soil temperatures between lf and nm was not significant bf raised soil temperatures by trapping air between the soil and the mulch and reducing latent heat loss through evaporation ms protected the underlying soil from incoming solar radiation and kept the soil cool snyder et al 2015 explained that bf increased soil temperature by permitting the most of the solar spectrum to penetrate the film and by trapping long wavelength infrared radiation while ms reduced soil temperature due to its high reflectivity and low absorptivity and transmissivity subrahmaniyan and zhou 2008 demonstrated that the soil temperature for straw mulching was lower than that for nm during winter rape seed brassica napus l growing seasons water shortage is the major constraint for agricultural production in arid and semiarid areas zhang et al 2014 water retained in topsoil is easily lost by evaporation li et al 2018 bf and ms prevented water evaporation from furrow soil surfaces to the atmosphere and increased crop transpiration li et al 2013 consequently soil water storage at 0 140 cm depth increased for bf and mf mulching compared to nm the increases in mean soil water storage for ms and bf were 15 26 and 8 9 mm during maize growing seasons respectively while they were 21 23 and 8 14 mm during sorghum growing seasons soil water storage for lf was slightly higher than that for nm during crop growing seasons but the differences in soil water storage between lf and nm were not significant the differences in et between treatments were not significant ms had lower water vapor evaporation than bf resulting in ms having higher soil water storage than bf differences in environmental conditions and management practices may contribute to yield gaps liu et al 2012 crop type and furrow mulching had great impacts on sy gy by hi and wue analysis of variance showed that the main effect of mulching on et was not significant furrow mulching decreased furrow soil evaporation but increased crop transpiration thus it did not change the total water loss through et the sys gys bys his and wues of maize and sorghum varied under different furrow mulching materials because of the variations in soil temperatures and moisture regimes which modified soil water consumption rates li et al 2013 klocke et al 2014 the high soil temperatures and moisture status enhanced root proliferation and increased nutrient availability to the crop roots which improved crops yields sarkar 2005 sarkar and singh 2007 low temperatures in root zones severely impaired emergence and crop development and high soil water storage particularly during tasseling and milk stage however increased maize and sorghum sys gys and bys for ms bf and ms reduced soil evaporation and improved wue compared with nm the mean maize sys gys and bys for bf increased by 17 0 17 7 and 13 7 respectively while the mean sorghum sys gys and bys for bf increased by 12 9 17 0 and 11 7 respectively the mean wues of maize and sorghum for bf significantly increased by 4 8 and 2 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively compared with nm the mean maize sys gys and bys for ms increased by 9 3 12 1 and 8 0 respectively while the mean sorghum sys gys and bys for ms increased by 5 6 14 3 and 6 7 the mean wues of maize and sorghum for ms significantly increased by 3 8 and 2 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively previous studies have shown that furrow mulching decreased soil evaporation but increased crop transpiration shifted water consumption from invalid consumption soil evaporation to valid consumption crop transpiration thereby increased crop yield and wue li and gong 2002 wang and shangguan 2015 ms provided lower increases 12 1 for maize production and 14 3 for sorghum production in gys compared with bf 17 7 for maize production and 17 0 for sorghum production across the three years 5 conclusions the silage yields grain yields biomass yields and water use efficiencies of maize were greater than those of sorghum for the study period biodegradable film mulching increased topsoil temperature while maize straw mulching decreased it biodegradable film and maize straw mulching decreased soil evaporation and increased crop transpiration but did not shift the total water loss through et maize straw mulching had a greater effect on reducing soil evaporation than did biodegradable film mulching especially during drought biodegradable film and maize straw increased silage yields grain yields biomass yields harvest index and water use efficiencies of maize and sorghum while maize straw mulching provided a lower increasing effect compared with that for biodegradable film mulching liquid film kept similar soil temperatures and water moistures as did no mulching and did not significantly increase crop yields and water use efficiency acknowledgment this research was funded by the national natural science foundation of china 41661059 and 41461062 the

crop coefficients evapotranspiration leaf water potential stomatal conductance washington navel orange water productivity 1 introduction improving the irrigation water management strategies in semi arid regions requires proper knowledge about crop water use and the agronomic responses under water stress conditions this requirement is even more determinant in citrus orchards in places such as southern iran where few in situ experiences exist jamshidi et al 2019 world citrus production has increased from 61 1 million tons mt in 1990 to 99 5 mt in 2017 faostat 2017 asia contributes to more than 40 of the total citrus production covering 1 8 million hectares mha of cultivated lands faostat 2017 in iran citrus orchards cover more than 0 24 mha of agricultural lands and over 4 3 mt of fruits are produced annually ahmadi et al 2015 the climatic condition of southern iran and similar semi arid regions facing rain scarcity as well as high summer temperatures necessitates the provision of irrigation for enhancing agriculture production the irrigation requirements have to be optimized in the context of limited water resources in the region therefore designing an optimal deficit irrigation strategy to maximize the water savings and minimize the yield losses can alleviate the current orchards vulnerability to water scarcity from a hydrological perspective in situ measurements of standard crop evapotranspiration etc and crop coefficient estimations kc the ratio of etc to reference evapotranspiration are the primary steps for improving the crop water productivity in water scarce scenarios de medeiros et al 2005 er raki et al 2008 several studies have assessed crop water requirement and obtained single and dual forms of crop coefficients kc kcb some examples focusing on the study domain of southern iran are dastranj and sepaskhah 2019 kamali and zand parsa 2017 mehrabi and sepaskhah 2018 mosaffa and sepaskhah 2019 however fruit trees and citrus in particular have received limited attention the fao recommended kc values for clean cultivated mature citrus trees providing 70 of the ground cover range from 0 65 to 0 75 table 1 however through a number of studies investigating citrus etc based on single kc castel and buj 1990 castel et al 1987 consoli et al 2006 maestre valero et al 2017 rogers et al 1983 and dual kc er raki et al 2008 peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 a variety of crop coefficient values have been recommended table 1 these discrepancies in the reported kc values is likely due to the variability and complexity of climatic factors niziński et al 2017 yang et al 2003 irrigation management zitouna chebbi et al 2015 plant physical and biological features consoli et al 2006 consoli and papa 2013 garcía tejero et al 2011 and soil evaporation rates maestre valero et al 2017 the inherent inconsistencies in kc resulting from its empirical determination also highlight the need for local calibrations especially under drought scenarios rana et al 2005 villalobos et al 2013 in addition to understanding crop water requirement the feasibility of applying deficit irrigation strategies requires monitoring of crop water status sepaskhah and ahmadi 2012 several researchers have identified the citrus leaf water potential ψleaf de lima et al 2015 rodríguez gamir et al 2010 and stomatal conductance gs taylor et al 2015 villalobos et al 2009 as sensitive proxies to reflect plant water stress as soil water potential is reduced leaf stomates dynamically adjust leaf gas exchange through partial closure klein 2014 although several physical and chemical signals trigger stomatal closure including leaf desiccation turgor loss environmental factors e g co2 concentration light intensity vapor pressure deficit vpd xylem foliar and root levels of the abscisic acid aba davies and zhang 1991 klein 2014 pérez pérez et al 2008 it is well established that leaf water potential ψleaf is a critical factor in regulating guard cell turgor zhang et al 2013 the interspecific feedback mechanism between ψleaf and g s is however crop specific and different among species this study sought to evaluate the applicability of saving water without affecting yield for washington navel orange trees under the semi arid climate conditions of the study region more broadly the study also aimed to identify and understand the plant feedbacks under the coupling impact of water stress and climatic condition the specific objectives include i to determine the standard evapotranspiration and crop coefficients kc of field grown washington navel orange trees in a drip irrigated citrus orchard ii to understand the trees responses to different levels of irrigation and monitor the feedback mechanism between ψleaf and g s and iii to define an appropriate deficit irrigation strategy in terms of yield and crop physiological responses 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the field trial was conducted for two consecutive years 2016 and 2017 in a drip irrigated citrus orchard located about 45 km from kazeroon city latitude 29 27 n longitude 51 39 e elevation 950 m a s l in fars province of southern iran the study area is characterized by semi arid mediterranean climate surrounded by hot semi desert climate de pauw et al 2004 soufi 2004 with a mean annual rainfall of 341 mm hot and dry summers with maximum air temperatures exceeding 45 c and mild winters with minimum temperatures around 2 c table 2 summarizes the climate conditions during the experimental period the soil texture was loam table 3 with an average field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp of 27 5 and 10 2 respectively the experiments were performed in the middle of a clean cultivated citrus orchard where navel oranges were planted at 5 5 m spacing the orchard was flat and drip irrigated with a high frequency interval during summer every other day lower frequency during autumn after every 4 days or weekly depending on the evaporative demand and no irrigation during the winter an average of ten on line emitters 4 l hr 1 supplied water in each treatment the citrus trees were mature 12 year old with an average height of 2 8 m and the area shaded by the canopy was 75 80 of the allotted spacing the growing season typically starts at the early february with flower bud induction and it follows by flowering from mid march to april fruit setting begins around may followed by the ripening and fruit development stage in june fruit harvesting is done during december 2 2 irrigation treatments and experimental design to identify the water use the washington navel orange trees were subjected to five irrigation levels from high to low extents the irrigation levels covered the water use range suggested by fao 56 and other studies under similar conditions allen et al 1998 consoli and papa 2013 rana et al 2005 sepaskhah and kashefipour 1995 accordingly five treatments with three replications and three plants per replication were prescribed in completely randomized blocks with different irrigation amounts based on the fraction of eto 100 90 75 60 and 45 named as i100 i90 i75 i60 i45 respectively eto was calculated from calibrated hargreaves samani equation for the region razzaghi and sepaskhah 2012 based on the mean long term meteorological data as well as for the study years 2016 and 2017 note that the long term eto values were used for calculating the amount of applied water in each treatment while the eto values for 2016 and 2017 were used for calculating kc values 1 e t 0 0 0026 t a v g 17 8 t m a x t m i n 0 5 r a where eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 tavg tmax and tmin are the mean maximum and minimum air temperatures oc respectively ra is the extraterrestrial radiation mm day 1 and 0 0026 is the empirical coefficient calibrated by razzaghi and sepaskhah 2012 flowering and post blooming to fruit set have been reported as the sensitive stages to water deficit in citrus garcía tejero et al 2012 ruiz et al 2001 typically these stages start in february and extend until the end of may over the region of study therefore all trees were irrigated at full water requirement from february through may to minimize the adverse impacts of low irrigation levels on flowering and fruitlet abscission the trees were exposed to the irrigation levels from june to december and the following january 2 3 data acquisition and plants measurements crop evapotranspiration etc was calculated following monthly water balance method this choice is based on a number of studies reported in the literature flumignan et al 2011 intrigliolo et al 2013 kang et al 2003 kusakabe et al 2016 miranda et al 2006 sepaskhah and andam 2001 the following equation is utilized 2 e t c i p d i 1 n θ 2 θ 1 δ z i where i is the irrigation depth mm p is the effective rainfall mm d is the deep percolation mm from the bottom of the root zone n is the number of soil layers δz is the thickness of each soil layer mm and θ2 and θ1 are the volumetric soil water contents swc at two consecutive measurements cm3 cm 3 to ensure accurate delivery of water required for each of the irrigation treatment analog water meters were installed and the irrigation volume was measured weekly during the growing seasons for soil moisture assessments neutron probe cpn 503 elite hydroprobetm was used and monthly volumetric swc was measured during the growing seasons at depths of 0 15 0 45 0 75 and 1 05 m the neutron probe was calibrated for the study site using the method suggested by zand parsa and mahmoodian 1989 the amount of water applied in each irrigation treatment was adjusted by considering the effective rainfall the rainfall data were obtained from a nearby weather station to estimate soil evaporation e fifteen microlysimeters one per replication were used during the study period boast and robertson 1982 the microlysimeters consisted of double slotted cylindrical tubes i e an inner hollow plastic tube of 10 20 cm radius height was placed inside an outer plastic tube of 12 25 cm the outer cover was a closed end cylinder filled with 5 cm of field soil and placed into the ground under the canopy area the inner cylinder held a meshed screen end which was filled with the field soil and inserted into the outer layer the mesh screen was an interface between the soil in the outer and inner tubes the mesh screen allowed the soil moisture to drain from the inner tube while keeping the soil weight constant by avoiding soil sliding and mixing between the two cylinders the soil layer at the bottom of the outer cylinder was selected from the under the canopy in situ conditions to maintain the moisture levels similar to the irrigation treatment and to simulate the actual suction gradient for draining the microlysimeters were leveled with the soil surface creating isolated volumes of bare soil and received the same amount of applied water as each irrigation treatment both cylinders of the micro lysimeters were weighted before each irrigation evaporation was calculated as 3 e δ w i n n e r a 1 δ w o u t e r a 1 where δ w i n n e r is the difference in the inner tube weight reflecting the swc loss due to evaporation and drainage δ w o u t e r is the difference in the outer tube weight reflecting the swc loss due to drainage from the inner layer and a1 a2 is the surface area of inner and outer cylinders respectively deep percolation is typically assumed to be negligible as previously suggested for drip irrigated crops parvizi et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 however in the measurements undertaken the crop water use was not known and therefore we considered deep percolation in the analysis the amount of swc in the root zone beyond the field capacity as well as the water content that increased between the measurement intervals at the fourth soil layer 1 m below the root zone was considered as deep percolation leaf water potential ψleaf was measured at solar midday using pressure chamber soil moisture equip corp model 5100a santa barbara ca usa following the procedures described in turner 1988 measurements were carried out in randomly selected mature leaves 4 8 leaves from each tree in each experimental unit covered with foil 1 2 hr before measurements between 12 00 pm 14 00 pm stomatal conductance gs was measured bi weekly at midday for fair weather days between 12 00 pm to 14 00 pm on relatively younger leaves using lci sd a photosynthesis system adc bio scientific ltd hoddes don england at the end of each season december fruits were harvested and crop load i e number of fruit per tree fruit size was quantified the overall yield of each tree was weighed using an on site commercial grading machine 2 4 analysis and calculations for calculating the single crop coefficient k c the ratio of etc measured using monthly water balance approach to eto was used 4 k c e t c e t 0 the etc is representative of non stressed growing conditions considering a high level of management referred to as standard level for crop evapotranspiration non optimal growing conditions reduce the et as compared to the standard level and a reduction factor defined as the stress reduction coefficient kstress was considered 5 e t c k c k s t r e s s e t 0 the non standard conditions could occur due to several factors primarily including soil water deficiency but also due to soil salinity and other environmental or physiological stresses allen et al 1998 described a water stress coefficient this stress term was referred to as ksoil in our study stemming from low soil water potential as a function of root zone depletion dr i e water shortage relative to field capacity θ f c water stress is assumed to occur when dr exceeds readily available water raw the stress function was defined as 6 k s o i l t a w d r t a w r a w where taw is the total available soil water in the root zone mm for dr raw ks t 1 it was assumed that the plant can utilize water from the root zone without water stress since the study includes irrigation at different levels e g applied water at 45 eto the k s o i l coefficient was calculated for each irrigation treatment to evaluate the imposed stress level in the dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 wright 1982 kc is split into two parts the basal crop coefficient kcb as a representative of the crop transpiration and the soil water evaporation coefficient ke as 7 k c d u a l k c b k e the measured soil evaporation using microlysimeters was subtracted from the measured etc to obtain the transpiration t values the values of kcb and ke were defined using the following 8 k c b t e t 0 k e e e t 0 note that the stress reduction coefficient kstress in dual crop approach for non ideal condition only affects kcb component this stress term was referred to as ks t i e k c d u a l k s t k c b k e the mean kc and kcb values from the fao 56 publication allen et al 1998 were reviewed for different crops under a sub humid climate condition with average minimum relative humidity rhmin of 45 and average wind speeds u2 of 2 m s 1 however variations in climate and plant conditions alter the aerodynamic resistance and the crop coefficients especially for tall canopies e g citrus tree when compared to the grass surface which is considered as the reference crop in the fao 56 therefore the mid season and end season kc and kcb values presented in tables 12 and 17 of fao 56 publication allen et al 1998 were considered as 9 k c m i d e n d s e a s o n k c f a o 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 10 k c b m i d e n d s e a s o n k c b f a o 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 where u2 and rhmin are the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 and the minimum relative humidity respectively h is the plant canopy height m for assessing and comparing the impact of the applied irrigation levels on the crop production the water productivity wpet kg m 3 was calculated as fernández et al 2019 11 w p e t m a r k e t a b l e y i e l d k g h a 1 t w u m 3 h a 1 where twu is the total amount of water m3 used for crop production per hectare twu has been given different definitions in various studies fernández et al 2019 in this study the amount of crop water use etc was considered in water productivity calculations and referred to as evapotranspiration water productivity wpet the data from different treatments were compared using tukey test 3 results and discussions 3 1 reference evapotranspiration the calculated reference evapotranspiration values for the 2016 and 2017 study period and the irrigation amount for each treatment as well as the rainfall are shown in fig 1 the variations in eto values between the two years were relatively small with january february having the lowest average daily eto rate of 2 37 mm and june july august with the highest average daily eto rate of 8 8 mm during the course of study there was no rain over the area in summer and the cumulative rainfall was 254 3 mm in 2016 25 1 mm occurring during june dec and 419 1 mm in 2017 98 1 mm occurring during june dec 3 2 soil water content and crop evapotranspiration the average soil water content over each season corresponding to the different irrigation levels is presented in fig 2 as expected the soil moisture levels recorded from the irrigation treatments corresponded to the severity of the imposed water restriction thus high soil moisture values were observed in i100 treatment with the average water content in the soil profile from 0 216 to 0 262 cm 3 cm 3 for i90 the soil moisture ranged from 0 251 cm3 cm 3 to 0 183 cm3 cm 3 during summer remained relatively constant during autumn and then increased to 0 245 cm3 cm 3 by the end of winter the reduction during summer in this treatment suggested the inadequate water supply during june august and the crop water requirement was partially compensated from the swc the mean seasonal soil moisture in i75 and i60 were 0 164 and 0 156 cm3 cm 3 and in i45 soil moisture depleted close to the pwp with 0 144 cm 3 cm 3 of volumetric water content once full irrigation was employed from february the soil moisture gradually increased the soil moisture recovery rate was higher in the i75 and i60 treatments compared to i45 in 2016 heavy rainfall occurred in february and saturated the soil profile and caused a fast recovery in soil moisture in 2017 the end season soil moisture during the winter in the i75 i60 and i45 treatments recovered to 0 180 0 187 0 198 cm 3 cm 3 respectively in all treatments upper soil layers 0 50 cm exhibited lower water content compared to the lower soils 50 100 cm this was mainly observed during summer months when high evaporative demand during hot windy days excessively reduced the soil moisture of the top layers the ksoil calculated based on the soil water depletion eq 6 indicated a non stressed condition in i100 and i90 treatments i e ksoil 1 while the average ksoil values for the i75 i60 and i45 treatments were 0 87 0 76 and 0 61 respectively indicating increasing levels of water stress the stress coefficient values were further calculated by alternate methods using the inversion of eqs 5 and 7 k s t t k c b e t o a n d k s e t e t a k c e t o and the measured etc kcb and kc data the resulting ks t and ks et values fig 3 were consistent with the ksoil values when the soil moisture content was higher than 0 18 cm 3 cm 3 i e two thirds of field capacity as the soil profile became drier the discrepancy between the three coefficients increased this discrepancy indicates that under non optimal conditions e g presence of water stress considering only soil moisture status i e using ksoil likely results in overestimating actual evapotranspiration the ksoil estimates do not explicitly account for stomatal conductance and evapotranspiration terms which likely contributes to the overestimation when the soil dried as feedback leaf turgor reduced and stomatal resistance increased and reduced transpiration niyogi et al 1998 1999 this feedback process caused the etc to decrease further and resulted in lowering ks t and ks et values such feedback was not integrated in ksoil estimation the simultaneous analysis of ks et and ks t data at similar soil moisture levels showed lower estimates by ks et and the differences are evident in the gap between their line graphs shown in fig 3 in general ks et reflects the overall actual stress occurring at each treatment considering the coupled feedback between soil moisture and atmospheric condition on evapotranspiration while ks t primarily reflects the overall plant stress based on transpiration reduction and does not utilize the evaporation component therefore by subtracting evaporation from the overall imposed water stress reflected in ks et higher values ensued for ks t we considered the difference between ksoil and ks t as the controlling effect of stomatal resistance in reducing the water stress accordingly stomatal closure contributed 4 1 9 4 and 16 9 in curtailing water loss in the i75 i60 and i45 treatments table 4 summarizes the average measured values of crop evapotranspiration and its components to quantify the standard evapotranspiration rates in the resulting values obtained from the imposed irrigation levels we evaluated the variations of etc and soil moisture content between the treatments the calculated ksoil from eq 6 added further criterion in recognizing the standard versus water stressed et rates the treatments with ksoil 1 were regarded as water stressed trees for which et rates occur lower than the optimal level allen et al 1998 2005 for a standard irrigation treatment the ksoil value is required to be an equal or near unity allen et al 2005 therefore the i75 i60 and i45 treatments with average ks oil of 0 87 0 76 and 0 61 during the controlled irrigation period were considered as deficit irrigation strategies when the irrigation amount was increased by 10 from i90 to i100 treatments the change in etc rate between the two treatments increased only by 2 5 on average and the difference was not statistically significant the higher irrigation level in i100 caused the swc to increase 0 24 cm3 cm 3 compared to the i90 treatment 0 20 cm3 cm 3 suggesting that extra water applied in the i100 treatment was not needed consumed by the crop and was instead stored in the soil profile as a result irrigating at 90 of eto rate was considered as the irrigation treatment for which etc occurred at the standard rate accordingly the i100 was classified as an over irrigation treatment while i75 i60 and i45 treatments were considered as mild moderate and severe deficit irrigation treatments respectively the standard etc for washington navel ranged from 52 7 1 0 mm during dec to feb to 285 1 4 3 mm in june and july the total measured etc was 1843 2 mm in the first year and 1874 6 mm in the following year for the i90 treatment considered as the full irrigation treatment the kc values ranged from 0 67 in january and gradually increased toward the end of winter table 4 during flowering and fruit set stages in march and april the kc value reached 0 8 and then peaked at 0 96 during the fruit development stage in the summer the kc value dropped during the harvest time and end season from november to december to 0 75 comparable to these results in the study by rogers et al 1983 and sepaskhah and kashefipour 1995 in a semi arid climate the kc values reached to 1 1 in summer and around 0 70 to 0 75 in winter elevated kc values during the peak season have also been reported by other studies maestre valero et al 2017 snyder and o connell 2007 depending on the climate and vpd the peak value varied for different months snyder and o connell 2007 and maestre valero et al 2017 find peak values of 1 and 1 2 respectively during december for a mediterranean climate while consoli and papa 2013 reported the maximum kc values of 0 95 during november for a semi arid mediterranean climate evaporation followed a similar pattern and consisted of 7 of total etc in winter doubling to almost 15 in summer as the irrigation amount frequency i e a persistent wet area under canopy and vpd increased table 4 the evaporation rate correlated with the amount of applied water the basal crop coefficient also showed a significant reduction in water stressed trees table 4 the decrease in kcb with increasing eto in june august demonstrated the close coupling of the canopy to the atmospheric condition the measured values of kc kcb and ke resulting from the i90 treatment as the standard values were compared with those reported in the fao 56 publication allen et al 1998 for canopy cover of 70 note that the relative humidity and wind speed of the study region table 2 were not consistent with those of fao 56 rhmin of 45 and u2 of 2 m s 1 and therefore the fao kc and kcb values were modified based on eqs 9 10 for the climate of the study region the measured values in our study were higher than those suggested by fao 56 using the standard approaches of fao 56 the yearly etc was calculated as 1596 mm 13 lower than our measured etc with kc values ranging from 0 72 to 0 89 such underestimation in etc and kc based on fao 56 is not surprising and was also reported in other studies for different climates and crops rana et al 2005 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 snyder and o connell 2007 in addition to climatic factor the crop physiology including its vigor e g trunk diameter leaf and shading area density of planting types of citrus e g lime orange variety e g valencia navel soil type and agricultural practices e g fertilization tillage ground coverage all affect the evapotranspiration reported in different studies our study was performed in a well managed orchard with proper cultivation practices and the experimented trees were vigorous with high crown density the experimental conditions and environmental factors can be considered as an incremental factor contributing to the high rate of etc over the study area 3 3 plant water status measurements plants respond to water stress through physiological response such as stomatal closure and regulating leaf water potential davies and zhang 1991 liu et al 2006 therefore we reviewed the physiological indicators to identify the responses of washington navel orange trees to the imposed levels of water deficiency seasonal variation of stomatal conductance gs and leaf water potential ψleaf for the irrigation treatments during 2016 and 2017 are shown in fig 4 for all the irrigation treatments during the early growing season the stomatal conductance was relatively similar at around 0 11 mol m 2 s 1 water availability was not a limiting factor during this stage and the plants transpired at their potential during the water restriction period while in i100 treatment the gs values remained relatively constant between 0 10 and 0 12 mol m 2 s 1 in the i45 treatment the stomatal conductance was markedly low at 0 021 mol m 2 s 1 during summer for ideal non stressed condition allen and pereira 2009 reported a range of 0 10 to 0 13 mol m 2 s 1 for citrus which is consistent with our findings nevertheless for a well watered condition a considerable variation in gs has been reported highlighting the need for local observations regarding citrus stomatal response to water stress condition for instance dzikiti et al 2007 reported the stomatal conductance of 2 year old orange trees in a range of 0 005 to 0 175 molm 2 s 1 on a typical clear day and pérez pérez et al 2008 reported a range of 0 03 to 0 14 mol m 2 s 1 for fully watered lane late citrus trees during the phenological stages for non optimal conditions our measured gs values of severely stressed trees 0 011 molm 2 s 1 for i45 in summer were lower than the values 0 05 mol m 2 s 1 as the lowest reported for a similar 50 water reduction in a six year old orange orchard consoli et al 2017 consistent with our results other studies have also reported stomatal conductance as low as 0 020 mol m 2 s 1 mossad et al 2018 0 018 mol m 2 s 1 gomes et al 2004 during the peak stress corresponding measurements of the leaf water potential showed that leaf water potential remained relatively steady for non stressed trees i100 and i90 at 0 71 0 20 mpa and mildly stressed trees i75 at 0 94 0 18 mpa higher leaf dehydration was observed in the severely stressed trees as in i60 and i45 treatments the average ψleaf during the water restriction period were 1 35 and 1 86 mpa although some extreme negative values up 3 21 mpa were recorded from the mature leaves in i45 treatments the overall result is consistent with the reported values for 7 years old navel lane late 1 17 to 1 54 mpa ballester et al 2013 12 years old orange trees up to 2 mpa garcía tejero et al 2010 and mature navelina orange trees up to 2 5 mpa gasque et al 2016 note that the extreme negative recorded value could be due to leaf age as noted by syvertsen 1982 the leaf water potential reached 3 50 mpa when the leaves were 3 6 months old the plant functioning mechanism was further investigated by considering the interactions between gs and ψleaf with respect to the climatic conditions and soil moisture status fig 5 shows the variations in gs and ψleaf relative to vpd for each of the irrigation level cf ballester et al 2013 consoli et al 2017 parvizi et al 2016 in our measurements with increasing vpd particularly from april to august vpd 3 k pa the stomatal conductance followed a declining trend across all the treatments the reduced gs was notable as the water stress level intensified between the irrigation treatments and is shown in fig 5 after august vpd followed a decreasing trend and the trees in i100 i90 and i75 treatments started showing decreasing stomatal resistance however the gs for the i60 and i45 treatments remained high until post harvest the reference best fit lines of gs in fig 5 delineate how the stomatal response to vpd as the water stress level changes between the treatments these best fit lines can be potentially used as a reference for future studies to assess the physiological stress under different irrigation and atmospheric vpd conditions especially when detailed measurements are not possible the leaf water potential in non stress to mildly stressed trees i e i100 190 i75 was mildly impacted by the changes in vpd also seen in fig 4 the average gs values in i100 i90 and i75 during summer were 0 105 0 095 and 0 079 mol m 2 s 1 while the leaf water potential in these treatments remained relatively similar i90 i100 i75 jones 1998 noted that stomatal closure could result in higher ψleaf in mild water stressed trees as compared to well watered trees the impact of vpd on ψleaf was more pronounced in lower irrigation levels i e i60 and i45 nevertheless the resulting low correlation as well as the moderate correlations between gs and vpd signified that in addition to the atmospheric conditions i e vpd other factors such as soil moisture deficit could have a notable feedback on plant water status since the soil moisture was not a limiting factor in i100 during high vpd period the plant continued its high rate of transpiration which caused a slight decrease in the leaf water potential evident in fig 4a and the reference line of ψleaf for i100 in fig 5a as the irrigation level reduced from i100 to i45 in conjunction with the summer heat stress and high vpd the mild to severe soil desiccation experienced by the plant roots likely trigger stomatal closure and higher resistance the covariance between the soil moisture relative soil moisture deficit rsmd and gs ψleaf is plotted in fig 6 a b the rsmd values near zero indicate that swc is approaching the pwp while values close to 1 are indicative of soil moisture levels near the fc the analysis showed that when the soil moisture was not a limiting factor low rsmd the reduction in both gs and ψleaf was insignificant for rsmd higher than 0 35 0 45 the reduction in gs and ψleaf became more evident soil moisture availability also alters atmospheric humidity which has an impact on the transpiration rates to assess this feedback fig 6c shows the variations of gs relative to vpd gs vpd for a range of swc under higher soil moisture conditions the moderate slope in the gs variation indicated a dominant effect of vpd on stomatal closure on the other hand the abrupt slope change with soil moisture depletion indicated that in the lower range of swc plant water status was controlled by root water uptake and soil moisture availability the simultaneous evolution of gs and ψleaf showed isohydric behavior of washington navel orange trees particularly in i100 i90 and i75 treatments in general isohydric plants maintain constant midday leaf water potential in the absence of water by limiting transpiration with increasing stomatal resistance consistent with our finding several studies have reported increasing stomatal resistance in citrus during drought condition to regulate leaf water potential tardieu and simonneau 1998 as the severity of water restriction intensified in the i60 and i45 treatments evidently the stomatal adjustment could not sustain the balance between root water uptake and transpiration rate leading to a decrease in the leaf turgor thus the trees in i60 and i45 relative to other treatments showed higher stomatal resistance for a more extended period to avoid a further loss in ψleaf note that the reduction in stomatal conductance was more pronounced than ψleaf reduction and the trees exhibited isohydric behavior the concurrent reduction of gs and ψleaf of citrus with the intensification of water restriction can also be inferred from other studies ballester et al 2013 garcía tejero et al 2011 gasque et al 2016 however a few studies investigated the resulting correlation in our study the relationship between gs and ψleaf formed a semi sigmoid shape as plotted in fig 6c it was noted that for a threshold 0 067 0 077 mol m 2 s 1 fig 6d of stomatal closure the reduction in ψleaf was not statistically significant p 0 05 with decreasing gs values beyond the threshold and soil moisture depleting beyond raw the ψleaf reduced linearly with the gs reduction resulting in the following equation 12 ψ l e a f 1 05 4 13 1 e g s 33 81 0 5 the ψleaf gs correlation investigated by pérez pérez et al 2012 for lemon and mossad et al 2018 for valencia orange was described using a linear fit showing a corresponding reduction in both variables as the stress level increased the data used in these studies were obtained from the trees subjected to regulated di and partial root zone drying methods more consistent with our findings a study by gomes et al 2004 for pera orange trees obtained relatively constant values of ψleaf for a range of decreasing stomatal conductance according to their results leaf water potential started to drop when gs decreased beyond 0 05 mol m 2 s 3 4 yield and evapotranspiration water productivity the number of fruits and recorded yield were not statistically different between the growing seasons 2016 and 2017 however significant differences were found for among the treatments table 5 the yield boosted with increasing irrigation rate fig 7 however with the higher degree of applied water the differences were not statistically significant on average irrigating at 100 and 90 of eto yielded 95 6 and 93 3 kg tree 1 with relatively large fruit size 286 and 279 g respectively with no significant difference between the two treatments in the i75 treatment 17 of water saving relative to the i90 treatment was achieved along with the final yield of 87 1 kg tree 1 and fruit size of 275 g overall the crop load reduction in i75 was statistically significant compared to i100 and not different from i90 but the improvement in wpet was statistically higher than both of i100 and i90 the i60 treatment yielded 33 water saving and resulted in significant yield and fruit size reduction 78 3 kg tree 1 and 251 g compared to i100 and i90 treatments yet the decrease was not significant compared to the i75 treatment in the last set of experiment the 50 water saving in the i45 treatment caused considerable fruit dropping during the growing season and yielded small fruits 237 g overall the imposed irrigation rates caused 7 16 and 29 of yield reduction in i75 i60 and i45 respectively as expected the wpet was inversely correlated with irrigation level fig 7 and the highest wpet was achieved in i45 treatment irrigating the trees with 100 and 45 eto yielded 2 05 and 2 31 kg m 3 of wpet respectively the intersection point between the relative yield and wpet fig 7c can be regarded as the optimized irrigation amount that reflects the best equilibrium between water savings and yields the irrigation amount associated with the intersection point was calculated as 1391 mm which was approximately similar to the amount of water applied in the i75 treatment 1368 mm however a recommendation regarding an optimal strategy for the growers to achieve water savings without significantly compromising the final yield also depends on the available irrigation water for the region based on this rationale and recognizing the current water deficiency in the study region as the main driver of this study we suggest irrigating at lower rates 60 and 45 of et0 additionally the yielded wpet in i60 2 27 kg m 3 was not statistically different from that of i45 however since the amount of yield was significantly higher than i45 irrigating at the i60 level results in a higher marketable option accordingly the overall results and considerations suggest that irrigating at 60 of eto or 70 of etc for citrus orange can minimize the amount of water use while still maintaining the benefit of a good yield 4 conclusions effective water management strategies for sustainable agriculture in the semi arid climate of regions with limited water resources such as southern iran requires enhanced knowledge of plant water use particularly for the dominant agro systems study results suggest that the standard default fao 56 crop coefficients are low compared to the measurements for the study region as kc ranged from 0 71 in winter to 0 96 in summer with seasonal etc of 1814 mm the high irrigation rate and frequency persistent wetted area hot winds and temperature advection during summer as well as the high foliage density of the trees caused the soil evaporation and plant transpiration occurring at a high rate analysis of stomatal conductance and leaf water potential in non water stress and low water stress conditions showed that the atmospheric condition vpd heat stress wind affected the stomatal closer opening although our findings cannot fully delineate the coupling between the various environmental and physiological factors a feedback mechanism can be inferred whereby stomatal closure in response to a slight leaf turgor depression results in a consequent increase or preservation of leaf water potential in severely stressed trees particularly during summer the leaf water potential ψleaf was low and the stomatal resistance remained high for an extended period to avoid the further decrease in ψleaf best fit reference lines were developed gs and ψleaf under different water stress conditions which can be used to obtain plant physiological responses for the stressed and non stressed citrus trees and could be of potential value in irrigation scheduling reviewing the resulting yield and wpet and considering the current water deficiency in the region irrigating at 60 of eto 0 7 etc was identified as the optimized strategy to be adopted by the local growers irrigating at this level resulted in 16 of yield loss and increased wpet up to 33 this recommended strategy could vary depending on the water availability for the region in the future these findings would be transmitted to the help the knowledge base for local growers to plan accordingly for adequate irrigation and help agencies and decision makers to devise a sustainable agricultural

10817,improved understanding of crop water use is vital for aiding water saving and sustainable production practices particularly for water restricted regions where limited observations exist this study investigated the standard evapotranspiration and crop coefficients single and dual for drip irrigated mature orange trees citrus sinensis l cv washington navel for the semi arid climate of southern iran forty five washington navel trees in a clean cultivated orchard were subjected to five irrigation levels 100 90 75 60 and 45 of reference evapotranspiration for two consecutive seasons 2016 2017 crop physiological responses including stomatal conductance gs and leaf water potential ψleaf were measured and the agronomic effects in terms of plant yield i e fruit number and weight and evapotranspiration water productivity wpet were evaluated the average standard evapotranspiration rate was measured as 5 11 mm day 1 with the seasonal amount of 1814 mm partitioned as 84 9 86 5 of transpiration and 13 5 15 1 evaporation and the crop coefficient ranged from 0 67 in january to 0 96 in june during periods of high evaporative demand the non stressed and moderately stressed trees 100 90 75 treatments reduced their gs 0 107 0 075 mol m 2 s 1 to maintain a relatively constant ψleaf whereas in severely stressed trees 60 and 45 treatments ψleaf significantly reduced when gs

crop coefficients evapotranspiration leaf water potential stomatal conductance washington navel orange water productivity 1 introduction improving the irrigation water management strategies in semi arid regions requires proper knowledge about crop water use and the agronomic responses under water stress conditions this requirement is even more determinant in citrus orchards in places such as southern iran where few in situ experiences exist jamshidi et al 2019 world citrus production has increased from 61 1 million tons mt in 1990 to 99 5 mt in 2017 faostat 2017 asia contributes to more than 40 of the total citrus production covering 1 8 million hectares mha of cultivated lands faostat 2017 in iran citrus orchards cover more than 0 24 mha of agricultural lands and over 4 3 mt of fruits are produced annually ahmadi et al 2015 the climatic condition of southern iran and similar semi arid regions facing rain scarcity as well as high summer temperatures necessitates the provision of irrigation for enhancing agriculture production the irrigation requirements have to be optimized in the context of limited water resources in the region therefore designing an optimal deficit irrigation strategy to maximize the water savings and minimize the yield losses can alleviate the current orchards vulnerability to water scarcity from a hydrological perspective in situ measurements of standard crop evapotranspiration etc and crop coefficient estimations kc the ratio of etc to reference evapotranspiration are the primary steps for improving the crop water productivity in water scarce scenarios de medeiros et al 2005 er raki et al 2008 several studies have assessed crop water requirement and obtained single and dual forms of crop coefficients kc kcb some examples focusing on the study domain of southern iran are dastranj and sepaskhah 2019 kamali and zand parsa 2017 mehrabi and sepaskhah 2018 mosaffa and sepaskhah 2019 however fruit trees and citrus in particular have received limited attention the fao recommended kc values for clean cultivated mature citrus trees providing 70 of the ground cover range from 0 65 to 0 75 table 1 however through a number of studies

kambhammettu 2019 a variety of crop coefficient values have been recommended table 1 these discrepancies in the reported kc values is likely due to the variability and complexity of climatic factors

evaporation rates maestre valero et al 2017 the inherent inconsistencies in kc resulting from its empirical determination also highlight the need for local calibrations especially under drought scenarios rana et al 2005 villalobos et al 2013 in addition to understanding crop water requirement the feasibility of applying deficit irrigation strategies requires monitoring of crop water status sepaskhah and ahmadi 2012 several researchers have identified the citrus leaf water potential ψleaf de lima et al 2015 rodríguez gamir et al 2010 and stomatal conductance gs taylor et al 2015 villalobos et al 2009 as sensitive proxies to reflect plant water stress as soil water potential is reduced leaf stomates dynamically adjust leaf gas exchange through partial closure klein 2014 although several physical and chemical signals trigger stomatal closure including leaf desiccation turgor loss environmental factors e g co2 concentration light intensity vapor pressure deficit vpd xylem foliar and root levels of the abscisic acid aba davies and zhang 1991 klein 2014 pérez pérez et al 2008 it is well established that leaf water potential ψleaf is a critical factor in regulating guard cell turgor zhang et al 2013 the interspecific feedback mechanism between ψleaf and g s is however crop specific and different among species this study sought to evaluate the applicability of saving water without affecting yield for washington navel orange trees under the semi arid climate conditions of the study region more broadly the study also aimed to identify and understand the plant feedbacks under the coupling impact of water stress and climatic condition the specific objectives include i to determine the standard evapotranspiration and crop coefficients kc of field grown washington navel orange trees in a drip irrigated citrus orchard ii to understand the trees responses to different levels of irrigation and monitor the feedback mechanism between ψleaf and g s and iii to define an appropriate deficit irrigation strategy in terms of yield and crop physiological responses 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the field trial was conducted for two consecutive years 2016 and 2017 in a drip irrigated citrus orchard located about 45 km from kazeroon city latitude 29 27 n longitude 51 39 e elevation 950 m a s l in fars province of southern iran the study area is characterized by semi arid mediterranean climate surrounded by hot semi desert climate de pauw et al 2004 soufi 2004 with a mean annual rainfall of 341 mm hot and dry summers with maximum air temperatures exceeding 45 c and mild winters with minimum temperatures around 2 c table 2 summarizes the climate conditions during the experimental period the soil texture was loam table 3 with an average field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp of 27 5 and 10 2 respectively the experiments were performed in the middle of a clean cultivated citrus orchard where navel oranges were planted at 5 5 m spacing the orchard was flat and drip irrigated with a high frequency interval during summer every other day lower frequency during autumn after every 4 days or weekly depending on the evaporative demand and no irrigation during the winter an average of ten on line emitters 4 l hr 1 supplied water in each treatment the citrus trees were mature 12 year old with an average height of 2 8 m and the area shaded by the canopy was 75 80 of the allotted spacing the growing season typically starts at the early february with flower bud induction and it follows by flowering from mid march to april fruit setting begins around may followed by the ripening and fruit development stage in june fruit harvesting is done during december 2 2 irrigation treatments and experimental design to identify the water use the washington navel orange trees were subjected to five irrigation levels from high to low extents the irrigation levels covered the water use range suggested by fao 56 and other studies under similar conditions allen et al 1998 consoli and papa 2013 rana et al 2005 sepaskhah and kashefipour 1995 accordingly five treatments with three replications and three plants per replication were prescribed in completely randomized blocks with different irrigation amounts based on the fraction of eto 100 90 75 60 and 45 named as i100 i90 i75 i60 i45 respectively eto was calculated from calibrated hargreaves samani equation for the region razzaghi and sepaskhah 2012 based on the mean long term meteorological data as well as for the study years 2016 and 2017 note that the long term eto values were used for calculating the amount of applied water in each treatment while the eto values for 2016 and 2017 were used for calculating kc values 1 e t 0 0 0026 t a v g 17 8 t m a x t m i n 0 5 r a where eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 tavg tmax and tmin are the mean maximum and minimum air temperatures oc respectively ra is the extraterrestrial radiation mm day 1 and 0 0026 is the empirical coefficient calibrated by razzaghi and sepaskhah 2012 flowering and post blooming to fruit set have been reported as the sensitive stages to water deficit in citrus garcía tejero et al 2012 ruiz et al 2001 typically these stages start in february and extend until the end of may over the region of study therefore all trees were irrigated at full water requirement from february through may to minimize the adverse impacts of low irrigation levels on flowering and fruitlet abscission the trees were exposed to the irrigation levels from june to december and the following january 2 3 data acquisition and plants measurements crop evapotranspiration etc was calculated following monthly water balance method this choice is based on a number of studies reported in the literature flumignan et al 2011 intrigliolo et al 2013 kang et al 2003 kusakabe et al 2016 miranda et al 2006 sepaskhah and andam 2001 the following equation is utilized 2 e t c i p d i 1 n θ 2 θ 1 δ z i where i is the irrigation depth mm p is the effective rainfall mm d is the deep percolation mm from the bottom of the root zone n is the number of soil layers δz is the thickness of each soil layer mm and θ2 and θ1 are the volumetric soil water contents swc at two consecutive measurements cm3 cm 3 to ensure accurate delivery of water required for each of the irrigation treatment analog water meters were installed and the irrigation volume was measured weekly during the growing seasons for soil moisture assessments neutron probe cpn 503 elite hydroprobetm was used and monthly volumetric swc was measured during the growing seasons at depths of 0 15 0 45 0 75 and 1 05 m the neutron probe was calibrated for the study site using the method suggested by zand parsa and mahmoodian 1989 the amount of water applied in each irrigation treatment was adjusted by considering the effective rainfall the rainfall data were obtained from a nearby weather station to estimate soil evaporation e fifteen microlysimeters one per replication were used during the study period boast and robertson 1982 the microlysimeters consisted of double slotted cylindrical tubes i e an inner hollow plastic tube of 10 20 cm radius height was placed inside an outer plastic tube of 12 25 cm the outer cover was a closed end cylinder filled with 5 cm of field soil and placed into the ground under the canopy area the inner cylinder held a meshed screen end which was filled with the field soil and inserted into the outer layer the mesh screen was an interface between the soil in the outer and inner tubes the mesh screen allowed the soil moisture to drain from the inner tube while keeping the soil weight constant by avoiding soil sliding and mixing between the two cylinders the soil layer at the bottom of the outer cylinder was selected from the under the canopy in situ conditions to maintain the moisture levels similar to the irrigation treatment and to simulate the actual suction gradient for draining the microlysimeters were leveled with the soil surface creating isolated volumes of bare soil and received the same amount of applied water as each irrigation treatment both cylinders of the micro lysimeters were weighted before each irrigation evaporation was calculated as 3 e δ w i n n e r a 1 δ w o u t e r a 1 where δ w i n n e r is the difference in the inner tube weight reflecting the swc loss due to evaporation and drainage δ w o u t e r is the difference in the outer tube weight reflecting the swc loss due to drainage from the inner layer and a1 a2 is the surface area of inner and outer cylinders respectively deep percolation is typically assumed to be negligible as previously suggested for drip irrigated crops parvizi et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 however in the measurements undertaken the crop water use was not known and therefore we considered deep percolation in the analysis the amount of swc in the root zone beyond the field capacity as well as the water content that increased between the measurement intervals at the fourth soil layer 1 m below the root zone was considered as deep percolation leaf water potential ψleaf was measured at solar midday using pressure chamber soil moisture equip corp model 5100a santa barbara ca usa following the procedures described in turner 1988 measurements were carried out in randomly selected mature leaves 4 8 leaves from each tree in each experimental unit covered with foil 1 2 hr before measurements between 12 00 pm 14 00 pm stomatal conductance gs was measured bi weekly at midday for fair weather days between 12 00 pm to 14 00 pm on relatively younger leaves using lci sd a photosynthesis system adc bio scientific ltd hoddes don england at the end of each season december fruits were harvested and crop load i e number of fruit per tree fruit size was quantified the overall yield of each tree was weighed using an on site commercial grading machine 2 4 analysis and calculations for calculating the single crop coefficient k c the ratio of etc measured using monthly water balance approach to eto was used 4 k c e t c e t 0 the etc is representative of non stressed growing conditions considering a high level of management referred to as standard level for crop evapotranspiration non optimal growing conditions reduce the et as compared to the standard level and a reduction factor defined as the stress reduction coefficient kstress was considered 5 e t c k c k s t r e s s e t 0 the non standard conditions could occur due to several factors primarily including soil water deficiency but also due to soil salinity and other environmental or physiological stresses allen et al 1998 described a water stress coefficient this stress term was referred to as ksoil in our study stemming from low soil water potential as a function of root zone depletion dr i e water shortage relative to field capacity θ f c water stress is assumed to occur when dr exceeds readily available water raw the stress function was defined as 6 k s o i l t a w d r t a w r a w where taw is the total available soil water in the root zone mm for dr raw ks t 1 it was assumed that the plant can utilize water from the root zone without water stress since the study includes irrigation at different levels e g applied water at 45 eto the k s o i l coefficient was calculated for each irrigation treatment to evaluate the imposed stress level in the dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 wright 1982 kc is split into two parts the basal crop coefficient kcb as a representative of the crop transpiration and the soil water evaporation coefficient ke as 7 k c d u a l k c b k e the measured soil evaporation using microlysimeters was subtracted from the measured etc to obtain the transpiration t values the values of kcb and ke were defined using the following 8 k c b t e t 0 k e e e t 0 note that the stress reduction coefficient kstress in dual crop approach for non ideal condition only affects kcb component this stress term was referred to as ks t i e k c d u a l k s t k c b k e the mean kc and kcb values from the fao 56 publication allen et al 1998 were reviewed for different crops under a sub humid climate condition with average minimum relative humidity rhmin of 45 and average wind speeds u2 of 2 m s 1 however variations in climate and plant conditions alter the aerodynamic resistance and the crop coefficients especially for tall canopies e g citrus tree when compared to the grass surface which is considered as the reference crop in the fao 56 therefore the mid season and end season kc and kcb values presented in tables 12 and 17 of fao 56 publication allen et al 1998 were considered as 9 k c m i d e n d s e a s o n k c f a o 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 10 k c b m i d e n d s e a s o n k c b f a o 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 where u2 and rhmin are the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 and the minimum relative humidity respectively h is the plant canopy height m for assessing and comparing the impact of the applied irrigation levels on the crop production the water productivity wpet kg m 3 was calculated as fernández et al 2019 11 w p e t m a r k e t a b l e y i e l d k g h a 1 t w u m 3 h a 1 where twu is the total amount of water m3 used for crop production per hectare twu has been given different definitions in various studies fernández et al 2019 in this study the amount of crop water use etc was considered in water productivity calculations and referred to as evapotranspiration water productivity wpet the data from different treatments were compared using tukey test 3 results and discussions 3 1 reference evapotranspiration the calculated reference evapotranspiration values for the 2016 and 2017 study period and the irrigation amount for each treatment as well as the rainfall are shown in fig 1 the variations in eto values between the two years were relatively small with january february having the lowest average daily eto rate of 2 37 mm and june july august with the highest average daily eto rate of 8 8 mm during the course of study there was no rain over the area in summer and the cumulative rainfall was 254 3 mm in 2016 25 1 mm occurring during june dec and 419 1 mm in 2017 98 1 mm occurring during june dec 3 2 soil water content and crop evapotranspiration the average soil water content over each season corresponding to the different irrigation levels is presented in fig 2 as expected the soil moisture levels recorded from the irrigation treatments corresponded to the severity of the imposed water restriction thus high soil moisture values were observed in i100 treatment with the average water content in the soil profile from 0 216 to 0 262 cm 3 cm 3 for i90 the soil moisture ranged from 0 251 cm3 cm 3 to 0 183 cm3 cm 3 during summer remained relatively constant during autumn and then increased to 0 245 cm3 cm 3 by the end of winter the reduction during summer in this treatment suggested the inadequate water supply during june august and the crop water requirement was partially compensated from the swc the mean seasonal soil moisture in i75 and i60 were 0 164 and 0 156 cm3 cm 3 and in i45 soil moisture depleted close to the pwp with 0 144 cm 3 cm 3 of volumetric water content once full irrigation was employed from february the soil moisture gradually increased the soil moisture recovery rate was higher in the i75 and i60 treatments compared to i45 in 2016 heavy rainfall occurred in february and saturated the soil profile and caused a fast recovery in soil moisture in 2017 the end season soil moisture during the winter in the i75 i60 and i45 treatments recovered to 0 180 0 187 0 198 cm 3 cm 3 respectively in all treatments upper soil layers 0 50 cm exhibited lower water content compared to the lower soils 50 100 cm this was mainly observed during summer months when high evaporative demand during hot windy days excessively reduced the soil moisture of the top layers the ksoil calculated based on the soil water depletion eq 6 indicated a non stressed condition in i100 and i90 treatments i e ksoil 1 while the average ksoil values for the i75 i60 and i45 treatments were 0 87 0 76 and 0 61 respectively indicating increasing levels of water stress the stress coefficient values were further calculated by alternate methods using the inversion of eqs 5 and 7 k s t t k c b e t o a n d k s e t e t a k c e t o and the measured etc kcb and kc data the resulting ks t and ks et values fig 3 were consistent with the ksoil values when the soil moisture content was higher than 0 18 cm 3 cm 3 i e two thirds of field capacity as the soil profile became drier the discrepancy between the three coefficients increased this discrepancy indicates that under non optimal conditions e g presence of water stress considering only soil moisture status i e using ksoil likely results in overestimating actual evapotranspiration the ksoil estimates do not explicitly account for stomatal conductance and evapotranspiration terms which likely contributes to the overestimation when the soil dried as feedback leaf turgor reduced and stomatal resistance increased and reduced transpiration niyogi et al 1998 1999 this feedback process caused the etc to decrease further and resulted in lowering ks t and ks et values such feedback was not integrated in ksoil estimation the simultaneous analysis of ks et and ks t data at similar soil moisture levels showed lower estimates by ks et and the differences are evident in the gap between their line graphs shown in fig 3 in general ks et reflects the overall actual stress occurring at each treatment considering the coupled feedback between soil moisture and atmospheric condition on evapotranspiration while ks t primarily reflects the overall plant stress based on transpiration reduction and does not utilize the evaporation component therefore by subtracting evaporation from the overall imposed water stress reflected in ks et higher values ensued for ks t we considered the difference between ksoil and ks t as the controlling effect of stomatal resistance in reducing the water stress accordingly stomatal closure contributed 4 1 9 4 and 16 9 in curtailing water loss in the i75 i60 and i45 treatments table 4 summarizes the average measured values of crop evapotranspiration and its components to quantify the standard evapotranspiration rates in the resulting values obtained from the imposed irrigation levels we evaluated the variations of etc and soil moisture content between the treatments the calculated ksoil from eq 6 added further criterion in recognizing the standard versus water stressed et rates the treatments with ksoil 1 were regarded as water stressed trees for which et rates occur lower than the optimal level allen et al 1998 2005 for a standard irrigation treatment the ksoil value is required to be an equal or near unity allen et al 2005 therefore the i75 i60 and i45 treatments with average ks oil of 0 87 0 76 and 0 61 during the controlled irrigation period were considered as deficit irrigation strategies when the irrigation amount was increased by 10 from i90 to i100 treatments the change in etc rate between the two treatments increased only by 2 5 on average and the difference was not statistically significant the higher irrigation level in i100 caused the swc to increase 0 24 cm3 cm 3 compared to the i90 treatment 0 20 cm3 cm 3 suggesting that extra water applied in the i100 treatment was not needed consumed by the crop and was instead stored in the soil profile as a result irrigating at 90 of eto rate was considered as the irrigation treatment for which etc occurred at the standard rate accordingly the i100 was classified as an over irrigation treatment while i75 i60 and i45 treatments were considered as mild moderate and severe deficit irrigation treatments respectively the standard etc for washington navel ranged from 52 7 1 0 mm during dec to feb to 285 1 4 3 mm in june and july the total measured etc was 1843 2 mm in the first year and 1874 6 mm in the following year for the i90 treatment considered as the full irrigation treatment the kc values ranged from 0 67 in january and gradually increased toward the end of winter table 4 during flowering and fruit set stages in march and april the kc value reached 0 8 and then peaked at 0 96 during the fruit development stage in the summer the kc value dropped during the harvest time and end season from november to december to 0 75 comparable to these results in the study by rogers et al 1983 and sepaskhah and kashefipour 1995 in a semi arid climate the kc values reached to 1 1 in summer and around 0 70 to 0 75 in winter elevated kc values during the peak season have also been reported by other studies maestre valero et al 2017 snyder and o connell 2007 depending on the climate and vpd the peak value varied for different months snyder and o connell 2007 and maestre valero et al 2017 find peak values of 1 and 1 2 respectively during december for a mediterranean climate while consoli and papa 2013 reported the maximum kc values of 0 95 during november for a semi arid mediterranean climate evaporation followed a similar pattern and consisted of 7 of total etc in winter doubling to almost 15 in summer as the irrigation amount frequency i e a persistent wet area under canopy and vpd increased table 4 the evaporation rate correlated with the amount of applied water the basal crop coefficient also showed a significant reduction in water stressed trees table 4 the decrease in kcb with increasing eto in june august demonstrated the close coupling of the canopy to the atmospheric condition the measured values of kc kcb and ke resulting from the i90 treatment as the standard values were compared with those reported in the fao 56 publication allen et al 1998 for canopy cover of 70 note that the relative humidity and wind speed of the study region table 2 were not consistent with those of fao 56 rhmin of 45 and u2 of 2 m s 1 and therefore the fao kc and kcb values were modified based on eqs 9 10 for the climate of the study region the measured values in our study were higher than those suggested by fao 56 using the standard approaches of fao 56 the yearly etc was calculated as 1596 mm 13 lower than our measured etc with kc values ranging from 0 72 to 0 89 such underestimation in etc and kc based on fao 56 is not surprising and was also reported in other studies for different climates and crops rana et al 2005 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 snyder and o connell 2007 in addition to climatic factor the crop physiology including its vigor e g trunk diameter leaf and shading area density of planting types of citrus e g lime orange variety e g valencia navel soil type and agricultural practices e g fertilization tillage ground coverage all affect the evapotranspiration reported in different studies our study was performed in a well managed orchard with proper cultivation practices and the experimented trees were vigorous with high crown density the experimental conditions and environmental factors can be considered as an incremental factor contributing to the high rate of etc over the study area 3 3 plant water status measurements plants respond to water stress through physiological response such as stomatal closure and regulating leaf water potential davies and zhang 1991 liu et al 2006 therefore we reviewed the physiological indicators to identify the responses of washington navel orange trees to the imposed levels of water deficiency seasonal variation of stomatal conductance gs and leaf water potential ψleaf for the irrigation treatments during 2016 and 2017 are shown in fig 4 for all the irrigation treatments during the early growing season the stomatal conductance was relatively similar at around 0 11 mol m 2 s 1 water availability was not a limiting factor during this stage and the plants transpired at their potential during the water restriction period while in i100 treatment the gs values remained relatively constant between 0 10 and 0 12 mol m 2 s 1 in the i45 treatment the stomatal conductance was markedly low at 0 021 mol m 2 s 1 during summer for ideal non stressed condition allen and pereira 2009 reported a range of 0 10 to 0 13 mol m 2 s 1 for citrus which is consistent with our findings nevertheless for a well watered condition a considerable variation in gs has been reported highlighting the need for local observations regarding citrus stomatal response to water stress condition for instance dzikiti et al 2007 reported the stomatal conductance of 2 year old orange trees in a range of 0 005 to 0 175 molm 2 s 1 on a typical clear day and pérez pérez et al 2008 reported a range of 0 03 to 0 14 mol m 2 s 1 for fully watered lane late citrus trees during the phenological stages for non optimal conditions our measured gs values of severely stressed trees 0 011 molm 2 s 1 for i45 in summer were lower than the values 0 05 mol m 2 s 1 as the lowest reported for a similar 50 water reduction in a six year old orange orchard consoli et al 2017 consistent with our results other studies have also reported stomatal conductance as low as 0 020 mol m 2 s 1 mossad et al 2018 0 018 mol m 2 s 1 gomes et al 2004 during the peak stress corresponding measurements of the leaf water potential showed that leaf water potential remained relatively steady for non stressed trees i100 and i90 at 0 71 0 20 mpa and mildly stressed trees i75 at 0 94 0 18 mpa higher leaf dehydration was observed in the severely stressed trees as in i60 and i45 treatments the average ψleaf during the water restriction period were 1 35 and 1 86 mpa although some extreme negative values up 3 21 mpa were recorded from the mature leaves in i45 treatments the overall result is consistent with the reported values for 7 years old navel lane late 1 17 to 1 54 mpa ballester et al 2013 12 years old orange trees up to 2 mpa garcía tejero et al 2010 and mature navelina orange trees up to 2 5 mpa gasque et al 2016 note that the extreme negative recorded value could be due to leaf age as noted by syvertsen 1982 the leaf water potential reached 3 50 mpa when the leaves were 3 6 months old the plant functioning mechanism was further investigated by considering the interactions between gs and ψleaf with respect to the climatic conditions and soil moisture status fig 5 shows the variations in gs and ψleaf relative to vpd for each of the irrigation level cf ballester et al 2013 consoli et al 2017 parvizi et al 2016 in our measurements with increasing vpd particularly from april to august vpd 3 k pa the stomatal conductance followed a declining trend across all the treatments the reduced gs was notable as the water stress level intensified between the irrigation treatments and is shown in fig 5 after august vpd followed a decreasing trend and the trees in i100 i90 and i75 treatments started showing decreasing stomatal resistance however the gs for the i60 and i45 treatments remained high until post harvest the reference best fit lines of gs in fig 5 delineate how the stomatal response to vpd as the water stress level changes between the treatments these best fit lines can be potentially used as a reference for future studies to assess the physiological stress under different irrigation and atmospheric vpd conditions especially when detailed measurements are not possible the leaf water potential in non stress to mildly stressed trees i e i100 190 i75 was mildly impacted by the changes in vpd also seen in fig 4 the average gs values in i100 i90 and i75 during summer were 0 105 0 095 and 0 079 mol m 2 s 1 while the leaf water potential in these treatments remained relatively similar i90 i100 i75 jones 1998 noted that stomatal closure could result in higher ψleaf in mild water stressed trees as compared to well watered trees the impact of vpd on ψleaf was more pronounced in lower irrigation levels i e i60 and i45 nevertheless the resulting low correlation as well as the moderate correlations between gs and vpd signified that in addition to the atmospheric conditions i e vpd other factors such as soil moisture deficit could have a notable feedback on plant water status since the soil moisture was not a limiting factor in i100 during high vpd period the plant continued its high rate of transpiration which caused a slight decrease in the leaf water potential evident in fig 4a and the reference line of ψleaf for i100 in fig 5a as the irrigation level reduced from i100 to i45 in conjunction with the summer heat stress and high vpd the mild to severe soil desiccation experienced by the plant roots likely trigger stomatal closure and higher resistance the covariance between the soil moisture relative soil moisture deficit rsmd and gs ψleaf is plotted in fig 6 a b the rsmd values near zero indicate that swc is approaching the pwp while values close to 1 are indicative of soil moisture levels near the fc the analysis showed that when the soil moisture was not a limiting factor low rsmd the reduction in both gs and ψleaf was insignificant for rsmd higher than 0 35 0 45 the reduction in gs and ψleaf became more evident soil moisture availability also alters atmospheric humidity which has an impact on the transpiration rates to assess this feedback fig 6c shows the variations of gs relative to vpd gs vpd for a range of swc under higher soil moisture conditions the moderate slope in the gs variation indicated a dominant effect of vpd on stomatal closure on the other hand the abrupt slope change with soil moisture depletion indicated that in the lower range of swc plant water status was controlled by root water uptake and soil moisture availability the simultaneous evolution of gs and ψleaf showed isohydric behavior of washington navel orange trees particularly in i100 i90 and i75 treatments in general isohydric plants maintain constant midday leaf water potential in the absence of water by limiting transpiration with increasing stomatal resistance consistent with our finding several studies have reported increasing stomatal resistance in citrus during drought condition to regulate leaf water potential tardieu and simonneau 1998 as the severity of water restriction intensified in the i60 and i45 treatments evidently the stomatal adjustment could not sustain the balance between root water uptake and transpiration rate leading to a decrease in the leaf turgor thus the trees in i60 and i45 relative to other treatments showed higher stomatal resistance for a more extended period to avoid a further loss in ψleaf note that the reduction in stomatal conductance was more pronounced than ψleaf reduction and the trees exhibited isohydric behavior the concurrent reduction of gs and ψleaf of citrus with the intensification of water restriction can also be inferred from other studies ballester et al 2013 garcía tejero et al 2011 gasque et al 2016 however a few studies investigated the resulting correlation in our study the relationship between gs and ψleaf formed a semi sigmoid shape as plotted in fig 6c it was noted that for a threshold 0 067 0 077 mol m 2 s 1 fig 6d of stomatal closure the reduction in ψleaf was not statistically significant p 0 05 with decreasing gs values beyond the threshold and soil moisture depleting beyond raw the ψleaf reduced linearly with the gs reduction resulting in the following equation 12 ψ l e a f 1 05 4 13 1 e g s 33 81 0 5 the ψleaf gs correlation investigated by pérez pérez et al 2012 for lemon and mossad et al 2018 for valencia orange was described using a linear fit showing a corresponding reduction in both variables as the stress level increased the data used in these studies were obtained from the trees subjected to regulated di and partial root zone drying methods more consistent with our findings a study by gomes et al 2004 for pera orange trees obtained relatively constant values of ψleaf for a range of decreasing stomatal conductance according to their results leaf water potential started to drop when gs decreased beyond 0 05 mol m 2 s 3 4 yield and evapotranspiration water productivity the number of fruits and recorded yield were not statistically different between the growing seasons 2016 and 2017 however significant differences were found for among the treatments table 5 the yield boosted with increasing irrigation rate fig 7 however with the higher degree of applied water the differences were not statistically significant on average irrigating at 100 and 90 of eto yielded 95 6 and 93 3 kg tree 1 with relatively large fruit size 286 and 279 g respectively with no significant difference between the two treatments in the i75 treatment 17 of water saving relative to the i90 treatment was achieved along with the final yield of 87 1 kg tree 1 and fruit size of 275 g overall the crop load reduction in i75 was statistically significant compared to i100 and not different from i90 but the improvement in wpet was statistically higher than both of i100 and i90 the i60 treatment yielded 33 water saving and resulted in significant yield and fruit size reduction 78 3 kg tree 1 and 251 g compared to i100 and i90 treatments yet the decrease was not significant compared to the i75 treatment in the last set of experiment the 50 water saving in the i45 treatment caused considerable fruit dropping during the growing season and yielded small fruits 237 g overall the imposed irrigation rates caused 7 16 and 29 of yield reduction in i75 i60 and i45 respectively as expected the wpet was inversely correlated with irrigation level fig 7 and the highest wpet was achieved in i45 treatment irrigating the trees with 100 and 45 eto yielded 2 05 and 2 31 kg m 3 of wpet respectively the intersection point between the relative yield and wpet fig 7c can be regarded as the optimized irrigation amount that reflects the best equilibrium between water savings and yields the irrigation amount associated with the intersection point was calculated as 1391 mm which was approximately similar to the amount of water applied in the i75 treatment 1368 mm however a recommendation regarding an optimal strategy for the growers to achieve water savings without significantly compromising the final yield also depends on the available irrigation water for the region based on this rationale and recognizing the current water deficiency in the study region as the main driver of this study we suggest irrigating at lower rates 60 and 45 of et0 additionally the yielded wpet in i60 2 27 kg m 3 was not statistically different from that of i45 however since the amount of yield was significantly higher than i45 irrigating at the i60 level results in a higher marketable option accordingly the overall results and considerations suggest that irrigating at 60 of eto or 70 of etc for citrus orange can minimize the amount of water use while still maintaining the benefit of a good yield 4 conclusions effective water management strategies for sustainable agriculture in the semi arid climate of regions with limited water resources such as southern iran requires enhanced knowledge of plant water use particularly for the dominant agro systems study results suggest that the standard default fao 56 crop coefficients are low compared to the measurements for the study region as kc ranged from 0 71 in winter to 0 96 in summer with seasonal etc of 1814 mm the high irrigation rate and frequency persistent wetted area hot winds and temperature advection during summer as well as the high foliage density of the trees caused the soil evaporation and plant transpiration occurring at a high rate analysis of stomatal conductance and leaf water potential in non water stress and low water stress conditions showed that the atmospheric condition vpd heat stress wind affected the stomatal closer opening although our findings cannot fully delineate the coupling between the various environmental and physiological factors a feedback mechanism can be inferred whereby stomatal closure in response to a slight leaf turgor depression results in a consequent increase or preservation of leaf water potential in severely stressed trees particularly during summer the leaf water potential ψleaf was low and the stomatal resistance remained high for an extended period to avoid the further decrease in ψleaf best fit reference lines were developed gs and ψleaf under different water stress conditions which can be used to obtain plant physiological responses for the stressed and non stressed citrus trees and could be of potential value in irrigation scheduling reviewing the resulting yield and wpet and considering the current water deficiency in the region irrigating at 60 of eto 0 7 etc was identified as the optimized strategy to be adopted by the local growers irrigating at this level resulted in 16 of yield loss and increased wpet up to 33 this recommended strategy could vary depending on the water availability for the region in the future these findings would be transmitted to the help the knowledge base for local growers to plan accordingly for adequate irrigation and help agencies and decision makers to devise a sustainable agricultural

photosynthetic characteristics of summer maize in the soil column experiment severe water stress w1 significantly decreased the leaf area index relative chlorophyll content and net photosynthesis and delayed maize growth resulting in significant yield loss under mild water stress w2 increased controlled release urea crn application counteracted the inhibition of maize growth under adequate water

increasing chlorophyll content and improving photosynthetic performance during the grain filling period these characteristics allowed more water and nutrients for maize plant and ultimately increased the yield in areas with adequate irrigation conditions crn reduced to 210 kg n ha 1 could satisfy maize growth in mild water stress and half reduced conventional irrigation area the crn rate of 315 kg

fertilizer and irrigation are two of the most important factors in maize production maize yield responds positively to the optimum level of soil moisture and n fertilizer liu and zhang 2007 however excessive n application can decrease resources utilization efficiency and negatively impact the environment which has aroused widespread concern on farming systems such as rational application of n

fertilizers play an essential role in modern agricultural production systems excessive n can cause low n use efficiency and nitrate groundwater contamination and results in resource and energy waste which can seriously affect the agricultural and ecological environment zhang et al 2016 shen et al 2018 given the economic factors and environmental concerns techniques for balancing fertilizer input

maize yield under different water conditions are shown in figs 3 and 4 under the same water conditions the maize yield increased in response to increasing amounts of applied n in 2014 the yield increased by 20 4 28 1 13 1 43 1 and 17 7 29 4 under w1 w2 and w3 treatments respectively compared with n0 in the soil column experiment the yield was not significantly different between cn210 and

them were significantly higher than those of the other treatments in the field experiment the dm and n uptake values of cn315 were the highest under ri however the values of cn210 and cn315 were similar and significantly higher than those of the other treatment groups under ci in 2014 and 2015 the dm and n uptake were significantly higher in cn315 than in n315 under ci and ri the results from

the lai decreased after vt and then increased with increasing n application under the same water condition under w1 condition in 2014 the lai values of cn315 cn210 and cn105 were 13 5 12 4 and 7 1 higher than those under n0 at vt respectively under w2 and w3 conditions the lai values of cn315 cn210 and cn105 were also significantly higher than those under n0 under w1 conditions lai was generally lower and declined rapidly after r2 the lai values of cn210 and cn315 under w3 were similar and slightly higher than those of cn210 under w2 in 2014 but were not significantly different from that in 2015 fig 9 the lai values of n315 cn315 cn210 and cn105 were 10 6 12 8 7 7 and 5 5 higher respectively than that of n0 under ri and were 6 8 8 1 10 0 and 5 5 higher under ci at vt in 2014 fig

content and spad under different water conditions figs 11 and 12 at the same n application level the chlorophyll content was the highest under w3 intermediate under w2 and lowest under w1 conditions in the soil column experiment the spad values under ci were significantly higher than those under ri at r2 stage the chlorophyll contents of cn315 cn210 and cn105 were 35 0 29 8 and 21 4 higher respectively than those of n0 under w1 in 2014 under w2 the chlorophyll contents of cn315 cn210 and cn105 were 32 9 11 6 and 9 2 higher than those of n0 respectively under w3 conditions the chlorophyll contents of cn315 cn210 and cn105 were 35 3 28 7 and 10 1 higher respectively at vt the spad values of n315 cn315 cn210 and cn105 were 32 1 37 5 25 9 and 11 2 higher respectively than those of n0 under ri in 2014 and were 28 6 41 4 43 9 and 14 8 respectively higher under ci the chlorophyll content was not significantly different among cn315 under w2 and cn210 and cn315 under w3 at different growth stages and all were significantly higher than those of the other treatments the spad values of cn210 and cn315 under ci was not significantly different among different growth stages similar results were obtained in 2014 and 2015 with only minor differences between years figs 11 and 12 3 5 net photosynthetic rate the interactive effects of irrigation and crn on p n in the soil column and field experiments were significant at different growth stages tables 3 and 4 p n followed a decreasing trend after vt the average decline rate of p n was relatively slow from vt to r2 13 2 17 5 in 2014 and 2015 and accelerated after r2 26 2 34 7 in 2014 and 2015 in soil column in field experiment the average decline rate of p n was 16 2 in 2014 and 19 2 in 2015 from vt to r2 and 36 7 in 2014 and 33 3 in 2015 from r2 to r5 under w1 average p n was 9 4 μmol m 2 s 1 and relatively low under w2 the average p n in 4 stages of cn315 were 25 4 and 67 3 higher than those of cn210 and cn105 in 2014 22 5 and 67 6 in 2015 under w3 the p n values of cn210 and cn315 were similar and significantly higher than those of cn105 overall cn315 under w2 and cn210 and cn315 under w3 treatments were associated with high p n which was beneficial in terms of yield table 5 under ri the p n of cn315 was significantly higher than those of n315 cn210 and cn105 under ci the p n values of cn210 and cn315 were similar and significantly higher than those of n315 and cn105 table 4 similar results were obtained in 2014 and 2015 with only minor differences between years tables 3 and 4 3 6 correlation coefficients of growth index with yield and yield components leaf area index chlorophyll content spad value and p n at vt were significantly positively correlated with grains per ear 1000 grain weight and yield total plant dry matter and n accumulation were also significantly positive correlated with yield and yield components a similar positive correlation was found among grains per ear 1000 grain weight and yield table 5 thus the interaction of irrigation and crn was closely related to yield and its components lai chlorophyll content spad value and p n could effectively improve total dm and n accumulation during main growth stages of summer maize thereby increasing the number of grains per ear and 1000 grain weight and ultimately determining the maize yield 4 discussion final dry matter weight dm and n uptake of summer maize were highly responsive to irrigation and amount of n applied chilundo et al 2017 ge et al 2012 and wang et al 2016 demonstrated that dm and n uptake increased with increasing soil moisture content in the present study the soil column and field experiments showed that dm and n accumulation under adequate water w3 and ci were significantly higher than those under severe w1 and mild water stress w2 and ri figs 5 and 6 these parameters under ci were also higher than those under ri which received the same n levels figs 7 and 8 n fertilization can significantly increase dm accumulation in maize mueller and vyn 2016 zhao et al 2013 also demonstrated that controlled release fertilizers can significantly increase aboveground dm accumulation and n uptake in maize compared with common compound fertilizer these results are consistent with the present results the dm and n accumulation increased with increasing crn amounts under same water condition but were not significantly different between cn210 and cn315 under w3 in soil column experiment figs 5 and 6 in the field experiment dm and n accumulation in cn315 were significantly higher than those in n315 under ci and ri conditions but no significant differences were observed between cn210 and cn315 under ci figs 7 and 8 these results suggest that crn performed better than conventional urea in improving dm and n uptake and cn315 was excessive when the soil moisture was adequate under severe water stress the available water content restricted the crn release capacity and impacted crop n availability due to reduced mineralization and root activity in soil shao et al 2013 this phenomenon reduced the efficiency of soil nutrient and water absorption by roots and inhibited normal plant growth and development thereby reducing dm and n uptake these values were not significantly higher for cn315 than for cn210 indicating that increasing the crn levels did not significantly counteract the inhibition of plant growth and development under severe water stress under mild water stress soil moisture limitation also markedly reduced the n uptake causing high amounts of fertilizer to remain in the soil instead of being taken up by maize teixeira et al 2014 however li et al 2017 showed that increasing crn level can enhance the ability of crn to release available nitrogen to the soil which can play a compensatory role in the reduction of n accumulation and consequently may increase n use efficiency the dm and n accumulation increased significantly with increasing crn application these values were not significantly different between cn315 under w2 and w3 indicating that increasing the crn levels significantly counteracted the inhibition of plant growth under mild water stress under adequate water conditions the dm and n accumulation were the highest in cn210 and cn315 given the lack of significant difference cn210 was likely sufficient for maize growth and development under adequate water conditions the same results were obtained in the field experiment effective irrigation and crn management can improve maize growth and development facilitating the absorption of water and nutrients and thereby enhancing the physiological characteristics and yield the p n of ear leaves approximated photosynthetic capacity and is a key factor in determining maize grain yield soo hyung et al 2006 liu et al 2018 in the present study significant decreases in dm and n uptake at maize maturity occurred due to drought under w1 w2 and ri conditions which corresponded to significant decreases in lai chlorophyll content and p n of ear leaves at vt drought stress significantly decreased lai and p n at vt suralta et al 2010 ge et al 2012 teixeira et al 2014 showed that soil drought decreased the chlorophyll content resulting in a decline in photosynthetic characteristic these results are consistent with our findings in which water deficiency decreased the leaf area accelerated the senescence process and negatively affected the photosynthetic properties the results also showed that soil drought significantly decreased the leaf chlorophyll content in summer maize especially at vt stage which negatively affected leaf photosynthesis and ultimately reduced the grain yield proper application of n fertilizer can help alleviate the adverse effects of mild drought on lai chlorophyll content and leaf photosynthesis in summer maize li et al 2007 gheysari et al 2009 adamtey et al 2010 hernández et al 2015 in the present study the interactions of irrigation management and controlled release urea exhibited significant effects on lai chlorophyll content and leaf photosynthesis after vt in the field and soil column experiments under w1 drought inhibited normal plant growth and development resulting in relatively low lai chlorophyll content and p n figs 9 and 11 table 3 despite increasing the levels of crn applied under w2 increasing the crn amount to an appropriate level 315 kg n ha 1 significantly increased the lai chlorophyll content and p n in summer maize these parameters of w2cn315 treatment had no difference with w3cn315 thus the interaction of irrigation management and nitrogen significantly counteracted the inhibition of leaf growth and development under w2 however in the presence of ci and ri the lai chlorophyll content and p n were the highest in cn210 figs 10 and 12 table 4 n application beyond the optimal n rate did not consistently promote the lai chlorophyll content or p n our study concluded that an appropriate combination of crn and irrigation could improve leaf photosynthetic ability and help achieve high yield previous studies demonstrated that the yields increased with increasing n application under the same water condition and with increasing soil moisture content at the same n level guo et al 2016 li et al 2017 shao et al 2013 found a significant positive interaction between n and irrigation on maize yield in the present study the results showed the significant interaction of irrigation and crn on maize yield table 1 and 2 under w1 the inhibition of plant growth limited the accumulation of dm and n and decreased the ear leaf photosynthetic capacity resulting in a highly significant reduction in the grain yield the average yield of w3 and w2 decreased by 30 7 and 20 4 in 2014 20 4 and 14 7 in 2015 grains per ear and 1000 grain weight followed a trend similar to that of yield indicating that drought decreased the plant ability to transport photosynthetic products from the source to sink organs under w2 the increase in the crn from 105 to 315 kg n ha 1 increased the yield and enhanced the maize plant growth and development the yield of cn315 under w2 was not significantly different from that of cn315 under w3 indicating that the interaction effects of irrigation and crn on w2cn315 treatment effectively alleviated mild water stress our results showed that cn210 was sufficient for normal plant growth under adequate water conditions and cn315 might be excessive these results are consistent with previous studies of controlled release fertilizer zhao et al 2013 li et al 2017 this effect could be explained by the interactive effects of irrigation and crn table 1 and 2 that is high levels of water available help enhance the ability of crn to release available n to the soil which could promote n uptake and utilization by maize throughout the growth period the lai chlorophyll content spad value and p n at vt and the total dm and n accumulation were all significantly positively correlated with grains per ear 1000 grain weight and yield table 5 additionally crn migration mechanisms influenced the maize yield in soil under different water conditions the corresponding loss mechanisms must be further investigated 5 conclusions irrigation management and crn exhibited significant interaction effects on maize growth and development applying the optimum levels of crn and irrigation enhanced plant dry matter accumulation and n uptake these effects improved ear leaf photosynthetic capacity during the grain filling stage increased the yield components including grains per ear and 1000 grain weight and ultimately led to high yield considering the results of our soil column and field experiments the study determined that crn application rate of 210 kg n ha 1 was optimal for areas with sufficient irrigation conditions whereas 315 kg n ha 1 was optimal for areas with mild water stress and reduced conventional irrigation under similar

10818,effective irrigation and nitrogen n management is crucial for sustainable agricultural development controlled release fertilizer has been widely used to improve n use efficiency and save labor in one off application a specially designed soil column and field trial were conducted to investigate the effect of the interaction of irrigation management and nitrogen on yield n uptake and photosynthetic characteristics of summer maize in the soil column experiment severe water stress w1 significantly decreased the leaf area index relative chlorophyll content and net photosynthesis and delayed maize growth resulting in significant yield loss under mild water stress w2 increased controlled release urea crn application counteracted the inhibition of maize growth under adequate water condition w3 the yield and maize growth exhibited no significant difference between crn 210 and 315 kg n ha 1 in the field experiment crn 210 and 315 kg n ha 1 also exhibited similar yield and were significantly higher than common urea 315 kg n ha 1 under conventional irrigation ci under half reduced conventional irrigation ri yields of crn 315 kg n ha 1 increased by 10 5 and 7 5 compared with that of crn 210 kg n ha 1 in 2014 and 2015 the interaction between irrigation and crn could effectively alleviate the adverse effects of mild drought on summer maize by delaying leaf senescence increasing chlorophyll content and improving photosynthetic performance during the grain filling period these characteristics allowed more water and nutrients for maize plant and ultimately increased the yield in areas with adequate irrigation conditions crn reduced to 210 kg n ha 1 could satisfy maize growth in mild water stress and half reduced conventional irrigation area the crn rate of 315 kg n ha 1 used by traditional farmers showed superior benefits keywords summer maize controlled release urea irrigation grain yield nitrogen uptake 1 introduction maize zea mays l is amajor food crop in china and has multiple uses including food fodder industrial material and bioenergy the world currently faces the challenge of providing food security for a growing population and few new areas are available for agricultural production chen et al 2014 with the development of green growth agriculture maize plays an increasingly important role in crop production cui et al 2018 nitrogen n fertilizer and irrigation are two of the most important factors in maize production maize yield responds positively to the optimum level of soil moisture and n fertilizer liu and zhang 2007 however excessive n application can decrease resources utilization efficiency and negatively impact the environment which has aroused widespread concern on farming systems such as rational application of n fertilizer chen et al 2014 shen et al 2018 drought in northern china can affect maize production and lead to reduced crop biomass and n accumulation and yield ge et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 n fertilizers play an essential role in modern agricultural production systems excessive n can cause low n use efficiency and nitrate groundwater contamination and results in resource and energy waste which can seriously affect the agricultural and ecological environment zhang et al 2016 shen et al 2018 given the economic factors and environmental concerns techniques for balancing fertilizer input and production output have received increasing attention studies have suggested that multiple in season n fertilizer applications can increase aboveground dry matter yield in summer maize thereby improving the n use efficiency duan et al 2011 guo et al 2017 however multiple n applications will inevitably increase the production cost therefore effective irrigation and n management requires the application of innovative and sustainable approaches to satisfy maize demands and achieve high economical yield numerous studies have examined the impact of isolated or combined effects of irrigation methods and levels and application of n fertilizers on maize growth and yield under different conditions li et al 2009 benjamin et al 2014 teixeira et al 2014 chilundo et al 2016 deficit irrigation delays the growth of summer maize and reduces the dry matter accumulation dm and n uptake resulting in significant yield reduction teixeira et al 2014 chilundo et al 2016 proper fertilizer and irrigation management are crucial for maize production in arid regions bouazzama et al 2012 liu et al 2012 ensuring the n supply for maize in the later growth stage after silking is essential for high yield mueller and vyn 2016 thus it is very important to ensure n fertilizer supply under different water conditions in the maize growing season chilundo et al 2017 controlled release urea crn could release n gradually to coincide with the n demand of the crop yang et al 2017 and previous studies have shown that crn could reduce the risk of environmental pollution naz and sulaiman 2016 and significantly increase maize yield and n use efficiency compared with conventional urea hu et al 2013 guan et al 2014 zheng et al 2017 water management and n fertilizer are interrelated and exhibit significant interactive effects on maize dm gheysari et al 2009 n uptake jia et al 2014 and yield shao et al 2013 further research must be conducted to establish improved management strategies to increase maize yield and reduce water and n losses understanding the interaction of irrigation and crn on maize growth and yield is important to maximize agronomic and economic benefits and minimize environmental costs therefore the present study aims to determine the influence of crn irrigation and their interaction on i maize dm and n uptake ii leaf area index lai chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate p n and iii grain yield under soil column and field experiments the findings will help identify suitable combinations of water and crn practices to promote maize growth and improve

coefficients of growth index with yield and yield components leaf area index chlorophyll content spad value and p n at vt were significantly positively correlated with grains per ear 1000 grain weight and yield total plant dry matter and n accumulation were also significantly positive correlated with yield and yield components a similar positive correlation was found among grains per ear 1000 grain weight and yield table 5 thus the interaction of irrigation and crn was closely related to yield and its components lai chlorophyll content spad value and p n could effectively improve total dm and n accumulation during main growth stages of summer maize thereby increasing the number of grains per ear and 1000 grain weight and ultimately determining the maize yield 4 discussion final dry matter weight dm and n uptake of summer maize were highly responsive to irrigation and amount of n applied chilundo et al 2017 ge et al 2012 and wang et al 2016 demonstrated that dm and n uptake increased with increasing soil moisture content in the present study the soil column and field experiments showed that dm and n accumulation under adequate water w3 and ci were significantly higher than those under severe w1 and mild water stress w2 and ri figs 5 and 6 these parameters under ci were also higher than those under ri which received the same n levels figs 7 and 8 n fertilization can significantly increase dm accumulation in maize mueller and vyn 2016 zhao et al 2013 also demonstrated that controlled release fertilizers can significantly increase aboveground dm accumulation and n uptake in maize compared with common compound fertilizer these results are consistent with the present results the dm and n accumulation increased with increasing crn amounts under same water condition but were not significantly different between cn210 and cn315 under w3 in soil column experiment figs 5 and 6 in the field experiment dm and n accumulation in cn315 were significantly higher than those in n315 under ci and ri conditions but no significant differences were observed between cn210 and cn315 under ci figs 7 and 8 these results suggest that crn performed better than conventional urea in improving dm and n uptake and cn315 was excessive when the soil moisture was adequate under severe water stress the available water content restricted the crn release capacity and impacted crop n availability due to reduced mineralization and root activity in soil shao et al 2013 this phenomenon reduced the efficiency of soil nutrient and water absorption by roots and inhibited normal plant growth and development thereby reducing dm and n uptake these values were not significantly higher for cn315 than for cn210 indicating that increasing the crn levels did not significantly counteract the inhibition of plant growth and development under severe water stress under mild water stress soil moisture limitation also markedly reduced the n uptake causing high amounts of fertilizer to remain in the soil instead of being taken up by maize teixeira et al 2014 however li et al 2017 showed that increasing crn level can enhance the ability of crn to release available nitrogen to the soil which can play a compensatory role in the reduction of n accumulation and consequently may increase n use efficiency the dm and n accumulation increased significantly with increasing crn application these values were not significantly different between cn315 under w2 and w3 indicating that increasing the crn levels significantly counteracted the inhibition of plant growth under mild water stress under adequate water conditions the dm and n accumulation were the highest in cn210 and cn315 given the lack of significant difference cn210 was likely sufficient for maize growth and development under adequate water conditions the same results were obtained in the field experiment effective irrigation and crn management can improve maize growth and development facilitating the absorption of water and nutrients and thereby enhancing the physiological characteristics and yield the p n of ear leaves approximated photosynthetic capacity and is a key factor in determining maize grain yield soo hyung et al 2006 liu et al 2018 in the present study significant decreases in dm and n uptake at maize maturity occurred due to drought under w1 w2 and ri conditions which corresponded to significant decreases in lai chlorophyll content and p n of ear leaves at vt drought stress significantly decreased lai and p n at vt suralta et al 2010 ge et al 2012 teixeira et al 2014 showed that soil drought decreased the chlorophyll content resulting in a decline in photosynthetic characteristic these results are consistent with our findings in which water deficiency decreased the leaf area accelerated the senescence process and negatively affected the photosynthetic properties the results also showed that soil drought significantly decreased the leaf chlorophyll content in summer maize especially at vt stage which negatively affected leaf photosynthesis and ultimately reduced the grain yield proper application of n fertilizer can help alleviate the adverse effects of mild drought on lai chlorophyll content and leaf photosynthesis in summer maize li et al 2007 gheysari et al 2009 adamtey et al 2010 hernández et al 2015 in the present study the interactions of irrigation management and controlled release urea exhibited significant effects on lai chlorophyll content and leaf photosynthesis after vt in the field and soil column experiments under w1 drought inhibited normal plant growth and development resulting in relatively low lai chlorophyll content and p n figs 9 and 11 table 3 despite increasing the levels of crn applied under w2 increasing the crn amount to an appropriate level 315 kg n ha 1 significantly increased the lai chlorophyll content and p n in summer maize these parameters of w2cn315 treatment had no difference with w3cn315 thus the interaction of irrigation management and nitrogen significantly counteracted the inhibition of leaf growth and development under w2 however in the presence of ci and ri the lai chlorophyll content and p n were the highest in cn210 figs 10 and 12 table 4 n application beyond the optimal n rate did not consistently promote the lai chlorophyll content or p n our study concluded that an appropriate combination of crn and irrigation could improve leaf photosynthetic ability and help achieve high yield previous studies demonstrated that the yields increased with increasing n application under the same water condition and with increasing soil moisture content at the same n level guo et al 2016 li et al 2017 shao et al 2013 found a significant positive interaction between n and irrigation on maize yield in the present study the results showed the significant interaction of irrigation and crn on maize yield table 1 and 2 under w1 the inhibition of plant growth limited the accumulation of dm and n and decreased the ear leaf photosynthetic capacity resulting in a highly significant reduction in the grain yield the average yield of w3 and w2 decreased by 30 7 and 20 4 in 2014 20 4 and 14 7 in 2015 grains per ear and 1000 grain weight followed a trend similar to that of yield indicating that drought decreased the plant ability to transport photosynthetic products from the source to sink organs under w2 the increase in the crn from 105 to 315 kg n ha 1 increased the yield and enhanced the maize plant growth and development the yield of cn315 under w2 was not significantly different from that of cn315 under w3 indicating that the interaction effects of irrigation and crn on w2cn315 treatment effectively alleviated mild water stress our results showed that cn210 was sufficient for normal plant growth under adequate water conditions and cn315 might be excessive these results are consistent with previous studies of controlled release fertilizer zhao et al 2013 li et al 2017 this effect could be explained by the interactive effects of irrigation and crn table 1 and 2 that is high levels of water available help enhance the ability of crn to release available n to the soil which could promote n uptake and utilization by maize throughout the growth period the lai chlorophyll content spad value and p n at vt and the total dm and n accumulation were all significantly positively correlated with grains per ear 1000 grain weight and yield table 5 additionally crn migration mechanisms influenced the maize yield in soil under different water conditions the corresponding loss mechanisms must be further investigated 5 conclusions irrigation management and crn exhibited significant interaction effects on maize growth and development applying the optimum levels of crn and irrigation enhanced plant dry matter accumulation and n uptake these effects improved ear leaf photosynthetic capacity during the grain filling stage increased the yield components including grains per ear and 1000 grain weight and ultimately led to high yield considering the results of our soil column and field experiments the study determined that crn application rate of 210 kg n ha 1 was optimal for areas with sufficient irrigation conditions whereas 315 kg n ha 1 was optimal for areas with mild water stress and reduced conventional irrigation under similar

10819,the accurate and timely estimation of temporal and spatial changes in crop growth and yield before harvesting is essential for ensuring global food security the integration of remote sensing data and crop models is a potential approach for the estimation of key crop growth parameters and crop yields therefore the aim of this study was to assimilate biomass and canopy cover cc derived from vegetation indices into the aquacrop model using the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm in order to obtain a more accurate estimation of cc biomass and yield for maize the results show that compared to other vegetation indices the enhanced vegetation index evi and the three band water index tbwi can be used to obtain a better estimation of cc r2 0 78 and root mean square error rmse 9 84 and biomass r2 0 76 and rmse 2 84 ton ha respectively additionally it was found that the data assimilation approaches in which only cc was used as a state variable scheme svcc and only biomass was used as a state variable scheme svbio can be used to obtain more accurate estimations of cc r2 0 83 and rmse 8 12 and biomass r2 0 81 and rmse 2 51 ton ha respectively however larger differences were found between the measured and estimated values of one variable i e cc or biomass when the other variable i e biomass or cc was used as the only state variable during the data assimilation the data assimilation approach in which both cc and biomass were used as state variables scheme svcc bio produced a robust result with the estimation accuracy being fairly close to that obtained using the single variable svcc or svbio data assimilation approaches the estimation accuracy for maize yield was slightly better when using a double variable data assimilation approach r2 0 78 and rmse 1 44 ton ha than when using a single variable data assimilation approach in summary this study presents a robust approach for increasing the estimation accuracy for maize cc biomass and yield and for optimizing field management strategies by assimilating remote sensing data into the aquacrop model at a regional scale keywords maize yield canopy cover biomass particle swarm optimization algorithm double state variables data assimilation 1 introduction maize is a major staple grain crop which is used for human consumption and as feed for animals and is highly important for china s food security the accurate and timely estimation of crop growth and yield is critical for policy decision making and field crop management at a national scale kowalik et al 2014 therefore it is necessary to develop an accessible method to obtain accurate and timely estimates of maize growth and yield before harvesting the combination of crop models and remote sensing data has become a very powerful tool for estimating crop growth parameters and crop yield using data assimilation approaches dorigo et al 2007 jin et al 2018a many researchers have combined remote sensing data and crop models using data assimilation approaches in different study regions curenl et al 2011 jarlan et al 2008 jin et al 2016 2017 launay and guerif 2006 morel et al 2014 crop models have been used to analyze relationships between environmental factors e g soil conditions climatic condition field management and crop growth status using mathematical statistical methods curry et al 1971 nendel et al 2011 steduto et al 2009 crop models can simulate changes in crop growth parameters and crop yield during the whole crop growing season however when a large region is modeled bias can be present in crop model simulations due to initial model conditions and uncertainties in crop parameters soil properties meteorological data and field management hansen and jones 2000 the simulation of crop growth status in crop models is mainly affected by these uncertainties which results in larger errors in the simulated yield the rapid improvement of the spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing imagery at regional scales has allowed increasingly accurate crop growth information to be obtained clevers et al 2017 gómez candón et al 2014 wei et al 2017 previous studies have suggested that the integration of crop models and remote sensing data can improve the accuracy of crop yield simulations dente et al 2008 feng et al 2015 huang et al 2016 ines et al 2013 jarlan et al 2008 jiang et al 2014 jin et al 2017 lewis et al 2012 by combining the leaf area index lai derived from satellite data and crop models maas 1988a b obtained an improved estimation of crop yield via reinitialization reparameterization and updating computational approaches additionally guérif and duke 2000 used the sail physical optical model and crop model to calibrate the crop and soil parameters of the sucros crop model based on remote sensing data for a local experimental site furthermore jongschaap 2006 demonstrated that the estimation accuracy for light interception can be increased using a combination of the rotask model and remote sensing data with run time calibration approaches moreover the estimation accuracy for wheat and maize yields can be improved by assimilating soil moisture into the world food study wofost model at a regional scale wit and diepen 2007 dente et al 2008 assimilated the lai obtained from multi source satellite images into the ceres wheat model using a variational assimilation algorithm at the catchment scale their results indicated that this method reduced the difference between the measured and simulated lai and obtained a higher estimation accuracy for wheat yield curenl et al 2011 assimilated wheat lai derived from remote sensing imagery into the wofost model using recalibration based algorithms their results also demonstrated that the data assimilation approach increased the estimation accuracy for crop yield additionally using a four dimensional variational algorithm jiang et al 2014 combined the ceres wheat model and hj 1a b satellite imagery to estimate crop yields in field plots furthermore huang et al 2016 assimilated lai data derived from satellite imagery with a spatial resolution of 30 m into the wofost model their results showed that the estimation of regional wheat yield using data assimilation approaches was more accurate than that obtained using traditional methods most previous studies used only a single agronomic parameter e g lai as a state variable to integrate crop models and remote sensing data and estimate crop yields in these studies the assimilated parameter in the crop model had a high accuracy however other agronomic parameters did not wang et al 2014 thorp et al 2012 combined the dssat and prosail models with canopy nitrogen n accumulation and lai as state variables to estimate the lai canopy n content canopy biomass and yield of wheat and their results indicated that the combination of dssat and prosail can provide a more accurate estimation of crop biophysical characteristics furthermore ines et al 2013 assimilated soil moisture and lai data obtained from remote sensing data into the dssat maize model using an ensemble kalman filter algorithm their results indicated that the estimated maize yield was more accurate when both soil moisture and lai were considered moreover li et al 2015 confirmed that a better estimate of wheat yield can be achieved when both lai and canopy nitrogen accumulation are used as state variables during data assimilation in the dssat ceres model compared to when only one of these variables is used previous studies showed that the use of double variable data assimilation can increase the estimation accuracy for crop state variables and crop yield many studies have focused on the integration of remote sensing data and carbon driven or light driven crop models both using single variable and double variable data assimilation however few studies have concentrated on the use of water driven models to estimate maize yield based on a double variable data assimilation method in 2009 a water driven crop model called aquacrop was introduced to enhance crop water management in irrigated regions of the world steduto et al 2009 therefore the aims of the present study were 1 to determine the best vegetation indices for estimating maize canopy cover cc and biomass 2 to assimilate cc and biomass derived from vegetation indices into the aquacrop model using the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm in order to obtain more accurate estimations of cc and biomass and 3 to evaluate the accuracy of maize yield estimation obtained using a single variable or double variable data assimilation approach respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site field experiments were carried out in 2012 and 2013 at the xiaotangshan precision agriculture experimental site 40 10 31 n 116 26 10 e beijing china beijing has a typical continental climate the minimum average temperature is 4 7 c and occurs in winter while the maximum average temperature is 26 1 c and occurs in summer during the experimental period the average annual precipitation and the frost free period were 650 mm and 180 days respectively jin et al 2014a the soil type in the experimental site is fine loamy 2 2 experimental setup the summer maize cultivars planting date nitrogen levels and plant density are presented in table 1 the area of each microplot was 100 m2 in 2012 and 80 m2 in 2013 three nitrogen levels with one plant density level and four nitrogen levels with three plant density levels were employed in 2012 and 2013 respectively in order to obtain different canopy cover and biomass levels a randomized complete block design with three replications was carried out in 2012 and 2013 pest and weed management were conducted according to local practical standards for summer maize 2 3 field data acquisition 2 3 1 canopy hyperspectral reflectance measurements the hyperspectral reflectance of the summer maize was measured at different growth stages maize growth stages and corresponding hyperspectral reflectance measurement dates are shown in table 2 hyperspectral reflectance was measured at a height of 1 0 m above the canopy with a nadir orientation under clear sky conditions at 10 00 14 00 local time using an asd fieldspec 4 spectrometer analytical spectral devices boulder co usa in the spectral region from 350 to 2500 nm the field of view of the optical fiber of the spectrometer was 25 and corresponding scanned area was about 0 70 m2 the baseline and black reflectance were obtained using a 40 40 cm baso4 calibration panel spectral reflectance was measured with four replicates for each microplot and these four measurements were averaged to represent the canopy reflectance of each microplot in order to reduce the possible effects of changing field conditions a total of 40 reflectance spectra were obtained for each microplot panel spectral measurements were made twice that is before and after the canopy spectral measurements more information about the spectral measurements are presented in the study of jin et al 2016 2 3 2 measurement of leaf area index lai and biomass the lai was measured four times in each microplot at positions where the hyperspectral reflectance was also measured using a lai 2000 plant canopy analyzer li cor inc lincoln ne usa with four replicates being performed for each microplot more information about the lai measurement is given in jin et al 2015 the average of the four lai measurements for each microplot was used to represent the lai of that microplot the lai was used to estimate cc via the following equation heng et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 1 cc 1 005 1 exp 0 60 lai 1 2 furthermore the aboveground biomass ab was measured four times in each microplot in both 2012 and 2013 at positions where the hyperspectral reflectance was also measured in each microplot by the random analysis of four consecutive representative plants with four replicates being performed for each microplot all plant samples were heated to 105 c before being oven dried at 70 c to a constant weight and their final dry weights were recorded in ton ha 2 3 3 meteorological data acquisition daily rainfall wind speed total sunshine hours relative humidity and minimum maximum and mean temperatures were directly measured at the xiaotangshan meteorological station the united nations food and agriculture organization fao penman monteith approach was applied to compute the reference evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 2 3 4 selection of vegetation indices and estimation of biomass a total of 15 hyperspectral vegetation indices from the literature chen 1996 dash and curran 2004 gitelson 2004 gitelson et al 2005 haboudane et al 2004 hunt and rock 1989 jiang et al 2008 jin et al 2013a b jin et al 2014b peñuelas et al 1993 rondeaux et al 1996 rouse 1972 seelig et al 2008 wang et al 2011 were used to determine cc and biomass during the entire maize growing stages in 2012 and 2013 a summary of these indices is given in table 3 the linear or nonlinear relationship between each of the vegetation indices and cc and biomass was obtained by regression of the field dataset the field dataset was divided into calibration 2013 n 132 and validation 2012 n 72 datasets the calibration dataset was used to analyze the relationships between cc biomass and each of the vegetation indices and the validation dataset was used to evaluate the estimation accuracy of the calibration models 2 4 description of the aquacrop model the aquacrop model was proposed by the fao in 2009 and is described in steduto et al 2009 and jin et al 2014a the model can be used to calculate daily soil evaporation and crop transpiration and can also be used to estimate cc biomass and crop yield based on daily crop evapotranspiration in this study the normalized crop water productivity ncwp g m2 was determined using the aquacrop model and was then used to compute the daily crop ab ton ha aboveground biomass was obtained by multiplying the ratio of crop evapotranspiration et mm to eto mm by the ncwp and grain yield gy ton ha was determined using the harvest index hi via the following eq 2 for ab the harvestable portion of gy and eq 3 2 a b e t e t o n c w p 3 g y a b h i the aquacrop plug in program acsav40 was developed to process a large amount of data without a user interface raes et al 2011 and further expands and enriches applications of aquacrop the crop and soil parameters etc that are input into acsav40 are recorded in a text file this file is then obtained by the aquacrop model or else the values in the file are manually enter into current text files raes et al 2011 acsav40 can process successive project files and corresponding simulated values in each project file are restored in the output file which contains cc biomass stress factor crop yield soil evaporation crop evapotranspiration and so on 2 5 assimilation of remote sensing data into the aquacrop model the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm is a simple algorithm with few input parameters and high calculation efficiency that can be easily integrated into crop models compared with other algorithms the pso algorithm can be more easily used in research and has the advantages of rapid convergence and high precision kennedy 2010 in particular this algorithm has attracted the attention of researchers for its superior ability to resolve practical problems additionally the pso algorithm can be used to carry out parallel computing therefore the pso algorithm can be used to combine the aquacrop model with remote sensing data the pso algorithm involves a group composed of m particles m 25 in the present study with certain speeds and without size or quality in an n dimensional searching space each particle can adjust its velocity and position according to both the best point in the current generation pid and the best point of all particles in the swarm pgd fig 1 shows the workflow for the estimation of cc biomass and crop yield by integrating remote sensing data into the aquacrop model three data assimilation schemes were conducted to evaluate the assimilation preformation using double variables a scheme where cc was the only state variable svcc a scheme where biomass was the only state variable svbio and a scheme where both cc and biomass were used as state variables svcc bio the steps for the construction of these assimilation schemes were as follows 1 the position and velocity initial value of each particle were fixed the modified parameters contained eight crop parameters eme ccx cgc cdc pstoshp rootdep psen and num jin et al 2018b vanuytrecht et al 2014 detailed information and the ranges of these parameters are shown in table 4 2 an executable file of the aquacrop model acsav40 exe was run with the required data using the matlab 2017b software mathworks natick ma usa this file delivers estimated biomass and cc as output 3 the relationships between vegetation indices and the measured biomass and cc which were determined by regression analysis were analyzed and the best fitting equation was used to estimate biomass and cc 4 a cost function was developed based on the values of cc and biomass simulated by the aquacrop model and those derived from vegetation indices the fitting value of the cost function was used to determine whether the optimization algorithm had reached the optimal input parameters when only one state variable was considered in the assimilation scheme i e in svcc or svbio the cost function was calculated based on only one variable i e cc or biomass respectively meanwhile when two state variables were utilized in the assimilation scheme i e scheme svcc bio the cost function of the simulated values of cc and biomass was calculated based on both cc and biomass 5 at each iteration the values of pid and pgd were calculated 6 the velocity and position of each particle were changed according to the values of pid and pgd the values of c1 and c2 were set as 2 and ξ and η were assigned random values between 0 and 1 as in wang et al 2014 7 the position of each particle was updated and step 2 was conducted again if the iteration target 100 generations had not been achieved values of biomass cc and crop yield were output if the final iteration had been reached 3 results 3 1 estimating canopy cover cc and biomass using vegetation indices a total of 15 vegetation indices were selected to estimate maize biomass and cc at the experimental site in 2013 n 132 and the 2012 experimental data n 72 were used to validate the estimation performance of the regression models that were constructed in the present study nonlinear functions exponential power and logarithmic and linear functions were fitted in the regression models and the model which produced the best fitting function was obtained i e that with the highest r2 and lowest root mean square error rmse table 5 presents the results of the regression for the relationship between cc or biomass and the vegetation indices the results of the regression demonstrate that all of the vegetation indices are highly significantly related to cc p value 0 01 the lowest and highest r2 values 0 34 and 0 78 were obtained for the vegetation indices wi ii and evi respectively and the corresponding rmses were 36 20 and 9 84 respectively the five vegetation indices evi osavi ndvi wdrvi and msr with r2 values larger than 0 6 led to the best estimations of the cc of maize although there were differences in their corresponding rmse values 9 84 12 91 21 72 18 89 and 20 06 respectively compared with other vegetation indices the logarithmic relationship that was determined between evi and cc had the best fit fig 2 therefore the evi was used to estimate the cc of maize in this study additionally the determined relationships between the vegetation indices and biomass were highly significant p value 0 01 the tbwi ndii ndmi and wi ii were more closely related with biomass r2 0 76 0 63 0 54 and 0 51 respectively suggesting that they these indices are more sensitive to differences in biomass the corresponding rmses were 2 84 3 15 3 52 and 4 29 ton ha respectively table 5 the tbwi had the lowest rmse and the highest r2 and the biomass estimated using this index presented a good consistency with the measured biomass fig 2 therefore the tbwi was used to estimate the biomass of maize in this study 3 2 estimation of cc and biomass using data assimilation values of cc and biomass derived from the evi and tbwi respectively were set as state variables to calibrate the aquacrop model using the pso algorithm the results showed a good agreement between the estimated and measured cc for all data assimilation methods fig 3 and table 6 when cc was used as the only state variable svcc the estimated cc agreed very well with the measured cc fig 3a and table 6 with r2 values of 0 81 and 0 64 and rmse values of 8 44 and 7 65 for the years 2012 and 2013 respectively when biomass was used as the only state variable svbio a poorer fit was obtained between the measured and estimated cc fig 3c and table 6 with r2 and rmse values of 0 52 and 0 53 and 16 88 and 17 71 for 2012 and 2013 respectively when both cc and biomass were used as state variables there was a close relationship between the estimated and measured cc fig 3e with r2 and rmse values of 0 67 and 0 65 and 10 15 and 8 08 for 2012 and 2013 respectively table 6 furthermore the relationships between the measured and estimated cc for 2012 and 2013 were combined for further regression analysis the results demonstrated that there was a large difference in the estimates of cc using the svbio approach r2 0 60 and rmse 18 11 and that the svcc approach r2 0 83 and rmse 8 12 obtained better estimates of cc than the svcc bio approach r2 0 73 and rmse 8 98 additionally the three assimilation methods svcc svbio and svcc bio were compared in terms of their performance for biomass estimation for 2012 and 2013 when the svcc approach was used a large variation was observed between the estimated and measured biomass fig 3b and table 6 with r2 values of 0 56 and 0 49 and rmse values of 4 39 ton ha and 5 24 ton ha for 2012 and 2013 respectively when the svbio approach was used the estimated biomass was very consistent with the measured biomass fig 3d and table 6 with r2 values of 0 85 and 0 85 and rmse values of 2 56 ton ha and 2 44 ton ha for 2012 and 2013 respectively when the svcc bio approach was used the estimated biomass also agreed well with the measured biomass fig 3f and table 6 with r2 values of 0 81 and 0 81 and rmse values of 2 71 ton ha and 2 81 ton ha for 2012 and 2013 respectively when the data from 2012 and 2013 were combined the best estimation performance was obtained using the svbio approach r2 0 81 and rmse 2 51 ton ha followed by the svcc bio approach r2 0 79 and rmse 2 77 ton ha and the svcc approach r2 0 56 and rmse 4 83 ton ha 3 3 estimation of yield the aquacrop model was integrated with remote sensing data in order to estimate maize yield using the pso algorithm fig 4 showed the regression results for the relationships between the measured and estimated values of maize yield the results showed that the svbio approach fig 4b and table 7 r2 0 67 and rmse 1 42 ton ha for 2012 r2 0 73 and rmse 1 96 ton ha for 2013 r2 0 72 and rmse 1 63 ton ha for 2012 2013 more accurately estimated maize yield than the svcc approach fig 4b and table 7 r2 0 38 and rmse 2 02 ton ha for 2012 r2 0 59 and rmse 2 82 ton ha for 2013 r2 0 52 and rmse 2 33 ton ha for 2012 2013 for the svcc bio approach the values of r2 and rmse were 0 75 and 1 29 ton ha for 2012 respectively 0 79 and 1 68 ton ha for 2013 respectively and 0 78 and 1 44 ton ha for 2012 2013 respectively fig 4c and table 7 therefore the svcc bio approach obtained the closest relationship between the estimated and measured maize yield as well as the lowest rmse in summary the data assimilation approach with two state variables obtained a more accurate estimation of maize yield than the approaches with only one state variable 4 discussion vegetation indices concurrent canopy cover cc and biomass were measured during two summer maize growing seasons the vegetation indices were selected for their ability to estimate biomass and cc table 5 the vegetation indices were calculated using hyperspectral reflectance measurements at visible and shortwave infrared wavelengths and can be used to obtain useful information about plant cc and biomass chen 1996 gitelson 2004 jin et al 2013a peñuelas et al 1993 rondeaux et al 1996 rouse 1972 the estimates of cc based on the evi r2 0 78 and rmse 9 84 were more accurate than those based on other vegetation indices the main reason for this is that the evi is calculated based on blue wavelengths rather than red and near infrared wavelengths which removes the impact of aerosol effects at red wavelengths additionally the evi is an optimized index that was designed to increase the vegetation signal with enhanced sensitivity for high ccs using the canopy signal and to reduce the effects of background noise from the soil and atmosphere jiang et al 2008 therefore the evi can be used to increase the estimation accuracy for maize cc meanwhile the tbwi is highly correlated with maize biomass with r2 and rmse values of 0 76 and 2 84 ton ha respectively since the absorption in the red edge spectral region is heavily influenced by chlorophyll content the tbwi is not calculated using such wavelengths which decreases the strength of the absorption signal compared with the absorption signal of dry biomass furthermore the calculation of the tbwi involves spectral absorption at wavelengths of 1447 and 1720 nm which are more sensitive to changes in dry biomass jin et al 2013b moreover the calculation of the tbwi also involves the spectral absorption at a wavelength of 973 nm which is more sensitive to vegetation water content jin et al 2013b peñuelas et al 1993 consequently the tbwi is more strongly correlated with biomass than other vegetation indices and can therefore be used to obtain more accurate estimates of maize biomass this study used four levels of nitrogen three levels of plant density and four varieties of maize the four maize cultivars nongda108 jinghua8 xianyu335 and zhengdan958 have a very similar plant structure and belong to the tight plant maize type our previous study showed that there were no significant differences between the vegetation indices that were calculated for these four maize cultivars jin et al 2019 in general the values of the selected vegetation indices gradually increased with increasing levels of plant density and nitrogen since the reflectance at visible and shortwave infrared wavelengths is mainly influenced by crop canopy chlorophyll content and crop canopy structure respectively gitelson 2004 jin et al 2013a peñuelas et al 1993 chen 1996 jin et al 2013b 2019 the results of the present study showed that the vegetation indices that were selected for the estimation of cc and biomass i e evi and tbwi respectively allow high estimation accuracies table 5 additionally the results indicate that the level of nitrogen plant density and type of maize cultivar do not influence the calculation of the vegetation indices the evi and tbwi vegetation indices can be used to accurately estimate cc and biomass respectively table 5 and fig 2 the cc biomass and corresponding hyperspectral data were obtained from small experimental plots the hyperspectral data can be used to simulate satellite spectral bands based on the satellite spectral response function which can then be used to calculate vegetation indices jin et al 2019 used simulated vegetation indices for the european space agency s sentinel 2a satellite based on the satellite s spectral response function in order to estimate the biomass of maize and obtained a good estimation accuracy this indicates that hyperspectral data can be used to simulate data from larger and high earth orbit satellites satellite derived vegetation indices are influenced by the conditions during image acquisition e g solar illumination and atmospheric conditions due to the large distance between the satellite and the near ground therefore in future research actual satellite data should be used to estimate crop parameters at regional scales in the present study differences were observed in the measured field hyperspectral data for different treatments and years for the experiments conducted in 2012 and 2013 however this is not reported in this paper these differences can be attributed to the large differences in nitrogen application and plant densities which likely lead to differences in the estimation accuracy in future research we plan to investigate ways to qualitatively analyze the effects of nitrogen and plant density on vegetation indices in order to improve the estimation of crop parameters cc and biomass were applied as state variables both individually and in combination to combine remote sensing data and the aquacrop model using the pso algorithm the results show that the svcc and svbio data assimilation methods estimated cc or biomass more accurately than the svcc bio method fig 3a and c table 6 which is consistent with the findings of previous research guérif and duke 2000 li et al 2015 thorp et al 2012 however there were larger differences between the estimated and measured values of one variable i e cc or biomass when the other variable i e biomass or cc was used as the only state variable during the data assimilation fig 3b and d table 6 for example the rmse of cc obtained using the svbio data assimilation approach is 18 11 which is much higher than that obtained using the svcc data assimilation approach rmse 8 12 similarly the difference between the measured values of biomass and the values of biomass estimated using the svcc data assimilation approach is higher than that for the svbio data assimilation approach this may be due to inaccuracy in the estimations of cc and biomass due to the fact that only one state variable cc or biomass was simulated accurately in the svcc and svbio data assimilation approaches regarding the simultaneous use of both cc and biomass as state variables for entering remote sensing data into the aquacrop model the estimated values of cc and biomass were robust with r2 and rmse values of 0 73 and 8 98 for cc respectively and 0 79 and 2 77 ton ha for biomass respectively fig 3e and f table 6 the estimation accuracy for cc and biomass obtained using the svcc bio data assimilation approach was fairly close to that obtained using the svcc or svbio data assimilation approaches the main reason for this is that cc is an important parameter for determining crop growth status steduto et al 2009 and biomass is an important indicator for determining the grain yield heng et al 2009 different crop parameters are relatively independent of each other however they do interact with each other to some degree jin et al 2018b therefore the svcc bio data assimilation approach obtained a more robust estimation of cc and biomass using the aquacrop model than the data assimilation approaches with only one state variable however our study only explored the estimation of biomass and cc and the integration of biomass and cc may not have been optimized since the relationship between these state variables has not yet been fitted by a pattern of interaction between them in the simulated system additionally in this study the cost function was calculated by the simple addition of cc and biomass fig 1 and did not include different deviations between the measured and simulated values of cc and biomass therefore in the future we plan to focus more on two problems i how to determine the two optimal state variables to acquire robust estimates of cc and biomass and ii how to determine the optimal weight of the cost function when two state variables are used simultaneously regarding the estimation of maize yield the svbio data assimilation method performed better than the svcc data assimilation method fig 4a and b table 7 this is due to the fact that biomass is more directly linked with yield in the aquacrop model hsiao et al 2009 the simultaneous use of both cc and biomass as state variables also obtained good estimations of grain yield as well as the lowest rmse values of all the data assimilation methods fig 4c and table 7 the reason for this is that the svcc bio data assimilation method can comprehensively consider the crop growth status and thus obtain a better estimate of maize yield the results of this study show that when incorporating remote sensing data into the aquacrop model the simultaneous use of two state variables during data assimilation can improve the consistency between the measured and simulated yields our results are in good agreement with those of previous studies ines et al 2013 li et al 2015 wang et al 2014 the results indicate that remote sensing data can be combined with the aquacrop model for the estimation of cc biomass and crop yield for various nitrogen treatments and cultivars over a period of two years the results also indicate that incorporating remote sensing data into the aquacrop model using the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm can produce better estimates of cc and biomass than the traditional method involving vegetation indices tables 5 and 6 compared to this traditional method the data assimilation method has the following advantages i the aquacrop model can simulate dynamic changes in cc and biomass considering physiological crop processes and the effects of field management strategies and weather therefore it can help field technicians or researchers to better understand the crop growth status and thus improve the specificity of crop management decision making and ii the data assimilation method can minimize the difference between the values measured by field spectroscopic analysis and the values simulated by the aquacrop model and can also reduce the errors in the remote sensing data during data assimilation iii with the rapid development of computer cluster technology and optical technology in the future the data assimilation method is expected to become more accurate and practical for estimating crop cc biomass and yield at a field scale or regional scale the data assimilation method can be used to improve crop water management and decision making since the aquacrop model better considers dynamic changes in crop water parameters in order to increase the practicality of the data assimilation method it is essential to maintain the accuracy and stability of the cc biomass and crop yield estimated using hyperspectral satellite images and the aquacrop model at a regional scale additionally in the future mounting hyperspectral sensors on unmanned aerial vehicles could allow the timely estimation of maize growth and yield using the data assimilation approach with higher spatial resolution images at the field scale furthermore the impact of the ranges of crop parameters on the estimates of cc biomass and yield should be further explored to utilize data assimilation in the aquacrop model at a regional scale in the future more research will be conducted to test the suitability of this method for various crops in different ecological regions 5 conclusions in this study canopy cover cc and biomass estimated from vegetation indices were assimilated into the aquacrop model to increase the estimation accuracy for cc biomass and crop yield using the pso algorithm for various nitrogen and cultivar treatments the following main conclusions can be drawn i the results show that biomass and cc can be estimated using vegetation indices and that the evi and tbwi were the best vegetation indices for estimating cc r2 0 78 and rmse 9 84 and biomass r2 0 76 and rmse 2 84 ton ha respectively ii the svcc and svbio data assimilation approaches obtained more accurate estimations for cc r2 0 83 and rmse 8 12 and biomass r2 0 81and rmse 2 51 ton ha respectively however larger differences were observed between the estimated and measured values of one variable i e cc or biomass when the other variable i e biomass or cc was used as the only state variable during the data assimilation the estimation accuracy for cc and biomass that was achieved when using the data assimilation approach with two state variables svcc bio agreed fairly well with the accuracies obtained when using the data assimilation approaches with a single state variable svcc or svbio and iii the estimation accuracy for maize yield was slightly higher when using the data assimilation approach with two state variables than when using the data assimilation approaches with a single state variable in short the results of this study suggest that a data assimilation approach can potentially improve the estimation accuracy for the cc biomass and yield of maize the results can offer effective guidance for optimizing field water management for maize at a regional scale acknowledgments this study was supported by the natural science foundation of china 41601369 and the young

10819,the accurate and timely estimation of temporal and spatial changes in crop growth and yield before harvesting is essential for ensuring global food security the integration of remote sensing data and crop models is a potential approach for the estimation of key crop growth parameters and crop yields therefore the aim of this study was to assimilate biomass and canopy cover cc derived from vegetation indices into the aquacrop model using the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm in order to obtain a more accurate estimation of cc biomass and yield for maize the results show that compared to other vegetation indices the enhanced vegetation index evi and the three band water index tbwi can be used to obtain a better estimation of cc r2 0 78 and root mean square error rmse 9 84 and biomass r2 0 76 and rmse 2 84 ton ha respectively additionally it was found that the data assimilation approaches in which only cc was used as a state variable scheme svcc and only biomass was used as a state variable scheme svbio can be used to obtain more accurate estimations of cc r2 0 83 and rmse 8 12 and biomass r2 0 81 and rmse 2 51 ton ha respectively however larger differences were found between the measured and estimated values of one variable i e cc or biomass when the other variable i e biomass or cc was used as the only state variable during the data assimilation the data assimilation approach in which both cc and biomass were used as state variables scheme svcc bio produced a robust result with the estimation accuracy being fairly close to that obtained using the single variable svcc or svbio data assimilation approaches the estimation accuracy for maize yield was slightly better when using a double variable data assimilation approach r2 0 78 and rmse 1 44 ton ha than when using a single variable data assimilation approach in summary this study presents a robust approach for increasing the estimation accuracy for maize cc biomass and yield and for optimizing field management strategies by assimilating remote sensing data into the aquacrop model at a regional scale keywords maize yield canopy cover biomass particle swarm optimization algorithm double state variables data assimilation 1 introduction maize is a major staple grain crop which is used for human consumption and as feed for animals and is highly important for china s food security the accurate and timely estimation of crop growth and yield is critical for policy decision making and field crop management at a national scale kowalik et al 2014 therefore it is necessary to develop an accessible method to obtain accurate and timely estimates of maize growth and yield before harvesting the combination of crop models and remote sensing data has become a very powerful tool for estimating crop growth parameters and crop yield using data assimilation approaches dorigo et al 2007 jin et al 2018a many researchers have combined remote sensing data and crop models using data assimilation approaches in different study regions curenl et al 2011 jarlan et al 2008 jin et al 2016 2017 launay and guerif 2006 morel et al 2014 crop models have been used to analyze relationships between environmental factors e g soil conditions climatic condition field management and crop growth status using mathematical statistical methods curry et al 1971 nendel et al 2011 steduto et al 2009 crop models can simulate changes in crop growth parameters and crop yield during the whole crop growing season however when a large region is modeled bias can be present in crop model simulations due to initial model conditions and uncertainties in crop parameters soil properties meteorological data and field management hansen and jones 2000 the simulation of crop growth status in crop models is mainly affected by these uncertainties which results in larger errors in the simulated yield the rapid improvement of the spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing imagery at regional scales has allowed increasingly accurate crop growth information to be obtained clevers et al 2017 gómez candón et al 2014 wei et al 2017 previous studies have suggested that the integration of crop models and remote sensing data can improve the accuracy of crop yield simulations dente et al 2008 feng et al 2015 huang et al 2016 ines et al 2013 jarlan et al 2008 jiang et al 2014 jin et al 2017 lewis et al 2012 by combining the leaf area index lai derived from satellite data and crop models maas 1988a b obtained an improved estimation of crop yield via reinitialization reparameterization and updating computational approaches additionally guérif and duke 2000 used the sail physical optical model and crop model to calibrate the crop and soil parameters of the sucros crop model based on remote sensing data for a local experimental site furthermore jongschaap 2006 demonstrated that the estimation accuracy for light interception can be increased using a combination of the rotask model and remote sensing data with run time calibration approaches moreover the estimation accuracy for wheat and maize yields can be improved by assimilating soil moisture into the world food study wofost model at a regional scale wit and diepen 2007 dente et al 2008 assimilated the lai obtained from multi source satellite images into the ceres wheat model using a variational assimilation algorithm at the catchment scale their results indicated that this method reduced the difference between the measured and simulated lai and obtained a higher estimation accuracy for wheat yield curenl et al 2011 assimilated wheat lai derived from remote sensing imagery into the wofost model using recalibration based algorithms their results also demonstrated that the data assimilation approach increased the estimation accuracy for crop yield additionally using a four dimensional variational algorithm jiang et al 2014 combined the ceres wheat model and hj 1a b satellite imagery to estimate crop yields in field plots furthermore huang et al 2016 assimilated lai data derived from satellite imagery with a spatial resolution of 30 m into the wofost model their results showed that the estimation of regional wheat yield using data assimilation approaches was more accurate than that obtained using traditional methods most previous studies used only a single agronomic parameter e g lai as a state variable to integrate crop models and remote sensing data and estimate crop yields in these studies the assimilated parameter in the crop model had a high accuracy however other agronomic parameters did not wang et al 2014 thorp et al 2012 combined the dssat and prosail models with canopy nitrogen n accumulation and lai as state variables to estimate the lai canopy n content canopy biomass and yield of wheat and their results indicated that the combination of dssat and prosail can provide a more accurate estimation of crop biophysical characteristics furthermore ines et al 2013 assimilated soil moisture and lai data obtained from remote sensing data into the dssat maize model using an ensemble kalman filter algorithm their results indicated that the estimated maize yield was more accurate when both soil moisture and lai were considered moreover li et al 2015 confirmed that a better estimate of wheat yield can be achieved when both lai and canopy nitrogen accumulation are used as state variables during data assimilation in the dssat ceres model compared to when only one of these variables is used previous studies showed that the use of double variable data assimilation can increase the estimation accuracy for crop state variables and crop yield many studies have focused on the integration of remote sensing data and carbon driven or light driven crop models both using single variable and double variable data assimilation however few studies have concentrated on the use of water driven models to estimate maize yield based on a double variable data assimilation method in 2009 a water driven crop model called aquacrop was introduced to enhance crop water management in irrigated regions of the world steduto et al 2009 therefore the aims of the present study were 1 to determine the best vegetation indices for estimating maize canopy cover cc and biomass 2 to assimilate cc and biomass derived from vegetation indices into the aquacrop model using the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm in order to obtain more accurate estimations of cc and biomass and 3 to evaluate the accuracy of maize yield estimation obtained using a single variable or double variable data assimilation approach respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site field experiments were carried out in 2012 and 2013 at the xiaotangshan precision agriculture experimental site 40 10 31 n 116 26 10 e beijing china beijing has a typical continental climate the minimum average temperature is 4 7 c and occurs in winter while the maximum average temperature is

and 80 m2 in 2013 three nitrogen levels with one plant density level and four nitrogen levels with three plant density levels were employed in 2012 and 2013 respectively in order to obtain different canopy cover and biomass levels a randomized complete block design with three replications was carried out in 2012 and 2013 pest and weed management were conducted according to local practical standards for summer maize 2 3 field data acquisition 2 3 1 canopy hyperspectral reflectance measurements the hyperspectral reflectance of the summer maize was measured at different growth stages maize growth stages and corresponding hyperspectral reflectance measurement dates are shown in table 2 hyperspectral reflectance was measured at a height of 1 0 m above the canopy with a nadir orientation under clear sky conditions at 10 00 14 00 local time using an asd fieldspec 4 spectrometer analytical spectral devices boulder co usa in the spectral region from 350 to 2500 nm the field of view of the optical fiber of the spectrometer was 25 and corresponding scanned area was about 0 70 m2 the baseline and black reflectance were obtained using a 40 40 cm baso4 calibration panel spectral reflectance was measured with four replicates for each microplot and these four measurements were averaged to represent the canopy reflectance of each microplot in order to reduce the possible effects of changing field conditions a total of 40 reflectance spectra were obtained for each microplot panel spectral measurements were made twice that is before and after the canopy spectral measurements more information about the spectral measurements are presented in the study of jin et al 2016 2 3 2 measurement of leaf area index lai and biomass the lai was measured four times in each microplot at positions where the hyperspectral reflectance was also measured using a lai 2000 plant canopy analyzer li cor inc lincoln ne usa with four replicates being performed for each microplot more information about the lai measurement is given in jin et al 2015 the average of the four lai measurements for each microplot was used to represent the lai of that microplot the lai was used to estimate cc via the following equation heng et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 1 cc 1 005 1 exp 0 60 lai 1 2 furthermore the aboveground biomass ab was measured four times in each microplot in both 2012 and 2013 at positions where the hyperspectral reflectance was also measured in each microplot by the random analysis of four consecutive representative plants with four replicates being performed for each microplot all plant samples were heated to 105 c before being oven dried at 70 c to a constant weight and their final dry weights were recorded in ton ha 2 3 3 meteorological data acquisition

agriculture organization fao penman monteith approach was applied to compute the reference evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 2 3 4 selection of vegetation indices and estimation of biomass a total of 15 hyperspectral vegetation indices from the literature chen 1996 dash and curran 2004 gitelson 2004 gitelson et al 2005 haboudane et al 2004 hunt and rock 1989 jiang et al 2008 jin et al 2013a b jin et al 2014b peñuelas et al 1993 rondeaux et al 1996 rouse 1972 seelig et al 2008 wang et al 2011 were used to determine cc and biomass during the entire maize growing stages in 2012 and 2013 a summary of these indices is given in table 3 the linear or nonlinear relationship between each of the vegetation indices and cc and biomass was obtained by regression of the field dataset the field dataset was divided into calibration 2013 n 132 and validation 2012 n 72 datasets the calibration dataset was used to analyze the relationships between cc biomass and each of the vegetation indices and the validation dataset was used to evaluate the estimation accuracy of the calibration models 2 4 description of the aquacrop model the aquacrop model was proposed by the fao in 2009 and is described in steduto et al 2009 and jin et al 2014a the model can be used to calculate daily soil evaporation and crop transpiration and can also be used to estimate cc biomass and crop yield based on daily crop evapotranspiration in this study the normalized crop water productivity ncwp g m2 was determined using the aquacrop model and was then used to compute the daily crop ab ton ha aboveground biomass was obtained by multiplying the ratio of crop evapotranspiration et mm to eto mm by the ncwp and grain yield gy ton ha was determined using the harvest index hi via the following eq 2 for ab the harvestable portion of gy and eq 3 2 a b e t e t o n c w p 3 g y a b h i the aquacrop plug in program acsav40 was developed to process a large amount of data without a user interface raes et al 2011 and further expands and enriches applications of aquacrop the crop and soil parameters etc that are input into acsav40 are recorded in a text file this file is then obtained by the aquacrop model or else the values in the file are manually enter into current text files raes et al 2011 acsav40 can process successive project files and corresponding simulated values in each project file are restored in the output file which contains cc biomass stress factor crop yield soil evaporation crop evapotranspiration and so on 2 5 assimilation of remote sensing data into the aquacrop model the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm is a simple algorithm with few input parameters and high calculation efficiency that can be easily integrated into crop models compared with other algorithms the pso algorithm can be more easily used in research and has the advantages of rapid convergence and high precision kennedy 2010 in particular this algorithm has attracted the attention of researchers for its superior ability to resolve practical problems additionally the pso algorithm can be used to carry out parallel computing therefore the pso algorithm can be used to combine the aquacrop model with remote sensing data the pso algorithm involves a group composed of m particles m 25 in the present study with certain speeds and without size or quality in an n dimensional searching space each particle can adjust its velocity and position according to both the best point in the current generation pid and the best point of all particles in the swarm pgd fig 1 shows the workflow for the estimation of cc biomass and crop yield by integrating remote sensing data into the aquacrop model three data assimilation schemes were conducted to evaluate the assimilation preformation using double variables a scheme where cc was the only state variable svcc a scheme where biomass was the only state variable svbio and a scheme where both cc and biomass were used as state variables svcc bio the steps for the construction of these assimilation schemes were as follows 1 the position and velocity initial value of each particle were fixed the modified parameters contained eight crop parameters eme ccx cgc cdc pstoshp rootdep psen and num jin et al 2018b vanuytrecht et al 2014 detailed information and the ranges of these parameters are shown in table 4 2 an executable file of the aquacrop model acsav40 exe was run with the required data using the matlab 2017b software mathworks natick ma usa this file delivers estimated biomass and cc as output 3 the relationships between vegetation indices and the measured biomass and cc which were determined by regression analysis were analyzed and the best fitting equation was used to estimate biomass and cc 4 a cost function was developed based on the values of cc and biomass simulated by the aquacrop model and those derived from vegetation indices the fitting value of the cost function was used to determine whether the optimization algorithm had reached the optimal input parameters when only one state variable was considered in the assimilation scheme i e in svcc or svbio the cost function was calculated based on only one variable i e cc or biomass respectively meanwhile when two state variables were utilized in the assimilation scheme i e scheme svcc bio the cost function of the simulated values of cc and biomass was calculated based on both cc and biomass 5 at each iteration the values of pid and pgd were calculated 6 the velocity and position of each particle were changed according to the values of pid and pgd the values of c1 and c2 were set as 2 and ξ and η were assigned random values between 0 and 1 as in wang et al 2014 7 the position of each particle was updated and step 2 was conducted again if the iteration target 100 generations had not been achieved values of biomass cc and crop yield were output if the final iteration had been reached 3 results 3 1 estimating canopy cover cc and biomass using vegetation indices a total of 15 vegetation indices were selected to estimate maize biomass and cc at the experimental site in 2013 n 132 and the 2012 experimental data n 72 were used to validate the estimation performance of the regression models that were constructed in the present study nonlinear functions exponential power and logarithmic and linear functions were fitted in the regression models and the model which produced the best fitting function was obtained i e that with the highest r2 and lowest root mean square error rmse table 5 presents the results of the regression for the relationship between cc or biomass and the vegetation indices the results of the regression demonstrate that all of the vegetation indices are highly significantly related to cc p value 0 01 the lowest and highest r2 values 0 34 and 0 78 were obtained for the vegetation indices wi ii and evi respectively and the corresponding rmses were 36 20 and 9 84 respectively the five vegetation indices evi osavi ndvi wdrvi and msr with r2 values larger than 0 6 led to the best estimations of the cc of maize although there were differences in their corresponding rmse values 9 84 12 91 21 72 18 89 and 20 06 respectively compared with other vegetation indices the logarithmic relationship that was determined between evi and cc had the best fit fig 2 therefore the evi was used to estimate the cc of maize in this study additionally the determined relationships between the vegetation indices and biomass were highly significant p value 0 01 the tbwi ndii ndmi and wi ii were more closely related with biomass r2 0 76 0 63 0 54 and 0 51 respectively suggesting that they these indices are more sensitive to differences in biomass the corresponding rmses were 2 84 3 15 3 52 and 4 29 ton ha respectively table 5 the tbwi had the lowest rmse and the highest r2 and the biomass estimated using this index presented a good consistency with the measured biomass fig 2 therefore the tbwi was used to estimate the biomass of maize in this study 3 2 estimation of cc and biomass using data assimilation values of cc and biomass derived from the evi and tbwi respectively were set as state variables to calibrate the aquacrop model using the pso algorithm the results showed a good agreement between the estimated and measured cc for all data assimilation methods fig 3 and table 6 when cc was used as the only state variable svcc the estimated cc agreed very well with the measured cc fig 3a and table 6 with r2 values of 0 81 and 0 64 and rmse values of 8 44 and 7 65 for the years 2012 and 2013 respectively when biomass was used as the only state variable svbio a poorer fit was obtained between the measured and estimated cc fig 3c and table 6 with r2 and rmse values of 0 52 and 0 53 and 16 88 and 17 71 for 2012 and 2013 respectively when both cc and biomass were used as state variables there was a close relationship between the estimated and measured cc fig 3e with r2 and rmse values of 0 67 and 0 65 and 10 15 and 8 08 for 2012 and 2013 respectively table 6 furthermore the relationships between the measured and estimated cc for 2012 and 2013 were combined for further regression analysis the results demonstrated that there was a large difference in the estimates of cc using the svbio approach r2 0 60 and rmse 18 11 and that the svcc approach r2 0 83 and rmse 8 12 obtained better estimates of cc than the svcc bio approach r2 0 73 and rmse 8 98 additionally the three assimilation methods svcc svbio and svcc bio were compared in terms of their performance for biomass estimation for 2012 and 2013 when the svcc approach was used a large variation was observed between the estimated and measured biomass fig 3b and table 6 with r2 values of 0 56 and 0 49 and rmse values of 4 39 ton ha and 5 24 ton ha for 2012 and 2013 respectively when the svbio approach was used the estimated biomass was very consistent with the measured biomass fig 3d and table 6 with r2 values of 0 85 and 0 85 and rmse values of 2 56 ton ha and 2 44 ton ha for 2012 and 2013 respectively when the svcc bio approach was used the estimated biomass also agreed well with the measured biomass fig 3f and table 6 with r2 values of 0 81 and 0 81 and rmse values of 2 71 ton ha and 2 81 ton ha for 2012 and 2013 respectively when the data from 2012 and 2013 were combined the best estimation performance was obtained using the svbio approach r2 0 81 and rmse 2 51 ton ha followed by the svcc bio approach r2 0 79 and rmse 2 77 ton ha and the svcc approach r2 0 56 and rmse 4 83 ton ha 3 3 estimation of yield the aquacrop model was integrated with remote sensing data in order to estimate maize yield using the pso algorithm fig 4 showed the regression results for the relationships between the measured and estimated values of maize yield the results showed that the svbio approach fig 4b and table 7 r2 0 67 and rmse 1 42 ton ha for 2012 r2 0 73 and rmse 1 96 ton ha for 2013 r2 0 72 and rmse 1 63 ton ha for 2012 2013 more accurately estimated maize yield than the svcc approach fig 4b and table 7 r2 0 38 and rmse 2 02 ton ha for 2012 r2 0 59 and rmse 2 82 ton ha for 2013 r2 0 52 and rmse 2 33 ton ha for 2012 2013 for the svcc bio approach the values of r2 and rmse were 0 75 and 1 29 ton ha for 2012 respectively 0 79 and 1 68 ton ha for 2013 respectively and 0 78 and 1 44 ton ha for 2012 2013 respectively fig 4c and table 7 therefore the svcc bio approach obtained the closest relationship between the estimated and measured maize yield as well as the lowest rmse in summary the data assimilation approach with two state variables obtained a more accurate estimation of maize yield than the approaches with only one state variable 4 discussion vegetation indices concurrent canopy cover cc and biomass were measured during two summer maize growing seasons the vegetation indices were selected for their ability to estimate biomass and cc table 5 the vegetation indices were calculated using hyperspectral reflectance measurements at visible and shortwave infrared wavelengths and can be used to obtain useful information about plant cc and biomass chen 1996 gitelson 2004 jin et al 2013a peñuelas et al 1993 rondeaux et al 1996 rouse 1972 the estimates of cc based on the evi r2 0 78 and rmse 9 84 were more accurate than those based on other vegetation indices the main reason for this is that the evi is calculated based on blue wavelengths rather than red and near infrared wavelengths which removes the impact of aerosol effects at red wavelengths additionally the evi is an optimized index that was designed to increase the vegetation signal with enhanced sensitivity for high ccs using the canopy signal and to reduce the effects of background noise from the soil and atmosphere jiang et al 2008 therefore the evi can be used to increase the estimation accuracy for maize cc meanwhile the tbwi is highly correlated with maize biomass with r2 and rmse values of 0 76 and 2 84 ton ha respectively since the absorption in the red edge spectral region is heavily influenced by chlorophyll content the tbwi is not calculated using such wavelengths which decreases the strength of the absorption signal compared with the absorption signal of dry biomass furthermore the calculation of the tbwi involves spectral absorption at wavelengths of 1447 and 1720 nm which are more sensitive to changes in dry biomass jin et al 2013b moreover the calculation of the tbwi also involves the spectral absorption at a wavelength of 973 nm which is more sensitive to vegetation water content jin et al 2013b peñuelas et al 1993 consequently the tbwi is more strongly correlated with biomass than other vegetation indices and can therefore be used to obtain more accurate estimates of maize biomass this study used four levels of nitrogen three levels of plant density and four varieties of maize the four maize cultivars nongda108 jinghua8 xianyu335 and zhengdan958 have a very similar plant structure and belong to the tight plant maize type our previous study showed that there were no significant differences between the vegetation indices that were calculated for these four maize cultivars jin et al 2019 in general the values of the selected vegetation indices gradually increased with increasing levels of plant density and nitrogen since the reflectance at visible and shortwave infrared wavelengths is mainly influenced by crop canopy chlorophyll content and crop canopy structure respectively gitelson 2004 jin et al 2013a peñuelas et al 1993 chen 1996 jin et al 2013b 2019 the results of the present study showed that the vegetation indices that were selected for the estimation of cc and biomass i e evi and tbwi respectively allow high estimation accuracies table 5 additionally the results indicate that the level of nitrogen plant density and type of maize cultivar do not influence the calculation of the vegetation indices the evi and tbwi vegetation indices can be used to accurately estimate cc and biomass respectively table 5 and fig 2 the cc biomass and corresponding hyperspectral data were obtained from small experimental plots the hyperspectral data can be used to simulate satellite spectral bands based on the satellite spectral response function which can then be used to calculate vegetation indices jin et al 2019 used simulated vegetation indices for the european space agency s sentinel 2a satellite based on the satellite s spectral response function in order to estimate the biomass of maize and obtained a good estimation accuracy this indicates that hyperspectral data can be used to simulate data from larger and high earth orbit satellites satellite derived vegetation indices are influenced by the conditions during image acquisition e g solar illumination and atmospheric conditions due to the large distance between the satellite and the near ground therefore in future research actual satellite data should be used to estimate crop parameters at regional scales in the present study differences were observed in the measured field hyperspectral data for different treatments and years for the experiments conducted in 2012 and 2013 however this is not reported in this paper these differences can be attributed to the large differences in nitrogen application and plant densities which likely lead to differences in the estimation accuracy in future research we plan to investigate ways to qualitatively analyze the effects of nitrogen and plant density on vegetation indices in order to improve the estimation of crop parameters cc and biomass were applied as state variables both individually and in combination to combine remote sensing data and the aquacrop model using the pso algorithm the results show that the svcc and svbio data assimilation methods estimated cc or biomass more accurately than the svcc bio method fig 3a and c table 6 which is consistent with the findings of previous research guérif and duke 2000 li et al 2015 thorp et al 2012 however there were larger differences between the estimated and measured values of one variable i e cc or biomass when the other variable i e biomass or cc was used as the only state variable during the data assimilation fig 3b and d table 6 for example the rmse of cc obtained using the svbio data assimilation approach is 18 11 which is much higher than that obtained using the svcc data assimilation approach rmse 8 12 similarly the difference between the measured values of biomass and the values of biomass estimated using the svcc data assimilation approach is higher than that for the svbio data assimilation approach this may be due to inaccuracy in the estimations of cc and biomass due to the fact that only one state variable cc or biomass was simulated accurately in the svcc and svbio data assimilation approaches regarding the simultaneous use of both cc and biomass as state variables for entering remote sensing data into the aquacrop model the estimated values of cc and biomass were robust with r2 and rmse values of 0 73 and 8 98 for cc respectively and 0 79 and 2 77 ton ha for biomass respectively fig 3e and f table 6 the estimation accuracy for cc and biomass obtained using the svcc bio data assimilation approach was fairly close to that obtained using the svcc or svbio data assimilation approaches the main reason for this is that cc is an important parameter for determining crop growth status steduto et al 2009 and biomass is an important indicator for determining the grain yield heng et al 2009 different crop parameters are relatively independent of each other however they do interact with each other to some degree jin et al 2018b therefore the svcc bio data assimilation approach obtained a more robust estimation of cc and biomass using the aquacrop model than the data assimilation approaches with only one state variable however our study only explored the estimation of biomass and cc and the integration of biomass and cc may not have been optimized since the relationship between these state variables has not yet been fitted by a pattern of interaction between them in the simulated system additionally in this study the cost function was calculated by the simple addition of cc and biomass fig 1 and did not include different deviations between the measured and simulated values of cc and biomass therefore in the future we plan to focus more on two problems i how to determine the two optimal state variables to acquire robust estimates of cc and biomass and ii how to determine the optimal weight of the cost function when two state variables are used simultaneously regarding the estimation of maize yield the svbio data assimilation method performed better than the svcc data assimilation method fig 4a and b table 7 this is due to the fact that biomass is more directly linked with yield in the aquacrop model hsiao et al 2009 the simultaneous use of both cc and biomass as state variables also obtained good estimations of grain yield as well as the lowest rmse values of all the data assimilation methods fig 4c and table 7 the reason for this is that the svcc bio data assimilation method can comprehensively consider the crop growth status and thus obtain a better estimate of maize yield the results of this study show that when incorporating remote sensing data into the aquacrop model the simultaneous use of two state variables during data assimilation can improve the consistency between the measured and simulated yields our results are in good agreement with those of previous studies ines et al 2013 li et al 2015 wang et al 2014 the results indicate that remote sensing data can be combined with the aquacrop model for the estimation of cc biomass and crop yield for various nitrogen treatments and cultivars over a period of two years the results also indicate that incorporating remote sensing data into the aquacrop model using the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm can produce better estimates of cc and biomass than the traditional method involving vegetation indices tables 5 and 6 compared to this traditional method the data assimilation method has the following advantages i the aquacrop model can simulate dynamic changes in cc and biomass considering physiological crop processes and the effects of field management strategies and weather therefore it can help field technicians or researchers to better understand the crop growth status and thus improve the specificity of crop management decision making and ii the data assimilation method can minimize the difference between the values measured by field spectroscopic analysis and the values simulated by the aquacrop model and can also reduce the errors in the remote sensing data during data assimilation iii with the rapid development of computer cluster technology and optical technology in the future the data assimilation method is expected to become more accurate and practical for estimating crop cc biomass and yield at a field scale or regional scale the data assimilation method can be used to improve crop water management and decision making since the aquacrop model better considers dynamic changes in crop water parameters in order to increase the practicality of the data assimilation method it is essential to maintain the accuracy and stability of the cc biomass and crop yield estimated using hyperspectral satellite images and the aquacrop model at a regional scale additionally in the future mounting hyperspectral sensors on unmanned aerial vehicles could allow the timely estimation of maize growth and yield using the data assimilation approach with higher spatial resolution images at the field scale furthermore the impact of the ranges of crop parameters on the estimates of cc biomass and yield should be further explored to utilize data assimilation in the aquacrop model at a regional scale in the future more research will be conducted to test the suitability of this method for various crops in different ecological regions 5 conclusions in this study canopy cover cc and biomass estimated from vegetation indices were assimilated into the aquacrop model to increase the estimation accuracy for cc biomass and crop yield using the pso algorithm for various nitrogen and cultivar treatments the following main conclusions can be drawn i the results show that biomass and cc can be estimated using vegetation indices and that the evi and tbwi were the best vegetation indices for estimating cc r2 0 78 and rmse 9 84 and biomass r2 0 76 and rmse 2 84 ton ha respectively ii the svcc and svbio data assimilation approaches obtained more accurate estimations for cc r2 0 83 and rmse 8 12 and biomass r2 0 81and rmse 2 51 ton ha respectively however larger differences were observed between the estimated and measured values of one variable i e cc or biomass when the other variable i e biomass or cc was used as the only state variable during the data assimilation the estimation accuracy for cc and biomass that was achieved when using the data assimilation approach with two state variables svcc bio agreed fairly well with the accuracies obtained when using the data assimilation approaches with a single state variable svcc or svbio and iii the estimation accuracy for maize yield was slightly higher when using the data assimilation approach with two state variables than when using the data assimilation approaches with a single state variable in short the results of this study suggest that a data assimilation approach can potentially improve the estimation accuracy for the cc biomass and yield of maize the results can offer effective guidance for optimizing field water management for maize at a regional scale acknowledgments this study was supported by the natural science foundation of china 41601369 and the young
