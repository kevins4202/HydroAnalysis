16885,eutrophic lakes especially shallow eutrophic lakes disproportionately contribute to greenhouse gas ghg emissions to investigate the effects of eutrophication on ghg dynamics we conducted field measurements every three months from january 2019 to october 2019 in lake ulansuhai a shallow eutrophic lake mean depth of 0 7 m located in a semi arid region in northern china we found that lake ulansuhai was a predominantly source of atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 however it converted to a co2 sink in july due to eutrophication it was also a strong source of methane ch4 with a mean co2 emission of 35 7 12 1 mmol m 2 d 1 and ch4 emission of 5 9 2 9 mmol m 2 d 1 the co2 concentrations in most sites and ch4 concentrations in all sites were supersaturated with the average partial pressure of co2 pco2 being 654 34 μatm and the partial pressure of ch4 pch4 being 157 37 μatm the partial pressures and emissions of the greenhouse gases exhibited substantial seasonal and spatial variations the correlation analysis between the trophic level index and the partial pressure of the greenhouse gases indicated that eutrophication could significantly decrease the co2 emissions but increase the ch4 emissions from the lake resulting in a ch4 and co2 emission ratio of approximately 2 in terms of global warming potential eutrophication decreased the pco2 in the lake and subsequently increased the pch4 due to nutrient input thereby enhancing primary production the results indicated that shallow eutrophic lakes in arid regions are strong sources of ch4 and that eutrophication could alter the greenhouse gas emission patterns graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eutrophication lake ulansuhai temporal and spatial changes partial pressure of greenhouse gases greenhouse gas emissions 1 introduction inland waters play a critical role in the storage and emission of greenhouse gases ghgs and they are extremely active components of the local and global carbon cycles butman et al 2016 davidson et al 2015 saunois et al 2020 vachon et al 2010 global inland waters emitted 0 13 pg c yr 1 of methane ch4 stanley et al 2016 and 2 1 pg c yr 1 of carbon dioxide co2 delsontro et al 2018 raymond et al 2013 lakes are a vital component of the inland water system concerning carbon cycle and climate regulation because they store transport and transform carbon tranvik et al 2009 global lakes only cover 3 7 of the non glaciated land area on earth verpoorter et al 2014 however they emit large amounts of co2 and ch4 while previous research has estimated global ghg emissions from lakes certain differences have been observed between the studies raymond et al 2013 holgerson and raymond 2016 li et al 2018 bastviken et al 2011 wik et al 2016 saunois et al 2020 shallow lakes average depth of less than 3 m are the water bodies that account for the largest area globally downing et al 2006 verpoorter et al 2014 while functioning as important sources of carbon efflux bastviken et al 2011 tranvik et al 2009 low water levels lead to reduced water hydrostatic pressure and shorter gas transport pathways delsontro et al 2011 this can reduce ch4 oxidation and lead to rapid ch4 emission into the atmosphere thereby resulting in greater proportions of ghg emissions from shallow lakes than those observed from deep lakes li et al 2020 furthermore shallow lakes are affected by turbulence margalef 1997 zhu et al 2018 wind driven turbulence can lead to thermal destratification and hypoxia reduction thereby enhancing organic matter aerobic decomposition and inhibiting ch4 production thus turbulence can increase co2 emissions and decrease ch4 emissions jalil et al 2018 jung et al 2014 zhu et al 2018 compared to deep lakes shallow lakes are more vulnerable to eutrophication due to high nutrient loadings and poor self cleaning capacity havens et al 2001 li et al 2020 in addition their nutrient levels and biotic interactions can affect ghg production and biogeochemical processes davidson et al 2015 the high nutrient loadings in shallow lakes stimulate mineralisation and provided more liable organic substrates to enhance ch4 production causing an increase in ghg emissions li et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 in contrast nutrient enrichment can enhance primary production to promote the carbon fixation efficiency of lake sediments gu et al 2011 resulting in a decrease in co2 emissions additionally aquatic plants and phytoplankton drive the primary production in shallow lakes and therefore reduce co2 emissions due to their co2 uptake from the water engel et al 2019 however the dynamics of co2 and ch4 under different eutrophication levels in a lake remain unclear therefore it is necessary to study the impact of eutrophication on ghg emissions in shallow lakes eutrophication is a serious environmental problem in inland lakes anderson et al 2014 sinha et al 2017 and the eutrophic status plays a critical role in influencing the amount of ghg emissions from inland lakes davidson et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 studies have found that eutrophication can stimulate ghgs emissions for example a laboratory incubation experiment demonstrated that hypereutrophic lakes exhibited higher ch4 emissions than those of oligotrophic lakes sepulveda jauregui et al 2015 studies on ghg emissions from continuous eutrophication lakes and impoundments illustrated that higher levels of eutrophication can increase ghg emissions into the atmosphere delsontro et al 2018 in contrast balmer and downing found that eutrophication enhanced primary production thereby decreasing co2 emissions balmer and downing 2011 although the impact of eutrophication on ghg emissions has been investigated the results of previous studies have been contradictory davidson et al 2015 sepulveda jauregui et al 2015 xiao et al 2020 furthermore it is not clear how different levels of eutrophication affect ghg dynamics in china there are approximately 185 000 lakes that exhibit a total surface area of approximately 82 232 km2 yang and lu 2014 eutrophication has become one of the most prominent problems faced by freshwater shallow lakes zhao et al 2012 therefore more studies are required to study the impact of eutrophication on ghg emissions here we conducted a field study to explore the effect of eutrophication on ghg dynamics in an arid shallow lake the specific objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the spatial and seasonal variations and possible influence factors associated with the partial pressures and emissions of co2 and ch4 and 2 to clarify the impact of eutrophication on co2 and ch4 emissions in shallow lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites lake ulansuhai 40 46 41 08 n 108 40 108 57 e is located in urad qianqi bayannaoer city of the inner mongolia autonomous region china fig 1 it is a typical furiotile lake with a total area of 293 km2 and a storage capacity of 2 5 3 108 m3 ma et al 2013 the depth of the lake ranges from 0 5 to 3 m with an average depth of 0 7 m köbbing et al 2014 it lies in a temperate continental climate with four distinct seasons and the ice free period of the lake is from april to october the annual precipitation is approximately 221 1 mm annual mean temperature is 7 6 c and annual evaporation is 2300 mm the major source of water to the lake is farmland drainage from the hetao irrigation district which is diverted from the yellow river and flows into the lake through the main canal eighth canal and ninth canal inflow rivers are situated on the northern and western sides of the lake and outflow occurs on the south side of the lake fig 1 since the 1990s continuous agricultural drainage from the hetao irrigation system sanitary sewage and industrial wastewater have resulted in eutrophication and floating algae blooms in lake ulansuhai qing et al 2020 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 sample collection and eutrophic index calculation in this study four sampling campaigns were conducted in january april july and october in 2019 which represented winter spring summer and autumn respectively in january the lake was covered by ice meanwhile the highest productivity was observed in july in april and october the productivity recovered and declined respectively seven sampling sites were selected to cover the primary lake area fig 1 site s1 which exhibited the lowest transparency is located in the western part of the lake adjacent to the water inlet meanwhile sites s2 s4 are located in the upstream and middle stream regions of the river sites s5 and s6 are adjacent but exhibit different nutrient levels site s7 is located near the aquafarm outlet in january we used an ice chisel to drill three round holes on the ice surface that were equal to the chamber diameter size described below during each sampling campaign the water temperature ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured using a multi 3420 analyser w gmbh weilheim germany with accuracies of 0 2 c 0 004 and 1 5 respectively additionally the air temperature and wind speed were measured 1 m above the lake surface and the air pressure was measured using a kestrel 2500 anemometer the transparency was measured using a secchi disc while the water depth was measured using a counterweight and graduated tape with the scheuer disc removed water samples were collected 10 cm beneath the surface using a 2 l organic glass hydrophore and were kept in 0 5 l polyethylene bottles the total alkalinity was tested by using the fixed endpoint titration method with 0 1 mol l hcl on the sampling day yao et al 2007 each water sample was refrigerated before the chemical variable analysis which was performed within 7 d after collection phytoplankton samples were collected

70 2 2 2 ghg measurements the surface partial pressures of co2 pco2 and ch4 pch4 in the water were measured and calculated using the headspace equilibrium method roland et al 2010 300 ml of ambient air was sampled 1 m above the lake surface and equilibrated with 800 ml of lake water in a sealed flask that was vigorously shaken for 1 min the equilibrated air was then injected into a pre vacuumed sampling bag comprising aluminium foil gas and analysed in a lab using gas chromatography pco2 was calibrated using solubility constants and the headspace ratio ran et al 2015 tian et al 2019 diffusive co2 and ch4 fluxes across the air water interface was measured using an opaque plexiglas floating chamber with an area of 0 09 m2 and a volume of 0 011 m3 each chamber was also covered with an aluminium foil and a heat filter made of foam to reflect sunlight and minimise internal heating the external surface of each chamber was covered with thermal insulation foam to minimise the heating effect of solar radiation during sampling three floating chambers were placed on the water surface to collect the gases the initial gas concentrations in the chambers were confirmed to match the atmospheric levels prior to gas sampling after the chambers were closed the gases were sampled from the chambers five times at 0 3 6 9 and 12 min by using a 60 ml plastic syringe subsequently these gases were immediately injected into a pre vacuumed sampling bag comprising 200 ml of aluminium foil each gas sampling campaign was conducted between 9 am and 3 pm the co2 and ch4 concentrations in the gas samples were analysed using gas chromatography shimadzu gas chromatograph gc2030 kyoto japan the co2 and ch4 emissions were calculated using eq 8 alin et al 2011 8 f d c d t v rta f 1 where f represents the diffusive gas emissions from the water surface into the atmosphere mmol m2 d 1 for co2 and the total gas emissions diffusive and ebullition for ch4 dc dt represents the slope of the concentration change in the chamber ppm min v is the chamber volume m3 r is the universal gas constant 8 2 10 5 m3 atm k 1mol 1 t is the temperature in the chamber k and a is the surface area of the chamber m2 f1 is a conversion factor of minutes to days 60 min 24 h 1440 min d 1 in this study the chambers were submerged in water 2 cm to minimise the disturbance of the surface boundary layer and ensure an effective seal mannich et al 2019 mcginnis et al 2015 vachon et al 2010 in each campaign except that in january when the lake was frozen we also used inverted plastic funnels wik et al 2013 to measure ch4 ebullition emission at seven sampling sites three bubble traps were placed under the water to collect the bubbles the traps consisted of a plastic funnel maximum opening diameter of 32 cm and height of 60 cm a section of polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinyl chloride plastic pipe inside diameter of 20 mm outside diameter of 25 mm and length of 0 31 m and a plastic three way stopcock when collecting the gas the funnel was inverted on the water surface and a large proportion of the open surface of the funnel was 50 cm below the water surface the plastic tube was connected to the three way stopcock at the top of the plastic tube and the entire device remained sealed and did not exchange gas with the atmosphere the ch4 emissions via ebullition bubble ch4 emission were estimated using the following equation 9 f c c h 4 v a t v m 1 1000 where f represents the emissions mmol m 2 d 1 cch4 is the ch4 concentration μl l 1 v is the accumulated headspace gas volume l a is the funnel area 0 07 m2 t is the fractional number of days between measurements and vm is the molar volume of the gas under standard conditions 22 4 mol l 1 the gas samples were equilibrated to room temperature before analysis to verify our result of ebullition we also used the method adopted by sawakuchi et al 2016 as follows fch4 was further used to estimate kch4 by inverting the equation describing fick s law following vachon et al 2010 as follows 10 k c h 4 t o t a l f c h 4 k h p c h 4 w a t e r p c h 4 a i r where kch4 total is the gas transfer velocity specific for ch4 in m d 1 fch4 is the measured total ch4 flux in the floating chamber kh is the henry s constant adjusted for salinity and temperature and p c h 4 w a t e r is the partial pressure of ch4 in surface water µatm and p c h 4 a i r is the partial pressure of ch4 in the atmosphere µatm the diffusive theoretical gas transfer velocity k in m d 1 for ch4 kch4 diffusive was calculated on the basis of kco2 as follows 11 k c h 4 k c o 2 s c c h 4 s c c o 2 n where sc is the schmidt number and n is assigned a value of 1 2 for wind speeds of 3 6 m s 1 or 2 3 for wind speeds of 3 6 m s 1 to determine the chambers that captured ebullition and to prove our results we used k600 the calculated k values were converted to k600 values using equation 12 k 600 k 600 s c 0 5 ebullition made the calculated k600 much larger than the measured values in chambers in the same transect the k600 total which was attributed to total flux in each chamber was used to divided the k600 diffusive which was attributed to diffusive flux if k600 total k600 diffusive for a trial was 2 it was considered to have received ch4 from both diffusion and ebullition sawakuchi et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 2 3 data analysis all statistical analyses were performed using spss for windows version 18 0 spss inc chicago il usa the statistical significance was set to p 0 05 an independent sample t test was used to determine the differences in the partial pressures and ghg emissions amongst the various sites and seasons pearson correlation analysis was conducted to estimate the relationships between the pco2 pch4 ghg emissions and environmental variables 3 results 3 1 temporal and spatial variation of environmental variables and trophic states lake ulansuhai exhibited significant temporal variations in its biological and chemical properties figs 2 and 3 furthermore there were significant differences in mean value of ph do doc tn and no3 amongst the seven sites however there were no significant spatial variations in the mean water temperature chl a dic tp dtp and nh4 the ph value changed from 7 05 to 10 00 with a mean value of 8 82 0 13 the ph value at s1 was slightly lower than that of the other sites fig 2b the lowest wind

seven sites was 15 40 µg l 1 with the lowest and highest concentrations being observed at s1 and s3 respectively fig 2f the concentrations of cod and doc increased from s1 to s7 the lowest cod and doc concentrations were observed at s1 with the annual mean values of 3 73 and 2 32 mg l 1 respectively meanwhile the highest concentrations were observed at s6 with annual mean values of 6 74 0 29 mg l 1 and 8 05 0 49 mg l 1 respectively figs 2g and 3 i the total alkalinity and dic fig 2h and j were stable with mean values of 5 61 0 11 mmol l 1 and 34 54 mg l 1 respectively the tn concentration first decreased and then increased fig 3a and the highest tn concentrations occurred at s1 with annual mean values of 4 79 0 52 mg l 1 the nh4 n concentration fluctuated and the lowest concentration occurred at s5 in addition the variation in nh4 n was similar to that in tn except for the fact that high nh4 n concentrations appeared in s1 and s5 tp decreased at first and then increased and the highest concentrations occurred at s1 with annual mean values of 0 20 0 09 mg l 1 in contrast the dtp concentration exhibited an opposite variation trend fig 3e lake ulansuhai exhibited spatial and temporal variabilities in the trophic state the tli values ranged from 58 12 to 84 98 with a mean value of 73 12 thereby indicating hyper eutrophication of the lake fig 4 the tli fluctuated from s1 to s7 the highest trophic state occurred at s1 and the lowest occurred at s2 the trophic level of s5 was significantly higher than that of the adjacent s6 p 0 01 regarding the temporal patterns of the trophic states tli reached the medium eutrophic level in april mean value of 62 83 while the hypereutrophic level was attained in the other months january july and october all the spatially averaged tli values were in the hypereutrophic level for each sampling site 3 2 temporal and spatial variation of co2 and ch4 3 2 1 co2 the pco2 values varied from 267 μatm to 1657 μatm fig 5 a with an overall mean pco2 of 654 34 μatm the pco2 values at approximately 80 of the sampling sites were greater than that of the atmosphere 400 μatm thereby indicating co2 supersaturation in most of the lake area however under saturated values were observed in july at s2 s3 s5 and s6 and october at s2 and s3 in addition the pco2 values exhibited clear temporal variations amongst the four sampling months the mean pco2 values were higher in january and april while being lower in july 406 12 μatm and october 496 31 μatm the mean pco2 values in july and october were particularly close to that in the atmosphere 400 μatm especially in july the annual co2 emissions fluctuated from 26 3 2 6 mmol m 2 d 1 to 248 7 15 0 mmol m 2 d 1in all the four measurements with an overall mean of 35 7 12 1 mmol m 2 d 1 fig 5b significant temporal variations in co2 emissions were also observed amongst the four sampling months with an average of 113 9 30 8 mmol m 2 d 1 in january 30 6 8 5 mmol m 2 d 1 in april 7 1 4 0 mmol m 2 d 1 in july and 4 3 5 6 mmol m 2 d 1 in october in july the co2 emissions at the four sites s2 s3 s5 and s6 were negative resulting in a carbon sink for lake ulansuhai in october negative co2 emissions were observed at s2 and s3 resulting in lower co2 emissions for the lake overall fig 5b the spatial distribution of pco2 and its relative spatial heterogeneity are displayed in fig 6 a and c the average pco2 value in each site amongst the four months ranged from 463 μatm to 764 μatm at s1 and s2 the pco2 was significantly lower than 400 μatm in july and october distinct spatial variations in co2 emissions are displayed in fig 6 high co2 emissions 68 7 15 0 mmol m 2 d 1 at s6 that were significantly greater than those of the other sites p 0 01 the lowest co2 emissions were observed at s2 2 1 3 6 mmol m 2 d 1 fig 7 c the pco2 and co2 emissions variations exhibited a similar trend from s1 to s4 while showing an opposite trend from s5 to s7 fig 6a and c the pco2 in lake ulansuhai is affected by various factors fig 9 the correlation analysis results demonstrated that pco2 was negatively correlated with the trophic state index r2 0 17 p 0 05 water temperature r2 0 31 p

with tn r2 0 09 p 0 01 no3 n r2 0 20 p 0 01 and biomass r2 0 18 p 0 05 the k for co2 ranged from 0 2 m d 1 to 30 0 m d 1 3 6 0 7 m d 1 and showed obvious temporal and spatial variations for temporal variations the highest mean k value was observed in july 8 2 1 7 m d 1 and the lowest value was detected in april 1 0 0 7 m d 1 meanwhile spatial variations in the k value were the highest at s6 7 8 3

these values indicate the supersaturation of ch4 the mean pch4 value was highest in january 458 120 μatm and lowest in april 15 4 μatm fig 5c corresponding to the highest and lowest trophic states respectively fig 4 ch4 emissions varied from 0 1 mmol m 2 d 1 to 55 7 mmol m 2 d 1 with a grand mean of 5 9 2 9 mmol m 2 d 1 and a grand median of 1 2 mmol m 2 d 1 indicating that ch4 was continually emitted from lake ulansuhai into the atmosphere in all seasons seasonal variations in ch4 emissions were identified fig 5d with the largest ch4 emissions occurring in july and the lowest occurring in april the ch4 emissions in july accounted for 65 51 of the total emissions recorded during the four sampling months the average ch4 emissions in january were higher than those in april and october temporal variations in pch4 and ch4 emissions exhibited different trends fig 5c and d the highest pch4 was observed in january while the highest fch4 was observed in july significant spatial heterogeneity was recognised for the pch4 values fig 6b and d the pch4 values ranged from 6 to 1754 μatm with the lowest mean value of 20 3 μatm at s1 and the highest mean value of 456 33 μatm at s6 various factors affect pch4 in lake ulansuhai the data analysis revealed that pch4 was significantly positively correlated with trophic state index r2 0 18 p 0 05 nh4 r2 0 29 p 0 01 tp r2 0 2 p 0 01 cod r2 0 26 p 0 01 doc r2 0 26 p 0 01 dic r2 0 18 p 0 01 but significantly negatively with do r2 0 06 p 0 05 and ph r2 0 29 p 0 01 due to the temporal variability of trophic state and pch4 in lake ulansuhai the relationship between pch4 and trophic state was weakened especially in april fig 10a and c red dots ch4 emissions exhibited a tendency similar to that of pch4 fig 6b and d the highest and lowest fch4 values were recorded at s6 and s1 respectively a minor spatial variation in the fch4 values was observed in april ranging from 0 1 to 1 3 mmol m 2 d 1 ch4 emissions exhibited a tendency similar to that of pch4 in spatial variability both pch4 and fch4 at s6 were significantly higher than at the other sites p 0 05 in addition pch4 and fch4 at s1 inflow and s7 outflow were lower than at the other sites fig 6d the ebullition emissions sample catch bubbles only in july and the results exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity fig 7 the highest ebullition emissions occurred at s2 where pch4 was highest and no bubbles were captured at s1 and s5 near the inflow and channel where sediment dredging occurred the bubble ch4 emissions ranged from 0 to 0 49 mmol m 2 d 1 mean value 0 15 mmol m 2 d 1 which only accounted for 1 of the total emissions compared with k600 the results showed that ebullition could be captured only for 16 measurements of which 10 were conducted in july it is consistent with our measured results although indeed the chamber may also capture a certain portion of the bubbles especially in july when ebullition was higher 4 discussion 4 1 ghg partial pressures controls 4 1 1 co2 water environments affect the balance of aquatic co2 production and consumption pco2 exhibited spatial and temporal variations in lake ulansuhai suggesting that the co2 dynamics were affected by ambient parameters that also demonstrated spatial and temporal variations the correlation analysis results demonstrated that pco2 was negatively correlated with water temperature r2 0 31 p 0 01 and ph r2 0 26 p 0 01 fig 8 a and b which was similar to the results reported in previous studies wen et al 2016 yang et al 2019b pco2 was often controlled by temperature seekell and gudasz 2016 and ph marotta et al 2009 water temperature played a vital role in aquatic metabolism and gas solubility karlsson et al 2012 an increasing water temperature can enhance photosynthetic activity and increase carbon fixation reducing the co2 concentration engel et al 2019 liang et al 2017 additionally chl a and water temperature were significantly positively correlated r2 0 53 p 0 01 in lake ulansuhai fig s1 indicating that when the temperature was high algae grew more quickly and thereby increased amount of co2 was consumed furthermore pco2 was often controlled by ph in freshwater lakes when at ph 8 the concentrations of dissolved co2 were lower than that of hco3 and co3 2 in lake ulansuhai the mean ph was 8 therefore it was apparent that pco2 exhibits a negative relationship with ph finlay et al 2009 in addition the accumulation of free co2 produced via the decomposition of organic matter because of eutrophication could also decrease the ph in lake ulansuhai shallow eutrophic lakes with high primary production can stimulate the uptake of co2 from the atmosphere balmer and downing 2011 chl a is a proxy for lake system productivity delsontro et al 2018 the negative relationship between chl a and pco2 indicated a reduction in co2 in the productive lake in lake ulansuhai chl a was negatively related with pco2 fig 8c similar results were also found in a study on capitol lake usa yang et al 2019b and lake taihu xiao et al 2020 because pco2 levels are affected by aquatic productivity chl a can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton productivity in lakes lapierre et al 2017 increasing chl a concentrations can enhance photosynthesis and increase the water co2 absorbed by phytoplankton balmer and downing 2011 the strong negative correlation between pco2 and do concentration fig 8d in lake ulansuhai also supported the negative correlation between chl a and pco2 similar findings have been reported in other studies e g xiao et al 2020 yang et al 2019b nutrients were important factors affecting the pco2 level in aquatic ecosystems yang et al 2019b xiao et al 2021 the pco2 value increased with an increased nutrient supply tn and no3 n fig 8f and g which was similar to the results of previous studies davidson et al 2015 wen et al 2016 xiao et al 2020 the nutrient supply can regulate the ghg concentration in the water by enhancing primary production gu et al 2011 or promoting bacterial mineralisation larsen et al 2011 in eutrophic lakes when the rate of photosynthesis is higher than that of respiration less co2 is produced and emissions occur in inland lakes wen et al 2016 as demonstrated by the negative relationship between do and pco2 r2 0 34 p 0 01 fig 8d in lake ulansuhai photosynthesis caused the lake to be a weak source of co2 especially in july however the correlation analysis demonstrated that pco2 was negatively correlated with tp and dtp fig 8h and i similar results can also be found in other studies santoso et al 2017 trolle et al 2012 the availability of p promoted the primary production of phytoplankton reducing the co2 concentration in the water delsontro et al 2018 which can be explained by chl a at the community level tp was the optimum proxy for chl a vogt et al 2017 as there was a significant positive relationship between chl a and p tp and dtp r2 tp 0 03 p 0 05 r2 dtp 0 64 p 0 01 fig s2 the trophic state is a crucial factor affecting the pco2 level in aquatic ecosystems yang et al 2019b as the trophic state of lake ulansuhai was hypertrophic fig 4 pco2 decreased with an increase in the eutrophic status r2 0 17 p 0 05 fig 10a which was consistent with the results reported by pacheco et al 2014 and sepulveda jauregui et al 2015 lakes undergoing eutrophication can become carbon sinks of atmospheric co2 due to their massive primary production pacheco et al 2014 sepulveda jauregui et al 2018a trolle et al 2012 found a similar result in that co2 emissions from lakes recovering from eutrophication exhibited increasing trend the effect of external and autochthonous nutrients on co2 depends on the balance between respiration and primary production xiao et al 2020 in july with the highest trophic state and negative co2 emissions high primary production enhanced by chl a and dtp elevated the inorganic carbon conversion rate free co2 and bicarbonate to particulate organic matter balmer and downing 2011 converting the lake into a carbon sink nutrients in lakes can alter the co2 concentration by enhancing respiration or promoting primary production however the ultimate co2 concentration is determined by the balance between its production and consumption perga et al 2016 xiao et al 2020 the opposite result was found in previous studies as co2 emissions exhibited a positive correlation with the trophic state zhou et al 2020 and moderate eutrophication increased ghg emissions from lakes into the atmosphere delsontro et al 2018 this contradiction may due to the high density of phytoplankton in hyper eutrophic lakes where respiration is significantly higher than photosynthesis resulting in co2 emissions from lakes in contrast in lake ulansuhai higher chl a concentrations were found in july and october indicating higher productivity in these months that may have converted the lake from a source co2 to its sink 4 1 2 ch4 a positive relationship between water temperature and pch4 was observed in lake ulansuhai fig 9 a methanogenesis is strongly dependant upon temperature sepulveda jauregui et al 2018a and in eutrophic lakes methanogenesis is more sensitive to temperature than methanotrophy warmer temperatures can promote ch4 production leading to ch4 oversaturation in the water january was an exceptional month with higher ch4 concentrations which was likely due to the accumulation of ch4 under the ice similar finding has been reported in other study xiao et al 2021 wherein high ch4 concentration was observed in winter ch4 is primarily produced by methanogens which are sensitive to the lake ph the ph range of 6 to 8 is most suitable for methanogen growth and ch4 concentrations decrease at ph outside of this optimal range schrier uijl et al 2011 yang et al 2019a in lake ulansuhai the ph ranged from 7 to 10 hence ch4 concentration exhibited a negative correlation with ph fig 9b ferland et al 2012 read et al 2012 aerobic methanotrophy is a critical regulator of ch4 concentration in lakes sepulveda jauregui et al 2018b in lake ulansuhai the mean do was 8 774 mg l 1 which can provide oxygen for ch4 oxidation and the highest surface water do was observed at s1 corresponding to the lowest ch4 concentration fig 9c in lake ulansuhai a positive correlation between pch4 and cod was observed r2 0 26 p 0 01 fig 9d with an increase in cod the consumption of oxygen by organic matter in the water caused do to drop and ch4 oxidation was reduced benefiting ch4 production this result was consistent with that of el fadel and massoud 2001 in aquatic systems nutrient levels and biotic interactions have the potential to affect the production ghgs production and consumption of the biogeochemical processes davidson et al 2015 various nutrients affected the pch4 in lake ulansuhai fig 9e h the input of n and p in the shallow lake stimulated mineralisation and provided additional liable organic substrate which enhanced ch4 production xiao et al 2021 previous studies have demonstrated that ammonium ions can inhibit ch4 oxidation van der nat et al 1997 resulting in ch4 accumulation in the water which is supported by the positive correlation between nh4 n and pch4 identified in our study the doc concentration in the lake reflects the distinct ecological functions that affect the processes governing ch4 cycling cunada et al 2018 doc can provide carbon substrate for methanogenesis to enhance ch4 production thereby increasing ch4 concentration rodriguez et al 2018 in contrast to co2 eutrophication increases ch4 emissions in this study we found that the tli was positively correlated with pch4 r2 0 18 p 0 05 fig 10 b which was consistent with the results of previous studies beaulieu et al 2019 delsontro et al 2018 sepulveda jauregui et al 2018a the lakes rich in nutrients provide substantial amounts of labile organic matter from primary production that can be readily transformed into ch4 precursors promoting ch4 emissions into the atmosphere davidson et al 2018 west et al 2016 pch4 was positively correlated with nutrients in our study fig 9e h in a laboratory incubation study of water and sediment from lakes of various trophic states it was found that eutrophic lakes exhibited higher temperature sensitivity than oligotrophic lakes leading to greater ch4 emissions sepulveda jauregui et al 2018a similarly in lake ulansuhai at s6 the tli was higher and the ch4 concentration was the highest figs 4 and 6b and d than other sites shallow eutrophic lakes are typically beneficial to the growth of submerged vegetation which can provide abundant amount of substrate to stimulate ch4 production in the sediment xiao et al 2017 at s1 although it exhibited a high trophic state the carbon content doc fig 2i was the lowest leading to lower ch4 concentrations furthermore the highest and lowest trophic states occurred in january and april which corresponded with the highest and lowest ch4 concentrations respectively 4 2 ghg emissions controls 4 2 1 co2 in lake ulansuhai high pco2 resulted in high co2 emissions which was the dominant variable influencing co2 flux natchimuthu et al 2017 and driving co2 exchange between lakes and the atmosphere pacheco et al 2014 the level of pco2 affected the exchange rate and thus the emissions in addition wind speed was a critical factor affecting ghg emissions from the air water interface which can cause algae to float in the water and accelerate pco2 consumption in water huttunen et al 2002 zhao et al 2017 resulting in lower co2 emissions differing from normal cases where wind enhanced the emissions yang et al 2018 furthermore with an increase in the water depth co2 emissions reduced probably owing to changes in ph zagarese et al 2021 which was also affected by depth fig s3 co2 emissions showed significant temporal and spatial variations in lake ulansuhai in july the lake was a co2 sink mainly due to increased primary productivity pacheco et al 2014 in january the lake was a great emission source accounting for 75 8 of the total month emissions recorded during the sampling months 75 8 hence emissions during january should not be ignored in the annual carbon budget this may be due to removal of the ice from the lake surface regarding spatial variations co2 emissions were extremely different at s2 2 1 3 6 mmol m 2 d 1 and s4 68 7 15 0 mmol m 2 d 1 the correlation analysis results showed that fco2 was significantly negatively correlated with pco2 r2 0 15 p 0 01 wind speed r2 0 08 p 0 01 and water depth r2 0 13 p 0 01 fig 11 a b however no significant relationship was found between k and wind speed p 0 05 wind speed could affect the gas exchange at the water air interface alin et al 2011 in our studied lake no significant correlation pearson correlation p 0 05 was found between wind speed and k this could be explained by lower wind speed mean speed 1 86 0 15 m s 1 which was weak and thus unable to cause turbulence guérin et al 2007 4 2 2 ch4 pch4 was a primary factor influencing ch4 emissions ch4 emissions exhibited weak correlations with pch4 and wind speed fig 11d and e the weak relations were primarily due to the higher emissions in july and the accumulation of ch4 in the water under ice in january ch4 emissions were affected by lake ulansuhai water depth r2 0 10 p 0 01 fig 11f in shallow lakes turbulence caused by wind is a recognised driver of ch4 emissions across the lake water interface wanninkhof et al 1985 which can facilitate the release of ch4 from water gu et al 2004 additionally do affected pch4 fig 9c sepulveda jauregui et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 yang and tong 2015 which was also influenced by wind this complex relationship weakened the effect of wind speed on ch4 emissions water depth can influence ghg dynamics by affecting water column mixing anoxic state of the volume fraction and sediment carbon accumulation ferland et al 2012 read et al 2012 low water levels lead to lower water hydrostatic pressure and shorter transport pathways for gases delsontro et al 2011 reducing ch4 oxidation and leading to rapid ch4 emissions into the atmosphere holgerson and raymond 2016 li et al 2020 seasonal and spatial patterns of ch4 emissions showed significant variations amongst the four months and the seven sites similar to other productive lakes zhang et al 2021 loken et al 2019 the significant temporal variations of ch4 emissions were mainly due to the seasonal variations in the trophic states and ambient factors natchimuthu et al 2016 loken et al 2019 such as water temperature xiao et al 2017 ch4 emissions in july accounted for 65 5 of their total over the four months water depth can affect ch4 concentrations and fluxes natchimuthu et al 2016 li et al 2020 which was also found to be the case for lake ulansuhai fig 11f previous studies have indicated that inflowing streams usually have lower ch4 concentrations s1 adjacent to the inlet had the lowest ch4 concentrations and only 1 1 of the total emissions amongst the seven sites in addition the carbon substrate for ch4 production xiao et al 2017 and the trophic state also effected the ch4 spatial pattern s5 with higher doc and trophic state level had the largest ch4 emissions amongst all the studied sites ch4 ebullition in lake ulansuhai only accounted for a small fraction of the total ch4 emissions and was lower than those reported in other studies wik et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 the studied lake had a higher abundance of submerged macrophytes which could transport oxygen to the root zone sorrell et al 2002 sorrell and downes 2004 xing et al 2005 and the rich vegetation could prevent bubbles from escaping the water these characteristics could support methanotrophs and other organisms that consume ch4 energy input to sediments and pressure also affected bubbling wik et al 2014 mattson and likens 1990 ch4 ebullition from lake sediment could be enhanced exponentially when temperature was above a threshold of 15 van bergen et al 2019 the mean water temperatures in april and october were 13 8 and 15 0 this might have been a major factor for inhibiting the bubbling in addition the higher ch4 pressures in april and october could also result in reduced bubbling furthermore due to the high spatiotemporal variability and stochastic nature of ebullition maher et al 2019 capturing ch4 bubbles was difficult using a few chambers this might increase the uncertainty in the results obtained 4 3 comparison with other eutrophic lakes various studies on lakes at the global regional and local scales have typically reported co2 supersaturation junger et al 2019 raymond et al 2013 wen et al 2016 the mean pco2 values of lake ulansuhai were similar to those of the guadalcacín reservoir mesotrophic and lower than those of lake taihu eutrophic morales pineda et al 2014 xiao et al 2020 but higher than those of lake mendota eutrophic and lake okaro eutrophic loken et al 2019 santoso et al 2020 with its low trophic state the guadalcacín reservoir exhibited low productivity resulting in co2 accumulation in the water consequently the pco2 value for the guadalcacín reservoir was similar to that of our results eutrophic lakes typically exhibit co2 undersaturation however lake taihu eutrophic is co2 supersaturated due to the high external carbon and other nutrient inputs xiao et al 2020 the mean co2 emissions in lake ulansuhai were higher than those in reports for other lakes at lower trophic states table 1 co2 emissions from lakes are associated with different morphometric characteristics and environmental factors wang et al 2017 as a shallow lake lake ulansuhai is vulnerable to wind and water temperatures resulting in fco2 variations furthermore the mean temperature of lake ulansuhai was lower than that of the above mentioned lakes certain studies only focused on summer emissions that corresponded to the highest productivity which may have led to greater co2 uptake results being observed for the studied lakes engel et al 2019 the results obtained from the study on lake ulansuhai imply that hypereutrophic lakes tend to exhibit higher ch4 concentrations and emissions than oligotrophic mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes table 1 eutrophication promotes high algal and macrophyte vegetation biomasses in water systems that may enrich the sediments with autochthonous carbon substrates which are then more labile and readily converted to ch4 west et al 2012 eutrophication induced algal increase not only enhances autochthonous production that fuels ch4 production but also increases oxygen consumption that suppresses ch4 oxidation huttunen et al 2003 high ch4 concentrations in biguás lake a shallow eutrophic lake with an area of approximately 0 015 km2 were identified and higher ch4 emissions from small lakes have also been reported by holgerson and raymond 2016 ch4 emissions in lake ulansuhai were similar to those observed by beaulieu et al 2019 as they simulated the eutrophication of lentic waters under scenarios of future nutrient loading to inland waters to demonstrate that the enhanced eutrophication of lakes and impoundments is projected to substantially increases ch4 emissions from these systems 30 90 over the next century we calculated global warming potential gwp to compare the potential climate impact of emissions of different greenhouse gases the gwp of atmospheric ch4 has been reported to be 34 fold stronger than that of atmospheric co2 over 100 years stocker et al 2013 in terms of co2 equivalents co2 eq co2 and ch4 emissions from lake ulansuhai were 573 3 and 1178 2 g c co2 eq m 2 year 1 respectively ch4 was the most important contributor to the gwp of the lake ch4 gwp was more than double the co2 gwp eutrophication plays a diverging role in co2 and ch4 emissions lapierre and del giorgio 2012 because it changes o2 and substrate availability in lakes and regulates primary production methanogenesis methanotrophy and respiration pacheco et al 2014 sepulveda jauregui et al 2018a the availability of nutrients and autochthonous primary production were the key regulators influencing inland lake ch4 cycling bastviken et al 2004 west et al 2016 enhanced eutrophication increases ch4 emissions from lakes beaulieu et al 2019 but decreases co2 emissions trolle et al 2012 the gwp of lake ulansuhai was larger than that of the eutrophic mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes loken et al 2019 yang et al 2015 van bergen et al 2019 xing et al 2005 huttunen et al 2003 table 2 which was mainly due to increased ch4 emissions by eutrophication in lake ulansuahi eutrophication increased the contribution of ch4 to the gwp but decreased the contribution of co2 similar results were demonstrated by bartosiewicz et al 2016 5 conclusions in this study we investigated ghg co2 and ch4 emissions and environmental parameters in lake ulansuhai from january 2019 to october 2019 by conducting trimestral sampling campaigns this study explored the dynamics of co2 and ch4 in a hypereutrophic lake demonstrating large spatial and temporal variations in the partial pressures and emissions of co2 and ch4 our results indicate that the lake is a source of co2 but a stronger source of ch4 and that an increase in the trophic state e g from eutrophic to hypereutrophic significantly decreases co2 emissions but increases ch4 emissions we found that abundant nutrients enhanced primary productivity consuming additional co2 and providing substrates for ch4 production the results of our study indicate that shallow eutrophic lakes in arid regions exhibit a high potential with respect to the release ghgs into the atmosphere and that eutrophication can change the ghg emission pattern of lakes when the trophic state increased co2 emissions were weakened or the lake even converted to a sink of co2 but ch4 emissions were reinforced such dynamics of carbon causing reduced co2 emissions but increased ch4 emissions complicate the carbon budget calculation to improve the accuracy of regional to large scale estimations of ghg emissions and carbon budgets of aquatic ecosystems further research on eutrophic lakes should be conducted our findings also suggest that carbon emissions should be considered for the management of the water environment in eutrophic lakes credit

16885,eutrophic lakes especially shallow eutrophic lakes disproportionately contribute to greenhouse gas ghg emissions to investigate the effects of eutrophication on ghg dynamics we conducted field measurements every three months from january 2019 to october 2019 in lake ulansuhai a shallow eutrophic lake mean depth of 0 7 m located in a semi arid region in northern china we found that lake ulansuhai was a predominantly source of atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 however it converted to a co2 sink in july due to eutrophication it was also a strong source of methane ch4 with a mean co2 emission of 35 7 12 1 mmol m 2 d 1 and ch4 emission of 5 9 2 9 mmol m 2 d 1 the co2 concentrations in most sites and ch4 concentrations in all sites were supersaturated with the average partial pressure of co2 pco2 being 654 34 μatm and the partial pressure of ch4 pch4 being 157 37 μatm the partial pressures and emissions of the greenhouse gases exhibited substantial seasonal and spatial variations the correlation analysis between the trophic level index and the partial pressure of the greenhouse gases indicated that eutrophication could significantly decrease the co2 emissions but increase the ch4 emissions from the lake resulting in a ch4 and co2 emission ratio of approximately 2 in terms of global warming potential eutrophication decreased the pco2 in the lake and subsequently increased the pch4 due to nutrient input thereby enhancing primary production the results indicated that shallow eutrophic lakes in arid regions are strong sources of ch4 and that eutrophication could alter the greenhouse gas emission patterns graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eutrophication lake ulansuhai temporal and spatial changes partial pressure of greenhouse gases greenhouse gas emissions 1 introduction inland waters play a critical role in the storage and emission of greenhouse gases ghgs and they are extremely active components of the local and global carbon cycles butman et al 2016 davidson et al 2015 saunois et al 2020 vachon et al 2010 global inland waters emitted 0 13 pg c yr 1 of methane ch4 stanley et al 2016 and 2 1 pg c yr 1 of carbon dioxide co2 delsontro et al 2018 raymond et al 2013 lakes are a vital component of the inland water system concerning carbon cycle and climate regulation because they store transport and transform carbon tranvik et al 2009 global lakes only cover 3 7 of the non glaciated land area on earth verpoorter et al 2014 however they emit large amounts of co2 and ch4 while previous research has estimated global ghg emissions from lakes certain differences have been observed between the studies raymond et al 2013 holgerson and raymond 2016 li et al 2018 bastviken et al 2011 wik et al 2016 saunois et al 2020 shallow lakes average depth of less than 3 m are the water bodies that account for the largest area globally downing et al 2006 verpoorter et al 2014 while functioning as important sources of carbon efflux bastviken et al 2011 tranvik et al 2009 low water levels lead to reduced water hydrostatic pressure and shorter gas transport pathways delsontro et al 2011 this can reduce ch4 oxidation and lead to rapid ch4 emission into the atmosphere thereby resulting in greater proportions of ghg emissions from shallow lakes than those observed from deep lakes li et al 2020 furthermore shallow lakes are affected by turbulence margalef 1997 zhu et al 2018 wind driven turbulence can lead to thermal destratification and hypoxia reduction thereby enhancing organic matter aerobic decomposition and inhibiting ch4 production thus turbulence can increase co2 emissions and decrease ch4 emissions jalil et al 2018 jung et al 2014 zhu et al 2018 compared to deep lakes shallow lakes are more vulnerable to eutrophication due to high nutrient loadings and poor self cleaning capacity havens et al 2001 li et al 2020 in addition their nutrient levels and biotic interactions can affect ghg production and biogeochemical processes davidson et al 2015 the high nutrient loadings in shallow lakes stimulate mineralisation and provided more liable organic substrates to enhance ch4 production causing an increase in ghg emissions li et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 in contrast nutrient enrichment can enhance primary production to promote the carbon fixation efficiency of lake sediments gu et al 2011 resulting in a decrease in co2 emissions additionally aquatic plants and phytoplankton drive the primary production in shallow lakes and therefore reduce co2 emissions due to their co2 uptake from the water engel et al 2019 however the dynamics of co2 and ch4 under different eutrophication levels in a lake remain unclear therefore it is necessary to study the impact of eutrophication on ghg emissions in shallow lakes eutrophication is a serious environmental problem in inland lakes anderson et al 2014 sinha et al 2017 and the eutrophic status plays a critical role in influencing the amount of ghg emissions from inland lakes davidson et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 studies have found that eutrophication can stimulate ghgs emissions for example a laboratory incubation experiment demonstrated that hypereutrophic lakes exhibited higher ch4 emissions than those of oligotrophic lakes sepulveda jauregui et al 2015 studies on ghg emissions from continuous eutrophication lakes and impoundments illustrated that higher levels of eutrophication can increase ghg emissions into the atmosphere delsontro et al 2018 in contrast balmer and downing found that eutrophication enhanced primary production thereby decreasing co2 emissions balmer and downing 2011 although the impact of eutrophication on ghg emissions has been investigated the results of previous studies have been contradictory davidson et al 2015 sepulveda jauregui et al 2015 xiao et al 2020 furthermore it is not clear how different levels of eutrophication affect ghg dynamics in china there are approximately 185 000 lakes that exhibit a total surface area of approximately 82 232 km2 yang and lu 2014 eutrophication has become one of the most prominent problems faced by freshwater shallow lakes zhao et al 2012 therefore more studies are required to study the impact of eutrophication on ghg emissions here we conducted a field study to explore the effect of eutrophication on ghg dynamics in an arid shallow lake the specific objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the spatial and seasonal variations and possible influence factors associated with the partial pressures and emissions of co2 and ch4 and 2 to clarify the impact of eutrophication on co2 and ch4 emissions in shallow lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites lake ulansuhai 40 46 41 08 n 108 40 108

et al 2013 the depth of the lake ranges from 0 5 to 3 m with an average depth of 0 7 m köbbing et al 2014 it lies in a temperate continental climate with four distinct seasons and the ice free period of the lake is from april to october the annual precipitation is approximately 221 1 mm annual mean temperature is 7 6 c and annual evaporation is 2300 mm the major source of water to the lake is farmland drainage from the hetao irrigation district which is diverted from the yellow river and flows into the lake through the main canal eighth canal and ninth canal inflow rivers are situated on the northern and western sides of the lake and outflow occurs on the south side of the lake fig 1 since the 1990s continuous agricultural drainage from the hetao irrigation system sanitary sewage and industrial wastewater have resulted in eutrophication and floating algae blooms in lake ulansuhai qing et al 2020 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 sample collection and eutrophic index calculation in this study four sampling campaigns were conducted in january april july and october in 2019 which represented winter spring summer and autumn respectively in january the lake was covered by ice meanwhile the highest productivity was observed in july in april and october the productivity recovered and declined respectively seven sampling sites were selected to cover the primary lake area fig 1 site s1 which exhibited the lowest transparency is located in the western part of the lake adjacent to the water inlet meanwhile sites s2 s4 are located in the upstream and middle stream regions of the river sites s5 and s6 are adjacent but exhibit different nutrient levels site s7 is located near the aquafarm outlet in january we used an ice chisel to drill three round holes on the ice surface that were equal to the chamber diameter size described below during each sampling campaign the water temperature ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured using a multi 3420 analyser w gmbh weilheim germany with accuracies of 0 2 c 0 004 and 1 5 respectively additionally the air temperature and wind speed were measured 1 m above the lake surface and the air pressure was measured using a kestrel 2500 anemometer the transparency was measured using a secchi disc while the water depth was measured using a counterweight and graduated tape with the scheuer disc removed water samples were collected 10 cm beneath the surface using a 2 l organic glass hydrophore and were kept in 0 5 l polyethylene bottles the total alkalinity was tested by using the fixed endpoint titration method with 0 1 mol l hcl on the sampling day yao et al 2007 each water sample was refrigerated before the chemical variable analysis which was performed within 7 d after collection phytoplankton samples were collected

70 2 2 2 ghg measurements the surface partial pressures of co2 pco2 and ch4 pch4 in the water were measured and calculated using the headspace equilibrium method roland et al 2010 300 ml of ambient air was sampled 1 m above the lake surface and equilibrated with 800 ml of lake water in a sealed flask that was vigorously shaken for 1 min the equilibrated air was then injected into a pre vacuumed sampling bag comprising aluminium foil gas and analysed in a lab using gas chromatography pco2 was calibrated using solubility constants and the headspace ratio ran et al 2015 tian et al 2019 diffusive co2 and ch4 fluxes across the air water interface was measured using an opaque plexiglas floating chamber with an area of 0 09 m2 and a volume of 0 011 m3 each chamber was also covered with an aluminium foil and a heat filter made of foam to reflect sunlight and minimise internal heating the external surface of each chamber was covered with thermal insulation foam to minimise the heating effect of solar radiation during sampling three floating chambers were placed on the water surface to collect the gases the initial gas concentrations in the chambers were confirmed to match the atmospheric levels prior to gas sampling after the chambers were closed the gases were sampled from the chambers five times at 0 3 6 9 and 12 min by using a 60 ml plastic syringe subsequently these gases were immediately injected into a pre vacuumed sampling bag comprising 200 ml of aluminium foil each gas sampling campaign was conducted between 9 am and 3 pm the co2 and ch4 concentrations in the gas samples were analysed using gas chromatography shimadzu gas chromatograph gc2030 kyoto japan the co2 and ch4 emissions were calculated using eq 8 alin et al 2011 8 f d c d t v rta f 1 where f

ensure an effective seal mannich et al 2019 mcginnis et al 2015 vachon et al 2010 in each campaign except that in january when the lake was frozen we also used inverted plastic funnels wik et al 2013 to measure ch4 ebullition emission at seven sampling sites three bubble traps were placed under the water to collect the bubbles the traps consisted of a plastic funnel maximum opening diameter of 32 cm and height of 60 cm a section of polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinyl chloride plastic pipe inside diameter of 20 mm outside diameter of 25 mm and length of 0 31 m and a plastic three way stopcock when collecting the gas the funnel was inverted on the water surface and a large proportion of the open surface of the funnel was 50 cm below the water surface the plastic tube was connected to the three way stopcock at the top of the plastic tube and the entire device remained sealed and did not exchange gas with the atmosphere the ch4 emissions via ebullition bubble ch4 emission were estimated using the following equation 9 f c c h 4 v a t v m 1 1000 where f represents the emissions mmol m 2 d 1 cch4 is the ch4 concentration μl l 1 v is the accumulated headspace gas volume l a is the funnel area 0 07 m2 t is the fractional number of days between measurements and vm is the molar volume of the gas under standard conditions 22 4 mol l 1 the gas samples were equilibrated to room temperature before analysis to verify our result of ebullition we also used the method adopted by sawakuchi et al 2016 as follows fch4 was further used to estimate kch4 by inverting the equation describing fick s law following vachon et al 2010 as follows 10 k c h 4 t o t a l f c h 4 k h p c h 4 w a t e r p c h 4 a i r where kch4 total is the gas transfer velocity specific for ch4 in m d 1 fch4 is the measured total ch4 flux in the floating chamber kh is the henry s constant adjusted for salinity and temperature and p c h 4 w a t e r is the partial pressure of ch4 in surface water µatm and p c h 4 a i r is the partial pressure of ch4 in the atmosphere µatm the diffusive theoretical gas transfer velocity k in m d 1 for ch4 kch4 diffusive was calculated on the basis of kco2 as follows 11 k c h 4 k c o 2 s c c h 4 s c c o 2 n where sc is the schmidt number and n is assigned a value of 1 2 for wind speeds of 3 6 m s 1 or 2 3 for wind speeds of 3 6 m s 1 to determine the chambers that captured ebullition and to prove our results we used k600 the calculated k values were converted to k600 values using equation 12 k 600 k 600 s c 0 5 ebullition made the calculated k600 much larger than the measured values in chambers in the same transect the k600 total which was attributed to total flux in each chamber was used to divided the k600 diffusive which was attributed to diffusive flux if k600 total k600 diffusive for a trial was 2 it was considered to have received ch4 from both diffusion and ebullition sawakuchi et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 2 3 data analysis all statistical analyses were performed using spss for windows version 18 0 spss inc chicago il usa the statistical significance was set to p 0 05 an independent sample t test was used to determine the differences in the partial pressures and ghg emissions amongst the various sites and seasons pearson correlation analysis was conducted to estimate the relationships between the pco2 pch4 ghg emissions and environmental variables 3 results 3 1 temporal and spatial variation of environmental variables and trophic states lake ulansuhai exhibited significant temporal variations in its biological and chemical properties figs 2 and 3 furthermore there were significant differences in mean value of ph do doc tn and no3 amongst the seven sites however there were no significant spatial variations in the mean water

decreased and then increased fig 3a and the highest tn concentrations occurred at s1 with annual mean values of 4 79 0 52 mg l 1 the nh4 n concentration fluctuated and the lowest concentration occurred at s5 in addition the variation in nh4 n was similar to that in tn except for the fact that high nh4 n concentrations appeared in s1 and s5 tp decreased at first and then increased and the highest concentrations occurred at s1 with annual mean values of 0 20 0 09 mg l 1 in contrast the dtp concentration exhibited an opposite variation trend fig 3e lake ulansuhai exhibited spatial and temporal variabilities in the trophic state the tli values ranged from 58 12 to 84 98 with a mean value of 73 12 thereby indicating hyper eutrophication of the lake fig 4 the tli fluctuated from s1 to s7 the highest trophic state occurred at s1 and the lowest occurred at s2 the trophic level of s5 was significantly higher than that of the adjacent s6 p 0 01 regarding the temporal patterns of the trophic states tli reached the medium eutrophic level in april mean value of 62 83 while the hypereutrophic level was attained in the other months january july and october all the spatially averaged tli values were in the hypereutrophic level for each sampling site 3 2 temporal and spatial variation of co2 and ch4 3 2 1 co2 the pco2 values varied from 267 μatm to 1657 μatm fig 5 a with an overall mean pco2 of 654 34 μatm the pco2 values at approximately 80 of the sampling sites were greater than that of the atmosphere 400 μatm thereby indicating co2 supersaturation in most of the lake area however under saturated values were observed in july at s2 s3 s5 and s6 and october at s2 and s3 in addition the pco2 values exhibited clear temporal variations amongst the four sampling months the mean pco2 values were higher in january and april while being lower in july 406 12 μatm and october 496 31 μatm the mean pco2 values in july and october were particularly close to that in the atmosphere 400 μatm especially in july the annual co2 emissions fluctuated from 26 3 2 6 mmol m 2 d 1 to 248 7 15 0 mmol m 2 d 1in all the four measurements with an overall mean of 35 7 12 1 mmol m 2

4 0 mmol m 2 d 1 in july and 4 3 5 6 mmol m 2 d 1 in october in july the co2 emissions at the four sites s2 s3 s5 and s6 were negative resulting in a carbon sink for lake ulansuhai in october negative co2 emissions were observed at s2 and s3 resulting in lower co2 emissions for the lake overall fig 5b the spatial distribution of pco2 and its relative spatial heterogeneity are displayed in fig 6 a and c the average pco2 value in each site amongst the four months ranged from 463 μatm to 764 μatm at s1 and s2 the pco2 was significantly lower than 400 μatm in july and october distinct spatial variations in co2 emissions are displayed in fig 6 high co2 emissions 68 7 15 0 mmol m 2 d 1 at s6 that were significantly greater than those of the other sites p 0 01 the lowest co2 emissions were observed at s2 2 1 3 6 mmol m 2 d 1 fig 7 c the pco2 and co2 emissions variations exhibited a similar trend from s1 to s4 while showing an opposite trend from s5 to s7 fig 6a and c the pco2 in lake ulansuhai is affected by various factors fig 9 the correlation analysis results demonstrated that pco2 was negatively correlated with the trophic state index r2 0 17 p 0 05 water temperature r2 0 31 p 0 01 ph r2 0 26 p 0 01 chl a r2 0 21 p 0 01 do r2 0 34 p 0 01 tp r2 0 13 p 0 01 and dtp r2 0 43 p 0 01 the results of the correlation analysis showed that pco2 was significantly positively correlated with tn r2 0 09 p 0 01 no3 n r2 0 20 p 0 01 and biomass r2 0 18 p 0 05 the k for co2 ranged from 0 2 m d 1 to 30 0 m d 1 3 6 0 7 m d 1 and showed obvious temporal and spatial variations for temporal variations the highest mean k value was observed in july 8 2 1 7 m d 1 and the lowest value was detected in april 1 0 0 7 m d 1 meanwhile spatial variations in the k value were the highest at s6 7 8 3 0 m d 1 and lowest at s4 1 7 0 5 m d 1 3 2 2 ch4 the pch4 values varied from 5 μatm to 1754 μatm with a mean value of 156 37 μatm as compared to the atmospheric equilibrium concentration of 1 85 μatm these values indicate the supersaturation of ch4 the mean pch4 value was highest in january 458 120 μatm and lowest in april 15 4 μatm fig 5c corresponding to the highest and lowest trophic states respectively fig 4 ch4 emissions varied from 0 1 mmol m 2 d 1 to 55 7 mmol m 2 d 1 with a grand mean of 5 9 2 9 mmol m 2 d 1 and a grand median of 1 2 mmol m 2 d 1 indicating that ch4 was continually emitted from lake ulansuhai into the atmosphere in all seasons seasonal variations in ch4 emissions were identified fig 5d with the largest ch4 emissions occurring in july and the lowest occurring in april the ch4 emissions in july accounted for 65 51 of the total emissions recorded during the four sampling months the average ch4 emissions in january were higher than those in april and october temporal variations in pch4 and ch4 emissions exhibited different trends fig 5c and d the highest pch4 was observed in january while the highest fch4 was observed in july significant spatial heterogeneity was recognised for the pch4 values fig 6b and d the pch4 values ranged from 6 to 1754 μatm with the lowest mean value of 20 3 μatm at s1 and the highest mean value of 456 33 μatm at s6 various factors affect pch4 in lake ulansuhai the data analysis revealed that pch4 was significantly positively correlated with trophic state index r2 0 18 p 0 05 nh4 r2 0 29 p 0 01 tp r2 0 2 p 0 01 cod r2 0 26 p 0 01 doc r2 0 26 p 0 01 dic r2 0 18 p 0 01 but significantly negatively with do r2 0 06 p 0 05 and ph r2 0 29 p 0 01 due to the temporal variability of trophic state and pch4 in lake ulansuhai the relationship between pch4 and trophic state was weakened especially in april fig 10a and c red dots ch4 emissions exhibited a tendency similar to that of pch4 fig 6b and d the highest and lowest fch4 values were recorded at s6 and s1 respectively a minor spatial variation in the fch4 values was observed in april ranging from 0 1 to 1 3 mmol m 2 d 1 ch4 emissions exhibited a tendency similar to that of pch4 in spatial variability both pch4 and fch4 at s6 were significantly higher than at the other sites p 0 05 in addition pch4 and fch4 at s1 inflow and s7 outflow were lower than at the other sites fig 6d the ebullition emissions sample catch bubbles only in july and the results exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity fig 7 the highest ebullition emissions occurred at s2 where pch4 was highest and no bubbles were captured at s1 and s5 near the inflow and channel where sediment dredging occurred the bubble ch4 emissions ranged from 0 to 0 49 mmol m 2 d 1 mean value 0 15 mmol m 2 d 1 which only accounted for 1 of the total emissions compared with k600 the results showed that ebullition could be captured only for 16 measurements of which 10 were conducted in july it is consistent with our measured results although indeed the chamber may also capture a certain portion of the bubbles especially in july when ebullition was higher 4 discussion 4 1 ghg partial pressures controls 4 1 1 co2 water environments affect the balance of aquatic co2 production and consumption pco2 exhibited spatial and temporal variations in lake ulansuhai suggesting that the co2 dynamics were affected by ambient parameters that also demonstrated spatial and temporal variations the correlation analysis results demonstrated that pco2 was negatively correlated with water temperature r2 0 31 p 0 01 and ph r2 0 26 p 0 01 fig 8 a and b which was similar to the results reported in previous studies wen et al 2016 yang et al 2019b pco2 was often controlled by temperature seekell and gudasz 2016 and ph marotta et al 2009 water temperature played a vital role in aquatic metabolism and gas solubility karlsson et al 2012 an increasing water temperature can enhance photosynthetic activity and increase carbon fixation reducing the co2 concentration engel et al 2019 liang et al 2017 additionally chl a and water temperature were significantly positively correlated r2 0 53 p 0 01 in lake ulansuhai fig s1 indicating that when the temperature was high algae grew more quickly and thereby increased amount of co2 was consumed furthermore pco2 was often controlled by ph in freshwater lakes when at ph 8 the concentrations of dissolved co2 were lower than that of hco3 and co3 2 in lake ulansuhai the mean ph was 8 therefore it was apparent that pco2 exhibits a negative relationship with ph finlay et al 2009 in addition the accumulation of free co2 produced via the decomposition of organic matter because of eutrophication could also decrease the ph in lake ulansuhai shallow eutrophic lakes with high primary production can stimulate the uptake of co2 from the atmosphere balmer and downing 2011 chl a is a proxy for lake system productivity delsontro et al 2018 the negative relationship between chl a and pco2 indicated a reduction in co2 in the productive lake in lake ulansuhai chl a was negatively related with pco2 fig 8c similar results were also found in a study on capitol lake usa yang et al 2019b and lake taihu xiao et al 2020 because pco2 levels are affected by aquatic productivity chl a can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton productivity in lakes lapierre et al 2017 increasing chl a concentrations can enhance photosynthesis and increase the water co2 absorbed by phytoplankton balmer and downing 2011 the strong negative correlation between pco2 and do concentration fig 8d in lake ulansuhai also supported the negative correlation between chl a and pco2 similar findings have been reported in other studies e g xiao et al 2020 yang et al 2019b nutrients were important factors affecting the pco2 level in aquatic ecosystems yang et al 2019b xiao et al 2021 the pco2 value increased with an increased nutrient supply tn and no3 n fig 8f and g which was similar to the results of previous studies davidson et al 2015 wen et al 2016 xiao et al 2020 the nutrient supply can regulate the ghg concentration in the water by enhancing primary production gu et al 2011 or promoting bacterial mineralisation larsen et al 2011 in eutrophic lakes when the rate of photosynthesis is higher than that of respiration less co2 is produced and emissions occur in inland lakes wen et al 2016 as demonstrated by the negative relationship between do and pco2 r2 0 34 p 0 01 fig 8d in lake ulansuhai photosynthesis caused the lake to be a weak source of co2 especially in july however the correlation analysis demonstrated that pco2 was negatively correlated with tp and dtp fig 8h and i similar results can also be found in other studies santoso et al 2017 trolle et al 2012 the availability of p promoted the primary production of phytoplankton reducing the co2 concentration in the water delsontro et al 2018 which can be explained by chl a at the community level tp was the optimum proxy for chl a vogt et al 2017 as there was a significant positive relationship between chl a and p tp and dtp r2 tp 0 03 p 0 05 r2 dtp 0 64 p 0 01 fig s2 the trophic state is a crucial factor affecting the pco2 level in aquatic ecosystems yang et al 2019b as the trophic state of lake ulansuhai was hypertrophic fig 4 pco2 decreased with an increase in the eutrophic status r2 0 17 p 0 05 fig 10a which was consistent with the results reported by pacheco et al 2014 and sepulveda jauregui et al 2015 lakes undergoing eutrophication can become carbon sinks of atmospheric co2 due to their massive primary production pacheco et al 2014 sepulveda jauregui et al 2018a trolle et al 2012 found a similar result in that co2 emissions from lakes recovering from eutrophication exhibited increasing trend the effect of external and autochthonous nutrients on co2 depends on the balance between respiration and primary production xiao et al 2020 in july with the highest trophic state and negative co2 emissions high primary production enhanced by chl a and dtp elevated the inorganic carbon conversion rate free co2 and bicarbonate to particulate organic matter balmer and downing 2011 converting the lake into a carbon sink nutrients in lakes can alter the co2 concentration by enhancing respiration or promoting primary production however the ultimate co2 concentration is determined by the balance between its production and consumption perga et al 2016 xiao et al 2020 the opposite result was found in previous studies as co2 emissions exhibited a positive correlation with the trophic state zhou et al 2020 and moderate eutrophication increased ghg emissions from lakes into the atmosphere delsontro et al 2018 this contradiction may due to the high density of phytoplankton in hyper eutrophic lakes where respiration is significantly higher than photosynthesis resulting in co2 emissions from lakes in contrast in lake ulansuhai higher chl a concentrations were found in july and october indicating higher productivity in these months that may have converted the lake from a source co2 to its sink 4 1 2 ch4 a positive relationship between water temperature and pch4 was observed in lake ulansuhai fig 9 a methanogenesis is strongly dependant upon temperature sepulveda jauregui et al 2018a and in eutrophic lakes methanogenesis is more sensitive to temperature than methanotrophy warmer temperatures can promote ch4 production leading to ch4 oversaturation in the water january was an exceptional month with higher ch4 concentrations which was likely due to the accumulation of ch4 under the ice similar finding has been reported in other study xiao et al 2021 wherein high ch4 concentration was observed in winter ch4 is primarily produced by methanogens which are sensitive to the lake ph the ph range of 6 to 8 is most suitable for methanogen growth and ch4 concentrations decrease at ph outside of this optimal range schrier uijl et al 2011 yang et al 2019a in lake ulansuhai the ph ranged from 7 to 10 hence ch4 concentration exhibited a negative correlation with ph fig 9b ferland et al 2012 read et al 2012 aerobic methanotrophy is a critical regulator of ch4 concentration in lakes sepulveda jauregui et al 2018b in lake ulansuhai the mean do was 8 774 mg l 1 which can provide oxygen for ch4 oxidation and the highest surface water do was observed at s1 corresponding to the lowest ch4 concentration fig 9c in lake ulansuhai a positive correlation between pch4 and cod was observed r2 0 26 p 0 01 fig 9d with an increase in cod the consumption of oxygen by organic matter in the water caused do to drop and ch4 oxidation was reduced benefiting ch4 production this result was consistent with that of el fadel and massoud 2001 in aquatic systems nutrient levels and biotic interactions have the potential to affect the production ghgs production and consumption of the biogeochemical processes davidson et al 2015 various nutrients affected the pch4 in lake ulansuhai fig 9e h the input of n and p in the shallow lake stimulated mineralisation and provided additional liable organic substrate which enhanced ch4 production xiao et al 2021 previous studies have demonstrated that ammonium ions can inhibit ch4 oxidation van der nat et al 1997 resulting in ch4 accumulation in the water which is supported by the positive correlation between nh4 n and pch4 identified in our study the doc concentration in the lake reflects the distinct ecological functions that affect the processes governing ch4 cycling cunada et al 2018 doc can provide carbon substrate for methanogenesis to enhance ch4 production thereby increasing ch4 concentration rodriguez et al 2018 in contrast to co2 eutrophication increases ch4 emissions in this study we found that the tli was positively correlated with pch4 r2 0 18 p 0 05 fig 10 b which was consistent with the results of previous studies beaulieu et al 2019 delsontro et al 2018 sepulveda jauregui et al 2018a the lakes rich in nutrients provide substantial amounts of labile organic matter from primary production that can be readily transformed into ch4 precursors promoting ch4 emissions into the atmosphere davidson et al 2018 west et al 2016 pch4 was positively correlated with nutrients in our study fig 9e h in a laboratory incubation study of water and sediment from lakes of various trophic states it was found that eutrophic lakes exhibited higher temperature sensitivity than oligotrophic lakes leading to greater ch4 emissions sepulveda jauregui et al 2018a similarly in lake ulansuhai at s6 the tli was higher and the ch4 concentration was the highest figs 4 and 6b and d than other sites shallow eutrophic lakes are typically beneficial to the growth of submerged vegetation which can provide abundant amount of substrate to stimulate ch4 production in the sediment xiao et al 2017 at s1 although it exhibited a high trophic state the carbon content doc fig 2i was the lowest leading to lower ch4 concentrations furthermore the highest and lowest trophic states occurred in january and april which corresponded with the highest and lowest ch4 concentrations respectively 4 2 ghg emissions controls 4 2 1 co2 in lake ulansuhai high pco2 resulted in high co2 emissions which was the dominant variable influencing co2 flux natchimuthu et al 2017 and driving co2 exchange between lakes and the atmosphere pacheco et al 2014 the level of pco2 affected the exchange rate and thus the emissions in addition wind speed was a critical factor affecting ghg emissions from the air water interface which can cause algae to float in the water and accelerate pco2 consumption in water huttunen et al 2002 zhao et al 2017 resulting in lower co2 emissions differing from normal cases where wind enhanced the emissions yang et al 2018 furthermore with an increase in the water depth co2 emissions reduced probably owing to changes in ph zagarese et al 2021 which was also affected by depth fig s3 co2 emissions showed significant temporal and spatial variations in lake ulansuhai in july the lake was a co2 sink mainly due to increased primary productivity pacheco et al 2014 in january the lake was a great emission source accounting for 75 8 of the total month emissions recorded during the sampling months 75 8 hence emissions during january should not be ignored in the annual carbon budget this may be due to removal of the ice from the lake surface regarding spatial variations co2 emissions were extremely different at s2 2 1 3 6 mmol m 2 d 1 and s4 68 7 15 0 mmol m 2 d 1 the correlation analysis results showed that fco2 was significantly negatively correlated with pco2 r2 0 15 p 0 01 wind speed r2 0 08 p 0 01 and water depth r2 0 13 p 0 01 fig 11 a b however no significant relationship was found between k and wind speed p 0 05 wind speed could affect the gas exchange at the water air interface alin et al 2011 in our studied lake no significant correlation pearson correlation p 0 05 was found between wind speed and k this could be explained by lower wind speed mean speed 1 86 0 15 m s 1 which was weak and thus unable to cause turbulence guérin et al 2007 4 2 2 ch4 pch4 was a primary factor influencing ch4 emissions ch4 emissions exhibited weak correlations with pch4 and wind speed fig 11d and e the weak relations were primarily due to the higher emissions in july and the accumulation of ch4 in the water under ice in january ch4 emissions were affected by lake ulansuhai water depth r2 0 10 p 0 01 fig 11f in shallow lakes turbulence caused by wind is a recognised driver of ch4 emissions across the lake water interface wanninkhof et al 1985 which can facilitate the release of ch4 from water gu et al 2004 additionally do affected pch4 fig 9c sepulveda jauregui et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 yang and tong 2015 which was also influenced by wind this complex relationship weakened the effect of wind speed on ch4 emissions water depth can influence ghg dynamics by affecting water column mixing anoxic state of the volume fraction and sediment carbon accumulation ferland et al 2012 read et al 2012 low water levels lead to lower water hydrostatic pressure and shorter transport pathways for gases delsontro et al 2011 reducing ch4 oxidation and leading to rapid ch4 emissions into the atmosphere holgerson and raymond 2016 li et al 2020 seasonal and spatial patterns of ch4 emissions showed significant variations amongst the four months and the seven sites similar to other productive lakes zhang et al 2021 loken et al 2019 the significant temporal variations of ch4 emissions were mainly due to the seasonal variations in the trophic states and ambient factors natchimuthu et al 2016 loken et al 2019 such as water temperature xiao et al 2017 ch4 emissions in july accounted for 65 5 of their total over the four months water depth can affect ch4 concentrations and fluxes natchimuthu et al 2016 li et al 2020 which was also found to be the case for lake ulansuhai fig 11f previous studies have indicated that inflowing streams usually have lower ch4 concentrations s1 adjacent to the inlet had the lowest ch4 concentrations and only 1 1 of the total emissions amongst the seven sites in addition the carbon substrate for ch4 production xiao et al 2017 and the trophic state also effected the ch4 spatial pattern s5 with higher doc and trophic state level had the largest ch4 emissions amongst all the studied sites ch4 ebullition in lake ulansuhai only accounted for a small fraction of the total ch4 emissions and was lower than those reported in other studies wik et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 the studied lake had a higher abundance of submerged macrophytes which could transport oxygen to the root zone sorrell et al 2002 sorrell and downes 2004 xing et al 2005 and the rich vegetation could prevent bubbles from escaping the water these characteristics could support methanotrophs and other organisms that consume ch4 energy input to sediments and pressure also affected bubbling wik et al 2014 mattson and likens 1990 ch4 ebullition from lake sediment could be enhanced exponentially when temperature was above a threshold of 15 van bergen et al 2019 the mean water temperatures in april and october were 13 8 and 15 0 this might have been a major factor for inhibiting the bubbling in addition the higher ch4 pressures in april and october could also result in reduced bubbling furthermore due to the high spatiotemporal variability and stochastic nature of ebullition maher et al 2019 capturing ch4 bubbles was difficult using a few chambers this might increase the uncertainty in the results obtained 4 3 comparison with other eutrophic lakes various studies on lakes at the global regional and local scales have typically reported co2 supersaturation junger et al 2019 raymond et al 2013 wen et al 2016 the mean pco2 values of lake ulansuhai were similar to those of the guadalcacín reservoir mesotrophic and lower than those of lake taihu eutrophic morales pineda et al 2014 xiao et al 2020 but higher than those of lake mendota eutrophic and lake okaro eutrophic loken et al 2019 santoso et al 2020 with its low trophic state the guadalcacín reservoir exhibited low productivity resulting in co2 accumulation in the water consequently the pco2 value for the guadalcacín reservoir was similar to that of our results eutrophic lakes typically exhibit co2 undersaturation however lake taihu eutrophic is co2 supersaturated due to the high external carbon and other nutrient inputs xiao et al 2020 the mean co2 emissions in lake ulansuhai were higher than those in reports for other lakes at lower trophic states table 1 co2 emissions from lakes are associated with different morphometric characteristics and environmental factors wang et al 2017 as a shallow lake lake ulansuhai is vulnerable to wind and water temperatures resulting in fco2 variations furthermore the mean temperature of lake ulansuhai was lower than that of the above mentioned lakes certain studies only focused on summer emissions that corresponded to the highest productivity which may have led to greater co2 uptake results being observed for the studied lakes engel et al 2019 the results obtained from the study on lake ulansuhai imply that hypereutrophic lakes tend to exhibit higher ch4 concentrations and emissions than oligotrophic mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes table 1 eutrophication promotes high algal and macrophyte vegetation biomasses in water systems that may enrich the sediments with autochthonous carbon substrates which are then more labile and readily converted to ch4 west et al 2012 eutrophication induced algal increase not only enhances autochthonous production that fuels ch4 production but also increases oxygen consumption that suppresses ch4 oxidation huttunen et al 2003 high ch4 concentrations in biguás lake a shallow eutrophic lake with an area of approximately 0 015 km2 were identified and higher ch4 emissions from small lakes have also been reported by holgerson and raymond 2016 ch4 emissions in lake ulansuhai were similar to those observed by beaulieu et al 2019 as they simulated the eutrophication of lentic waters under scenarios of future nutrient loading to inland waters to demonstrate that the enhanced eutrophication of lakes and impoundments is projected to substantially increases ch4 emissions from these systems 30 90 over the next century we calculated global warming potential gwp to compare the potential climate impact of emissions of different greenhouse gases the gwp of atmospheric ch4 has been reported to be 34 fold stronger than that of atmospheric co2 over 100 years stocker et al 2013 in terms of co2 equivalents co2 eq co2 and ch4 emissions from lake ulansuhai were 573 3 and 1178 2 g c co2 eq m 2 year 1 respectively ch4 was the most important contributor to the gwp of the lake ch4 gwp was more than double the co2 gwp eutrophication plays a diverging role in co2 and ch4 emissions lapierre and del giorgio 2012 because it changes o2 and substrate availability in lakes and regulates primary production methanogenesis methanotrophy and respiration pacheco et al 2014 sepulveda jauregui et al 2018a the availability of nutrients and autochthonous primary production were the key regulators influencing inland lake ch4 cycling bastviken et al 2004 west et al 2016 enhanced eutrophication increases ch4 emissions from lakes beaulieu et al 2019 but decreases co2 emissions trolle et al 2012 the gwp of lake ulansuhai was larger than that of the eutrophic mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes loken et al 2019 yang et al 2015 van bergen et al 2019 xing et al 2005 huttunen et al 2003 table 2 which was mainly due to increased ch4 emissions by eutrophication in lake ulansuahi eutrophication increased the contribution of ch4 to the gwp but decreased the contribution of co2 similar results were demonstrated by bartosiewicz et al 2016 5 conclusions in this study we investigated ghg co2 and ch4 emissions and environmental parameters in lake ulansuhai from january 2019 to october 2019 by conducting trimestral sampling campaigns this study explored the dynamics of co2 and ch4 in a hypereutrophic lake demonstrating large spatial and temporal variations in the partial pressures and emissions of co2 and ch4 our results indicate that the lake is a source of co2 but a stronger source of ch4 and that an increase in the trophic state e g from eutrophic to hypereutrophic significantly decreases co2 emissions but increases ch4 emissions we found that abundant nutrients enhanced primary productivity consuming additional co2 and providing substrates for ch4 production the results of our study indicate that shallow eutrophic lakes in arid regions exhibit a high potential with respect to the release ghgs into the atmosphere and that eutrophication can change the ghg emission pattern of lakes when the trophic state increased co2 emissions were weakened or the lake even converted to a sink of co2 but ch4 emissions were reinforced such dynamics of carbon causing reduced co2 emissions but increased ch4 emissions complicate the carbon budget calculation to improve the accuracy of regional to large scale estimations of ghg emissions and carbon budgets of aquatic ecosystems further research on eutrophic lakes should be conducted our findings also suggest that carbon emissions should be considered for the management of the water environment in eutrophic lakes credit

16886,sustainable seawater brine treatment demands an essential paradigm shift for effective recovery of resources and high value utilization of mixed salts here a novel hybrid electrodialysis ed system was proposed that integrated an innovative hybrid selective ed hsed and a developed selective bipolar membrane ed sbmed the hsed process allowed simultaneous recovery of major divalent cations and anions from seawater brine when nacl was selectively enriched then the impure nacl rich stream was fed directly into the sbmed process for acid base preparation without any purification pretreatment detailed analysis of the hsed process showed that increasing unit voltage from 2 33 v to 2 67 v would improve the removal ratio of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 from 54 7 41 4 and 13 3 to 78 9 76 6 and 32 1 respectively in addition the increment of initial concentration of product streams promoted the transport of various ions from the feed and middle compartments the fine utilization performance in terms of ionic removal ratio and fractionation ratio of divalent ions in the hsed process was more limited by the initial concentration of product streams furthermore the sbmed stack was found to have nearly identical performance over five cycles indicating that the presence of a trace amount of hardness cations did not induce scaling the current study thus provided a novel suitable strategy with a perspective of fine utilization for practical applications in sustainable disposal of seawater brine graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hybrid selective electrodialysis hsed selective bipolar membrane electrodialysis sbmed seawater brine sustainable disposal fine utilization 1 introduction freshwater scarcity is one of the world s most critical challenges of our time and a series of major concerns have been emerging including slowing economy polluted water and unhealthy ecosystems hoekstra 2014 tong and elimelech 2016 vorosmarty et al 2010 in such scenarios seawater desalination has become a priority technology for replenishing freshwater resources to date seawater desalination accounts for more than sixty percent of globally produced freshwater kress et al 2020 although this process could provide substantial amounts of freshwater it produces vast quantities of seawater brine which contains mixed salts with highly concentration elimelech and phillip 2011 zhao et al 2018b the mixed salts in seawater brine mainly consists of sodium chloride and many common scale forming species such as ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 et al chen et al 2019b if inadequately treated the brine discharge into an aquatic environment particularly in closed or semi closed seawaters can cause many adverse impacts on aquatic ecosystems jiang et al 2014 meanwhile direct seawater brine discharge also represents to a waste of chemical resources because brine contains nearly twice as much salt as natural seawater chen et al 2019a du et al 2018 therefore recovery and recycling of seawater brine has become a growing trend in the past few years according to the concepts of zero liquid discharge and sustainable development bindels et al 2020 choi et al 2020 kumar et al 2019a in most closed or semi closed seas such as bohai sea in china a more broadly strategy for seawater brine management is to alleviate the negative effects of mixed salts on the ecological environment and balance the inputs and outputs of seawater brine reclamation particularly in china the discharge of seawater brine into the bohai sea has been strictly restricted therefore in some specific sea areas the utilization or treatment of brine must be performed better utilization of seawater brine would have a positive impact on the rational use of chemical resources and the environmental footprint of seawater desalination comprehensive utilization of seawater brine not only minimizes the volume and environmental risk of resulting discharge but also alleviates pressure on ecosystems resulting from seawater desalination elsaid et al 2012 one pathway toward sensible goals is to convert the otherwise to be discharged seawater brine into useful chemicals to date many technologies have been developed for salt recovery which can be classified into thermal and membrane processes a thermal based concentrator as well as crystallizer is supported by phase change such as mechanical vapor compression mvc and multistage flash msf which use high energy to vaporize water from brine and leave mixed salts as solids al amshawee et al 2020 panagopoulos et al 2019 a membrane based concentrator which is a non phase change process can be considered as a high efficient brine pre concentration technology such processes include reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf and representative of the electro driven membrane process electrodialysis ed al amshawee et al 2020 casas et al 2012 liu et al 2016 nayar et al 2019 ed allows for ion transport through charge selective ion exchange membranes and is more suitable for brine preconcentration tanaka 2011 however the complexity of ionic composition in brine and its higher salinity produces a series of important issues in brine utilization such as energy consumption control scaling and separation of impurity salts which remain to be resolved chen et al 2019b lin et al 2020 mavukkandy et al 2019 tong and elimelech 2016 zhang et al 2015 until now the fine separation and purification of various ions has received little attention compared with reports of efficient pre concentration processes undeniably major developments of selective electrodialysis sed have been reported in recent years extending ed applications far beyond simple desalting and concentrating of saline water ahdab et al 2020 chen et al 2018b ye et al 2019 zhang et al 2017a zhang et al 2013 with the use of monovalent permselective cation and anion exchange membranes sed can accomplish selective separation and concentration of monovalent salts against divalent salts in nacl solutions yet it cannot further solve the extraction and utilization of divalent ions that are trapped in a dilute compartment as a result although the desalting stream in sed is below the salinity of seawater and can be discharged or returned to raw seawater for the seawater desalination process the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 which are trapped in the dilute compartment are still higher than that of seawater to be specific given its low salt content this desalting stream can be recommended for discharge directly into the ocean wang et al 2020 however it is not known whether the fact that divalent ions in the desalting stream which are more concentrated than those in seawater has an unfavorable impact on the marine ecological environment in another sense starting from sustainable development and zero brine discharge concepts of the whole industry of seawater desalination and comprehensive utilization the desalting stream is best introduced into the seawater desalination system to enhance the water recovery of the overall system and to improve the feed water quality for desalination chen et al 2019a however if the desalting stream is returned to the seawater desalination process it still would have a negative effect as such a mixture would increase the concentration ratio of divalent to monovalent salts changing the ionic composition of raw seawater and thus increasing scaling risk in desalination equipment nevertheless there has been little attention and few reports on such issues another pathway toward the goals of resource recovery is to convert seawater brine to high value chemicals such as transforming brine into caustic soda naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl using bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed fernandez gonzalez et al 2016 kumar et al 2019b lin et al 2015 yang et al 2014 in this manner high value utilization of seawater brine can be realized and economic benefits improved acids produced by the bmed process can be used to meet the demand for acidic solutions in seawater desalination pretreatment and to overcome the difficulty of transporting hydrochloric acid thus desalination plants can also save money and reduce their environmental impact by recovering hcl and naoh from brine also acids can be used as a necessary raw material for the secondary industry of seawater brine comprehensive utilization such as in the acidification process of bromine extraction acid produced by bmed could be used to provide some of the acid needed to extract bromine from seawater brine which has clear economic benefits to produce hcl and naoh seawater brine which contains high concentrations of hardness ions ca2 mg2 should first be pretreated using a chemical precipitation approach zhang et al 2019 other emerging softening technologies such as special ion exchange fractionating nanofiltration f nf or sed are more efficient in the brine softening process liu et al 2016 reig et al 2016 zhang et al 2017b zhang et al 2019 however these technologies still need to be integrated with chemical precipitation because of very strict hardness restrictions for inlet solutions for bmed liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017b typically to prevent scaling such as by mg oh 2 and provide a feed with the required purity for bmed system a subsequent chemical precipitation step should be applied after nf or sed pretreatments reig et al 2016 semblante et al 2018 except in the form of the external integrations above some researchers have proposed an internal integration of bmed and sed using monovalent selective ion exchange membranes to replace conventional ion exchange membranes in bmed stacks chen et al 2018a qiu et al 2019 the results have shown that with an appropriate treatment of concentrated industrial brines containing certain hardness ion concentrations reutilization of the brines might be achieved by using the single step however many studies have indicated that increased divalent ion concentration in feed solution could promote divalent ions to leak through the monovalent selective ion exchange membrane chen et al 2018a nie et al 2017 therefore compared to the influent quality lower concentration of ca2 and mg2 ions reported in the literature using seawater brine as the feed stream for sbmed directly would enhance the scaling tendency of alkali compartment in an sbmed stack thus the feasibility of its direct application needs to be reassessed because higher hardness ion concentrations in seawater brine increases the leakage risk of mg2 or ca2 in this study with the purpose of fostering the fine utilization of mixed salts in seawater brine a novel hybrid electrodialysis system was designed and presented by considering an innovation of a typical sed stack configuration and integrating it with a developmental sbmed the effects of applied voltage and initial nacl concentration in middle compartments on the transport and fractionation properties of monovalent and divalent ions in the hsed system were examined then the sbmed process for acid and base production from nacl rich solution obtained from hsed was investigated and the role of applied voltage as well as stable operation evaluated finally the salt transfer performance of the novel hybrid ed system for fine utilization of mixed salts in seawater brine was discussed the goal of this study was to provide prospects and guidance for technical improvements in the fine utilization process of seawater brine the specific objectives of the current study were a analysis of the influence of typical parameters on fine separation of mixed ions in hsed process using simulated seawater brine and b optimization and integration of the hsed and sbmed processes 2 construction of the novel hybrid electrodialysis system the innovation of membrane stack configuration and the system integration of emerging electro membrane processes could be provided strategies to the potential problems for conventional electro membrane process of seawater brine structurally monovalent selective cation exchange membranes sc and monovalent selective anion exchange membranes sa are placed alternately in a conventional sed stack so the monovalent cations na migrate through sc with negative fixed groups and are retained by the sa with positive active groups and the divalent cations ca2 mg2 are blocked by sc and stranded in dilute compartment similar migration characteristics exist for monovalent and divalent anions in sed stack this migration process causes an increase of monovalent ion concentration in concentrate cells and a decrease in the dilute cells differs from this structure a novel sed configuration could be formed by involving a specific arrangement of conventional and selective ion exchange membranes hybrid selective electrodialysis hsed to simultaneously fine fractionate nacl enrichment and na and cl type high solubility liquid salts hsls from seawater brine as shown in fig 1 specifically the cationic species in the na type hsls is only na while the anion species in the cl type hsls is only cl all of these belong to high solubility salt solution so as to avoid the potential scaling problem caso4 etc in ed process more importantly the hsed method can fractionate these ions in mixed salts into different streams and provide a technical path the fine utilization of mixed salts from seawater brine in this investigation based on the structural features of the innovative hsed and the developmental sbmed a novel hybrid electrodialysis system for sustainable disposal of seawater brine was proposed a schematic diagram of the novel electro driven membrane hybrid system is shown in fig 2 first hsed was used to fractionate the monovalent and divalent ions in the seawater brine subsequently the nacl rich stream in this system was further reused to produce hcl and naoh in one step using bmed with monovalent selective ion exchange membranes sbmed the na type hsls can be continuously reconcentrated without any risk of scaling and fed into a partial crystallization process to gradually separate nacl and na2so4 also after conversion and concentration during the hsed process cl type hsls can be used for removal of inorganic phosphate species during wastewater treatment via the precipitation of struvite mg phosphate jin et al 2018 lahav et al 2013 shaddel et al 2020 hydroxyapatite ca phosphate hermassi et al 2015a and farringtonite mg ca phosphate hermassi et al 2015b reig et al 2016 this latter process had the potential to produce new phosphorous resources for slow release fertilizer production besides the source of pure nacl for the two middle compartments can be provided by a portion of nacl rich stream produced from the hsed system after simple softening treatment such as ion exchange as its concentrations of divalent ions are very low when the concentration of various ions in the two dilute streams was lower than that of the corresponding ions in seawater the depleted brine streams from hsed and sbmed processes could also be recycled into the seawater desalination unit without any pretreatment therefore this novel hsed sbmed hybrid system possessed the following characteristics 1 simultaneous recovery of divalent ions from seawater brine when nacl was selectively enriched 2 providing a high salinity nacl stream with lower hardness for sbmed processing and omitting a routine softening pretreatment step and 3 retaining lower ionic concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in the dilute streams from hsed and sbmed and recycling the dilute streams to the seawater desalination plant 3 materials and methods 3 1 experimental strategies materials and apparatuses selective fractionation of charged ions has been studied using conventional sed in various studies but few have focused on the reutilization of divalent ions that are retained in the dilute cell of an sed stack casas et al 2012 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2020 the comprehensive utilization of seawater brine includes not only the recovery of inorganic salts but also the recycling of desalted water here from the configuration characteristics of an hsed stack nacl as well as major divalent cations and anions were obtained from different compartments in the stack the design of the hsed fractionating unit is shown in fig 3 a involving a stack with three repeating units monovalent selective cation exchange membrane sc monovalent selective anion exchange membrane sa conventional anion exchange membrane a and conventional cation exchange membrane c an hsed stack was applied to fractionate divalent cations and anions in cl and na type salt compartments respectively and to concentrate nacl rich stream in the product compartment fig 3a in principle when the anode and cathode plates of hsed stack were connected with a direct current dc stabilized voltage supply oxidation reduction reactions occurred at the interface between the anode cathode plate and the electrolyte and then a dc electric field formed in the stack to promote directional ion migration to be specific cations na mg2 and ca2 first transferred from the dilute seawater brine through the c membrane and entered the cl type hsls compartment then monovalent cations na transferred from the cl type hsls through the sc membrane and entered the nacl rich compartment while divalent cations mg2 and ca2 mostly remained in the cl type hsls on the other side anions cl and so4 2 first transferred from the dilute through the a membrane and entered the na type hsls compartment which had ionic transfer behaviors including monovalent anion cl transfer from the na type hsls compartment through the sa membrane and into the nacl rich compartment divalent anion so4 2 mostly remained in the na type hsls notably the role of nacl solution added in the two intermediate compartments na and cl type hsls was to provide migration replaced ions na or cl to replace transported divalent ions furthermore the nacl rich stream which contained lower hardness was then transported to the sbmed stack the design of the sbmed reutilization unit is shown in fig 3b including a stack with three repeating units bipolar membrane bpm monovalent selective anion exchange membrane sa and monovalent selective cation exchange membrane sc an sbmed stack was applied to produce hcl and naoh in one step without any softening process the boundary dimensions of both the hsed and sbmed stacks were 30 10 cm with each membrane having an effective size of 23 8 7 0 cm such that the active surface area was 158 cm2 the spacer channel width between two adjacent membranes was 0 9 mm three pairs of repeating units were used in hsed and sbmed stacks with all membranes manufactured by astom corp tokyo japan the characteristic properties of these membranes are listed in table s1 the positive and negative electrode plates for both hsed and sbmed are made of titanium coated ruthenium a direct current power supply jp3020d wuxi ans electronic technology co ltd china was used to maintain constant applied voltage during experiments the major ionic compositions and initial volumes of each solution in hsed sbmed experiments are shown in table s2 meanwhile the hco3 with low concentration 0 15 0 31 g l liu et al 2016 in seawater brine was not considered since it can be eliminated by introducing the acid produced with bmed prior to the hsed or even prior to the seawater desalination a 1 l portion of 3 wt na2so4 was used as the electrolyte solution in all experiments all salts in synthetic seawater brine and initial saline water were analytical grade the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 were tested by edta titration method gb t 15452 2009 chen et al 2018a cl was analyzed by silver nitrate titration astm d512 89 1999 chen et al 2018 tanaka et al 2015 so4 2 was determined by ion chromatography thermo dionex ics 5000 usa in which each sample was diluted to meet the requirement of sample concentration chen et al 2019a finally na was determined by electrically balancing solution ions using eq s1 liu et al 2016 tanaka et al 2015 the concentration of tds was therefore obtained using the eq s2 in addition the resulting concentration of naoh produced by the sbmed process was determined by titration with 0 01 mol l hcl standard solution and the concentration of hcl produced by the sbmed process was determined by titration with 0 01 mol l naoh standard solution ye et al 2015 1 c n a c c l 35 5 c s o 4 2 96 2 c c a 2 40 2 c m

sbmed were 15 l h which corresponded to a surface flow velocity of 1 65 cm s the electrolyte both anolyte and catholyte flow rates were maintained at 5 l h samples of 15 ml were taken from each tank every half hour all experiments were performed at room temperature 20 25 c other specific operating conditions of optimization of hsed and sbmed process parameters were as follows a novel hsed system was first developed for fine separation of mixed salts the feed brine na and cl type salt and nacl rich tanks were initially filled with seawater brine and nacl solution fig 3a with ion compositions of brine sources shown in table s2 in an electro membrane process the operating voltage is the indirect driving force of ionic transfer therefore the discussion of the effects of operating voltage on the ion transfer is vital for understanding both the hsed and sbmed processes in addition the initial concentration of nacl make up solutions in the hsed process is directly related to the solution resistance in the hsed membrane stack which affects the current density and driving force for ion migration so the influence of initial concentrations of nacl make up solutions is also an important parameter in hsed process thus the roles of applied voltage per repeating unit 2 33 2 67 and 3 00 v were investigated and the effects of initial nacl concentration of the nacl solution 11 7 20 5 and 29 3 g l on the performance of the seawater brine hsed process meanwhile ionic composition of the product stream nacl rich under optimal conditions was assessed and treated as the feed solution of sbmed two part experiments were performed in sbmed operations for preparation of acid and base products from an nacl rich source the effects of applied voltage per repeating unit 3 00 3 33 and 3 67 v on the preparation of acid and base components from nacl rich by sbmed were first investigated then the stability of sbmed operation was evaluated at optimized applied voltage it should be noted that the range of the above parameter values was selected based on the pre experiments other specific operating conditions of the corresponding experiments were illustrated in the discussion of each part of this study 3 3 data acquisition and analysis 3 3 1 flux of nacl the nacl flux fnacl from feed solution was determined using eq 3 which has been described by zhao et al 2018a 3 f n a c l g m 2 m i n

and discussion 4 1 hsed for fine fractionation of mixed salts from seawater brine different ions possess different permeation capabilities in ed process due to the effects of electric double layer and steric hindrance on the ion exchange membrane nie et al 2017 many investigations also indicating that these capabilities are especially influenced by the operating conditions of ed process such as applied voltage and ion concentrations casademont et al 2008 li et al 2016 in this section a more in depth parameter research was performed to gain a better understanding of the ionic fractionation from seawater brine during the hsed process 4 1 1 role of voltage per repeating unit to reveal the contribution of voltage per repeating unit in the seawater brine hsed process experiments were performed at different voltages per repeating unit from 2 33 to 3 00 v for electrochemical properties examination of the role of voltage on current density and stack resistance variation across the hsed stack showed that current density at higher voltage 2 67 and 3 00 v was clearly greater than that at lower voltage 2 33 v fig s1 this suggested that there was a powerful driving force of ionic transfer with a higher applied voltage this was mainly because that increasing applied voltage augmented the electric field intensity and resultant driving force for ion migration masigol et al 2012 however although the current density at 3 00 v was a little higher than that at 2 67 v the electrical resistance of the stack at 2 67 v was relatively smaller moreover the current density and stack resistance changed only a little with time at the lower applied voltage 2 33 v which was due to there being enough ions in the feed compartment for higher voltage conditions as the hsed process continued a growing number of ions from the feed solution transferred into the nacl rich na type and cl type hsls compartments which then lead to enhancement of feed solution resistance thus the stack electrical resistance rapidly ascended at later times in these experiments the main reason for this result is the enhanced difference in ionic concentration between the dilute and nacl rich compartments which resulted in significant increment of solution resistance in seawater brine compartment and a prominent reduction of the ionic transfer rate examination of the role of voltage per repeating unit on the separation performance of seawater brine hsed process showed that the slopes of tds lines with higher voltage were greater which indicated an excellent salt removal rate fig 4 tds declines in the feed compartment were observed to be coupled with the voltage increment with higher voltages forcing ions to transfer faster through ion exchange membranes which resulted in linear and quicker salt removal rates furthermore the tds change in the two middle brine compartments was not significant which suggested that the original nacl could be provided migration replaced ions na or cl to replace transported divalent ions ca2 mg2 or so4 2 observations of the variation in concentration of various ions in the na type hsls compartment showed that the sodium ion concentration at the three voltages changed little versus operating time fig 5 a and b however the cl concentration decreased gradually while so4 2 gradually increased the degree of anionic concentration variation at higher voltage was also observed to be significantly higher than at 2 33 v indicating that the cell voltage should be 2 67 v to capture more so4 2 fig 5 moreover the changes of various ion concentration in the cl type hsls compartment showed that the na concentration at the three voltages decreased gradually versus operating time while the concentration of ca2 and mg2 increased gradually in varying degrees fig 6 however the cl concentration did not show clear changes during the operating time from the view point of achieving ca2 and mg2 enrichment as much as possible and higher efficiency of electricity utilization the voltage per repeating unit was considered to be best at 2 67 v in short the above analysis of ionic transfer in the two middle brine compartments visibly illustrated the following facts 1 in the na type hsls compartment the displacement original cl for so4 2 which coming from the dilute and 2 in the cl type hsls compartment displacement original na for ca2 and mg2 which coming from the dilute in fact the applied voltage not only played a positive role on divalent ion enhancement in the two middle brine compartments but it also contributed to the concentration of monovalent salts in the nacl rich compartment the removal ratio of divalent ions was also examined as the fractionation ratio of each divalent ion and the flux as well as purity of nacl in rich solution in later experimental periods 120 min at different voltages fig 4d f the removal ratio of divalent ions was clearly seen to be positively correlated with applied voltage which was consistent with the previous researches chen et al 2018b jiang et al 2014 ye et al 2019 but the ionic fractionation ratio of divalent ions was not notably sensitive to applied voltage this phenomenon indicated that voltage had a positive influence on divalent ion removal from the dilute but did not have a negative effect on the removal ratio between divalent and monovalent ions from the middle compartments to nacl rich compartment this was further confirmed by the observation that voltage enhancement promoted increased nacl flux while not clearly affecting nacl purity in the product solution as shown in fig s2 the separation efficiencies of monovalent and divalent ions were calculated for the interval between start and 120 min for the hsed process at different voltages per repeating unit as mentioned in section 3 1 a more positive value means that the ion b is transported slower thus that it is more retained in na type and cl type hsls compartments it is noted that the monovalent selective ion exchange membranes give higher positive values for the selectivities of na ca2 na mg2 and cl so4 2 fig s2 which is meaning that the divalent ions were more retained in na type or cl type hsls compartments the selectivity is explained by the presence of a permselective layer on the monovalent selective ion exchange membrane and mainly based on two principles steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion zhang et al 2009 chen et al 2018a it also can be seen that the s b a values of na ca2 na mg2 and cl so4 2 increased in varying degrees with the increasing of voltage specially the selectivities are not significantly improved when the voltage was increased from 2 67 v to 3 00 v 4 1 2 role of initial salt concentration of product streams in the hsed process the displacement of monovalent ions na and cl for divalent ions ca2 mg2 and so4 2 could be achieved in na type and cl type hsls compartments due to the monovalent ion selective transfer characteristics of monovalent selective ion exchange membranes and the effects of initial nacl concentration in the product streams are of great importance to evaluate the performance of displacement monovalent ions for divalent ions in na type and cl type hsls compartments the role of initial salt concentration of the product compartment was further investigated by plotting the tds in the feed compartment as a function of operating time fig 7 for this compartment tds curves at all initial salt concentrations decreased linearly with time at a fixed composition and feed solution concentration seawater brine increasing the initial nacl concentration of the product from 11 7 to 29 3 g l resulted in a clear enhancement of salt transport 50 within 180 min this enhancement was mainly attributed to decreased electrical resistance of solutions in these compartments 5 ω of stack resistance at 11 7 g l to 2 6 ω of stack resistance at 29 3 g l fig s3 at the same time the tds in na and cl type hsls remained approximately constant with time as the inherent univalent ions of the two compartments displaced divalent ions that had migrated into them and then migrated to the nacl rich compartment fig 7b in particular compared with the tds in the na type hsls compartment tds curves in the cl type hsls compartment clearly decreased versus time this was mainly due to the superior transport of ca2 and mg2 compared with so4 2 in the ed process fig 7d and therefore resulted in the equivalent of na being replaced in the cl type hsls being greater than the equivalent of cl being replaced in the na type hsls also the enhancement of the product solution s initial concentration was conducive to improved nacl migration from the dilute compartment to the nacl rich compartment fig 7c for example during 180 min of operating time tds of the product solution from the three initial concentration conditions increased from 11 7 20 5 and 29 3 g l to 58 3 73 8 and 94 8 g l respectively in addition the separation efficiencies of monovalent and divalent ions for the hsed process at different initial concentrations of nacl as shown in fig s4 as expected the na ca2 na mg2 and cl so4 2 selectivities have become less positive in the 11 7 g l nacl experiment because of the higher unwanted ca2 mg2 and so4 2 transport through the monovalent selective ion exchange membrane towards the nacl rich compartment at the same time when the initial concentration of nacl increased to 20 5 g l the na ca2 na mg2 and cl so4 2 selectivities were improved positively this is because of the reduction of the competitive migration of divalent ions by the appropriate addition of sodium and chloride ions however the s b a values of na ca2 and na mg2 let up with further adding nacl to product solutions which should be caused by the increment of competitive action of calcium ion and magnesium ion this is mainly due to a significant increase in operating current resulting from an obvious reduction in the solution resistance as shown in fig s3 and it then enhance the migration driving force of calcium and magnesium ions taken together an appropriate increase in initial concentration was concluded to be beneficial to both the migration of various ions and the fractionation of divalent ions between the middle and nacl rich compartments therefore the increment of initial concentration of the product solution was observed to augment the nacl flux without affecting nacl purity fig 7f 4 2 acid and base production from hsed nacl rich solution in the treatment of seawater brine by this novel hsed process the concentration and purity of nacl in the concentrate compartment increased with running time however the residual hard cation concentration 0 40 g l ca2 and 0 19 g l mg2 of the nacl rich stream still limited the possibility of using the stream directly as the feed solution for a conventional bmed process to test another pathway toward the goals of resource efficient recovery and realizing high value utilization of the stream a developed sbmed stack was introduced to the hsed process without any purification of the nacl rich stream by precipitation or other methods the stream was fed directly into the sbmed unit as a feedstock for preparation of acid and base yields thus a novel integration between the two electro driven membrane systems was formed for this determination of the proper voltage was crucial in bmed process because the voltage per repeating unit directly determined water splitting the source of h and oh and ionic electro migration and the ionic compositions of the feed solutions are listed in table s3 4 2 1 determination of voltage per repeating unit examination of the influence of applied voltage on current density and salt removal ratio in the feed stream nacl rich solution revealed that the curves of current density exhibited an initial increase and then slow decrease fig 8 a this was mainly due to the lower initial concentrations of acid and base as well as gradually declining ionic strength in the feed solution versus running time zhang et al 2017b otherwise a higher voltage improved salt transport with a higher initial current density observed fig 8a and b meanwhile variations in acid and base concentrations during sbmed processing with different applied voltages showed that under the established dc field with various intensities na and cl migrated through the corresponding monovalent selective cation and anion exchange membranes into the base and acid cells fig 8c and d near linear increases in acid and base concentrations were clearly observed in the corresponding compartments during earlier operating stages as nacl in the feed solution was further exhausted na and cl transport was constrained leading to a slow enhancement in the concentrations of base and acid products however under such voltage enhancement mg2 and ca2 rejection in the product stream was decreased which was attributed to enhancement of the driving force of divalent ions transport as a result it was concluded to be beneficial for the voltage per repeating unit of sbmed process to be set at 3 33 v 4 2 2 evaluation of stable operation the operational stability of the sbmed process at the highest possible salt removal ratio was evaluated by performing an sbmed operation with five cycles using nacl rich solution as feed supplied by seawater brine hsed process fig 9 in particular the selection of working cycles and cumulative running time were according to the similar studies chen et al 2018a ye et al 2020 the sbmed stack was found to have nearly identical performance for the nacl rich solution in terms of variations in current density and tds of feed and with lower hardness in all five cycles this indicated that the presence of a trace amount hardness cations in the nacl rich solution did not induce scaling in the sbmed stack to be specific the sbmed stack maintained stable rejection of residual hardness cations 65 for ca2 and 85 for mg2 for acid base conversion and lower saline water regeneration with a stable current efficiency fig 9c and d otherwise the results of current efficiency 50 53 in this study agree with those observed by the previous researches which applying a similar bmed process to high contracted synthetic nacl solutions as well as synthetic brackish water concentrates badruzzaman et al 2009 ibáñez et al 2013 yang et al 2014 and the co ion leakage and to higher diffusion through the membranes by the transport of protons and hydroxyl ions across the anion and cation exchange membranes respectively thus reducing the system efficiency mazrou et al 1997 mazrou et al 1998 after experiment s end the sbmed stack was examined to detect fouling on membrane surfaces and no visible fouling deposits were observed on the surfaces of both the monovalent selective cation exchange membrane and the bipolar membrane this demonstrated that the sbmed process for acid base production from seawater brine pretreated by hsed was suitable for long term application thus in view of sustainable seawater brine management the monovalent selective ion exchange membrane was a promising alternative for reducing the scaling propensity of the base compartment for subsequent sbmed operations 4 3 performance of the novel hybrid ed system the salt compositions of natural seawater and each stream from the hsed and sbmed units are shown in table 1 the tds of seawater brine was reduced from 47 3 to 11 5 g l during the hsed process 180 min and the nacl concentration in this stream from 34 1 to 7 9 g l the other salt components in hsed dilute were basically lower than that in natural seawater although na2so4 content in hsed dilute clearly increased but the caso4 and mgso4 contents were clearly lower than the corresponding components in natural seawater another noticeable phenomenon was that the so4 2 concentration in this stream 2 70 g l was still slightly lower than the corresponding concentration in natural seawater 2 73 g l which insured that this stream could be completely recycled to the feed water for desalination therefore the tds and various ionic components in hsed dilute were lower than those in natural seawater which improved the feed seawater water quality and reduced the working load of the pretreatment process in the seawater desalination process in addition 3 5 g l na2so4 was gained in the na type salt compartment but the nacl and na2so4 proportions were still higher the main reason for this was that the steric hindrance effect caused by the pore size of anion exchange membrane resulted in different migration rates for cl and so4 2 further studies should focus on increasing the proportion of na2so4 in the na type salt compartment by adjusting the initial nacl concentration ratio of the two product compartments on the other hand enrichment of cacl2 and mgcl2 were realized in the cl type salt compartment with 4 38 and 9 94 g l respectively obtained in this compartment also the nacl concentration in this stream was decreased from 20 6 to 3 g l which indicated that the displacement monovalent ions for divalent ions ca2 as well as mg2 was realized in the compartment for the nacl rich stream the nacl concentration was increased from 20 3 to 71 9 g l after 180 min of processing meanwhile the small amounts of divalent salts that leaked into the nacl rich stream indicated that divalent ions in the corresponding product compartments had excellent fractionation ratios during the hsed process this was confirmed by the relevant contents discussed in the previous section for the preparation of acid and base from the nacl rich stream based on sbmed process the removal ratio of mixed salts and nacl reached 93 6 and 95 after 180 min respectively in addition an extremely lower leakage of divalent salts with low concentrations of mgcl2 cacl2 and caso4 was achieved which indicated a low likelihood of scaling risk in the alkali cell more importantly the sbmed dilute could also be recycled to the primary desalination process to achieve zero liquid discharge while improving the water quality of feed seawater and increasing the water recovery ratio of the utilization system moreover naoh and hcl concentrations produced by the sbmed process reached 1 64 and 1 59 mol l respectively further work needs to be done on process optimization of these emerging electro driven membrane processes as well as their integrated process and improvement of mass transfer efficiency thus the composition purity and concentrations of the corresponding product solutions could expect to be further improved 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that employing a novel hybrid ed system which integrated an innovative hsed and a developed sbmed realized fine and high value utilization of mixed salts from seawater brine the effluent streams of the hsed process consisted of na and cl type hsls and nacl rich solution it was found that appropriate increment of both applied voltage and initial salt concentration of product streams were beneficial to the recovery of divalent ions from seawater brine under the condition of ensuring the purity of nacl rich solution under optimized conditions 2 67 v of voltage per repeating unit 20 5 g l of initial nacl concentration in the product streams the concentration of na2so4 in na type hsls was 3 5g l the concentrations of cacl2 and mgcl2 in cl type hsls reached 4 38 and 9 94 g l and the concentration of nacl in nacl rich solution reached 73 8 g l with a satisfying purity 97 after continuous reconcentration without any risk of scaling na type hsls could be fed into a partial crystallization process to gradually separate nacl and na2so4 and cl type hsls could be used for removal of inorganic phosphate species during waste water treatment via the precipitation of struvite and related compounds more importantly nacl rich solution with lower hardness 0 40 g l ca2 and 0 19 g l mg2 was fed directly into the sbmed unit to stably prepare acid and base fractions without any precipitation or other purification processes the concentration of naoh and hcl streams produced by the sbmed process reached 1 64 and 1 59 mol l respectively moreover the concentrations of various ions in the dilute from both hsed and sbmed processes were lower than that in seawater which indicated it feasible to recycle the dilute streams into a seawater desalination plant overall this innovation could enhance the technological upgrading of seawater comprehensive utilization industry and transform the seawater brine into a process that produces high value fine chemicals these developed electro driven membrane processes and their integrated novel system could also be scaled for industrial applications pending further testing further studies will be devoted to investigating the energy consumption and benefits analysis of

16886,sustainable seawater brine treatment demands an essential paradigm shift for effective recovery of resources and high value utilization of mixed salts here a novel hybrid electrodialysis ed system was proposed that integrated an innovative hybrid selective ed hsed and a developed selective bipolar membrane ed sbmed the hsed process allowed simultaneous recovery of major divalent cations and anions from seawater brine when nacl was selectively enriched then the impure nacl rich stream was fed directly into the sbmed process for acid base preparation without any purification pretreatment detailed analysis of the hsed process showed that increasing unit voltage from 2 33 v to 2 67 v would improve the removal ratio of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 from 54 7 41 4 and 13 3 to 78 9 76 6 and 32 1 respectively in addition the increment of initial concentration of product streams promoted the transport of various ions from the feed and middle compartments the fine utilization performance in terms of ionic removal ratio and fractionation ratio of divalent ions in the hsed process was more limited by the initial concentration of product streams furthermore the sbmed stack was found to have nearly identical performance over five cycles indicating that the presence of a trace amount of hardness cations did not induce scaling the current study thus provided a novel suitable strategy with a perspective of fine utilization for practical applications in sustainable disposal of seawater brine graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hybrid selective electrodialysis hsed selective bipolar membrane electrodialysis sbmed seawater brine sustainable disposal fine utilization 1 introduction freshwater scarcity is one of the world s most critical challenges of our time and a series of major concerns have been emerging including slowing economy polluted water and unhealthy ecosystems hoekstra 2014 tong and elimelech 2016 vorosmarty et al 2010 in such scenarios seawater desalination has become a priority technology for replenishing freshwater resources to date seawater desalination accounts for more than sixty percent of globally produced freshwater kress et al 2020 although this process could provide substantial amounts of freshwater it produces vast quantities of seawater brine which contains mixed salts with highly concentration elimelech and phillip 2011 zhao et al 2018b the mixed salts in seawater brine mainly consists of sodium chloride and many common scale forming species such as ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 et al chen et al 2019b if inadequately treated the brine discharge into an aquatic environment particularly in closed or semi closed seawaters can cause many adverse impacts on aquatic ecosystems jiang et al 2014 meanwhile direct seawater brine discharge also represents to a waste of chemical resources because brine contains nearly twice as much salt as natural seawater chen et al 2019a du et al 2018 therefore recovery and recycling of seawater brine has become a growing trend in the past few years according to the concepts of zero liquid discharge and sustainable development bindels et al 2020 choi et al 2020 kumar et al 2019a in most closed or semi closed seas such as bohai sea in china a more broadly strategy for seawater brine management is to alleviate the negative effects of mixed salts on the ecological environment and balance the inputs and outputs of seawater brine reclamation particularly in china the discharge of seawater brine into the bohai sea has been strictly restricted therefore in some specific sea areas the utilization or treatment of brine must be performed better utilization of seawater brine would have a positive impact on the rational use of chemical resources and the environmental footprint of seawater desalination comprehensive utilization of seawater brine not only minimizes the volume and environmental risk of resulting discharge but also alleviates pressure on ecosystems resulting from seawater desalination elsaid et al 2012 one pathway toward sensible goals is to convert the otherwise to be discharged seawater brine into useful chemicals to date many technologies have been developed for salt recovery which can be classified into thermal and membrane processes a thermal based concentrator as well as crystallizer is supported by phase change such as mechanical vapor compression mvc and multistage flash msf which use high energy to vaporize water from brine and leave mixed salts as solids al amshawee et al 2020 panagopoulos et al 2019 a membrane based concentrator which is a non phase change process can be considered as a high efficient brine pre concentration technology such processes include reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf and representative of the electro driven membrane process electrodialysis ed al amshawee et al 2020 casas et al 2012 liu et al 2016 nayar et al 2019 ed allows for ion transport through charge selective ion exchange membranes and is more suitable for brine preconcentration tanaka 2011 however the complexity of ionic composition in brine and its higher salinity produces a series of important issues in brine utilization such as energy consumption control scaling and separation of impurity salts which remain to be resolved chen et al 2019b lin et al 2020 mavukkandy et al 2019 tong and elimelech 2016 zhang et al 2015 until now the fine separation and purification of various ions has received little attention compared with reports of efficient pre concentration processes undeniably major developments of selective electrodialysis sed have been reported in recent years extending ed applications far beyond simple desalting and concentrating of saline water ahdab et al 2020 chen et al 2018b ye et al 2019 zhang et al 2017a zhang et al 2013 with the use of monovalent permselective cation and anion exchange membranes sed can accomplish selective separation and concentration of monovalent salts against divalent salts in nacl solutions yet it cannot further solve the extraction and utilization of divalent ions that are trapped in a dilute compartment as a result although the desalting stream in sed is below the salinity of seawater and can be discharged or returned to raw seawater for the seawater desalination process the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 which are trapped in the dilute compartment are still higher than that of seawater to be specific given its low salt content this desalting stream can be recommended for discharge directly into the ocean wang et al 2020 however it is not known whether the fact that divalent ions in the desalting stream which are more concentrated than those in seawater has an unfavorable impact on the marine ecological environment in another sense starting from sustainable development and zero brine discharge concepts of the whole industry of seawater desalination and comprehensive utilization the desalting stream is best introduced into the seawater desalination system to enhance the water recovery of the overall system and to improve the feed water quality for desalination chen et al 2019a however if the desalting stream is returned to the seawater desalination process it still would have a negative effect as such a mixture would increase the concentration ratio of divalent to monovalent salts changing the ionic composition of raw seawater and thus increasing scaling risk in desalination equipment nevertheless there has been little attention and few reports on such issues another pathway toward the goals of resource recovery is to convert seawater brine to high value chemicals such as transforming brine into caustic soda naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl using bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed fernandez gonzalez et al 2016 kumar et al 2019b lin et al 2015 yang et al 2014 in this manner high value utilization of seawater brine can be realized and economic benefits improved acids produced by the bmed process can be used to meet the demand for acidic solutions in seawater desalination pretreatment and to overcome the difficulty of transporting hydrochloric acid thus desalination plants can also save money and reduce their environmental impact by recovering hcl and naoh from brine also acids can be used as a necessary raw material for the secondary industry of seawater brine comprehensive utilization such as in the acidification process of bromine extraction acid produced by bmed could be used to provide some of the acid needed to extract bromine from seawater brine which has clear economic benefits to produce hcl and naoh seawater brine which contains high concentrations of hardness ions ca2 mg2 should first be pretreated using a chemical precipitation approach zhang et al 2019 other emerging softening technologies such as special ion exchange fractionating nanofiltration f nf or sed are more efficient in the brine softening process liu et al 2016 reig et al 2016 zhang et al 2017b zhang et al 2019 however these technologies still need to be integrated with chemical precipitation because of very strict hardness restrictions for inlet solutions for bmed liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017b typically to prevent scaling such as by mg oh 2 and provide a feed with the required purity for bmed system a subsequent chemical precipitation step should be applied after nf or sed pretreatments reig et al 2016 semblante et al 2018 except in the form of the external integrations above some researchers have proposed an internal integration of bmed and sed using monovalent selective ion exchange membranes to replace conventional ion exchange membranes in bmed stacks chen et al 2018a qiu et al 2019 the results have shown that with an appropriate treatment of concentrated industrial brines containing certain hardness ion concentrations reutilization of the brines might be achieved by using the single step however many studies have indicated that increased divalent ion concentration in feed solution could promote divalent ions to leak through the monovalent selective ion exchange membrane chen et al 2018a nie et al 2017 therefore compared to the influent quality lower concentration of ca2 and mg2 ions reported in the literature using seawater brine as the feed stream for sbmed directly would enhance the scaling tendency of alkali compartment in an sbmed stack thus the feasibility of its direct application needs to be reassessed because higher hardness ion concentrations in seawater brine increases the leakage risk of mg2 or ca2 in this study with the purpose of fostering the fine utilization of mixed salts in seawater brine a novel hybrid electrodialysis system was designed and presented by considering an innovation of a typical sed stack configuration and integrating it with a developmental sbmed the effects of applied voltage and initial nacl concentration in middle compartments on the transport and fractionation properties of monovalent and divalent ions in the hsed system were examined then the sbmed process for acid and base production from nacl rich solution obtained from hsed was investigated and the role of applied voltage as well as stable operation evaluated finally the salt transfer performance of the novel hybrid ed system for fine utilization of mixed salts in seawater brine was discussed the goal of this study was to provide prospects and guidance for technical improvements in the fine utilization process of seawater brine the specific objectives of the current study were a analysis of the influence of typical parameters on fine separation of mixed ions in hsed process using simulated seawater brine and b optimization and integration of the hsed and sbmed processes 2 construction of the novel hybrid electrodialysis system the innovation of membrane stack configuration and the system integration of emerging electro membrane processes could be provided strategies to the potential problems for conventional electro membrane process of seawater brine structurally monovalent selective cation exchange membranes sc and monovalent selective anion exchange membranes sa are placed alternately in a conventional sed stack so the monovalent cations na migrate through sc with negative fixed groups and are retained by the sa with positive active groups and the divalent cations ca2 mg2 are blocked by sc and stranded in dilute compartment similar migration characteristics exist for monovalent and divalent anions in sed stack this migration process causes an increase of monovalent ion concentration in concentrate cells and a decrease in the dilute cells differs from this structure a novel sed configuration could be formed by involving a specific arrangement of conventional and selective ion exchange membranes hybrid selective electrodialysis hsed to simultaneously fine fractionate nacl enrichment and na and cl type high solubility liquid salts hsls from seawater brine as shown in fig 1 specifically the cationic species in the na type hsls is only na while the anion species in the cl type hsls is only cl all of these belong to high solubility salt solution so as to avoid the potential scaling problem caso4 etc in ed process more importantly the hsed method can fractionate these ions in mixed salts into different streams and provide a technical path the fine utilization of mixed salts from seawater brine in this investigation based on the structural features of the innovative hsed and the developmental sbmed a novel hybrid electrodialysis system for sustainable disposal of seawater brine was proposed a schematic diagram of the novel electro driven membrane hybrid system is shown in fig 2 first hsed was used to fractionate the monovalent and divalent ions in the seawater brine subsequently the nacl rich stream in this system was further reused to produce hcl and naoh in one step using bmed with monovalent selective ion exchange membranes sbmed the na type hsls can be continuously reconcentrated without any risk of scaling and fed into a partial crystallization process to gradually separate nacl and na2so4 also after conversion and concentration during the hsed process cl type hsls can be used for removal of inorganic phosphate species during wastewater treatment via the precipitation of struvite mg phosphate jin et al 2018 lahav et al 2013 shaddel et al 2020 hydroxyapatite ca phosphate hermassi et al 2015a and farringtonite mg ca phosphate hermassi et al 2015b reig et al 2016 this latter process had the potential to produce new phosphorous resources for slow release fertilizer production besides the source of pure nacl for the two middle compartments can be provided by a portion of nacl rich stream produced from the hsed system after simple softening treatment such as ion exchange as its concentrations of divalent ions are very low when the concentration of various ions in the two dilute streams was lower than that of the corresponding ions in seawater the depleted brine streams from hsed and sbmed processes could also be recycled into the seawater desalination unit without any pretreatment therefore this novel hsed sbmed hybrid system possessed the following characteristics 1 simultaneous recovery of divalent ions from seawater brine when nacl was selectively enriched 2 providing a high salinity nacl stream with lower hardness for sbmed processing and omitting a routine softening pretreatment step and 3 retaining lower ionic concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in the dilute streams from hsed and sbmed and recycling the dilute streams to the seawater desalination plant 3 materials and methods 3 1 experimental strategies materials and apparatuses selective fractionation of charged ions has been studied using conventional sed in various studies but few have focused on the reutilization of divalent ions that are retained in the dilute cell of an sed stack casas et al 2012 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2020 the comprehensive utilization of seawater brine includes not only the recovery of inorganic salts but also the recycling of desalted water here from the configuration characteristics of an hsed stack nacl as well as major divalent cations and anions were obtained from different compartments in the stack the design of the hsed fractionating unit is shown in fig 3 a involving a stack with three repeating units monovalent selective cation exchange membrane sc monovalent selective anion exchange membrane sa conventional anion exchange membrane a and conventional cation exchange membrane c an hsed stack was applied to fractionate divalent cations and anions in cl and na type salt compartments respectively and to concentrate nacl rich stream in the product compartment fig 3a in principle when the anode and cathode plates of hsed stack were connected with a direct current dc stabilized voltage supply oxidation reduction reactions occurred at the interface between the anode cathode plate and the electrolyte and then a dc electric field formed in the stack to promote directional ion migration to be specific cations na mg2 and ca2 first transferred from the dilute seawater brine through the c membrane and entered the cl type hsls compartment then monovalent cations na transferred from the cl type hsls through the sc membrane and entered the nacl rich compartment while divalent cations mg2 and ca2 mostly remained in the cl type hsls on the other side anions cl and so4 2 first transferred from the dilute through the a membrane and entered the na type hsls compartment which had ionic transfer behaviors including monovalent anion cl transfer from the na type hsls compartment through the sa membrane and into the nacl rich compartment divalent anion so4 2 mostly remained in the na type hsls notably the role of nacl solution added in the two intermediate compartments na and cl type hsls was to provide migration replaced ions na or cl to replace transported divalent ions furthermore the nacl rich stream which contained lower hardness was then transported to the sbmed stack the design of the sbmed reutilization unit is shown in fig 3b including a stack with three repeating units bipolar membrane bpm monovalent selective anion exchange membrane sa and monovalent selective cation exchange membrane sc an sbmed stack was applied to produce hcl and naoh in one step without any softening process the boundary dimensions of both the hsed and sbmed stacks were 30 10 cm with each membrane having an effective size of 23 8 7 0 cm such that the active surface area was 158 cm2 the spacer channel width between two adjacent membranes was 0 9 mm three pairs of repeating units were used in hsed and sbmed stacks with all membranes manufactured by astom corp tokyo japan the characteristic properties of these membranes are listed in table s1 the positive and negative electrode plates for both hsed and sbmed are made of titanium coated ruthenium a direct current power supply jp3020d wuxi ans electronic technology co ltd china was used to maintain constant applied voltage during experiments the major ionic compositions and initial volumes of each solution in hsed sbmed experiments are shown in table s2 meanwhile the hco3 with low concentration 0 15 0 31 g l liu et al 2016 in seawater brine was not considered since it can be eliminated by introducing the acid produced with bmed prior to the hsed or even prior to the seawater desalination a 1 l portion of 3 wt na2so4 was used as the electrolyte solution in all experiments all salts in synthetic seawater brine and initial saline water were analytical grade the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 were tested by edta titration method gb t 15452 2009 chen et al 2018a cl was analyzed by silver nitrate titration astm d512 89 1999 chen et al 2018 tanaka et al 2015 so4 2 was determined by ion chromatography thermo dionex ics 5000 usa in which each sample was diluted to meet the requirement of sample concentration chen et al 2019a finally na was determined by electrically balancing solution ions using eq s1 liu et al 2016 tanaka et al 2015 the concentration of tds was therefore obtained using the eq s2 in addition the resulting concentration of naoh produced by the sbmed process was determined by titration with 0 01 mol l hcl standard solution and the concentration of hcl produced by the sbmed process was determined by titration with 0 01 mol l naoh standard solution ye et al 2015 1 c n a c c l 35 5 c s o 4 2 96 2 c c a 2 40 2 c m

every half hour all experiments were performed at room temperature 20 25 c other specific operating conditions of optimization of hsed and sbmed process parameters were as follows a novel hsed system was first developed for fine separation of mixed salts the feed brine na and cl type salt and nacl rich tanks were initially filled with seawater brine and nacl solution fig 3a with ion compositions

the ion transfer is vital for understanding both the hsed and sbmed processes in addition the initial concentration of nacl make up solutions in the hsed process is directly related to the solution resistance in the hsed membrane stack which affects the current density and driving force for ion migration so the influence of initial concentrations of nacl make up solutions is also an important parameter in hsed process thus the roles of applied voltage per repeating unit 2 33 2 67 and 3 00 v were investigated and the effects of initial nacl concentration of the nacl solution 11 7 20 5 and 29 3 g l on the performance of the seawater brine hsed process meanwhile ionic composition of the product stream nacl rich under optimal conditions was assessed and treated as the feed solution of sbmed two part experiments were performed in sbmed operations for preparation of acid and base products from an nacl rich source the effects of applied voltage per repeating unit 3 00 3 33 and 3 67 v on the preparation of acid and base components from nacl rich by sbmed were first investigated then the stability of sbmed operation was evaluated at optimized applied voltage it should be noted that the range of the above parameter values was selected based on the pre experiments other specific operating conditions of the corresponding experiments were illustrated in the discussion of each part of this study 3 3 data acquisition and analysis 3 3 1 flux of nacl the nacl flux fnacl from feed solution was determined using eq 3 which has been described by zhao et al 2018a 3 f n a c l g m 2 m i n

and discussion 4 1 hsed for fine fractionation of mixed salts from seawater brine different ions possess different permeation capabilities in ed process due to the effects of electric double layer and steric hindrance on the ion exchange membrane nie et al 2017 many investigations also indicating that these capabilities are especially influenced by the operating conditions of ed process such as applied voltage and ion concentrations casademont et al 2008 li et al 2016 in this section a more in depth parameter research was performed to gain a better understanding of the ionic fractionation from seawater brine during the hsed process 4 1 1 role of voltage per repeating unit to reveal the contribution of voltage per repeating unit in the seawater brine hsed process experiments were performed at different voltages per repeating unit from 2 33 to 3 00 v for electrochemical properties examination of the role of voltage on current density and stack resistance variation across the hsed stack showed that current density at higher voltage 2 67 and 3 00 v was clearly greater than that at lower voltage 2 33 v fig s1 this suggested that there was a powerful driving force of ionic transfer with a higher applied voltage this was mainly because that increasing applied voltage augmented the electric field intensity and resultant driving force for ion migration masigol et al 2012 however although the current density at 3 00 v was a little higher than that at 2 67 v the electrical resistance of the stack at 2 67 v was relatively smaller moreover the current density and stack resistance changed only a little with time at the lower applied voltage 2 33 v which was due to there being enough ions in the feed compartment for higher voltage conditions as the hsed process continued a growing number of ions from the feed solution transferred into the nacl rich na type and cl type hsls compartments which then lead to enhancement of feed solution resistance thus the stack electrical resistance rapidly ascended at later times in these experiments the main reason for this result is the enhanced difference in ionic concentration between the dilute and nacl rich compartments which resulted in significant increment of solution resistance in seawater brine compartment and a prominent reduction of the ionic transfer rate examination of the role of voltage per repeating unit on the separation performance of seawater brine hsed process showed that the slopes of tds lines with higher voltage were greater which indicated an excellent salt removal rate fig 4 tds declines in the feed compartment were observed to be coupled with the voltage increment with higher voltages forcing ions to transfer faster through ion exchange membranes which resulted in linear and quicker salt removal rates furthermore the tds change in the two middle brine compartments was not significant which suggested that the original nacl could be provided migration replaced ions na or cl to replace transported divalent ions ca2 mg2 or so4 2 observations of the variation in concentration of various ions in the na type hsls compartment showed that the sodium ion concentration at the three voltages changed little versus operating time fig 5 a and b however the cl concentration decreased gradually while so4 2 gradually increased the degree of anionic concentration variation at higher voltage was also observed to be significantly higher than at 2 33 v indicating that the cell voltage should be 2 67 v to capture more so4 2 fig 5 moreover the changes of various ion concentration in the cl type hsls compartment showed that the na concentration at the three voltages decreased gradually versus operating time while the concentration of ca2 and mg2 increased gradually in varying degrees fig 6 however the cl concentration did not show clear changes during the operating time from the view point of achieving ca2 and mg2 enrichment as much as possible and higher efficiency of electricity utilization the voltage per repeating unit was considered to be best at 2 67 v in short the above analysis of ionic transfer in the two middle brine compartments visibly illustrated the following facts 1 in the na type hsls compartment the displacement original cl for so4 2 which coming from the dilute and 2 in the cl type hsls compartment displacement original na for ca2 and mg2 which coming from the dilute in fact the applied voltage not only played a positive role on divalent ion enhancement in the two middle brine compartments but it also contributed to the concentration of monovalent salts in the nacl rich compartment the removal ratio of divalent ions was also examined as the fractionation ratio of each divalent ion and the flux as well as purity of nacl in rich solution in later experimental periods 120 min at different voltages fig 4d f the removal ratio of divalent ions was clearly seen to be positively correlated with applied voltage which was consistent with the previous researches chen et al 2018b jiang et al 2014 ye et al 2019 but the ionic fractionation ratio of divalent ions was not notably sensitive to applied voltage this phenomenon indicated that voltage had a positive influence on divalent ion removal from the dilute but did not have a negative effect on the removal ratio between divalent and monovalent ions from the middle compartments to nacl rich compartment this was further confirmed by the observation that voltage enhancement promoted increased nacl flux while not clearly affecting nacl purity in the product solution as shown in fig s2 the separation efficiencies of monovalent and divalent ions were calculated for the interval between start and 120 min for the hsed process at different voltages per repeating unit as mentioned in section 3 1 a more positive value means that the ion b is transported slower thus that it is more retained in na type and cl type hsls compartments it is noted that the monovalent selective ion exchange membranes give higher positive values for the selectivities of na ca2 na mg2 and cl so4 2 fig s2 which is meaning that the divalent ions were more retained in na type or cl type hsls compartments the selectivity is explained by the presence of a permselective layer on the monovalent selective ion exchange membrane and mainly based on two principles steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion zhang et al 2009 chen et al 2018a it also can be seen that the s b a values of na ca2 na mg2 and cl so4 2 increased in varying degrees with the increasing of voltage specially the selectivities are not significantly improved when the voltage was increased from 2 67 v to 3 00 v 4 1 2 role of initial salt concentration of product streams in the hsed process the displacement of monovalent ions na and cl for divalent ions ca2 mg2 and so4 2 could be achieved in na type and cl type hsls compartments due to the monovalent ion selective transfer characteristics of monovalent selective ion exchange membranes and the effects of initial nacl concentration in the product streams are of great importance to evaluate the performance of displacement monovalent ions for divalent ions in na type and cl type hsls compartments the role of initial salt concentration of the product compartment was further investigated by plotting the tds in the feed compartment as a function of operating time fig 7 for this compartment tds curves at all initial salt concentrations decreased linearly with time at a fixed composition and feed solution concentration seawater brine increasing the initial nacl concentration of the product from 11 7 to 29 3 g l resulted in a clear enhancement of salt transport 50 within 180 min this enhancement was mainly attributed to decreased electrical resistance of solutions in these compartments 5 ω of stack resistance at 11 7 g l to 2 6 ω of stack resistance at 29 3 g l fig s3 at the same time the tds in na and cl type hsls remained approximately constant with time as the inherent univalent ions of the two compartments displaced divalent ions that had migrated into them and then migrated to the nacl rich compartment fig 7b in particular compared with the tds in the na type hsls compartment tds curves in the cl type hsls compartment clearly decreased versus time this was mainly due to the superior transport of ca2 and mg2 compared with so4 2 in the ed process fig 7d and therefore resulted in the equivalent of na being replaced in the cl type hsls being greater than the equivalent of cl being replaced in the na type hsls also the enhancement of the product solution s initial concentration was conducive to improved nacl migration from the dilute compartment to the nacl rich compartment fig 7c for example during 180 min of operating time tds of the product solution from the three initial concentration conditions increased from 11 7 20 5 and 29 3 g l to 58 3 73 8 and 94 8 g l respectively in addition the separation efficiencies of monovalent and divalent ions for the hsed process at different initial concentrations of nacl as shown in fig s4 as expected the na ca2 na mg2 and cl so4 2 selectivities have become less positive in the 11 7 g l nacl experiment because of the higher unwanted ca2 mg2 and so4 2 transport through the monovalent selective ion exchange membrane towards the nacl rich compartment at the same time when the initial concentration of nacl increased to 20 5 g l the na ca2 na mg2 and cl so4 2 selectivities were improved positively this is because of the reduction of the competitive migration of divalent ions by the appropriate addition of sodium and chloride ions however the s b a values of na ca2 and na mg2 let up with further adding nacl to product solutions which should be caused by the increment of competitive action of calcium ion and magnesium ion this is mainly due to a significant increase in operating current resulting from an obvious reduction in the solution resistance as shown in fig s3 and it then enhance the migration driving force of calcium and magnesium ions taken together an appropriate increase in initial concentration was concluded to be beneficial to both the migration of various ions and the fractionation of divalent ions between the middle and nacl rich compartments therefore the increment of initial concentration of the product solution was observed to augment the nacl flux without affecting nacl purity fig 7f 4 2 acid and base production from hsed nacl rich solution in the treatment of seawater brine by this novel hsed process the concentration and purity of nacl in the concentrate compartment increased with running time however the residual hard cation concentration 0 40 g l ca2 and 0 19 g l mg2 of the nacl rich stream still limited the possibility of using the stream directly as the feed solution for a conventional bmed process to test another pathway toward the goals of resource efficient recovery and realizing high value utilization of the stream a developed sbmed stack was introduced to the hsed process without any purification of the nacl rich stream by precipitation or other methods the stream was fed directly into the sbmed unit as a feedstock for preparation of acid and base yields thus a novel integration between the two electro driven membrane systems was formed for this determination of the proper voltage was crucial in bmed process because the voltage per repeating unit directly determined water splitting the source of h and oh and ionic electro migration and the ionic compositions of the feed solutions are listed in table s3 4 2 1 determination of voltage per repeating unit examination of the influence of applied voltage on current density and salt removal ratio in the feed stream nacl rich solution revealed that the curves of current density exhibited an initial increase and then slow decrease fig 8 a this was mainly due to the lower initial concentrations of acid and base as well as gradually declining ionic strength in the feed solution versus running time zhang et al 2017b otherwise a higher voltage improved salt transport with a higher initial current density observed fig 8a and b meanwhile variations in acid and base concentrations during sbmed processing with different applied voltages showed that under the established dc field with various intensities na and cl migrated through the corresponding monovalent selective cation and anion exchange membranes into the base and acid cells fig 8c and d near linear increases in acid and base concentrations were clearly observed in the corresponding compartments during earlier operating stages as nacl in the feed solution was further exhausted na and cl transport was constrained leading to a slow enhancement in the concentrations of base and acid products however under such voltage enhancement mg2 and ca2 rejection in the product stream was decreased which was attributed to enhancement of the driving force of divalent ions transport as a result it was concluded to be beneficial for the voltage per repeating unit of sbmed process to be set at 3 33 v 4 2 2 evaluation of stable operation the operational stability of the sbmed process at the highest possible salt removal ratio was evaluated by performing an sbmed operation with five cycles using nacl rich solution as feed supplied by seawater brine hsed process fig 9 in particular the selection of working cycles and cumulative running time were according to the similar studies chen et al 2018a ye et al 2020 the sbmed stack was found to have nearly identical performance for the nacl rich solution in terms of variations in current density and tds of feed and with lower hardness in all five cycles this indicated that the presence of a trace amount hardness cations in the nacl rich solution did not induce scaling in the sbmed stack to be specific the sbmed stack maintained stable rejection of residual hardness cations 65 for ca2 and 85 for mg2 for acid base conversion and lower saline water regeneration with a stable current efficiency fig 9c and d otherwise the results of current efficiency 50 53 in this study agree with those observed by the previous researches which applying a similar bmed process to high contracted synthetic nacl solutions as well as synthetic brackish water concentrates badruzzaman et al 2009 ibáñez et al 2013 yang et al 2014 and the co ion leakage and to higher diffusion through the membranes by the transport of protons and hydroxyl ions across the anion and cation exchange membranes respectively thus reducing the system efficiency mazrou et al 1997 mazrou et al 1998 after experiment s end the sbmed stack was examined to detect fouling on membrane surfaces and no visible fouling deposits were observed on the surfaces of both the monovalent selective cation exchange membrane and the bipolar membrane this demonstrated that the sbmed process for acid base production from seawater brine pretreated by hsed was suitable for long term application thus in view of sustainable seawater brine management the monovalent selective ion exchange membrane was a promising alternative for reducing the scaling propensity of the base compartment for subsequent sbmed operations 4 3 performance of the novel hybrid ed system the salt compositions of natural seawater and each stream from the hsed and sbmed units are shown in table 1 the tds of seawater brine was reduced from 47 3 to 11 5 g l during the hsed process 180 min and the nacl concentration in this stream from 34 1 to 7 9 g l the other salt components in hsed dilute were basically lower than that in natural seawater although na2so4 content in hsed dilute clearly increased but the caso4 and mgso4 contents were clearly lower than the corresponding components in natural seawater another noticeable phenomenon was that the so4 2 concentration in this stream 2 70 g l was still slightly lower than the corresponding concentration in natural seawater 2 73 g l which insured that this stream could be completely recycled to the feed water for desalination therefore the tds and various ionic components in hsed dilute were lower than those in natural seawater which improved the feed seawater water quality and reduced the working load of the pretreatment process in the seawater desalination process in addition 3 5 g l na2so4 was gained in the na type salt compartment but the nacl and na2so4 proportions were still higher the main reason for this was that the steric hindrance effect caused by the pore size of anion exchange membrane resulted in different migration rates for cl and so4 2 further studies should focus on increasing the proportion of na2so4 in the na type salt compartment by adjusting the initial nacl concentration ratio of the two product compartments on the other hand enrichment of cacl2 and mgcl2 were realized in the cl type salt compartment with 4 38 and 9 94 g l respectively obtained in this compartment also the nacl concentration in this stream was decreased from 20 6 to 3 g l which indicated that the displacement monovalent ions for divalent ions ca2 as well as mg2 was realized in the compartment for the nacl rich stream the nacl concentration was increased from 20 3 to 71 9 g l after 180 min of processing meanwhile the small amounts of divalent salts that leaked into the nacl rich stream indicated that divalent ions in the corresponding product compartments had excellent fractionation ratios during the hsed process this was confirmed by the relevant contents discussed in the previous section for the preparation of acid and base from the nacl rich stream based on sbmed process the removal ratio of mixed salts and nacl reached 93 6 and 95 after 180 min respectively in addition an extremely lower leakage of divalent salts with low concentrations of mgcl2 cacl2 and caso4 was achieved which indicated a low likelihood of scaling risk in the alkali cell more importantly the sbmed dilute could also be recycled to the primary desalination process to achieve zero liquid discharge while improving the water quality of feed seawater and increasing the water recovery ratio of the utilization system moreover naoh and hcl concentrations produced by the sbmed process reached 1 64 and 1 59 mol l respectively further work needs to be done on process optimization of these emerging electro driven membrane processes as well as their integrated process and improvement of mass transfer efficiency thus the composition purity and concentrations of the corresponding product solutions could expect to be further improved 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that employing a novel hybrid ed system which integrated an innovative hsed and a developed sbmed realized fine and high value utilization of mixed salts from seawater brine the effluent streams of the hsed process consisted of na and cl type hsls and nacl rich solution it was found that appropriate increment of both applied voltage and initial salt concentration of product streams were beneficial to the recovery of divalent ions from seawater brine under the condition of ensuring the purity of nacl rich solution under optimized conditions 2 67 v of voltage per repeating unit 20 5 g l of initial nacl concentration in the product streams the concentration of na2so4 in na type hsls was 3 5g l the concentrations of cacl2 and mgcl2 in cl type hsls reached 4 38 and 9 94 g l and the concentration of nacl in nacl rich solution reached 73 8 g l with a satisfying purity 97 after continuous reconcentration without any risk of scaling na type hsls could be fed into a partial crystallization process to gradually separate nacl and na2so4 and cl type hsls could be used for removal of inorganic phosphate species during waste water treatment via the precipitation of struvite and related compounds more importantly nacl rich solution with lower hardness 0 40 g l ca2 and 0 19 g l mg2 was fed directly into the sbmed unit to stably prepare acid and base fractions without any precipitation or other purification processes the concentration of naoh and hcl streams produced by the sbmed process reached 1 64 and 1 59 mol l respectively moreover the concentrations of various ions in the dilute from both hsed and sbmed processes were lower than that in seawater which indicated it feasible to recycle the dilute streams into a seawater desalination plant overall this innovation could enhance the technological upgrading of seawater comprehensive utilization industry and transform the seawater brine into a process that produces high value fine chemicals these developed electro driven membrane processes and their integrated novel system could also be scaled for industrial applications pending further testing further studies will be devoted to investigating the energy consumption and benefits analysis of

16887,while the impact of suspended solids on chemical disinfection kinetics has been widely recognized a detailed modeling framework for assessing their contribution on disinfection efficiency in municipal contact tanks is yet unavailable in this paper we conducted experimental and modeling studies to mechanistically describe the interplay between suspended solids not removed by gravity settling in secondary clarifiers and disinfection performance of an emerging disinfectant peracetic acid operated in a municipal contact tank specifically we developed an integrated computational fluid dynamics cfd model to simultaneously predict the fate and transport of suspended solids escherichia coli and peracetic acid in a hypothetical reactor using an exposure based i e ct based inactivation rate expression the integrated cfd model calibrated against laboratory data was used to gain insights on the vertical distribution and local paa decay effect associated with solids settling and their impact on disinfectant decay and microbial inactivation results indicated that a solids settling in contact tanks is a significant phenomenon that cannot be neglected which can substantially impact disinfection efficiency under low flow conditions b vertical solids distribution and stratification in contact tanks can strongly affect escherichia coli inactivation by peracetic acid as highlighted by the cfd modeling studies c escherichia coli settling is experimentally measurable and strongly correlated with solids settling these phenomena can be successfully integrated into a cfd model to obtain a comprehensive description of the paa disinfection process in presence of changes in secondary effluent quality and flow a situation typically encountered in municipal

from its use it is commercially available in the form of an equilibrium mixture containing acetic acid ch3co2h hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and water batch and pilot experiments indicated high efficiency of

2001 understanding water quality impacts on paa disinfection efficiency santoro et al 2015 henao et al 2018 manoli et al 2019 as well as optimizing the use of paa for municipal application is a topic of primary research interest that is driven by the need of minimizing cost of treatment and environmental impact paa is known to undergo spontaneous decomposition in aqueous solutions yuan et al 1997 it has also been observed that suspended solids can significantly impact the decay of paa koivunen et al 2005 falsanisi et al 2006 qualitatively paa decomposition takes the form of a rapid decay i e instantaneous demand followed by a slower rate i e decay henao et al 2018 manoli et al 2019 the instantaneous demand is an initial rapid consumption that occurs when paa is introduced to wastewater due to rapidly oxidizable organic and inorganic compounds haas joffe 1994 the second stage decay is a more gradual decomposition of the oxidant commonly well described by a first order chemical reaction haas joffe 1994 koivunen et al 2005 falsanisi et al 2006 while considerable effort has been made to characterize the total suspended solids tss impact on disinfection efficiency koivunen et al 2005 falsanisi et al 2006 henao et al 2018 the formulation of scalable exposure based or ct based inactivation kinetic models that are able to relate tss concentration and inactivation kinetic parameters is still a subject of current research the availability of such models is key for process sizing and operation as a matter of fact tss concentration can vary considerably depending on the upstream treatment efficacy of the separation processes employed in the plant as well as local factors including seasonality and climate conditions water temperature viscosity rainfall and sewer characteristics etc it is known that solids settling and accumulation in contact tanks are potential causes for loss in disinfection efficiency and microbial regrowth while settling of primary and secondary particles has been widely investigated the characterization and mechanistic understanding of post secondary settling i e settling of particles escaping from the secondary clarifier has not received adequate attention to date moreover the prediction of fate and transport of total suspended solids in conventional settling units has been based mostly on simplified one dimensional models vesilind 1968 takacs et al 1991 flamant et al 2004 bürger et al 2011 and was only recently extended to the use of computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation strategies lakehal et al 1999 medina and laurent 2020 within the cfd framework of analysis one approach is eulerian kahane et al 2002 medina and laurent 2020 where both phases solids and water have their own momentum equations solved with considering a momentum exchange between the phases a second approach depends on solving the momentum transport equation for the water phase while using a lagrangian particle tracking model wicklein et al 2016 to solve the settling of discrete particles solid phase the third and most common approach relies on a mixture model i e uses only one momentum equation for the mixture in this approach to account for tss settling without adding a solids momentum equation a settling flux is empirically introduced to represent tss momentum transport in the gravitational direction such flux is added to the convection term of the tss concentration equation using an empirically derived and calibrated settling velocity expression also known as the settling function this approach was originally developed for 1d models vesilind 1968 takacs et al 1991 flamant et al 2004 bürger et al 2011 and later was extended to 2d 3d models mainly for the analysis of secondary clarifiers lakehal et al 1999 bürger et al 2011 medina and laurent 2020 to date different types of settling functions have been proposed in the literature the most widely used functions are those of vesilind 1968 takacs et al 1991 and diehl 2015 the vesilind function is popular due to its simple form i e an exponential decay equation with only two parameters required for calibration diehl s function is a power law function that has three constants and is a relatively recent development diehl 2015 medina and laurent 2020 the most widely used function in wastewater treatment process simulations has been proposed by takacs et al 1991 and contains five parameters that are arranged in a double exponential form it has been derived to describe settling phenomena observed in secondary clarifiers especifically generally settling behaviors have been associated with differences in solids characteristics such as particle size distribution floc structure particle material and presence of specific floc forming organisms takacs et al 1991 torfs et al 2017 these factors lead to different settling behaviors such as discrete settling hindered settling flocculent settling and blanket compression flamant et al 2004 bürger et al 2011 torfs et al 2017 discrete settling occurs when the concentration of tss is relatively low and particles do not interact with each other in a substantial manner under those circumstances the other settling behaviors can be neglected in the present work it is hypothesized that this settling regime also applies to particles escaping the secondary clarification stage and entering a contact tank chemical disinfection unit with secondary settling effluents typically not exceeding an average of tss concentration of 10 20 mg l and peaks that are not surpassing 100 mg l to the best of our knowledge tss settling in municipal contact tanks used for chemical disinfection and its impact on inactivation efficiency has received little attention to date due to the fact that chemical contact tanks are designed for average flow and average suspended solids conditions and considering the high variability in wastewater characteristics resulting from the different sewer systems and local climate conditions even optimally designed chemical contact tanks may operate under conditions leading to considerable settling as anecdotally reported in several instances indeed low flow conditions may result in locally low flow horizontal velocity thus leading to gravitational settling and solids stratification in the contact tank moreover solids accumulation at the bottom of the contact tank may induce accelerated disinfectant quenching and regrowth conditions which are also very problematic for disinfection these issues are even more exacerbated in poorly designed tanks where the accumulation of solids at the bottom of the system could also lead to fermentation and more pronouced regrowth due to the presence of a microbially active region where microbial concentration is potentially very high in this paper we conducted experimental and modeling studies to investigate paa disinfection in presence of post secondary tss settling in municipal contact tanks batch experiments were conducted to verify the hypotheses behind this work and to quantify the paa demand decay and the inactivation profiles of escherichia coli e coli observed paa and e coli inactivation kinetics were modelled using the double exponential exposure based ct based inactivation model which was extended to analytically incorporate the impact of tss as such results presented in this manuscript extend the findings of previous studies stampi et al 2001 falsanisi et al 2006 santoro et al 2007 2015 maffettone et al 2017 henao et al 2018 where ct based approaches were used to control paa disinfection a fully coupled computational fluid dynamics cfd model was developed to simultaneously predict in a single pass contact tank solids transport and settling paa demand and decay as well as e coli transport and inactivation the cfd model was verified and used to conduct a dynamic assessment of spikes in tss concentration on e coli inactivation efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 mixed liquor fractionation samples were collected from the influent stream to the secondary clarifier of the local wastewater treatment plant wwtp of pottersburg located in london on canada the wwtp consists of a conventional facility composed of preliminary treatment denitrification nitrification in an activated sludge system followed by secondary circular clarification tanks each collected sample underwent a two step procedure in the first step the mixed liquor was settled in batch mode and the position of the suspension liquid interface was measured at different time intervals in order to minimize wall effects the batch settling experiment was carried out in a sufficiently wide container consisting of a standard 2000 ml wide cylindrical beaker which was 13 cm in diameter and 15 cm in height a timer was used for recording the time at different interface heights the second step consisted of gently collecting the supernatant produced with the first step experiment using a large mouth pipette i e the batch simulated secondary effluent and subsequently subjecting it to a second settling experiment herein referred to as post secondary settling experiment to simulate the residual settling potentially occurring in a dowstream contact tank this two steps procedure was repeated in triplicate for each condition to obtain a sufficiently large and representative sample specifically three different settling times were established by observing the corresponding times at which the solids liquid interface of the mixed liquor reached 1600 1200 and 800 ml in the graduated beaker at which the supernatant collection process was carried out this allowed mimicking different solids separation efficiency for the secondary clarifier while keeping the non settleable consitutents identical in the fractionated samples the volumes and the corresponding sampling times were selected to achieve the widest possible range of tss concentrations in the supernatant it should be mentioned that the selection of these three settling conditions i e volumes and corresponding times was confirmed after a number of preliminary experiments to visually characterize the time dependent behaviour of the sludge water interface the appropriateness of these experimental conditions was further confirmed by the tss levels obtained in the supernatants which bracketed very well the values observed in full scale plants for secondary effluents it is also important to note that the choice of fractionating by gravitational settling the same waste activated sludge sample was justified by the experimental requirement of having in the same sub samples the same amounts of dissolved and non settleable constituents 2 2 turbidity tss correlation during batch disinfection experiments tss measurements were carried out according to the standard method 2540 american public health associatio 2018 using a 100 ml wastewater volume paired turbidity tests were also carried out using a standard turbidimeter hach 2100an turbidimeter such that an experimental correlation between tss and turbidity could be developed thus allowing for an increase in sample frequency with minimal disturbance of the settling experiments due to the much lower volume required for turbidity measurement i e 20 ml turbidity was reported in nephelometric turbidity units ntu sadar 1998 the importance of intensively calibrating the turbidity suspended solids correlation stems from considerations summarized in bhargava and mariam 1991 clifford et al 1995 2 3 post secondary settling experiments in analogy with the batch settling experiment conducted for mixed liquor solids fractionation the supernatant obtained from such tests was subjected to a second settling experiment to determine the post secondary settling velocity as a function of the residual tss concentration it should be noted that this is the settling behavior that is most relevant for disinfection purposes since it conceptually represents the residual settling of solids escaping from the secondary clarifier and entering a contact tank settling experiments were conducted using a 2000 ml cylindrical column which was 8 cm in diameter and 40 cm in height the column was selected to be taller than the mixed liquor fractionation beaker in order to better observe the settling behavior in this low tss concentration range before starting the experiment the collected aliquots obtained from the fractionation test were gently mixed to uniformly re suspend the tss in the sample immediately after mixing the sample a timer started to record the settling time the turbidity of water was followed over time during the experiment by gently sampling 20 ml of wastewater from the top of the column using a pipette then a glass vial was filled with this extract and tested in the turbidity meter thanks to the low amount of water required for turbidity measurement the water level in the settling column dropped only 4 mm 1 of total depth we also hypothesized that the dispersed and particle associated nature of e coli present in wastewater could undergo separation by gravitational forces acting on the suspended solids therefore additional experiments were conducted using the same cylinder to measure at discrete time steps the e coli concentration using standard method 9222 of membrane filtration of the coliform group american public health association 2018 the same method was used to enumerate viable e coli during paa inactivation experiments 2 5 paa demand and decay during the disinfection experiments the effects of tss on paa demand decay as well as on e coli inactivation by paa were characterized specifically the three experimentally simulated secondary settled wastewater fractionated with the method described in section 2 1 and sampled by obtaining the supernatant were tested over a 40 min contact time in a completely mixed disinfection batch reactor 1000 ml glass beaker gently agitated by a magnetic stirrer to avoid further settling and operated at room temperature an aliquot of a paa stock solution 12 paa w w was applied to deliver a paa initial concentration before instantaneous demand of 4 mg l immediately after adding the paa a timer was started and samples were collected at five contact times of 2 5 5 10 20 and 40 minutes respectively at each established contact time 40 ml were sampled and 5 drops of paa quenching solution were added to quench the residual oxidant and stop the disinfection process 2 6 the settling model in order to develop settling functions that are specific to the tss concentration range observed in disinfection contact tanks we developed a two dimensional 2d axisymmetric cfd model for the previously described post secondary settling experiments a vesilind settling function was modified and incorporated in the cfd model as a momentum flux using a user defined function that implements the settling velocity function parameters in implementing the settling function approach in the two dimensional axisymmetric problem for the settling column the solids transport equation may be represented with the following form lakehal et al 1999 1 c t v s c x x d c x 1 y y d c y where c t x y and d represent the tss concentration time vertical gravity and radial coordinates and tss diffusivity a low value of 10 9 m2 s is utilized respectively while v s represents the settling velocity which is estimated using the settling function using the 2 d cfd model extended to batch settling a study was conducted to identify the optimal settling parameters that could satisfactorily describe the observed tss settling and optimally fit the experimental data see fig 2 the study started with initially guessed settling function parameters moreover to avoid any local minimum in the objective function associated with the minimization of the sum of squared errors multiple starting points were selected to search for the optimal parameters the selection of vesilind function is justified by the discrete regime of solids settling due to highly diluted particles as confirmed by the good fit obtained using the 2 d cfd model however a modification of the settling function was required to consider the non settleable portion of tss the modified vesilind function was preferred over takacs s function takacs et al 1991 due to the lower number of calibration parameters involved and the discrete settling nature expected to occur in the post secondary settling experiments conducted in our study indeed the vesilind function has only two parameters namely v 0 and k where v 0 is the initial settling velocity and k is an exponential decay constant that represents tss concentration dependence we have expanded this function by introducing an additional parameter i e c m i n to capture the tail in the experimental data as such the modified vesilind expression used in this paper may be represented as 2 v s v 0 e x p k c c m i n with the minimum non settleable tss concentration defined as follows 3 c m i n f n s c i n where f n s is a non settleable fraction takacs et al 1991 and c i n is the inlet tss concentration before post secondary settling occurs by introducing these modifications to the expression for settling velocity the inferred settling velocity predicted by the model reproduced well the time dependent tss data collected during post secondary settling tests fig 2 the model setup involved a two dimensional axisymmetric grid generated using ansys meshing tm ansys workbench meshing tool vol 19 1 which consists of 21 945 cells using a quadrilateral dominant approach and 8 layers of inflation at the walls such grid could achieve grid independent results with less than 1 see supporting information ansys fluent tm ansys fluent vol 19 1 was used to implement and simulate the model a time step of 1 second was utilized in the transient simulation of settling 3 results and discussion 3 1 waste activated sludge fractionation experiments fig 1 shows the height of the solids liquid interface of the mixed liquor indicating the corresponding height and time used for the fractionation experiment mixed liquor fractionation tests confirm the expected settling behavior of the waste activated sludge sample with the liquid solid interface proceeding first a linear decline takacs et al 1991 torfs et al 2017 and then followed by a compression phase in which the settling process slows down as the blanket starts building up at the bottom using selected contact times corresponding to the dashed lines shown in fig 1 three tss supernatant concentrations were obtained i e 39 9 29 4 and 10 8 mg l tss respectively the experimental data for the post secondary settling experiments associated with the three different tss concentrations is reported in fig 2 a combination of tss and tss converted turbidity measurements were used to characterize the tss settling behavior of escaped solids using a tss turbidity correlation developed specifically for this study reported in the supporting material 3 2 velocity settling functions for tss and e coli table 1 shows the parameter values for the modified vesilind function for tss settling the purpose of characterizing the settling process in this low tss concentration is to enable the cfd model to predict tss separation and stratification when applied to chemical contact tanks it was observed that the modified vesilind settling function was also suitable to model microbial e coli settling as shown in fig 3 therefore an additional scalar transport equation to predict microbial concentration was set up in the 2d cfd model to take into account for this additional phenomenon in analogy to what was observed for solids settling fig 3 shows an initial settling behavior that can be attributed mainly to discrete settling this initial phase is followed by a tail representing the non settleable fraction of e coli which was found to be proportional to the e coli influent concentration table 2 reports the modified vesilind settling function parameters for e coli in analogy to the same process parameterization for suspended solids represented in table 1 it is important to note that the e coli non settleable fraction 77 is much higher in comparison to the non settleable tss fraction 34 this may be explained by the argument that a particle attached fraction of e coli colonies settles in accompaniment of solids settling however a large fraction of the e coli that is present in a contact tank might not be particle associated hence the importance of disinfection of the bulk liquid portion of the secondary effluent it is also possible that this non settleable fraction of e coli is associated with fine particles that are non settleable within the timescale associated with transport across the contact tank which makes this non settleable fraction of e coli appear as if it is in the free phase in general our findings are consistent with the observations on settling of tss and e coli that are previously reported to occur in natural environments garcia armisen et al 2009 fig 4 reports the correlation observed between total suspended solids and e coli concentrations when measurements were conducted on the same samples this correlation may also be used for estimating dynamic change in secondary effluent e coli concentration using a simple tss probe to enable process control under dynamic conditions 3 4 paa decomposition paa demand decay experiments in the presence of different tss concentrations 39 9 29 4 and 10 8 mg l were carried out and reported in fig 5 and following santoro et al 2015 and henao et al 2018 4 c p a a c p a a 0 d e x p k t where c p a a is paa concentration as a function of time c p a a 0 is initial paa concentration and both are expressed in mg l d is the oxidative demand mg l haas and joffe 1994 santoro et al 2015 henao et al 2018 t is contact time min and k is the decay rate constant 1 min due to initial oxidative demand a significant reduction in residual paa between 0 to 2 5 min was observed unlike the work of henao et al 2018 a linear correlation was deemed suitable to represent both the demand and decay constants as a function of tss concentration as observed by the qualitative and quantitative trending of the fits in fig 5 in this technique the paa concentration was determined as 5 c p a a t c p a a 0 m d t s s exp k b k t s s t s s t the following constant values were obtained using a least squares fit m 0 d 0 01658 k b 0 00567 1 min and k t s s 6 65e 5 1 min mg l the integrated ct dose also of importance was evaluated by the following formula 6 c t p a a t 0 t c p a a d t c p a a 0 m d t s s k b k t s s t s s 1 e k b k t s s t s s t in this way the effect of tss concentration is explicitely taken into consideration and incorporated not only into the paa demand and decay equations but in the integrated ct dose calculations as well 3 5 e coli inactivation kinetics fig 6 shows the paa dose response results for different tss and e coli concentrations it was observed that the trend of decay kinetics for e coli depended on tss concentration values this observation lead to the development of a novel inactivation kinetic model where the tss impacts on kinetic parameters were explicitely captured to do so we introduced a modification to the widely used double exponential model santoro et al 2015 manoli et al 2019 this modified form of the double exponential microbial inactivation model in the ct domain can be expressed as follows 7 n n 0 1 β exp k d t s s c t m n 0 β e x p k p t s s c t where n and n0 are the e coli instantaneous and initial before disinfection number concentrations respectively the model parameters β k d k p and m are referred to as the particle associated microbial fraction inactivation rate constants for the dispersed and particle associated microbial fractions and the shoulder effect dose exponent respectively santoro et al 2015 manoli et al 2019 a global least squares fit for the three tss concentration data sets in fig 6 resulted the values of β k d k p and m as 0 0125 0 5378 0 1616 and 1 84 respectively with k d and k p in units of 1 min mg paa mg tss in order to include microbial inactivation processes in cfd using an eulerian approach the microbial inactivation rate expression must be derived from the integral expression reported in eq 7 in perfectly mixed conditions and from eq 7 the derivative of n with respect to time is dependent on c t only since the remaining variables are not considered time dependent hence the derivative of eq 7 with respect to time can be written as follows 8 d n d t n c t d c t d t recognizing that d c t d t c p a a eq 8 can be rearranged as 9 d n d t n c t c p a a in order to satisfy this form one may cast n c t by differentiating eq 7 as 10 n c t n 0 1 β k d t s s m c t m 1 exp k d t s s c t m n 0 β k p t s s e x p k p t s s c t inserting eqs 7 9 and 10 into eq 8 we may cast the output as 11 d n d t 1 β k d m c t m 1 exp k d t s s c t m β k p exp k p t s s c t 1 β exp k d t s s c t m β exp k p t s s c t c p a a t s s n to our knowldege this expression for the microbial inactivation rate associated with the widely used double exponential model shown in eq 10 was not reported before in a cfd simulation eq 11 represents a generalized source term that may be utilized for spatially dependent simulations for achieving numerical stability numerical bracketing may be required for this rate expression and or the tss concentration to avoid numerical divergence or division over zero while using eq 11 two additional transport equations for ct and e coli as transported scalars were solved to verify the ability of the newly derived source term shown in eq 11 to describe the paa disinfection process the paa decay experiments and the corresponding inactivation profiles were simulated in cfd and compared with the observed data see supporting information 3 6 scenario analysis using computational fluid dynamics cfd we used the verified cfd model to conduct scenario analysis for the single pass hypothetical contact tank it is to be noted that while the cfd approach facilitates greater insights by considering the integrated disinfection process as a whole it also poses some challenges indeed while the state of the art of computing hardware and large memory available nowadays enabled good progress with reasonable computational times it still is time consuming to conduct large three dimensional simulations also high quality cfd analysis requires specialized skillsets for setting up simulations appropriately and for critical analysis of the results our scenario analysis focused on a single channel system where most of the inactivation and settling occurs and was achieved by varying the flowrate and the main variables affecting the disinfection process paa and tss concentrations it should be emphasized that the cfd model included settling for both tss and e coli via their batch calibrated velocity settling functions another important aspect that was considered in the cfd analysis was the impact of influent tss changes that manifest themselves during full scale plant operations in order to investigate this a coupled 2d cfd simulation model was developed for flow turbulence tss transport and settling paa transport including residual paa and ct dose as well as e coli microbial transport and settling a 2d generic single pass contact tank was modeled see fig 7 including some typical flow disturbances potentially present in a full scale system such as an underflow weir near the contact tank inlet and an overflow weir to convey the effluent to the contact tank outlet the presence of the underflow weir allowed the generation of recirculation and stagnation regions which is beneficial in showing the interaction between the hydraulics solids settling and disinfection see supporting information for grid generation and independence information the modified vesilind settling functions were utilised for both tss and e coli settling with the parameters obtained in the present work see table 1 and 2 fig 7 shows a steady state eulerian representation of the residence time distribution rtd as stated the hydraulics of the tank shows a recirculation zone due to the presence of the small vertical baffle behind the baffle the contact time becomes the highest due to flow stagnation a second high contact time zone is shown at the bottom left corner recirculation region these effects are enhanced as the hrt becomes higher due to decreasing the flowrate fig 8 illustrates the effect of settleability of tss in the contact tank at different hrt values solids stratification and settling is shown to be considerable with more observable separation as the flow slows down in the tank solids deposition and accumulation becomes considerable in the bottom of the tank especially in corners for high hrt cases and high influent tss values in this case centimeters thick blanket regions will form which are localized sources of high disinfectant demand and potential microbial regrowth solids stratification leads to an accelerated vertical anisotropic change in paa decay due to higher rate of paa decomposition induced by suspended solids fig 9 shows the steady state paa concentration contours for an influent tss concentration of 10 mg l an influent value of paa of 4 mg l can be decomposed due to instantaneous demand for as much as 44 3 in presence of an influent spike in tss reaching 90 mg l using eq 4 further gradual reduction occurs due to paa decay at an hrt value of 30 60 90 and 120 min the percentage reductions due to paa decay alone are 15 85 27 2 36 1 and 43 5 respectively three main local high decay regions may be seen from the contours a significant paa decay is observed behind the baffle due to the high local contact time and hence high ct dose the second region where decay becomes high is the left corner recirculation region due to both a considerable rise in contact time and high tss concentration due to settling it is also noted that the thin blanket layer and the two corners settling regions for hrt 120 min shows obvious effect on the paa decay as well fig 10 illustrates the steady state integrated ct dose contours for 10 mg l of tss concentration the highest build up of the ct dose is correlated to the highest local contact time as depicted in fig 7 in the stagnation region behind the baffle and the left corner recirculation region the effect of both paa decay and the high tss concentration value is also evident from the reduction of the ct doses observed fig s 11 depicts the e coli inactivation behavior as results from the use of the inactivation source term eq 11 in log units for influent tss concentration of 10 mg l this value corresponds to an influent microbial concentration of 3900 cfu 100 ml as estimated from fig 4 fig 11 shows a very efficient operating point corresponding to a low tss concentration which is also exhibiting a strong inactivation profile as evident from the inactivation kinetics plot in fig 6 the contour plot shows a strong local correlation between the ct dose and the e coli inactivation a worse operating condition develops with higher influent tss concentrations due to both a higher influent value of e coli colonies as well as a poor inactivation condition due to the high value of tss concentration see supporting information for e coli predictions at 90 mg l tss influent concentration in fig 12 the impact of a transient event is examined using the same hypothetical tank a steady state solution for an inlet tss concentration of 12 mg l was obtained in ansys fluenttm ansys fluent vol 19 1 which corresponds to a typical value of the tss concentration encountered in a wwtp operation metcalf et al 2014 the corresponding value of paa instantaneous demand decay and e coli colonies were calculated using the experimental correlations identified in this study and specified into the cfd simulation a transient inlet condition was applied where the tss concentration was gradually increased from 12 mg l to 60 mg l for a period of 1 hour this period was selected arbitrarily as a proxy for the time required to conduct an average maintainance event in a secondary clarifier or to account for natural variability that can lead to high clarifier loading such as a storm event the transition time between the two modes of operation was 20 minutes before and after the transient event which enables a quasi steady change in the influent variables a full coupling between all variables was maintained during this simulation eq 4 and fig 4 were used for specifying the change in paa demand and e coli colonies due to the change in tss concentration fig 12 illustrates the temporal variation of the outlet mass weighted average profiles as compared to the inlet profiles for the state variables considered the fig compares the system response for hrts of 20 30 and 40 min a significant delay in recovering the steady condition of operation is observed as the average hrt value increases it was observed that for 40 min of hrt it may take up to 4 hours of additional delay after the end of the transient event for the state variables to restore to their before transient values and this number of hours is increased significantly as the hrt increases further at the low tss operation mode it was observed that a greater disinfection target and hence a lower e coli concentration was achieved at higher hrts due to longer contact time from fig 12 a disinfection efficiency reduction of 0 8 1 2 and 1 6 logs may be observed for the hydraulic retention times of 20 30 and 40 min respectively in light of this it may be concluded that the effect of tss concentration on disinfection characteristics was well characterised using this simulation approach this phenomenon may explain violations that occur during water quantity quality variation events this highlights the importance of advanced disinfection control strategies able to follow transient effects in water quality manoli et al 2019 4 conclusions based on the outcome of the experimental and modeling studies reported in this paper the following can be concluded post secondary settling is an important phenomenon often neglected to date that could considerably impact wastewater disinfection efficiency in contact tanks such phenomenon can generate localized regions of high disinfection demand and decay with consequent loss of disinfection credits during full scale operations the e coli non settleable fraction observed in this study 77 was substantially higher than the tss non settleable fraction 34 indicating that a large fraction of e coli that is present in contact tanks is not attached to suspended solids i e in the free phase or it is attached to the fine particles that are non settleable a tss settling model for post secondary settling was developed and calibrated against experimental data obtained for three different tss concentrations the model was also successfully calibrated to represent microbial e coli settling in laboratory conditions and applied to cfd simulation of municipal contact tanks a mechanistic model to incorporate the tss concentration effects on paa instantaneous demand and decay ct dose and microbial inactivation was successfully developed the rate expression of the double exponential disinfection model was also analytically derived for the first time and included in the cfd model at high contact times tss and e coli settling becomes a considerable phenomenon with the cfd analysis being able to capture and visualize well the convoluted effect of tss concentration on paa demand decay and ct dose the cfd results also shows that influent tss concentration variability may strongly affect e coli inactivation causing potential losses in disinfection credits up to 0 8 1 2 and 1 6 logs for hydraulic retention times of 20 30 and 40 min respectively once further validation evidence is collected e g calibration against different water qualities and validation against full scale secondary effluent data the model presented in this study could be particularly useful for optimization and control of paa disinfection efficiency in

16887,while the impact of suspended solids on chemical disinfection kinetics has been widely recognized a detailed modeling framework for assessing their contribution on disinfection efficiency in municipal contact tanks is yet unavailable in this paper we conducted experimental and modeling studies to mechanistically describe the interplay between suspended solids not removed by gravity settling in secondary clarifiers and disinfection performance of an emerging disinfectant peracetic acid operated in a municipal contact tank specifically we developed an integrated computational fluid dynamics cfd model to simultaneously predict the fate and transport of suspended solids escherichia coli and peracetic acid in a hypothetical reactor using an exposure based i e ct based inactivation rate expression the integrated cfd model calibrated against laboratory data was used to gain insights on the vertical distribution and local paa decay effect associated with solids settling and their impact on disinfectant decay and microbial inactivation results indicated that a solids settling in contact tanks is a significant phenomenon that cannot be neglected which can substantially impact disinfection efficiency under low flow conditions b vertical solids distribution and stratification in contact tanks can strongly affect escherichia coli inactivation by peracetic acid as highlighted by the cfd modeling studies c escherichia coli settling is experimentally measurable and strongly correlated with solids settling these phenomena can be successfully integrated

2001 understanding water quality impacts on paa disinfection efficiency santoro et al 2015 henao et al 2018 manoli et al 2019 as well as optimizing the use of paa for municipal application is a topic of primary research interest that is driven by the need of minimizing cost of treatment and environmental impact paa is known to undergo spontaneous decomposition in aqueous solutions yuan et al 1997 it has also been observed that suspended solids can significantly impact the decay of paa koivunen et al 2005 falsanisi et al 2006 qualitatively paa decomposition takes the form of a rapid decay i e instantaneous demand followed by a slower rate i e decay henao et al 2018 manoli et al 2019 the instantaneous demand is an initial rapid consumption that occurs when paa is introduced to wastewater due to rapidly oxidizable organic and inorganic compounds haas joffe 1994 the second stage decay is a more gradual decomposition of the oxidant commonly well described by a first order chemical reaction haas joffe 1994 koivunen et al 2005 falsanisi et al 2006 while considerable effort has been made to characterize the total suspended solids tss impact on disinfection efficiency koivunen et al 2005 falsanisi et al 2006 henao et al 2018 the formulation of scalable exposure based or ct based inactivation kinetic models that are able to relate tss concentration and inactivation kinetic parameters is still a subject of current research the availability of such models is key for process sizing and operation as a matter of fact tss concentration can vary considerably depending on the upstream treatment efficacy of the separation processes employed in the plant as well as local factors including seasonality and climate conditions water temperature viscosity rainfall and sewer characteristics etc it is known that solids settling and accumulation in contact tanks are potential causes for loss in disinfection efficiency and microbial regrowth while settling of primary and secondary particles has been widely investigated the characterization and mechanistic understanding of post secondary settling i e settling of particles escaping from the secondary clarifier has not received adequate attention to date moreover the prediction of fate and transport of total suspended solids in conventional settling units has been based mostly on simplified one dimensional models vesilind 1968 takacs et al 1991 flamant et al 2004 bürger et al 2011 and was only recently extended to the use of computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation strategies lakehal et al 1999 medina and laurent 2020 within the cfd framework of analysis one approach is eulerian kahane et al 2002 medina and laurent 2020 where both phases solids and water have their own momentum equations solved with considering a momentum exchange between the phases a second approach depends on solving the momentum transport equation for the water phase while using a lagrangian particle tracking model wicklein et al 2016 to solve the settling of discrete particles solid phase the third and most common approach relies on a mixture model i e uses only one momentum equation for the mixture in this approach to account for tss settling without adding a solids momentum equation a settling flux is empirically introduced to represent tss momentum transport in the gravitational direction such flux is added to the convection term of the tss concentration equation using an empirically derived and calibrated settling velocity expression also known as the settling function this approach was originally developed for 1d models vesilind 1968 takacs et al 1991 flamant et al 2004 bürger et al 2011 and later was extended to 2d 3d models mainly for the analysis of secondary clarifiers lakehal et al 1999 bürger et al 2011 medina and laurent 2020 to date different types of settling functions have been proposed in the literature the most widely used functions are those of vesilind 1968 takacs et al 1991 and diehl 2015 the vesilind function is popular due to its simple form i e an exponential decay equation with only two parameters required for calibration diehl s function is a power law function that has three constants and is a relatively recent development diehl 2015 medina and laurent 2020 the most widely used function in wastewater treatment process simulations has been proposed by takacs et al 1991 and contains five parameters that are arranged in a double exponential form it has been derived to describe settling phenomena observed in secondary clarifiers especifically generally settling behaviors have been associated with differences in solids characteristics such as particle size distribution floc structure particle material and presence of specific floc forming organisms takacs et al 1991 torfs et al 2017 these factors lead to different settling behaviors such as discrete settling hindered settling flocculent settling and blanket compression flamant et al 2004 bürger et al 2011 torfs et al 2017 discrete settling occurs when the concentration of tss is relatively low and particles do not interact with each other in a substantial manner under those circumstances the other settling behaviors can be neglected in the present work it is hypothesized that this settling regime also applies to particles escaping the secondary clarification stage and entering a contact tank chemical disinfection unit with secondary settling effluents typically not exceeding an average of tss concentration of 10 20 mg l and peaks that are not surpassing 100 mg l to the best of our knowledge tss settling in municipal contact tanks used for chemical disinfection and its impact on inactivation efficiency has received little attention to date due to the fact that chemical contact tanks are designed for average flow and average suspended solids conditions and considering the high variability in wastewater characteristics resulting from the different sewer systems and local climate conditions even optimally designed chemical contact tanks may operate under conditions leading to considerable settling as anecdotally reported in several instances indeed low flow conditions may result in locally low flow horizontal velocity thus leading to gravitational settling and solids stratification in the contact tank moreover solids accumulation at the bottom of the contact tank may induce accelerated disinfectant quenching and regrowth conditions which are also very problematic for disinfection these issues are even more exacerbated in poorly designed tanks where the accumulation of solids at the bottom of the system could also lead to fermentation and more pronouced regrowth due to the presence of a microbially active region where microbial concentration is potentially very high in this paper we conducted experimental and modeling studies to investigate paa disinfection in presence of post secondary tss settling in municipal contact tanks batch experiments were conducted to verify the hypotheses behind this work and to quantify the paa demand decay and the inactivation profiles of escherichia coli e coli observed paa and e coli inactivation kinetics were modelled using the double exponential exposure based ct based inactivation model which was extended to analytically incorporate the impact of tss as such results presented in this manuscript extend the findings of previous studies stampi et al 2001 falsanisi et al 2006 santoro et al 2007 2015 maffettone et al 2017 henao et al 2018 where ct based approaches were used to control paa disinfection a fully coupled computational fluid dynamics cfd model was developed to simultaneously predict in a single pass contact tank solids transport and settling paa demand and decay as well as e coli transport and inactivation the cfd model was verified and used to conduct a dynamic assessment of spikes in tss concentration on e coli inactivation efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 mixed liquor fractionation samples were collected from the influent stream to the secondary clarifier of the local wastewater treatment plant wwtp of pottersburg located in london on canada the wwtp consists of a conventional facility composed of preliminary treatment denitrification nitrification in an activated sludge system followed by secondary circular clarification tanks each collected sample underwent a two step procedure in the first step the mixed liquor was settled in batch mode and the position of the suspension liquid interface was measured at different time intervals in order to minimize wall effects the batch settling experiment was carried out in a sufficiently wide container consisting of a standard 2000 ml wide cylindrical beaker which was 13 cm in diameter and 15 cm in height a timer was used for recording the time at different interface heights the second step consisted of gently collecting the supernatant produced with the first step experiment using a large mouth pipette i e the batch simulated secondary effluent and subsequently subjecting it to a second settling experiment herein referred to as post secondary settling experiment to simulate the residual settling potentially occurring in a dowstream contact tank this two steps procedure was repeated in triplicate for each condition to obtain a sufficiently large and representative sample specifically three different settling times were established by observing the corresponding times at which the solids liquid interface of the mixed liquor reached 1600 1200 and 800 ml in the graduated beaker at which the supernatant collection process was carried out this allowed mimicking different solids separation efficiency for the secondary clarifier while keeping the non settleable consitutents identical in the fractionated samples the volumes and the corresponding sampling times were selected to achieve the widest possible range of tss concentrations in the supernatant it should be mentioned that the selection of these three settling conditions i e volumes and corresponding times was confirmed after a number of preliminary experiments to visually characterize the time dependent behaviour of the sludge water interface the appropriateness of these experimental conditions was further confirmed by the tss levels obtained in the supernatants which bracketed very well the values observed in full scale plants for secondary effluents it is also important to note that the choice of fractionating by gravitational settling the same waste activated sludge sample was justified by the experimental requirement of having in the same sub samples the same amounts of dissolved and non settleable constituents 2 2 turbidity tss correlation during batch disinfection experiments tss measurements were carried out according to the standard method 2540 american public health associatio 2018 using a 100 ml wastewater volume paired turbidity tests were also carried out using a standard turbidimeter hach 2100an turbidimeter such that an experimental correlation between tss and turbidity could be developed thus allowing for an increase in sample frequency with minimal disturbance of the settling experiments due to the much lower volume required for turbidity measurement i e 20 ml turbidity was reported in nephelometric turbidity units ntu sadar 1998 the importance of intensively calibrating the turbidity suspended solids correlation stems from considerations summarized in bhargava and mariam 1991 clifford et al 1995 2 3 post secondary settling experiments in analogy with the batch settling experiment conducted for mixed liquor solids fractionation the supernatant obtained from such tests was subjected to a second settling experiment to determine the post secondary settling velocity as a function of the residual tss concentration it should be noted that this is the settling behavior that is most relevant for disinfection purposes since it conceptually represents the residual settling of solids escaping from the secondary clarifier and entering a contact tank settling experiments were conducted using a 2000 ml cylindrical column which was 8 cm in diameter and 40 cm in height the column was selected to be taller than the mixed liquor fractionation beaker in order to better observe the settling behavior in this low tss concentration range before starting the experiment the collected aliquots obtained from the fractionation test were gently mixed to uniformly re suspend the tss in the sample immediately after mixing the sample a timer started to record the settling time the turbidity of water was followed over time during the experiment by gently sampling 20 ml of wastewater from the top of the column using a pipette then a glass vial was filled with this extract and tested in the turbidity meter thanks to the low amount of water required for turbidity measurement the water level in the settling column dropped only 4 mm 1 of total depth we also hypothesized that the dispersed and particle associated nature of e coli present in wastewater could undergo separation by gravitational forces acting on the suspended solids therefore additional experiments were conducted using the same cylinder to measure at discrete time steps the e coli concentration using standard method 9222 of membrane filtration of the coliform group american public health association 2018 the same method was used to enumerate viable e coli during paa inactivation experiments 2 5 paa demand and decay during the disinfection experiments the effects of tss on paa demand decay as well as on e coli inactivation by paa were characterized specifically the three experimentally simulated secondary settled wastewater fractionated with the method described in section 2 1 and sampled by obtaining the supernatant were tested over a 40 min contact time in a completely mixed disinfection batch reactor 1000 ml glass beaker gently agitated by a magnetic stirrer to avoid further settling and operated at room temperature an aliquot of a paa stock solution 12 paa w w was applied to deliver a paa initial concentration before instantaneous demand of 4 mg l immediately after adding the paa a timer was started and samples were collected at five contact times of 2 5 5 10 20 and 40 minutes respectively at each established contact time 40 ml were sampled and 5 drops of paa quenching solution were added to quench the residual oxidant and stop the disinfection process 2 6 the settling model in order to develop settling functions that are specific to the tss concentration range observed in disinfection contact tanks we developed a two dimensional 2d axisymmetric cfd model for the previously described post secondary settling experiments a vesilind settling function was modified and incorporated in the cfd model as a momentum flux using a user defined function that implements the settling velocity function parameters in implementing the settling function approach in the two dimensional axisymmetric problem for the settling column the solids transport equation may be represented with the following form lakehal et al 1999 1 c t v s c x x d c x 1 y y d c y where c t x y and d represent the tss concentration time vertical gravity and radial coordinates and tss diffusivity a low value of 10 9 m2 s is utilized respectively while v s represents the settling velocity which is estimated using the settling function using the 2 d cfd model extended to batch settling a study was conducted to identify the optimal settling parameters that could satisfactorily describe the observed tss settling and optimally fit the experimental data see fig 2 the study started with initially guessed settling function parameters moreover to avoid any local minimum in the objective function associated with the minimization of the sum of squared errors multiple starting points were selected to search for the optimal parameters the selection of vesilind function is justified by the discrete regime of solids settling due to highly diluted particles as confirmed by the good fit obtained using the 2 d cfd model however a modification of the settling function was required to consider the non settleable portion of tss the modified vesilind function was preferred over takacs s function takacs et al 1991 due to the lower number of calibration parameters involved and the discrete settling nature expected to occur in the post secondary settling experiments conducted in our study indeed the vesilind function has only two parameters namely v 0 and k where v 0 is the initial settling velocity and k is an exponential decay constant that represents tss concentration dependence we have expanded this function by introducing an additional parameter i e c m i n to capture the tail in the experimental data as such the modified vesilind expression used in this paper may be represented as 2 v s v 0 e x p k c c m i n with the minimum non settleable tss concentration defined as follows 3 c m i n f n s c i n where f n s is a non settleable fraction takacs et al 1991 and c i n is the inlet tss concentration before post secondary settling occurs by introducing these modifications to the expression for settling velocity the inferred settling velocity predicted by the model reproduced well the time dependent tss data collected during post secondary settling tests fig 2 the model setup involved a two dimensional axisymmetric grid generated using ansys meshing tm ansys workbench meshing tool vol 19 1 which consists of 21 945 cells using a quadrilateral dominant approach and 8 layers of inflation at the walls such grid could achieve grid independent results with less than 1 see supporting information ansys fluent tm ansys fluent vol 19 1 was used to implement and simulate the model a time step of 1 second was utilized in the transient simulation of settling 3 results and discussion 3 1 waste activated sludge fractionation experiments fig 1 shows the height of the solids liquid interface of the mixed liquor indicating the corresponding height and time used for the fractionation experiment mixed liquor fractionation tests confirm the expected settling behavior of the waste activated sludge sample with the liquid solid interface proceeding first a linear decline takacs et al 1991 torfs et al 2017 and then followed by a compression phase in which the settling process slows down as the blanket starts building up at the bottom using selected contact times corresponding to the dashed lines shown in fig 1 three tss supernatant concentrations were obtained i e 39 9 29 4 and 10 8 mg l tss respectively the experimental data for the post secondary settling experiments associated with the three different tss concentrations is reported in fig 2 a combination of tss and tss converted turbidity measurements were used to characterize the tss settling behavior of escaped solids using a tss turbidity correlation developed specifically for this study reported in the supporting material 3 2 velocity settling functions for tss and e coli table 1 shows the parameter values for the modified vesilind function for tss settling the purpose of characterizing the settling process in this low tss concentration is to enable the cfd model to predict tss separation and stratification when applied to chemical contact tanks it was observed that the modified vesilind settling function was also suitable to model microbial e coli settling as shown in fig 3 therefore an additional scalar transport equation to predict microbial concentration was set up in the 2d cfd model to take into account for this additional phenomenon in analogy to what was observed for solids settling fig 3 shows an initial settling behavior that can be attributed mainly to discrete settling this initial phase is followed by a tail representing the non settleable fraction of e coli which was found to be proportional to the e coli influent concentration table 2 reports the modified vesilind settling function parameters for e coli in analogy to the same process parameterization for suspended solids represented in table 1 it is important to note that the e coli non settleable fraction 77 is much higher in comparison to the non settleable tss fraction 34 this may be explained by the argument that a particle attached fraction of e coli colonies settles in accompaniment of solids settling however a large fraction of the e coli that is present in a contact tank might not be particle associated hence the importance of disinfection of the bulk liquid portion of the secondary effluent it is also possible that this non settleable fraction of e coli is associated with fine particles that are non settleable within the timescale associated with transport across the contact tank which makes this non settleable fraction of e coli appear as if it is in the free phase in general our findings are consistent with the observations on settling of tss and e coli that are previously reported to occur in natural environments garcia armisen et al 2009 fig 4 reports the correlation observed between total suspended solids and e coli concentrations when measurements were conducted on the same samples this correlation may also be used for estimating dynamic change in secondary effluent e coli concentration using a simple tss probe to enable process control under dynamic conditions 3 4 paa decomposition paa demand decay experiments in the presence of different tss concentrations 39 9 29 4 and 10 8 mg l were carried out and reported in fig 5 and following santoro et al 2015 and henao et al 2018 4 c p a a c p a a 0 d e x p k t where c p a a is paa concentration as a function of time c p a a 0 is initial paa concentration and both are expressed in mg l d is the oxidative demand mg l haas and joffe 1994 santoro et al 2015 henao et al 2018 t is contact time min and k is the decay rate constant 1 min due to initial oxidative demand a significant reduction in residual paa between 0 to 2 5 min was observed unlike the work of henao et al 2018 a linear correlation was deemed suitable to represent both the demand and decay constants as a function of tss concentration as observed by the qualitative and quantitative trending of the fits in fig 5 in this technique the paa concentration was determined as 5 c p a a t c p a a 0 m d t s s exp k b k t s s t s s t the following constant values were obtained using a least squares fit m 0 d 0 01658 k b 0 00567 1 min and k t s s 6 65e 5 1 min mg l the integrated ct dose also of importance was evaluated by the following formula 6 c t p a a t 0 t c p a a d t c p a a 0 m d t s s k b k t s s t s s 1 e k b k t s s t s s t in this way the effect of tss concentration is explicitely taken into consideration and incorporated not only into the paa demand and decay equations but in the integrated ct dose calculations as well 3 5 e coli inactivation kinetics fig 6 shows the paa dose response results for different tss and e coli concentrations it was observed that the trend of decay kinetics for e coli depended on tss concentration values this observation lead to the development of a novel inactivation kinetic model where the tss impacts on kinetic parameters were explicitely captured to do so we introduced a modification to the widely used double exponential model santoro et al 2015 manoli et al 2019 this modified form of the double exponential microbial inactivation model in the ct domain can be expressed as follows 7 n n 0 1 β exp k d t s s c t m n 0 β e x p k p t s s c t where n and n0 are the e coli instantaneous and initial before disinfection number concentrations respectively the model parameters β k d k p and m are referred to as the particle associated microbial fraction inactivation rate constants for the dispersed and particle associated microbial fractions and the shoulder effect dose exponent respectively santoro et al 2015 manoli et al 2019 a global least squares fit for the three tss concentration data sets in fig 6 resulted the values of β k d k p and m as 0 0125 0 5378 0 1616 and 1 84 respectively with k d and k p in units of 1 min mg paa mg tss in order to include microbial inactivation processes in cfd using an eulerian approach the microbial inactivation rate expression must be derived from the integral expression reported in eq 7 in perfectly mixed conditions and from eq 7 the derivative of n with respect to time is dependent on c t only since the remaining variables are not considered time dependent hence the derivative of eq 7 with respect to time can be written as follows 8 d n d t n c t d c t d t recognizing that d c t d t c p a a eq 8 can be rearranged as 9 d n d t n c t c p a a in order to satisfy this form one may cast n c t by differentiating eq 7 as 10 n c t n 0 1 β k d t s s m c t m 1 exp k d t s s c t m n 0 β k p t s s e x p k p t s s c t inserting eqs 7 9 and 10 into eq 8 we may cast the output as 11 d n d t 1 β k d m c t m 1 exp k d t s s c t m β k p exp k p t s s c t 1 β exp k d t s s c t m β exp k p t s s c t c p a a t s s n to our knowldege this expression for the microbial inactivation rate associated with the widely used double exponential model shown in eq 10 was not reported before in a cfd simulation eq 11 represents a generalized source term that may be utilized for spatially dependent simulations for achieving numerical stability numerical bracketing may be required for this rate expression and or the tss concentration to avoid numerical divergence or division over zero while using eq 11 two additional transport equations for ct and e coli as transported scalars were solved to verify the ability of the newly derived source term shown in eq 11 to describe the paa disinfection process the paa decay experiments and the corresponding inactivation profiles were simulated in cfd and compared with the observed data see supporting information 3 6 scenario analysis using computational fluid dynamics cfd we used the verified cfd model to conduct scenario analysis for the single pass hypothetical contact tank it is to be noted that while the cfd approach facilitates greater insights by considering the integrated disinfection process as a whole it also poses some challenges indeed while the state of the art of computing hardware and large memory available nowadays enabled good progress with reasonable computational times it still is time consuming to conduct large three dimensional simulations also high quality cfd analysis requires specialized skillsets for setting up simulations appropriately and for critical analysis of the results our scenario analysis focused on a single channel system where most of the inactivation and settling occurs and was achieved by varying the flowrate and the main variables affecting the disinfection process paa and tss concentrations it should be emphasized that the cfd model included settling for both tss and e coli via their batch calibrated velocity settling functions another important aspect that was considered in the cfd analysis was the impact of influent tss changes that manifest themselves during full scale plant operations in order to investigate this a coupled 2d cfd simulation model was developed for flow turbulence tss transport and settling paa transport including residual paa and ct dose as well as e coli microbial transport and settling a 2d generic single pass contact tank was modeled see fig 7 including some typical flow disturbances potentially present in a full scale system such as an underflow weir near the contact tank inlet and an overflow weir to convey the effluent to the contact tank outlet the presence of the underflow weir allowed the generation of recirculation and stagnation regions which is beneficial in showing the interaction between the hydraulics solids settling and disinfection see supporting information for grid generation and independence information the modified vesilind settling functions were utilised for both tss and e coli settling with the parameters obtained in the present work see table 1 and 2 fig 7 shows a steady state eulerian representation of the residence time distribution rtd as stated the hydraulics of the tank shows a recirculation zone due to the presence of the small vertical baffle behind the baffle the contact time becomes the highest due to flow stagnation a second high contact time zone is shown at the bottom left corner recirculation region these effects are enhanced as the hrt becomes higher due to decreasing the flowrate fig 8 illustrates the effect of settleability of tss in the contact tank at different hrt values solids stratification and settling is shown to be considerable with more observable separation as the flow slows down in the tank solids deposition and accumulation becomes considerable in the bottom of the tank especially in corners for high hrt cases and high influent tss values in this case centimeters thick blanket regions will form which are localized sources of high disinfectant demand and potential microbial regrowth solids stratification leads to an accelerated vertical anisotropic change in paa decay due to higher rate of paa decomposition induced by suspended solids fig 9 shows the steady state paa concentration contours for an influent tss concentration of 10 mg l an influent value of paa of 4 mg l can be decomposed due to instantaneous demand for as much as 44 3 in presence of an influent spike in tss reaching 90 mg l using eq 4 further gradual reduction occurs due to paa decay at an hrt value of 30 60 90 and 120 min the percentage reductions due to paa decay alone are 15 85 27 2 36 1 and 43 5 respectively three main local high decay regions may be seen from the contours a significant paa decay is observed behind the baffle due to the high local contact time and hence high ct dose the second region where decay becomes high is the left corner recirculation region due to both a considerable rise in contact time and high tss concentration due to settling it is also noted that the thin blanket layer and the two corners settling regions for hrt 120 min shows obvious effect on the paa decay as well fig 10 illustrates the steady state integrated ct dose contours for 10 mg l of tss concentration the highest build up of the ct dose is correlated to the highest local contact time as depicted in fig 7 in the stagnation region behind the baffle and the left corner recirculation region the effect of both paa decay and the high tss concentration value is also evident from the reduction of the ct doses observed fig s 11 depicts the e coli inactivation behavior as results from the use of the inactivation source term eq 11 in log units for influent tss concentration of 10 mg l this value corresponds to an influent microbial concentration of 3900 cfu 100 ml as estimated from fig 4 fig 11 shows a very efficient operating point corresponding to a low tss concentration which is also exhibiting a strong inactivation profile as evident from the inactivation kinetics plot in fig 6 the contour plot shows a strong local correlation between the ct dose and the e coli inactivation a worse operating condition develops with higher influent tss concentrations due to both a higher influent value of e coli colonies as well as a poor inactivation condition due to the high value of tss concentration see supporting information for e coli predictions at 90 mg l tss influent concentration in fig 12 the impact of a transient event is examined using the same hypothetical tank a steady state solution for an inlet tss concentration of 12 mg l was obtained in ansys fluenttm ansys fluent vol 19 1 which corresponds to a typical value of the tss concentration encountered in a wwtp operation metcalf et al 2014 the corresponding value of paa instantaneous demand decay and e coli colonies were calculated using the experimental correlations identified in this study and specified into the cfd simulation a transient inlet condition was applied where the tss concentration was gradually increased from 12 mg l to 60 mg l for a period of 1 hour this period was selected arbitrarily as a proxy for the time required to conduct an average maintainance event in a secondary clarifier or to account for natural variability that can lead to high clarifier loading such as a storm event the transition time between the two modes of operation was 20 minutes before and after the transient event which enables a quasi steady change in the influent variables a full coupling between all variables was maintained during this simulation eq 4 and fig 4 were used for specifying the change in paa demand and e coli colonies due to the change in tss concentration fig 12 illustrates the temporal variation of the outlet mass weighted average profiles as compared to the inlet profiles for the state variables considered the fig compares the system response for hrts of 20 30 and 40 min a significant delay in recovering the steady condition of operation is observed as the average hrt value increases it was observed that for 40 min of hrt it may take up to 4 hours of additional delay after the end of the transient event for the state variables to restore to their before transient values and this number of hours is increased significantly as the hrt increases further at the low tss operation mode it was observed that a greater disinfection target and hence a lower e coli concentration was achieved at higher hrts due to longer contact time from fig 12 a disinfection efficiency reduction of 0 8 1 2 and 1 6 logs may be observed for the hydraulic retention times of 20 30 and 40 min respectively in light of this it may be concluded that the effect of tss concentration on disinfection characteristics was well characterised using this simulation approach this phenomenon may explain violations that occur during water quantity quality variation events this highlights the importance of advanced disinfection control strategies able to follow transient effects in water quality manoli et al 2019 4 conclusions based on the outcome of the experimental and modeling studies reported in this paper the following can be concluded post secondary settling is an important phenomenon often neglected to date that could considerably impact wastewater disinfection efficiency in contact tanks such phenomenon can generate localized regions of high disinfection demand and decay with consequent loss of disinfection credits during full scale operations the e coli non settleable fraction observed in this study 77 was substantially higher than the tss non settleable fraction 34 indicating that a large fraction of e coli that is present in contact tanks is not attached to suspended solids i e in the free phase or it is attached to the fine particles that are non settleable a tss settling model for post secondary settling was developed and calibrated against experimental data obtained for three different tss concentrations the model was also successfully calibrated to represent microbial e coli settling in laboratory conditions and applied to cfd simulation of municipal contact tanks a mechanistic model to incorporate the tss concentration effects on paa instantaneous demand and decay ct dose and microbial inactivation was successfully developed the rate expression of the double exponential disinfection model was also analytically derived for the first time and included in the cfd model at high contact times tss and e coli settling becomes a considerable phenomenon with the cfd analysis being able to capture and visualize well the convoluted effect of tss concentration on paa demand decay and ct dose the cfd results also shows that influent tss concentration variability may strongly affect e coli inactivation causing potential losses in disinfection credits up to 0 8 1 2 and 1 6 logs for hydraulic retention times of 20 30 and 40 min respectively once further validation evidence is collected e g calibration against different water qualities and validation against full scale secondary effluent data the model presented in this study could be particularly useful for optimization and control of paa disinfection efficiency in

16888,microplastic particles mps are ubiquitous pollutants widely found in aquatic ecosystems although mps are mostly retained in wastewater treatment plants wwtps a high number of mps reaches the open waters potentially contributing to the spread of pathogenic bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes in the environment nowadays a limited number of studies have focused on the role of mps as carriers of potentially pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria in wwtps thus an investigation on the community composition by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and the abundance of antibiotic and metal resistance genes by qpcr of the biofilm on mps the plastisphere and of planktonic bacteria in treated pre and post disinfection wastewaters was performed mps resulted to be very similar in terms of type color size and chemical composition before and after the disinfection the bacterial community on mps differed from the planktonic community in terms of richness composition and structure of the community network potentially pathogenic bacteria generally showed higher abundances in treated wastewater than in the biofilm on mps furthermore among the tested resistance genes only sul2 a common resistance gene against sulfonamides resulted to be more abundant in the plastisphere than in the planktonic bacterial community our results suggest that the wastewater plastisphere could promote the spread of pathogenic bacteria and resistance genes in aquatic environment although with a relatively lower contribution than the wastewater planktonic bacterial community graphical

ecologically major concerns are related to microplastic particles mps plastic fragments with dimensions comprised between 1 µm and 5 mm frias and nash 2019 which share features like durability and

be divided into primary mps directly manufactured in small size salvador cesa et al 2017 and secondary mps derived from the breakdown of larger pieces as a result of physical and or chemical damage naik et al 2020 smith et al 2018 wright et al 2013 mps can be considered a complex dynamic mixture of polymers and additives to which organic material and contaminants can successively bind to form an ecocorona with a peculiar density surface charge bioavailability and toxicity galloway et al 2017 this means that mps in the environment create inhabitable surfaces characterized by a specific

of wastewater derived bacteria eckert et al 2018 within wastewater treatments disinfection is the only specifically designed step to lower the load of pathogenic microorganisms zhang et al 2020 to date the efficacy of disinfection in abating resistance genes is debated with some studies reporting a general tendency towards their decrease together with the reduction of the viable bacterial cell

et al 2018 singh and sharma 2008 and reduces the mps load hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 but it can also influence the bacterial community composition of treated wastewater and its resistome alexander et al 2016 for these reasons we evaluated the abundance and the persistence of resistance genes and potentially pathogenic bacteria in wastewater in the biofilm on mps and in the planktonic bacterial community before and after the disinfection treatment therefore we selected an urban wwtp applying ozonation as disinfection treatment sampling it once a week for three weeks we assessed the mps abatement along the wwtp comparing their amount in the inlet pre and post disinfection water then we tested the effect of disinfection on the abundance of selected resistance genes and class 1 integrons on mps biofilm and within the planktonic bacterial communities to conclude we compared the plastisphere and the planktonic bacterial community both at the pre and post disinfection step with a particular focus on potentially pathogenic bacteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 wwtp sampling the sampled wwtp is located in the north of italy in an area characterized by a level of anthropogenic impact at the highest in europe alias et al 2019 after a primary screen 3 mm mesh size the wwtp consists of a settler followed by biological denitrification oxidation and 40 µm membrane filtration supplementary figure s1 final disinfection is done through ozone treatment the dosage of which is determined according to the flow rate and never exceeds 20 g m3 the facility is built to serve more than 100000 population equivalent but it is only used to serve less than 70000 people the sewage collected by this plant comes approximately in equal parts from an urban area and industries samples were collected in october 2019 once a week for three weeks with stable dry weather conditions this timing was chosen to minimize the influence of other factors such as seasonality the chosen sampling points were 1 after the primary grids placed at the entrance of the system named in 2 before the disinfection treatment named pre and 3 after disinfection at the outlet of the wwtp named post see supplementary figure s1 in sample was collected using an auto sampler installed immediately after the initial screen grid working with a flow rate of 1 l h 1 for a total of 3 h as already done in other studies michielssen et al 2016 simon et al 2018 talvitie et al 2017 and stored at 4 c until further analyses pre and post composite samples were collected with a membrane pump with a flow rate of 30 l h 1 operated for 3 h resulting in the collection of 100 l each sampling time was chosen according to the hydraulic retention time of the different sections of the plant as highlighted by lares et al 2018 pre samples were collected 30 h after the respective in samples whereas post samples were collected 30 minutes after the collection of pre samples the choice of a composite sample of 3 h was preferred over grab punctual samples to decrease the probability of small errors in the calculation of the hydraulic retention time for each sampling site high turbulence points were chosen to ensure a homogeneous collection of mps floating on the surface and in the water column pre and post samples were in situ filtered onto a 25 µm stainless steel sieve to maximize the particle retention while ensuring a good filtration rate following previous studies 25 µm ziajahromi et al 2017 20 µm talvitie et al 2017 20 µm michielssen et al 2016 20 µm carr et al 2016 the stainless steel sieve was carefully washed with mps free deionized water and the retained particulate was transferred to a glass bottle and stored at 4 c until further analyses 1 l of the filtrate fraction smaller than 25 µm of the pre and post wastewaters was stored at 4 c and further processed for the analysis of the planktonic bacterial community within 5 h from the sampling a schematic representation of the experimental set up is given in supplementary figure s1 2 2 mps isolation quantification and classification once in the laboratory the retained particulate from pre and post samples was vacuum filtered onto custom made 25 µm polyester net filters with hot sealed border to avoid mps release and washed with autoclaved mps free deionized water 240 ml of the in subsamples were treated with h2o2 30 1 1 v v incubated at 60 c for 30 min and then for 72 h at room temperature occasionally mixed by carefully manual shaking of the bottle at the end of the incubation the mixture was vacuum filtered onto a custom made 25 µm polyester filter and thoroughly washed with mps free deionized water filters were stored in glass petri jars to avoid contamination mps isolation was performed through visual sorting of the material collected on the filters under a stereomicroscope zeiss n 475053 equipped with 8x 12x 20x and 50x magnification and with the help of a stainless steel needle general rules were followed to distinguish between natural and synthetic particles like the homogeneity and artificiality of coloration absence of cellular or other organic structures and resistance to rupture mohamed nor and obbard 2014 putative mps were classified according to their shape as fragments thick particles with irregular dimensions films irregular in shape but thin and flexible beads round mps with a spherical shape and fibers long filaments with a constant diameter all the isolated mps were counted their color was annotated and their major dimension was measured with an amscope md500 ck camera and the software provided by the seller amscope v3 7 united scope llc irvine california usa periodically calibrated according to their major dimension mps were also categorized in size classes smaller than 99 µm 100 499 µm 500 999 µm 1000 1999 2000 4999 µm bigger than 5000 µm subsamples of particles isolated from the in pre and post samples corresponding to 5 8 of the total were further analyzed for the chemical composition of mps putative mps were collected from the filters and stored in a solution of h2o2 30 1 1 v v to eliminate the biofilm on their surface the ratio between true plastic particles within the pool of putative mps analyzed by ft ir was applied to the counts done through visual sorting to calculate the actual concentration of mps in the samples retention efficiency was calculated as the ratio between the concentration in the post and in samples multiplied by 100 comparisons in mps abundance according to treatment step in pre or post and sampling dates were assessed by anova in r 3 6 0 environment r core team 2019 using either the concentration or the normalized abundance as the response variable followed by a tukey honestly significant difference hsd test to disentangle the significant effects of predictors with more than two levels because proportion data were compared values were divided by 100 and the arcsine value of their squared root was used for the anova analysis to account for the assumptions of the test crawley 2012 differences were considered significant at p 0 05 particular attention was paid to minimize the risk of contamination with mps from other sources clean cotton laboratory coats and natural latex gloves were worn during all the steps of the laboratory work to avoid any possible mps contamination mps free deionized water was filtered onto 0 22 µm nitrocellulose filters mf membrane millipore and h2o2 30 was filtered onto glass fiber filters gf c whatman laboratory equipment was washed thrice with filtered distilled water just before use and the 25 µm filters were visually checked at the stereomicroscope for mps presence immediately before the utilization procedural blank controls were performed in parallel to all protocol steps and the number of mps found was negligible 2 3 mps chemical characterization different particles identified with the stereomicroscope were collected on a silicon filter diameter of 13 mm and pore size of 5 µm purchased from smart membrane germany and characterized by an infrared spectrophotometer coupled with a microscope the ft ir spectra of fragments fibers beads and films were acquired with a thermo scientific nicolet in 10 infrared microscope equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride liquid nitrogen cooled detector the measurements were performed in attenuated total reflection mode with a germanium crystal from 4000 to 650 cm 1 averaging 64 scansions at 4 cm 1 spectral resolution 2 4 dna extraction to characterize the planktonic bacterial communities a volume of 200 300 ml of the pre and post wastewater already filtered onto 25 µm stainless steel sieve for the particulate retention was further filtered onto 0 22 µm polycarbonate filters cut in three sections and each one processed for dna extraction to analyze the biofilm forming bacteria for each pre and post sample three pooled mps subsamples were prepared collecting with tweezers between 25 and 45 mps during the visual sorting for the precise number of mps in each pool see supplementary table s1 every mp was washed with a few drops of autoclaved mps free water to avoid unspecific carryover and collected in dna extraction tubes dna from pooled mps and pre and post filters was extracted following the protocol suggested in debeljak et al 2017 using the qiagen powersoil kit with some modifications in detail 5 mg of zirconia beads were added to each extraction tube using a homogenizer precellys 24 bertin technologies for the bead beating three times at 6000 rpm for 30 s with 1 min of break in between each homogenization step the dna samples were then divided into two aliquots one was used for the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing while the other one was four fold diluted and processed for qpcr assays 2 5 antibiotic and metal resistance genes and inti1 quantification in detail the following args teta against tetracycline sul2 against sulphonamide ermb against macrolide qnrs against quinolone and bla ctxm against β lactam were selected because of their wide distribution in wastewater and aquatic environments di cesare et al 2015 2016b sabatino et al 2020 and their detection in the plastisphere lu et al 2019 shi et al 2021 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the multimetal resistance gene czca against co zn and cd generally present in wastewaters and also previously found to correlate with args and class 1 integrons di cesare et al 2016a was chosen as a proxy for metal resistance genes mrgs in addition to the integrase inti1 gene of the class 1 integrons proposed as a general proxy of anthropogenic pollution in aquatic environments gillings et al 2015 args mrg and inti1 were quantified by qpcr following programs and protocols previously described di cesare et al 2015 and using the rt thermocycler cfx connect bio rad primer pairs sequences and annealing temperatures are reported in supplementary table s2 the standard curves preparation for each tested gene followed the protocol of di cesare et al 2013 the mean value standard deviation of the reaction efficiency was 99 10 5 95 and the r2 for the assays was 1 00 0 01 the limits of quantification loq per each gene was determined according to bustin et al 2009 and they were 1548 36 122 35 54 22 24 and 112 copy µl 1 for 16s rrna sul2 teta bla ctxm ermb qnrs czca and inti1 genes respectively the inhibition of pcr was tested by the dilution method di cesare et al 2013 and no inhibition was observed always less than 0 3 threshold cycles gene abundances were normalized by dividing the copy number of the tested gene by the corresponding 16s rrna gene copy number in order to evaluate the dynamics of resistance genes in our system the difference in their abundance according to matrices wastewater or mps sampling dates and before and after the disinfection was assessed first by manova analyzing genes collectively and then by anova for each single gene furthermore anova was used to investigate the effect of disinfection testing separately each matrix in all cases the normalized abundance of the genes was used as response variable 2 6 bacterial community analyses bacterial community composition was analyzed using illumina sequencing of the 16s rrna gene by sequencing the v3 v4 regions using the universal bacterial primer pair s d bact 0341 b s 17 s d bact 0785 a a 21 herlemann et al 2011 sequencing was conducted on an illumina miseq platform at iga technologies udine italy raw reads were deposited at ncbi s sra as project prjna665138 adaptors were clipped with cutadapt 1 9 1 martin 2011 the usearch pipeline with denoised zotus zero radius operational taxonomic units was used edgar 2010 2013 2016 the pipeline was essentially used as suggested in the online tutorial except for the following changes or sequence related particularities while merging the max diff parameter was set to 8 then sequences were filtered to a min and max length of 344 and 366 respectively with a max error of 0 5 and were subsequently truncated to 344 nucleotides of length clustering was conducted with the unoise algorithm to obtain zotus edgar 2016 zotus are constructed after error correction of the amplicon reads only using sequences with the highest quality zotus are thought to be based on correct biological sequences and do not have a fixed similarity threshold taxonomic assignments were conducted using the sintax command in usearch using the silva database quast et al 2013 if sequences were 80 similar to the ones in the database the pipeline can be found on the github repository at the webpage https github com esterme pipeline amplicon sequencing data analyses were performed in r figures were made in r using ggplot2 v3 3 and reshape2 v1 4 packages wickham 2020 2016 in the first step all data were rarefied to the read number of the sample with the lowest read number 10544 in order to obtain a comparable dataset zotus that were not identified at a phylum level or identified as chloroplasts or mitochondria were removed from the dataset the original data set was composed of 6299 zotus and 5878 zotus were retained after the above mentioned removal steps to assess differences in bacterial communities between matrices wastewater or mps disinfection pre and post treatment and dates of sampling two datasets were used 1 the data of the total bacterial community and 2 a subset of data with only taxa containing potentially pathogenic bacteria the potentially pathogenic bacteria were defined as the taxa that included also clinically relevant pathogenic species from the pathogens database of the bode science center https www bode science center com center relevant pathogens from a z html and previously reported by di cesare and colleagues 2020 richness was defined as the number of zotus in each sample for the whole community and potentially pathogenic bacteria only differences in richness between matrices were tested using anova with a log10 transformation of the data for the analysis of beta diversity a matrix of all pairwise comparisons through bray curtis dissimilarity index of the total bacterial community was calculated using the vegan v2 5 6 package oksanen et al 2007 a dendrogram connecting all samples was calculated using hierarchical cluster analysis hclust with average linkage the factors matrix disinfection and sampling date contributing to variance of this distance matrix were evaluated with a permanova using the vegan package anderson 2001 oksanen et al 2007 the significance for the pairwise comparison was calculated using the function pairwise perm manova in rvaidememoire v0 9 79 hervé 2020 furthermore for the total bacterial community differences in richness with anova and beta diversity with permanova for each matrix were assessed in relation to the disinfection process pre and post treatment to identify bacterial genera that were important in defining the differences between matrices mps and wastewater a random forest analysis breiman 2001 was performed using the randomforest package v4 6 12 liaw and wiener 2002 only genera with more than 100 reads were included in the analysis to avoid biases from rare taxa the number of trees was set to 10000 the matrix was specified as group parameter and the importance of the various genera for the community prediction was evaluated using the mean decrease in gini coefficient genera that were important for the mean decrease in gini coefficient were then plotted for their occurrence in each matrix to investigate the co occurrence of the various bacterial genera and the quantified genes both on mps and in wastewater a network correlation analysis was carried out including both the total bacterial community and the potentially pathogenic bacteria only a matrix of correlations was obtained by spearman rank correlation using psych package v1 9 12 31 revelle 2015 considering genera or genes nodes in the network significantly correlated for rho 0 8 and p 0 01 for the total bacterial community the correlation was analysed constructing a network of the co occurrence at the pre and post disinfection both for mps and wastewater the correlation network was visualized and characterized using gephi software v0 9 2 bastian et al 2009 in the network a modularity index 0 4 identified a structure composed by different modules as defined in newman 2006 3 results 3 1 mps number dimension and characteristics mps were found in all the samples with the highest concentration measured at the in 495 61 mps l 1 the overall sewage treatment determines a significant reduction of the mps anova f 191 5 p 3 7 10 6 to a final concentration of 5 8 2 7 mps l 1 in post table 1 this reduction happens in the first treatment step between in and pre tukey hsd test p 6 2 10 6 with no further changes between pre and post p 0 9998 and corresponds to a retention efficiency of 98 9 isolated mps were mainly fragments 80 0 with few films 14 2 and fibers 4 7 while beads rarely occurred 1 1 details in table 1 the dimensional analysis revealed that the most frequent size in either in pre and post is comprised between 100 and 499 µm followed by the 500 999 µm sized fragments table 1 the mps were present in a wide range of colors but white and transparent accounting respectively for 29 4 and 30 2 of the particles were the most abundant in every stage of the process ft ir analysis revealed that polyethylene pe 55 was the most common polymer followed by polypropylene pp 37 fig 1 other less frequent polymers were polystyrene ps 3 polyamide 2 polyethylene terephthalate 1 polyacrylonitrile 1 and silicones 1 fig 1 the spectra of unknown particles shown in supplementary figure s2 were identified by comparing absorption bands with reference polymers obtained from our in house spectral library or reported in the literature supplementary table s3 the disinfection ozonation has a limited effect on mps since their type size and appearance did not show any significant variation during the treatment except for a slight decrease in the concentration of blue light blue particles supplementary table s4 3 2 antibiotic and metal resistance genes and inti1 abundances args when quantifiable ranged from 5 59 10 5 to 4 44 10 3 gene copies 16s rrna gene copy in the plastisphere and from 1 41 10 5 to 6 08 10 3 gene copies 16s rrna gene copy in the planktonic bacterial community supplementary figure s3 the overall normalized abundance of tested genes was significantly higher in the planktonic community than in the plastisphere manova pillai s trace 0 9999 f 2397 65 p 0 0157 supplementary table s5 in particular ermb and qnrs were significantly more abundant in the planktonic community fig 2 supplementary table s6 and sul2 was significantly more abundant in the plastisphere fig 2 supplementary table s6 whereas the other tested args did not show any difference supplementary table s6 the normalized abundance of czca was not significantly different between the plastisphere 1 62 10 3 to 2 86 10 3 gene copies 16s rrna gene copy and the planktonic community 1 12 10 3 to 6 55 10 3 gene copies 16s rrna gene copy supplementary table s6 the normalized abundance of inti1 ranged in the plastisphere from 7 42 10 2 to 1 48 10 1 gene copies 16s rrna gene copy and in the planktonic community from 4 57 10 2 to 1 48 10 1 gene copies 16s rrna gene copy supplementary figure s3 with no significant difference between matrices supplementary table s6 the disinfection did not affect the normalized abundances of the tested genes manova pillai s trace 0 9990 f 136 51 p 0 0658 supplementary table s5 instead looking at the effect of disinfection on the gene abundance in each single matrix in wastewater only sul2 was influenced by ozonation resulting significantly more abundant at the post disinfection step than at the pre disinfection supplementary figure s4 supplementary table s7 whereas no differences were seen in the plastisphere before and after the ozone treatment supplementary table s7 3 3 bacterial community composition and structure the most abundant group of bacteria in the biofilm on mps was flavobacteriaceae 10 1 of total reads followed by comamonadaceae 9 5 and rhodocyclaceae 7 7 in wastewater the predominant family was also flavobacteriaceae 25 3 then moraxellaceae 8 1 and legionellaceae 7 2 for the whole bacterial community richness was higher on mps than in wastewater anova f 8 8 p 0 0055 supplementary figure s5 whereas analyzing separately the matrices the richness was higher in the post disinfection wastewater than that in the pre disinfection wastewater f 7 6 p 0 0141 with no effect of the ozonation within the community grown on mps f 0 2 p 0 629 supplementary figure s6 looking at the potentially pathogenic bacteria richness was higher in wastewater than on mps f 43 39 p 0 0001 supplementary figure s5 the results of permanova showed that 41 1 of the beta diversity was explained by the matrix mps or wastewater whereas 13 5 was explained by the sampling date and only 0 6 by the disinfection supplementary table s8 the pairwise comparison between matrices resulted in a significant difference p 0 01 supplementary figure s7 on the contrary the disinfection explained 22 3 and 12 4 of beta diversity considering individually wastewater and mps respectively supplementary table s9 for the analysis of beta diversity of potentially pathogenic bacteria permanova showed that 26 6 of the variance was explained by the matrix whereas 20 5 was explained by the sampling date and 0 5 by disinfection supplementary table s8 total and potentially pathogenic bacterial communities were always predicted correctly by the random forest analysis in the case of the total bacterial community there were 16 genera mainly differentially distributed between mps and wastewater fig 3 a thus increasing the accuracy of the community prediction among these 16 genera only legionella and tolumonas were more abundant in wastewater while the others were more abundant on mps fig 3b regarding the potentially pathogenic bacteria the most important taxa for community prediction were only seven fig 4 a except for coxiella all these bacteria were more abundant in the planktonic bacterial community fig 4b in the network correlation analysis the two bacterial communities showed different patterns in the planktonic community the number of elements that co occurred was almost fourfold more than that calculated for the plastisphere 163 and 42 respectively figs 5 and 6 a supplementary table s10 the number of edges calculated in the planktonic community was higher than the one observed in the community on mps 629 and 48 respectively figs 5 and 6a supplementary table s10 both bacterial communities showed a modular structure of the network supplementary table s10 the number of modules was similar in the two bacterial communities 15 in the plastisphere and 17 in the planktonic community figs 5 and 6a supplementary table s10 however for both networks a main module was evident with 22 7 of the network nodes in the planktonic bacterial community partially composed by potentially pathogenic bacteria fig 6a and 14 3 of the network nodes in the plastisphere fig 5 interestingly only for wastewater a co occurrence between potentially pathogenic bacteria was obtained with args and inti1 gene in the related network fig 6b considering the effect of ozonation a loss of co occurrences approximately to half was observed in the post disinfection network of wastewater 136 nodes 231 edges vs 70 nodes 88 edges at the pre and post disinfection step respectively supplementary figure s8 supplementary table s10 instead a steady condition was shown for mps before and after the ozone treatment with a minor increase in the post disinfection 54 nodes 91 edges vs 68 nodes 138 edges at the pre and post disinfection step respectively supplementary figure s9 supplementary table s10 4 discussion the wwtp sampled in this study resulted to be well efficient in the abatement of mps more than 98 of the mps counted in the wastewater at the in were retained by the wwtp similarly to the findings observed in previous studies carr et al 2016 lares et al 2018 long et al 2019 michielssen et al 2016 contrary to what was previously found hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 ozone disinfection did not reduce the abundance of mps the profiles of mps in terms of number type and dimension were perfectly overlapping when comparing pre and post samples in fact the only difference found was a slightly lower concentration of blue light blue particles possibly because of the damaging action of ozone on polymers of this specific color chen et al 2018 singh and sharma 2008 the majority of the analyzed mps independently of the sampling point was composed by pe followed by pp and only in the in samples a relevant percentage 19 of mps was composed by ps these findings are similar to what observed in other wwtps long et al 2019 mason et al 2016 sun et al 2019 talvitie et al 2015 and in agreement with the fact that pe and pp are the polymers with the highest industrial demand in europe 19 3 and 17 5 respectively plasticseurope 2019 the plastisphere displayed a significantly higher richness in bacterial genera if compared to the planktonic bacterial community in contrast to what was reported in zettler et al 2013 where the investigated environment was the seawater characterized by completely different ecological parameters and disturbance factors the structural difference between the plastisphere and the planktonic bacteria was also highlighted by the clustering based on the community composition which depicted the plastisphere and the planktonic bacterial community in different clusters independently of the other tested variables sampling date disinfection explaining almost half of the variance in the community composition this result is not completely surprising given that it has previously been reported that mps could be considered as an independent spatial niche prone to be colonized by bacteria differing from those composing the planktonic bacterial community wang et al 2020 this result implies a higher number of bacterial genera released into the environment than those detected by studies on wwtp effluents commonly targeting only the planktonic bacterial community the differences in the community composition were determined by a limited number of genera of which only two were more abundant in wastewater legionella and tolumonas while the others chryseobacterium steroidobacter byssovorax nannocystis acidibacter and piscinibacter resulted more abundant in the plastisphere the latter except acidibacter are all typically associated with the activated sludge fahrbach et al 2008 kämpfer et al 2003 zhou et al 2014 and some of them e g chryseobacterium byssovorax have previously been reported as opportunistic pathogenic and or antibiotic resistant bacteria guo et al 2018 sharma et al 2015 it can be speculated that all the bacterial genera discriminating the composition of the plastisphere come from the activated sludge taking into account that mps reduce the abundance of bacteria devoted to removing nitrogen and phosphorus in the biological treatment step zhang and chen 2020 the plastisphere may be mainly composed of bacteria selected in the activated sludge regarding the two genera discriminating the planktonic bacterial community tolumonas was originally isolated from anoxic freshwater sediment and its main characteristic is the ability to transform substituted aromatic compounds into toluene caldwell et al 2011 whereas the other genus legionella is commonly present within the bacterial communities from urban wwtps demonstrating its capability to survive to wastewater treatments caicedo et al 2019 it is noteworthy that the potentially pathogenic legionella was found mainly in the planktonic bacterial community furthermore when focusing only on the relevant potentially human pathogenic bacteria again the difference between the plastisphere and the planktonic bacteria was the main factor explaining 26 6 of the variance it is interesting that several potentially pathogenic bacteria i e aeromonas bacteroidetes escherichia shigella legionella prevotella streptococcus resulted to be discriminant of the planktonic bacterial community this finding is in contrast to evidence from a previous study where the plastisphere resulted enriched in potentially pathogenic bacteria in comparison to the planktonic community and to biofilm on organic substrates in a river exposed to high anthropogenic pressure mccormick et al 2014 in our study directly performed in a wwtp the conditions for the attachment of potentially pathogenic bacteria to the mps are pretty different to open waters the drastic changes imposed on the bacterial community through the treatment and the limited exposure time from the inlet to the effluent leave room for a further colonization in environments e g a river where limiting factors are different e g temperature predation competition for natural resources here less competitive strains e g pathogenic bacteria could find a refuge on mps where the impact of limiting factors is smoothed raising the predominance of these bacteria as noticed in mccormick et al 2014 another significant difference between the two bacterial communities was in the co occurrence among the genera and the args and inti1 gene although both bacterial communities showed a modular structure with a similar number of modules the genera shaping the planktonic community resulted more correlated both in terms of number of nodes involved and of number of edges if compared to the bacterial communities of the plastisphere interestingly the main module of the planktonic bacterial community with more than 22 of the network nodes was rich in taxa harboring potentially pathogenic bacteria e g bacteroides citrobacter and in the second main module there were also args sul2 teta and ermb and inti1 gene along with potentially pathogenic bacteria e g aeromonas escherichia shigella in the main modules of the plastisphere comprising around 40 of the network nodes potentially pathogenic bacteria and args were absent this difference highlights once more that mps isolated from the sampled wwtp were not a favorable environment to allow the growth of pathogenic bacteria if compared with the planktonic bacterial community in the context of the wwtp moreover the disinfection process through ozonation did not affect the composition of the total bacterial communities and the composition of the potentially pathogenic bacteria regardless of the matrix and the date of sampling however analyzing independently each single matrix only in wastewater the disinfection caused an increase of the richness of the bacterial community in contrast to what was previously obtained by alexander and colleagues 2016 who found that ozone disinfection significantly decreased the diversity of the bacterial community furthermore a strong reduction of the co occurrence patterns in wastewater after disinfection was observed however in order to understand the effect of the disinfection on the plastisphere and on its surrounding water other studies using different methodological approaches e g through the detection of only viable bacteria with the treatment of propidium monoazide nocker et al 2007 are needed very few studies have been performed on the comparison of args and or mrgs abundances between the plastisphere and the planktonic bacterial community in the aquatic environment showing that mps biofilm is generally enriched in args sathicq et al 2021 wu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 in our study the normalized abundances of args and mrg within the bacterial communities did not follow a univocal trend ermb and qnrs were more abundant in the planktonic bacterial community whereas sul2 showed a higher concentration within the plastisphere sul2 was also more abundant after ozonation in wastewater suggesting that this disinfection could contribute to the selection of this gene in the planktonic bacterial community of wwtp for a comprehensive comparison of the relative genes distribution it would be necessary to adjust the methodology applied in the different studies and here we compared our results genes quantified by qpcr thus providing a partial view of the antibiotic and metal resistome to other studies where shotgun metagenomics or high throughput quantitative real time pcr were used taking into account the comparable proportions of the gene inti1 widely recognized indicator for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 and args abundance ma et al 2017 zheng et al 2020 in the plastisphere and the planktonic community we can speculate a limited selection of args and mrgs on mps in treated wastewater according to the limited selection of potentially pathogenic bacteria we observed indeed this speculation does not exclude a further colonization of this substrate once the ecological conditions of the medium will change in the environment furthermore to reach a general conclusion on the role of the plastisphere in treated wastewaters to the spread of pathogenic bacteria and resistance genes in aquatic ecosystems extensive surveys based on the collection of samples from wwtps located in different countries and in different seasons are needed 5 conclusions in this study we demonstrated differences between the bacterial community growing on mps and the planktonic bacteria in a wwtp furthermore the disinfection process through ozonation did not affect the concentration and the characteristics of mps the composition of the bacterial community of the plastisphere and the args and mrg abundances on mps overall our study indicates that mps could be considered as carriers of potentially pathogenic bacteria chryseobacterium enriched in the plastisphere and args sul2 selected in the plastisphere in treated wastewater in sessile form where bacteria better resist to stress lee et al 2014 and where the rate of the horizontal gene transfer is generally higher than the planktonic bacterial community madsen et al 2012 posing a serious concern for human health yet their contribution to the spread of pathogens and args in the aquatic environment resulted relatively lower if compared with that of the treated wastewater planktonic community declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this research was financially supported by uniacque s p a we thank the staff of uniacque s p a for the

16888,microplastic particles mps are ubiquitous pollutants widely found in aquatic ecosystems although mps are mostly retained in wastewater treatment plants wwtps a high number of mps reaches the open waters potentially contributing to the spread of pathogenic bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes in the environment nowadays a limited number of studies have focused on the role of mps as carriers of potentially pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria in wwtps thus an investigation on the community composition by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and the abundance of antibiotic and metal resistance genes by qpcr of the biofilm on mps the plastisphere and of planktonic bacteria in treated pre and post disinfection wastewaters was performed mps resulted to be very similar in terms of type color size and chemical composition before and after the disinfection the bacterial community on mps differed from the planktonic community in terms of richness composition and structure of the community network potentially pathogenic bacteria generally showed higher abundances in treated wastewater than in the biofilm on mps furthermore among the tested resistance genes only sul2 a common resistance gene against sulfonamides resulted to be more abundant in the plastisphere than in the planktonic bacterial community our results suggest that the wastewater plastisphere could promote the spread of pathogenic bacteria and resistance genes in aquatic environment although with a relatively lower contribution than the wastewater planktonic bacterial community graphical

ecologically major concerns are related to microplastic particles mps plastic fragments with dimensions comprised between 1 µm and 5 mm frias and nash 2019 which share features like durability and buoyancy with larger plastic litter but because of their limited size can also be accidentally ingested adversely affecting various organisms along the trophic chain franzellitti et al 2019 they can be divided into primary mps directly manufactured in small size salvador cesa et al 2017 and secondary mps derived from the breakdown of larger pieces as a result of physical and or chemical damage naik et al 2020 smith et al 2018 wright et al 2013 mps can be considered a complex dynamic mixture of polymers and additives to which organic material and contaminants can successively bind to form an ecocorona with a peculiar density surface charge bioavailability and toxicity galloway et al 2017 this means that mps in the environment create inhabitable surfaces characterized by a specific bacterial community defined as plastisphere zettler et al 2013 the bacterial community in the plastisphere can be very different from those in the surrounding environments bryant et al 2016 de tender et al 2015 dussud et al 2018 pinnell and turner 2020 2019 zettler et al 2013 furthermore mps can also harbor pathogenic bacteria including members of the genus vibrio kirstein et al 2016 mccormick et al 2014 rodrigues et al 2019 schmidt et al 2014 and escherichia coli rodrigues et al 2019 antibiotic resistant bacteria antibiotic resistance genes args and metal resistance genes mrgs lu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 due to spatial proximity and selective pressure in the biofilm on mps gene exchange by horizontal gene transfer is increased arias andres et al 2018 potentially involving antibiotic resistant and pathogenic bacteria thus favoring the selection and spread of resistance genes mps produced and dumped in industrial urban and agricultural areas generally reach the sewages and then wastewater treatment plants wwtps although wwtps are not designed for the removal of mps they still act as an efficient barrier to their release into the environment talvitie et al 2017 with higher efficiency when improved treating technologies are applied bui et al 2020 however mps escaping wwtps enter rivers lakes and seas with concentrations higher than 50 106 mps day from a single wwtp effluent murphy et al 2016 thus wwtps can be considered as a source of mps pollution galafassi et al 2019 as well as of antibiotic resistant and pathogenic bacteria hultman et al 2018 mps accumulate args and resistant bacteria from the environment lu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 y zhang et al 2020 in addition by mixing treated wastewater and lake water higher mps concentrations proportionally promoted a higher abundance of the class 1 integron eckert et al 2018 a proxy for anthropogenic contamination gillings et al 2015 and increased the persistence of wastewater derived bacteria eckert et al 2018 within wastewater treatments disinfection is the only specifically designed step to lower the load of pathogenic microorganisms zhang et al 2020 to date the efficacy of disinfection in abating resistance genes is debated with some studies reporting a general tendency towards their decrease together with the reduction of the viable bacterial cell number di cesare et al 2020 and other studies observing their selection corno et al 2019 di cesare et al 2016b among disinfection treatments ozone disinfection directly affects plastic polymers chen et al 2018 singh and sharma 2008 and reduces the mps load hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 but it can also influence the bacterial community composition of treated wastewater and its resistome alexander et al 2016 for these reasons we evaluated the abundance and the persistence of resistance genes and potentially pathogenic bacteria in wastewater in the biofilm on mps and in the planktonic bacterial community before and after the disinfection treatment therefore we selected an urban wwtp applying ozonation as disinfection treatment sampling it once a week for three weeks we assessed the mps abatement along the wwtp comparing their amount in the inlet pre and post disinfection water then we tested the effect of disinfection on the abundance of selected resistance genes and class 1 integrons on mps biofilm and within the planktonic bacterial communities to conclude we compared the plastisphere and the planktonic bacterial community both at the pre and post disinfection step with a particular focus on potentially pathogenic bacteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 wwtp sampling the sampled wwtp is located in the north of italy in an area characterized by a level of anthropogenic impact at the highest in europe alias et al 2019 after a primary screen 3 mm mesh size the wwtp consists of a settler followed by biological denitrification oxidation and 40 µm membrane filtration supplementary figure s1 final disinfection is done through ozone treatment the dosage of which is determined according to the flow rate and never exceeds 20 g m3 the facility is built to serve more than 100000 population equivalent but it is only used to serve less than 70000 people the sewage collected by this plant comes approximately in equal parts from an urban area and industries samples were collected in october 2019 once a week for three weeks with stable dry weather conditions this timing was chosen to minimize the influence of other factors such as seasonality the chosen sampling points were 1 after the primary grids placed at the entrance of the system named in 2 before the disinfection treatment named pre and 3 after disinfection at the outlet of the wwtp named post see supplementary figure s1 in sample was collected using an auto sampler installed immediately after the initial screen grid working with a flow rate of 1 l h 1 for a total of 3 h as already done in other studies michielssen et al 2016 simon et al 2018 talvitie et al 2017 and stored at 4 c until further analyses pre and post composite samples were collected with a membrane pump with a flow rate of 30 l h 1 operated for 3 h resulting in the collection of 100 l each sampling time was chosen according to the hydraulic retention time of the different sections of the plant as highlighted by lares et al 2018 pre samples were collected 30 h after the respective in samples whereas post samples were collected 30 minutes after the collection of pre samples the choice of a composite sample of 3 h was preferred over grab punctual samples to decrease the probability of small errors in the calculation of the hydraulic retention time for each sampling site high turbulence points were chosen to ensure a homogeneous collection of mps floating on the surface and in the water column pre and post samples were in situ filtered onto a 25 µm stainless steel sieve to maximize the particle retention while ensuring a good filtration rate following previous studies 25 µm ziajahromi et al 2017 20 µm talvitie et al 2017 20 µm michielssen et al 2016 20 µm carr et al 2016 the stainless steel sieve was carefully washed with mps free deionized water and the retained particulate was transferred to a glass bottle and stored at 4 c until further analyses 1 l of the filtrate fraction smaller than 25 µm of the pre and post wastewaters was stored at 4 c and further processed for the analysis of the planktonic bacterial community within 5 h from the sampling a schematic representation of the experimental set up is given in supplementary figure s1 2 2 mps isolation quantification and classification once in the laboratory the retained particulate from pre and post samples was vacuum filtered onto custom made 25 µm polyester net filters with hot sealed border to avoid mps release and washed with autoclaved mps free deionized water 240 ml of the in subsamples were treated with h2o2 30 1 1 v v incubated at 60 c for 30 min and then for 72 h at room temperature occasionally mixed by carefully manual shaking of the bottle at the end of the incubation the mixture was vacuum filtered onto a custom made 25 µm polyester filter and thoroughly washed with mps free deionized water filters were stored in glass petri jars to avoid contamination mps isolation was performed through visual sorting of the material collected on the filters under a stereomicroscope zeiss n 475053 equipped with 8x 12x 20x and 50x magnification and with the help of a stainless steel needle general rules were followed to distinguish between natural and synthetic particles like the homogeneity and artificiality of coloration absence of cellular or other organic structures and resistance to rupture mohamed nor and obbard 2014 putative mps were classified according to their shape as fragments thick particles with irregular dimensions films irregular in shape but thin and flexible beads round mps with a spherical shape and fibers long filaments with a constant diameter all the isolated mps were counted their color was annotated and their major dimension was measured with an amscope md500 ck camera and the software provided by the seller amscope v3 7 united scope llc irvine california usa periodically calibrated according to their major dimension mps were also categorized in size classes smaller than 99 µm 100 499 µm 500 999 µm 1000 1999 2000 4999 µm bigger than 5000 µm subsamples of particles isolated from the in pre and post samples corresponding to 5 8 of the total were further analyzed for the chemical composition of mps putative mps were collected from the filters and stored in a solution of h2o2 30 1 1 v v to eliminate the biofilm on their surface the ratio between true plastic particles within the pool of putative mps analyzed by ft ir was applied to the counts done through visual sorting to calculate the actual concentration of mps in the samples retention efficiency was calculated as the ratio between the concentration in the post and in samples multiplied by 100 comparisons in mps abundance according to treatment step in pre or post and sampling dates were assessed by anova in r 3 6 0 environment r core team 2019 using either the concentration or the normalized abundance as the response variable followed by a tukey honestly significant difference hsd test to disentangle the significant effects of predictors with more than two levels because proportion data were compared values were divided by 100 and the arcsine value of their squared root was used for the anova analysis to account for the assumptions of the test crawley 2012 differences were considered significant at p 0 05 particular attention was paid to minimize the risk of contamination with mps from other sources clean cotton laboratory coats and natural latex gloves were worn during all the steps of the laboratory work to avoid any possible mps contamination mps free deionized water was filtered onto 0 22 µm nitrocellulose filters mf membrane millipore and h2o2 30 was filtered onto glass fiber filters gf c whatman laboratory equipment was washed thrice with filtered distilled water just before use and the 25 µm filters were visually checked at the stereomicroscope for mps presence immediately before the utilization procedural blank controls were performed in parallel to all protocol steps and the number of mps found was negligible 2 3 mps chemical characterization different particles identified with the stereomicroscope were collected on a silicon filter diameter of 13 mm and pore size of 5 µm purchased from smart membrane germany and characterized by an infrared spectrophotometer coupled with a microscope the ft ir spectra of fragments fibers beads and films were acquired with a thermo scientific nicolet in 10 infrared microscope equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride liquid nitrogen cooled detector the measurements were performed in attenuated total reflection mode with a germanium crystal from 4000 to 650 cm 1 averaging 64 scansions at 4 cm 1 spectral resolution 2 4 dna extraction to characterize the planktonic bacterial communities a volume of 200 300 ml of the pre and post wastewater already filtered onto 25 µm stainless steel sieve for the particulate retention was further filtered onto 0 22 µm polycarbonate filters cut in three sections and each one processed for dna extraction to analyze the biofilm forming bacteria for each pre and post sample three pooled mps subsamples were prepared collecting with tweezers between 25 and 45 mps during the visual sorting for the precise number of mps in each pool see supplementary table s1 every mp was washed with a few drops of autoclaved mps free water to avoid unspecific carryover and collected in dna extraction tubes dna from pooled mps and pre and post filters was extracted following the protocol suggested in debeljak et al 2017 using the qiagen powersoil kit with some modifications in detail 5 mg of zirconia beads were added to each extraction tube using a homogenizer precellys 24 bertin technologies for the bead beating three times at 6000 rpm for 30 s with 1 min of break in between each homogenization step the dna samples were then divided into two aliquots one was used for the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing while the other one was four fold diluted and processed for qpcr assays 2 5 antibiotic and metal resistance genes and inti1 quantification in detail the following args teta against tetracycline sul2 against sulphonamide ermb against macrolide qnrs against quinolone and bla ctxm against β lactam were selected because of their wide distribution in wastewater and aquatic environments di cesare et al 2015 2016b sabatino et al 2020 and their detection in the plastisphere lu et al 2019 shi et al 2021 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the multimetal resistance gene czca against co zn and cd generally present in wastewaters and also previously found to correlate with args and class 1 integrons di cesare et al 2016a was chosen as a proxy for metal resistance genes mrgs in addition to the integrase inti1 gene of the class 1 integrons proposed as a general proxy of anthropogenic pollution in aquatic environments gillings et al 2015 args mrg and inti1 were quantified by qpcr following programs and protocols previously described di cesare et al 2015 and using the rt thermocycler cfx connect bio rad primer pairs sequences and annealing temperatures are reported in supplementary table s2 the standard curves preparation for each tested gene followed the protocol of di cesare et al 2013 the mean value standard deviation of the reaction efficiency was 99 10 5 95 and the r2 for the assays was 1 00 0 01 the limits of quantification loq per each gene was determined according to bustin et al 2009 and they were 1548 36 122 35 54 22 24 and 112 copy µl 1 for 16s rrna sul2 teta bla ctxm ermb qnrs czca and inti1 genes respectively the inhibition of pcr was tested by the dilution method di cesare et al 2013 and no inhibition was observed always less than 0 3 threshold cycles gene abundances were normalized by dividing the copy number of the tested gene by the corresponding 16s rrna gene copy number in order to evaluate the dynamics of resistance genes in our system the difference in their abundance according to matrices wastewater or mps sampling dates and before and after the disinfection was assessed first by manova analyzing genes collectively and then by anova for each single gene furthermore anova was used to investigate the effect of disinfection testing separately each matrix in all cases the normalized abundance of the genes was used as response variable 2 6 bacterial community analyses bacterial community composition was analyzed using illumina sequencing of the 16s rrna gene by sequencing the v3 v4 regions using the universal bacterial primer pair s d bact 0341 b s 17 s d bact 0785 a a 21 herlemann et al 2011 sequencing was conducted on an illumina miseq platform at iga technologies udine italy raw reads were deposited at ncbi s sra as project prjna665138 adaptors were clipped with cutadapt 1 9 1 martin 2011 the usearch pipeline with denoised zotus zero radius operational taxonomic units was used edgar 2010 2013 2016 the pipeline was essentially used as suggested in the online tutorial except for the following changes or sequence related particularities while merging the max diff parameter was set to 8 then sequences were filtered to a min and max length of 344 and 366 respectively with a max error of 0 5 and were subsequently truncated to 344 nucleotides of length clustering was conducted with the unoise algorithm to obtain zotus edgar 2016 zotus are constructed after error correction of the amplicon reads only using sequences with the highest quality zotus are thought to be based on correct biological sequences and do not have a fixed similarity threshold taxonomic assignments were conducted using the sintax command in usearch using the silva database quast et al 2013 if sequences were 80 similar to the ones in the database the pipeline can be found on the github repository at the webpage https github com esterme pipeline amplicon sequencing data analyses were performed in r figures were made in r using ggplot2 v3 3 and reshape2 v1 4 packages wickham 2020 2016 in the first step all data were rarefied to the read number of the sample with the lowest read number 10544 in order to obtain a comparable dataset zotus that were not identified at a phylum level or identified as chloroplasts or mitochondria were removed from the dataset the original data set was composed of 6299 zotus and 5878 zotus were retained after the above mentioned removal steps to assess differences in bacterial communities between matrices wastewater or mps disinfection pre and post treatment and dates of sampling two datasets were used 1 the data of the total bacterial community and 2 a subset of data with only taxa containing potentially pathogenic bacteria the potentially pathogenic bacteria were defined as the taxa that included also clinically relevant pathogenic species from the pathogens database of the bode science center https www bode science center com center relevant pathogens from a z html and previously reported by di cesare and colleagues 2020 richness was defined as the number of zotus in each sample for the whole community and potentially pathogenic bacteria only differences in richness between matrices were tested using anova with a log10 transformation of the data for the analysis of beta diversity a matrix of all pairwise comparisons through bray curtis dissimilarity index of the total bacterial community was calculated using the vegan v2 5 6 package oksanen et al 2007 a dendrogram connecting all samples was calculated using hierarchical cluster analysis hclust with average linkage the factors matrix disinfection and sampling date contributing to variance of this distance matrix were evaluated with a permanova using the vegan package anderson 2001 oksanen et al 2007 the significance for the pairwise comparison was calculated using the function pairwise perm manova in rvaidememoire v0 9 79 hervé 2020 furthermore for the total bacterial community differences in richness with anova and beta diversity with permanova for each matrix were assessed in relation to the disinfection process pre and post treatment to identify bacterial genera that were important in defining the differences between matrices mps and wastewater a random forest analysis breiman 2001 was performed using the randomforest package v4 6 12 liaw and wiener 2002 only genera with more than 100 reads were included in the analysis to avoid biases from rare taxa the number of trees was set to 10000 the matrix was specified as group parameter and the importance of the various genera for the community prediction was evaluated using the mean decrease in gini coefficient genera that were important for the mean decrease in gini coefficient were then plotted for their occurrence in each matrix to investigate the co occurrence of the various bacterial genera and the quantified genes both on mps and in wastewater a network correlation analysis was carried out including both the total bacterial community and the potentially pathogenic bacteria only a matrix of correlations was obtained by spearman rank correlation using psych package v1 9 12 31 revelle 2015 considering genera or genes nodes in the network significantly correlated for rho 0 8 and p 0 01 for the total bacterial community the correlation was analysed constructing a network of the co occurrence at the pre and post disinfection both for mps and wastewater the correlation network was visualized and characterized using gephi software v0 9 2 bastian et al 2009 in the network a modularity index 0 4 identified a structure composed by different modules as defined in newman 2006 3 results 3 1 mps number dimension and characteristics mps were found in all the samples with the highest concentration measured at the in 495 61 mps l 1 the overall sewage treatment determines a significant reduction of the mps anova f 191 5 p 3 7 10 6 to a final concentration of 5 8 2 7 mps l 1 in post table 1 this reduction happens in the first treatment step between in and pre tukey hsd test p 6 2 10 6 with no further changes between pre and post p 0 9998 and corresponds to a retention efficiency of 98 9 isolated mps were mainly fragments 80 0 with few films 14 2 and fibers 4 7 while beads rarely occurred 1 1 details in table 1 the dimensional analysis revealed that the most frequent size in either in pre and post is comprised between 100 and 499 µm followed by the 500 999 µm sized fragments table 1 the mps were present in a wide range of colors but white and transparent accounting respectively for 29 4 and 30 2 of the particles were the most abundant in every stage of the process ft ir analysis revealed that polyethylene pe 55 was the most common polymer followed by polypropylene pp 37 fig 1 other less frequent polymers were polystyrene ps 3 polyamide 2 polyethylene terephthalate 1 polyacrylonitrile 1 and silicones 1 fig 1 the spectra of unknown particles shown in supplementary figure s2 were identified by comparing absorption bands with reference polymers obtained from our in house spectral library or reported in the literature supplementary table s3 the disinfection ozonation has a limited effect on mps since their type size and appearance did not show any significant variation during the treatment except for a slight decrease in the concentration of blue light blue particles supplementary table s4 3 2 antibiotic and metal resistance genes and inti1 abundances args when quantifiable ranged from 5 59 10 5 to 4 44 10 3 gene copies 16s rrna gene copy in the plastisphere and from 1 41 10 5 to 6 08 10 3 gene copies 16s rrna gene copy in the planktonic bacterial community supplementary figure s3 the overall normalized abundance of tested genes was significantly higher in the planktonic community than in the plastisphere manova pillai s trace 0 9999 f 2397 65 p 0 0157 supplementary table s5 in particular ermb and qnrs were significantly more abundant in the planktonic community fig 2 supplementary table s6 and sul2 was significantly more abundant in the plastisphere fig 2 supplementary table s6 whereas the other tested args did not show any difference supplementary table s6 the normalized abundance of czca was not significantly different between the plastisphere 1 62 10 3 to 2 86 10 3 gene copies 16s rrna gene copy and the planktonic community 1 12 10 3 to 6 55 10 3 gene copies 16s rrna gene copy supplementary table s6 the normalized abundance of inti1 ranged in the plastisphere from 7 42 10 2 to 1 48 10 1 gene copies 16s rrna gene copy and in the planktonic community from 4 57 10 2 to 1 48 10 1 gene copies 16s rrna gene copy supplementary figure s3 with no significant difference between matrices supplementary table s6 the disinfection did not affect the normalized abundances of the tested genes manova pillai s trace 0 9990 f 136 51 p 0 0658 supplementary table s5 instead looking at the effect of disinfection on the gene abundance in each single matrix in wastewater only sul2 was influenced by ozonation resulting significantly more abundant at the post disinfection step than at the pre disinfection supplementary figure s4 supplementary table s7 whereas no differences were seen in the plastisphere before and after the ozone treatment supplementary table s7 3 3 bacterial community composition and structure the most abundant group of bacteria in the biofilm on mps was flavobacteriaceae 10 1 of total reads followed by comamonadaceae 9 5 and rhodocyclaceae 7 7 in wastewater the predominant family was also flavobacteriaceae 25 3 then moraxellaceae 8 1 and legionellaceae 7 2 for the whole bacterial community richness was higher on mps than in wastewater anova f 8 8 p 0 0055 supplementary figure s5 whereas analyzing separately the matrices the richness was higher in the post disinfection wastewater than that in the pre disinfection wastewater f 7 6 p 0 0141 with no effect of the ozonation within the community grown on mps f 0 2 p 0 629 supplementary figure s6 looking at the potentially pathogenic bacteria richness was higher in wastewater than on mps f 43 39 p 0 0001 supplementary figure s5 the results of permanova showed that 41 1 of the beta diversity was explained by the matrix mps or wastewater whereas 13 5 was explained by the sampling date and only 0 6 by the disinfection supplementary table s8 the pairwise comparison between matrices resulted in a significant difference p 0 01 supplementary figure s7 on the contrary the disinfection explained 22 3 and 12 4 of beta diversity considering individually wastewater and mps respectively supplementary table s9 for the analysis of beta diversity of potentially pathogenic bacteria permanova showed that 26 6 of the variance was explained by the matrix whereas 20 5 was explained by the sampling date and 0 5 by disinfection supplementary table s8 total and potentially pathogenic bacterial communities were always predicted correctly by the random forest analysis in the case of the total bacterial community there were 16 genera mainly differentially distributed between mps and wastewater fig 3 a thus increasing the accuracy of the community prediction among these 16 genera only legionella and tolumonas were more abundant in wastewater while the others were more abundant on mps fig 3b regarding the potentially pathogenic bacteria the most important taxa for community prediction were only seven fig 4 a except for coxiella all these bacteria were more abundant in the planktonic bacterial community fig 4b in the network correlation analysis the two bacterial communities showed different patterns in the planktonic community the number of elements that co occurred was almost fourfold more than that calculated for the plastisphere 163 and 42 respectively figs 5 and 6 a supplementary table s10 the number of edges calculated in the planktonic community was higher than the one observed in the community on mps 629 and 48 respectively figs 5 and 6a supplementary table s10 both bacterial communities showed a modular structure of the network supplementary table s10 the number of modules was similar in the two bacterial communities 15 in the plastisphere and 17 in the planktonic community figs 5 and 6a supplementary table s10 however for both networks a main module was evident with 22 7 of the network nodes in the planktonic bacterial community partially composed by potentially pathogenic bacteria fig 6a and 14 3 of the network nodes in the plastisphere fig 5 interestingly only for wastewater a co occurrence between potentially pathogenic bacteria was obtained with args and inti1 gene in the related network fig 6b considering the effect of ozonation a loss of co occurrences approximately to half was observed in the post disinfection network of wastewater 136 nodes 231 edges vs 70 nodes 88 edges at the pre and post disinfection step respectively supplementary figure s8 supplementary table s10 instead a steady condition was shown for mps before and after the ozone treatment with a minor increase in the post disinfection 54 nodes 91 edges vs 68 nodes 138 edges at the pre and post disinfection step respectively supplementary figure s9 supplementary table s10 4 discussion the wwtp sampled in this study resulted to be well efficient in the abatement of mps more than 98 of the mps counted in the wastewater at the in were retained by the wwtp similarly to the findings observed in previous studies carr et al 2016 lares et al 2018 long et al 2019 michielssen et al 2016 contrary to what was previously found hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 ozone disinfection did not reduce the abundance of mps the profiles of mps in terms of number type and dimension were perfectly overlapping when comparing pre and post samples in fact the only difference found was a slightly lower concentration of blue light blue particles possibly because of the damaging action of ozone on polymers of this specific color chen et al 2018 singh and sharma 2008 the majority of the analyzed mps independently of the sampling point was composed by pe followed by pp and only in the in samples a relevant percentage 19 of mps was composed by ps these findings are similar to what observed in other wwtps long et al 2019 mason et al 2016 sun et al 2019 talvitie et al 2015 and in agreement with the fact that pe and pp are the polymers with the highest industrial demand in europe 19 3 and 17 5 respectively plasticseurope 2019 the plastisphere displayed a significantly higher richness in bacterial genera if compared to the planktonic bacterial community in contrast to what was reported in zettler et al 2013 where the investigated environment was the seawater characterized by completely different ecological parameters and disturbance factors the structural difference between the plastisphere and the planktonic bacteria was also highlighted by the clustering based on the community composition which depicted the plastisphere and the planktonic bacterial community in different clusters independently of the other tested variables sampling date disinfection explaining almost half of the variance in the community composition this result is not completely surprising given that it has previously been reported that mps could be considered as an independent spatial niche prone to be colonized by bacteria differing from those composing the planktonic bacterial community wang et al 2020 this result implies a higher number of bacterial genera released into the environment than those detected by studies on wwtp effluents commonly targeting only the planktonic bacterial community the differences in the community composition were determined by a limited number of genera of which only two were more abundant in wastewater legionella and tolumonas while the others chryseobacterium steroidobacter byssovorax nannocystis acidibacter and piscinibacter resulted more abundant in the plastisphere the latter except acidibacter are all typically associated with the activated sludge fahrbach et al 2008 kämpfer et al 2003 zhou et al 2014 and some of them e g chryseobacterium byssovorax have previously been reported as opportunistic pathogenic and or antibiotic resistant bacteria guo et al 2018 sharma et al 2015 it can be speculated that all the bacterial genera discriminating the composition of the plastisphere come from the activated sludge taking into account that mps reduce the abundance of bacteria devoted to removing nitrogen and phosphorus in the biological treatment step zhang and chen 2020 the plastisphere may be mainly composed of bacteria selected in the activated sludge regarding the two genera discriminating the planktonic bacterial community tolumonas was originally isolated from anoxic freshwater sediment and its main characteristic is the ability to transform substituted aromatic compounds into toluene caldwell et al 2011 whereas the other genus legionella is commonly present within the bacterial communities from urban wwtps demonstrating its capability to survive to wastewater treatments caicedo et al 2019 it is noteworthy that the potentially pathogenic legionella was found mainly in the planktonic bacterial community furthermore when focusing only on the relevant potentially human pathogenic bacteria again the difference between the plastisphere and the planktonic bacteria was the main factor explaining 26 6 of the variance it is interesting that several potentially pathogenic bacteria i e aeromonas bacteroidetes escherichia shigella legionella prevotella streptococcus resulted to be discriminant of the planktonic bacterial community this finding is in contrast to evidence from a previous study where the plastisphere resulted enriched in potentially pathogenic bacteria in comparison to the planktonic community and to biofilm on organic substrates in a river exposed to high anthropogenic pressure mccormick et al 2014 in our study directly performed in a wwtp the conditions for the attachment of potentially pathogenic bacteria to the mps are pretty different to open waters the drastic changes imposed on the bacterial community through the treatment and the limited exposure time from the inlet to the effluent leave room for a further colonization in environments e g a river where limiting factors are different e g temperature predation competition for natural resources here less competitive strains e g pathogenic bacteria could find a refuge on mps where the impact of limiting factors is smoothed raising the predominance of these bacteria as noticed in mccormick et al 2014 another significant difference between the two bacterial communities was in the co occurrence among the genera and the args and inti1 gene although both bacterial communities showed a modular structure with a similar number of modules the genera shaping the planktonic community resulted more correlated both in terms of number of nodes involved and of number of edges if compared to the bacterial communities of the plastisphere interestingly the main module of the planktonic bacterial community with more than 22 of the network nodes was rich in taxa harboring potentially pathogenic bacteria e g bacteroides citrobacter and in the second main module there were also args sul2 teta and ermb and inti1 gene along with potentially pathogenic bacteria e g aeromonas escherichia shigella in the main modules of the plastisphere comprising around 40 of the network nodes potentially pathogenic bacteria and args were absent this difference highlights once more that mps isolated from the sampled wwtp were not a favorable environment to allow the growth of pathogenic bacteria if compared with the planktonic bacterial community in the context of the wwtp moreover the disinfection process through ozonation did not affect the composition of the total bacterial communities and the composition of the potentially pathogenic bacteria regardless of the matrix and the date of sampling however analyzing independently each single matrix only in wastewater the disinfection caused an increase of the richness of the bacterial community in contrast to what was previously obtained by alexander and colleagues 2016 who found that ozone disinfection significantly decreased the diversity of the bacterial community furthermore a strong reduction of the co occurrence patterns in wastewater after disinfection was observed however in order to understand the effect of the disinfection on the plastisphere and on its surrounding water other studies using different methodological approaches e g through the detection of only viable bacteria with the treatment of propidium monoazide nocker et al 2007 are needed very few studies have been performed on the comparison of args and or mrgs abundances between the plastisphere and the planktonic bacterial community in the aquatic environment showing that mps biofilm is generally enriched in args sathicq et al 2021 wu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 in our study the normalized abundances of args and mrg within the bacterial communities did not follow a univocal trend ermb and qnrs were more abundant in the planktonic bacterial community whereas sul2 showed a higher concentration within the plastisphere sul2 was also more abundant after ozonation in wastewater suggesting that this disinfection could contribute to the selection of this gene in the planktonic bacterial community of wwtp for a comprehensive comparison of the relative genes distribution it would be necessary to adjust the methodology applied in the different studies and here we compared our results genes quantified by qpcr thus providing a partial view of the antibiotic and metal resistome to other studies where shotgun metagenomics or high throughput quantitative real time pcr were used taking into account the comparable proportions of the gene inti1 widely recognized indicator for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 and args abundance ma et al 2017 zheng et al 2020 in the plastisphere and the planktonic community we can speculate a limited selection of args and mrgs on mps in treated wastewater according to the limited selection of potentially pathogenic bacteria we observed indeed this speculation does not exclude a further colonization of this substrate once the ecological conditions of the medium will change in the environment furthermore to reach a general conclusion on the role of the plastisphere in treated wastewaters to the spread of pathogenic bacteria and resistance genes in aquatic ecosystems extensive surveys based on the collection of samples from wwtps located in different countries and in different seasons are needed 5 conclusions in this study we demonstrated differences between the bacterial community growing on mps and the planktonic bacteria in a wwtp furthermore the disinfection process through ozonation did not affect the concentration and the characteristics of mps the composition of the bacterial community of the plastisphere and the args and mrg abundances on mps overall our study indicates that mps could be considered as carriers of potentially pathogenic bacteria chryseobacterium enriched in the plastisphere and args sul2 selected in the plastisphere in treated wastewater in sessile form where bacteria better resist to stress lee et al 2014 and where the rate of the horizontal gene transfer is generally higher than the planktonic bacterial community madsen et al 2012 posing a serious concern for human health yet their contribution to the spread of pathogens and args in the aquatic environment resulted relatively lower if compared with that of the

16889,the study investigated molecular mechanisms of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas on a surfactant modified clay smc which rivals or exceeds the performance of granular activated carbon in removing long chain pfas from contaminated water the adsorption isotherms of four anionic and one neutral pfas from 1 10 9 to 1 10 5 mol l were measured to be piecewise accompanied by the expansion of the smc interlayer based on the spatial distribution of perfluorocarboxylic acid pfoa on smc at the submicron scale achieved by synchrotron based scanning transmission x ray microscopy stxm coupled with x ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy xanes pfoa molecules were confirmed to enter the interlayer space of smc and could form charge charge interaction with the intercalants quaternary ammonia cations revealed by the all atom molecular dynamics md simulation and density functional theory based quantum calculations the interactions between the positively charged surfactant and representative pfas include charge charge charge dipole and dipole dipole interactions the adsorption mechanisms vary from one pfas structure to another in terms of adsorption energy and spatial arrangement those interactions overcome the interaction between pfas and water allowing pfas to be retained in the smc s interlayer space the study provides fundamental insights into how pfas interact

in the exchange sites of smectite clays e g bentonite creates surfactant modified clay smc zeng et al 2003 as ionic interactions between pfas and charged groups on smc may be formed enhanced adsorption was expected du et al 2016 we recently focused on the adsorption of pfas onto smc at an environmentally relevant concentration range e g ppb level of groundwater and showed smc could exceed the performance of granular activated carbon when treating afff impacted groundwater importantly as revealed by the x ray diffraction patterns pfas molecules did not enter the interlayer only occupied the interlayer edge and surface sites to result in a piecewise isotherm phase ⅰ linear shape and phase ⅱ ⅲ langmuir type yan et al 2020 however the expansive character of smc dictates distinct adsorption behaviors with changing pfas loading amount key questions remain will pfas spread to the interlayer internal space of smc at higher loading in restricted interlayer space how pfas molecules interact with hydrocarbon intercalants at the molecular level how to quantify the effect of solvent i e water in this work and how to predict the performance of smc for pfas in addition due to diverse pfas structures adsorption mechanisms may also vary from one compound to another the predominance of a particular mechanism can shift with the perfluoroalkyl chain length or a charged group adsorption mechanisms in interlayer inner sites may resemble those on the edge sites but as these interactions occur below surfaces the direct examination is challenging synchrotron based scanning transmission x ray microscopy stxm can map out the real space full field state of particles with high spatial resolution down to tens of nanometers scale chen et al 2014 lin et al 2017 such offers the possibility for directly visualizing sorbent materials across the entire depth in a nearly non destructive manner rather than only the surface furthermore x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectroscopy extracted from the stxm image contains information in the edge energy position that can be used to quantitatively probe an atom s oxidation state and allow analyzing atom based contaminant sorbent interactions with various depth sensitivity and high resolution lin et al 2017 smith and saykally 2017 though no study has attempted the characterization technique for pfas we hypothesize stxm xanes can assist in identifying specific interactions e g charge charge interaction by visualizing pfas spatial and elemental distribution on smc with high resolutions however x ray sources cannot visualize molecular configurations generally at sub nanoscale which are essential for confirming pfas adsorbent orientations and interactions instead all atom molecular dynamics md a simulation method based on classical mechanics of multiparticle systems can achieve such characterizations adcock and mccammon 2006 this capability shows conformational changes and interacting particles e g atoms groups and molecules offering a seeing is believing way of studying the structure of adsorbent adsorbate systems at the atomic level epa et al 2012 furthermore a detailed and accurate picture of how pfas interacts with the adsorbent can also be provided by the density functional theory dft quantum calculations which determine atomic forces and system energy from first principles by approximating the schrödinger equation hermann et al 2017 the introduction of a solvation model based on density smd can implicitly simulate the aqueous environment and specify the effect of water marenich et al 2009 md and dft tools each has certain limitations but the complementary use of these tools can reduce potentially biased and inaccurate conclusions we proposed that mechanistic insights of pfas on smc can be obtained in an unprecedented way by applying stxm xanes in conjunction with molecular simulations in this study the adsorption behaviors on smc of five commonly detected pfas including pfoa pfos pfhxs 6 2 ftsa and fhxsa were explored and adsorption isotherms were obtained the uptake of pfas accompanied by the swelling of smc was recorded and analyzed by xrd patterns and site energy distribution based on quantum calculations a novel thermodynamic approach was proposed to estimate the adsorption energy in an aqueous environment not just the binding energy the results provide fundamental insights to support the future use of smc for removing a range of pfas from contaminated waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the surfactant modified clay smc fluoro sorb 200 was

adsorption experiments all adsorption experiments were carried out in a batch mode the pfas solutions were prepared through a spike in procedure 5 0 0 1 mg smc was mixed with 15 0 ml of pfas solution single solute in 15 ml polypropylene conical tubes all suspensions were shaken at 150 rpm and 298 k in the dark in a temperature controlled horizontal shaker the initial concentrations of pfas ranged from 0 38 to 50 11 μmol l during the adsorption process no ph control was attempted the contact time of 168 h was found sufficient for adsorption to reach equilibrium in our previous study yan et al 2020 the equilibrium ph values of pfoa pfhxs pfos 6 2 ftsa and fhxsa solutions with the highest concentration of the isotherms were 5 72 0 08 6 39 0 05 5 29 0 10 7 71 0 09 and 6 64 0 18 respectively revealing anion is the dominant perfluoroalkyl acid species due to the low pka 4 ding and peijnenburg 2013 goss 2008 pfas adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbents was calculated by the pfas mass difference between the blank samples without smc 168 h and equilibrated samples divided the net dry weight of smc thus minimizing the impact of sorption artifact on the final results fig s1 all experiments were conducted in triplicate the pfas concentration was determined by a shimadzu ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with an ab sciex 5500 qtrap mass spectrometer system uhplc ms ms and the details were provided in the supplementary materials 2 3 stxm xanes spectroscopy stxm measurement was conducted at the soft x ray 10id 1 spectromicroscopy sm beamline of the canadian light source which is a 2 9 gev third generation synchrotron a 25 nm outermost zone plate was used to provide a spatial resolution of 30 nm sample in plane polarization dependence was averaged out by a circularly polarized beam generated from the sm elliptically polarized undulator epu powder samples were dispersed in di water and then deposited on a 100 nm thick si3n4 window before being air dried under ultra high vacuum conditions the samples smc loaded with pfoa qe 19 54 mg g smc without pfoa and pfoa were raster scanned in stxm with synchronized detection of transmitted x rays to generate images chemical imaging and xanes spectra were obtained using image sequence scans i e stacks over a range of photon energies at a specific element edge e g 280 320 ev for c 1s and 675 720 ev for f 1s the stack measurements for each element were obtained with dwell times of 1 1 5 ms and with pixel sizes from 40 to 80 nm nanospectroscopic data of xanes could be obtained from any physical location of the sample on the image stacks the c 1s f 1s and si 1s data were collected in that order over the same area with energy steps as fine as 0 1 ev around xanes peaks and 0 4 1 0 ev in the pre edge and continuum more details on stxm experimental and data analysis can be found in the literature chen et al 2014 solomon et al 2012 3 molecular simulations 3 1 molecular models of smc and pfas the surfactant modified clay smc was produced by intercalating quaternary ammonium salt into the interlayer of sodium bentonite as such the model cell of smc was built according to a triclinic p1 orthogonalized unit with a 5 18 å b 8 98 å c 29 00 å determined by the xrd result in this work and α β γ 90 viani et al 2002 and a quaternary ammonium cation c24h49n ch3 3 c24 was inserted heinz et al 2007 one hydroxyl hydrogen atom was added to each octahedral oxygen that does not contact with the tetrahedral silicon and the o h bond distance was assigned to be 0 96 å skipper et al 1991 one aluminum atom was substituted by a magnesium atom in the octahedral sheet which resulted in a unit cell formula of c24h49n ch3 3si8al3mgo20 oh 4 a supercell consisting of 40 smc unit cells 5 4 2 was then constructed scheme 1 3 2 all atom molecular dynamics simulations the adsorption behaviors of pfoa pfos 6 2 ftsa anions and fhxsa molecules on smc represented by a 5 4 2 supercell were monitored through all atom md simulations the system was modelled by a combined all atom force field of clayff cygan et al 2004 for clay sheet and optimized potentials for liquids simulations opls 2005 banks et al 2005 for intercalant and adsorbates pfas parameter details were presented in the supplementary materials fig s2 9 and table s2 3 it was a two step process where smc supercells with diverse basal spacing values were first created and energy minimized by the forcite module of materials studio 6 0 then 20 pfas anions or molecules were inserted and the following md simulations were performed in the dl poly 4 09 with the velocity verlet integration algorithms todorov et al 2006 water molecules were added using the spc e water model the smc pfas water supercell was then relaxed dynamically via the nve constant number of molecules volume and energy integration for 400 ps with a time step of 1 fs followed by the canonical nvt constant number of molecules volume and temperature ensemble for 1 ns and the isothermal isobaric npt constant number of molecules pressure and temperature simulation for 5 ns at 298 k and 1 atm a standard md calculation with an additional geometry optimization sept was performed on every frame produced in the nve nvt and npt simulation periodic boundary conditions were applied in three dimensions the non bond electrostatic interaction was calculated by the smoothed particle mesh ewald summation method and temperature and pressure were maintained by the nose hoover langevin thermostat hoover 1985 nosé 1984 and berendsen barostat berendsen et al 1984 respectively the atom based cutoff distance for van der waals interaction and pairwise coulombic interactions was set to be 8 0 å during the simulation the smectite atoms i e mg al si o and h were frozen while all atoms of the interlayer c24 pfas and water molecules were free to move 3 3 dft based thermodynamics calculation geometry optimization for c24 pfoa pfhxs pfos 6 2 ftsa and fhxsa molecule was first conducted individually and then the clusters of c24 pfoa c24 pfhxs c24 pfos c24 6 2 ftsa and c24 fhxsa were established by combing the intercalant with pfoa pfhxs pfos 6 2 ftsa and fhxsa molecules respectively and geo optimized all these calculations were performed at the b3lyp 6 311 g 2d 2p gd3 level of theory and the solvation model based on density smd was introduced to implicitly simulate the aqueous environment using gaussian 16 liu et al 2018 the adsorption energy was determined by a thermodynamic cycle as described in supplementary materials 4 results and discussion 4 1 piecewise adsorption isotherms previously the adsorption isotherms of the five pfas were determined using afff impacted groundwater total pfas 0 158 0 004 μmol l pfoa 0 014 0 001 μmol l pfhxs 0 038 0 001 μmol l pfos 0 028 0 001 μmol l 6 2 ftsa 0 018 0 001 μmol l and fhxsa 0 031 0 001 μmol l on the same smc there was nearly no expansion of the smc interlayer due to the low concentration yan et al 2020 piecewise isotherms were developed to describe three distinct phases phases ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ as no single isotherm model could describe the data chang et al 2018 the newly obtained adsorption isotherms phase ⅳ at higher concentrations in this study were merged with the previous dataset to cover a broad concentration range as displayed in fig 1 the adsorption isotherms phase ⅳ of pfoa pfhxs pfos 6 2 ftsa and fhxsa were well fitted by the langmuir freundlich equation with high values of coefficient of determination r2 and the corresponding maximum adsorption capacity qmax was determined to be 47 7 2 8 34 5 1 6 59 8 5 7 55 5 6 0 and 36 0 3 4 μmol g presented in fig s10 14 and table s4 respectively as shown by previous results the performance of smc is superior to those of granular activated carbon or hard wood biochar and comparable to an ion exchange resin yan et al 2020 though adsorption capacities of smc for pfoa and pfos determined in this study were lower than those in the reference du et al 2016 notably smc fluoro sorb 200 is mass produced and commercially available as illustrated in scheme 1 the anionic pfoa pfhxs pfos and 6 2 ftsa may strongly interact with the cationic intercalant c24 through the ionic interaction between the negatively charged head groups i e coo or so2o and positively charged ammonium group the weak dipole dipole interaction between the partially negatively charged f atoms on the perfluoroalkyl chain and the partially positively charged h atoms on the c h chain of c24 or the methyl groups connected to the quaternary ammonium could contribute to the binding of pfas with the surfactant c24 as well particularly for the neutral fhxsa molecules importantly piecewise isotherms covered the concentration range of 1 10 9 to 1 10 5 mol l ppt to ppm phase ⅰ ⅳ were recorded for the tested five pfas pfoa for example displayed a linear isotherm in the relatively low concentration range i e phase i from 1 34 10 9 to 3 84 10 9 mol l the first langmuir type isotherm at a slightly higher concentration range i e phase ⅱ and ⅲ from 3 84 10 9 to 6 60 10 9 mol l and the second langmuir type isotherm from 9 22 10 9 to 6 26 10 6 mol l such results indicate that the adsorption behaviors of anionic and neutral pfas on smc were significantly affected by small changes of the system e g concentration and that the adsorption mechanism such as adsorption sites may be distinct with the increase in pfas concentration implying the heterogeneity of smc to investigate the heterogeneous adsorption sites we derived site energy e and its distribution f e from the piecewise adsorption isotherms under the cerofolini approximation cerofolini 1974 the site energy e has been related to the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate ce 1 e e e s r t l n c e c s where cs denotes the maximum water solubility of the adsorbate e is the approximate site energy net energy e e es e is the difference between the solute and solvent adsorption energies for a given site es is the value of the sorption energy corresponding to ce cs r is the universal gas constant and t is the absolute temperature the site energy e thus depends on the adsorbate adsorbent and solvent the cs values of pfas were pfoa 2 29 104 μmol l pfhxs 5 88 102 μmol l and pfos 1 64 103 μmol l u s environmental protection agency 2014 2017 united nations environment programme 2012 and the values of fhxsa and 6 2 ftsa were set as the same as pfhxs incorporating the ce values into eq 1 the site energy e values of pfas on smc phase ⅳ were determined and then plotted as a function of the corresponding qe values in fig 2 a e the e values of all pfas significantly decreased as qe increased the results revealed that both anionic pfoa pfbs pfhxs pfos and 6 2 ftsa or neutral fhxsa pfas first occupied the high energy adsorption sites of smc and then spread to the low energy sites moreover considering pfoa as an example the site energy values ranged from 20 3 to 36 5 kj mol in phase ⅳ that are less than those values determined for lower concentrations phase ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ 41 3 37 3 kj mol as displayed in fig 2k of afff impacted groundwater the site energy distribution f e and its weighted mean μ e for phase ⅳ were then derived to quantitatively compare the distinction between the lower pfas concentrations and higher pfas concentrations by differentiating the isotherm carter et al 1995 yan and niu 2017 2 f e d q e e d e the site energy distribution f e l f 2 nd based on the langmuir freundlich model is 3 f e l f q m n k 2 c s n e n e r t r t 1 k 2 c s n e n e r t 2 the weighted mean was determined to be 4 μ e l f 2 n d r t n ln 1 b c s n the piecewise site energy distribution and its weight mean of pfas on smc were presented in fig 2f j phase ⅳ higher concentration and p t phase ⅰ ⅲ lower concentration it has been reported that the higher the value of the weighted mean the stronger the adsorption affinity carter et al 1995 consistent with site energy ranges for the tested five pfas the μ e values of phase ⅳ were lower than those of phase ⅰ and phase ⅱ ⅲ which revealed a weaker binding between pfas and smc at a higher concentration range the diversity in site energy e and weighted mean μ e of site energy distribution revealed that the adsorption driving force of pfas on the modified clay differed with the increasing occupation of adsorption sites which may be due to heterogeneity of the adsorbent the energetical heterogeneity of the adsorbent mainly originated from the material structure e g defects crosslinking and disordered arrangement and from the diverse chemical composition such as functional groups cerofolini and cerofolini 1980 yoon et al 2006 smc was produced by intercalating quaternary ammonium salt into the interlayers of sodium bentonite that is an expansive clay mineral as illustrated in scheme 1 the adsorption sites of smc can thus be categorized as 1 sparse polarized interlayer edge sites 2 interlayer surface sites 3 internal interlayer sites that can expand as smectite clay swells we proposed that pfas anions or molecules first occupied the sparse polarized interlayer edge sites that have the highest site energy and resulted in a linear adsorption isotherm at low pfas concentration phase ⅰ then the interlayer surface sites led to the first langmuir type isotherm ⅱ ⅲ after that pfas were adsorbed by the inner interlayer sites that accompanied the interlayer expansion of smc and generated the second langmuir type isotherm phase ⅳ the detailed discussion about phases ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ could be found elsewhere yan et al 2020 4 2 stxm mapping and xanes analysis the xrd measurements were carried out to investigate the expansion of smc when adsorption occurs in the interlayers of clay based materials as illustrated in fig s15 the changes in the basal spacing d spacing of smc were observed for the main 001 diffraction peak basal spacing expanded from 29 0 å not loaded with any pfas to 35 6 å loaded with pfoa 50 8 å loaded with pfos 34 2 å loaded with 6 2 ftsa and 38 3 å loaded with fhxsa pfos with the largest molecular length and the highest q m showed the largest d spacing for other pfas d spacing was not proportional to the molecule length table s5 or the adsorption capacity table s4 the obvious increase in basal spacing differed from the adsorption of pfas in afff impacted groundwater at much lower pfas concentration onto smc that no interlayer expansion was recorded in phase ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ yan et al 2020 the expanded d spacing values revealed that pfas were adsorbed into the inner interlayer sites of smc in fig s15 smc without any pfas showed another d 001 peak with a basal spacing of 13 4 å which was attributed to unmodified na bentonite two low degree peaks d 002 and d 003 were also visible in the smc loaded with pfos which represented 1 2 and 1 3 of d 001 respectively these peaks occur on xrd patterns when the d 001 is very large synchrotron based scanning transmission x ray microscope stxm imaged the fine scale spatial distribution of pfoa on smc and displayed in fig 3 a which was the c image difference map of smc loaded with pfoa showing the distribution of c in this region the bottom stack average image the grayscale indicates thickness in optical density od due to limited beamline only pfoa was imaged as a model compound f 1s and si 1s absorption intensities fig s17 were employed to semi quantified the sample thickness since f and si are the characteristic elements of pfoa and smc based on beer lambert s law the absorbance synonymous with optical density od is directly proportional to the amount thickness of the individual compound in the x ray beam path i e pfoa and smc sheet in this work 5 a od c l where a and c are the absorbance and scale factor nm 1 and l denotes the thickness μm and the c values of f 1s and si 1s are 0 00135 nm 1 fig s16 and 0 0014 nm 1 chen et al 2014 respectively by incorporating the absorbance of f 0 25 a u fig s17a and si 0 60 a u fig s17b of smc pfoa the material thickness could be determined thus the numbers of smc sheets and pfoa anion layers were semi quantified as 120 and 52 respectively using the d spacing of smc pfoa 35 6 å the results strongly evidenced that the pfoa anions were primarily adsorbed by the inner interlayer sites rather than the surface layer sites c 1s the common element of the intercalant and pfas and f 1s the characteristic of pfas xanes spectra of smc pfoa and smc loaded with pfoa were extracted to probe the molecular interactions in particular the ionic interaction between the intercalant c24 and the model pfas as presented in fig 3b the peak of pfoa at 689 7 ev is assigned to f 1s σ c f transitions of c f bond in the cf2 cf2 chain the strong f absorbance peak in the smc pfoa spectrum evidenced that pfoa was adsorbed onto smc the fluorine cf2 cf2 chain peak position did not shift after adsorption while the f xanes spectrum exhibited subtle variations in the shape the results indicated that f atoms on pfoa molecules remain at the oxidation state after adsorption but the local geometric structure around the central absorbing atom i e f changed lin et al 2017 this could be attributed to the conformational change of pfoa resulted from the interaction with c24 the peak at 710 2 ev of smc without pfoa di water smc could be attributed to fe l edge sassi et al 2017 because smc was produced using fe containing na bentonite tan et al 2017 the peak at 709 1 ev of pfoa is σ resonance brzhezinskaya et al 2009 the c 1s spectra of pfoa smc and smc loaded with pfoa are displayed in fig 3c the resonance peak at energy 288 6 ev is attributed to c 1s π c o transition of carboxyl c of pfoa chen et al 2014 the peak at 288 0 ev of the smc spectrum represents the alkyl carbon atom attached to ammonium n of the surfactant c24 and the peak redshifted to 287 6 ev for the quaternary alkylammonium on c24 the positive charge is not localized on the nitrogen atom but around the nitrogen atom and its adjacent carbons zeng et al 2003 the redshift indicated the lower energy value of photon resonance for excitation which means c atoms representative of the positively charged quaternary ammonium group gained electron density after the adsorption of pfoa okbinoğlu 2014 considering that pfoa is anionic in an aqueous solution it is logical that the positively charged quaternary ammonium group ch2n ch3 3 of intercalant c24 could form ionic interaction with the negatively charged coo of pfoa the ionic interaction was thus proposed as one of the primary driving forces for the adsorption of pfoa on smc regarding other anionic pfas such as pfos we surmise that consistent peak shifts would be observed on the corresponding xanse spectrum e g c 1 s s 1 s and n 1 s but the peak shape and shift width may vary in addition the electronegativity difference of fluorine carbon and hydrogen gave c f and c h bonds dipole polarity moments which could result in a dipole dipole interaction between the perfluoroalkyl chain of pfas and hydrocarbon chain of the surfactant c24 such an interaction has been proposed to play a substantial role in the adsorption of surfactants brownawell and westall 1991 the adsorption of neutral pfas such as fhxsa might primarily be contributed by the dipole dipole interaction such interactions were investigated at the atomic level through the all atom md simulation dft based quantum calculation 4 3 all atom md simulations of smc with pfas the all atom md simulations of smc with pfoa anions pfos anions 6 2 ftsa anions and fhxsa molecules were performed to probe the conformational changes and molecular interactions 20 pfas anions or molecules were added to the interlayer of smc and the systems were then relaxed through nve 400 ps nvt 1 ns and npt 5 ns the stability of the system was validated by root mean square deviation rmsd analysis and presented in fig s18 to demonstrate that the optimum conformation has been obtained fig 4 a c e and g illustrate the final conformations in the case of pfoa the surfactants c24 neighbored with pfoa anions and charge charge interaction and charge dipole interaction may form between the ammonium n of c24 and the o coo and f atoms of pfoa anions the c f dipole moment is important particularly f attached to an α or β c atom has high electron density the distances between the ammonium n and the o and f atoms were recorded via the radial distribution function g r and displayed in fig 4 the function g r derived from md trajectories of atoms and molecules defines the probability of finding an atom at a distance r from the target atom which is critical to depict a species surroundings in the interlayer region cygan et al 2012 as shown in fig 4b with pfoa present in the interlayer space four o and five f atoms were detected within 6 5 å furthermore aside from the charge charge and charge dipole interaction pfoa anion might interact with c24 via the dipolar interaction between the f of perfluoroalkyl chain and h of hydrocarbon chain revealed by the short atomic distance of 2 577 å fig 4a the conformation and g r results of pfos and 6 2 ftsa were consistent with pfoa while the number of o and f neighboring atoms were distinct one pfos anion was surrounded by six o and four f atoms in 6 5 å and the shortest f h distance was determined as 2 561 å the stronger charge charge charge dipole and dipole dipole interactions of pfos with smc could interpret the highest adsorption capacity among the tested pfas no o atom of fhxsa was recorded in 6 5 å for c24 and the f n distances of the nearest f atoms were larger than those for pfoa pfos and 6 2 ftsa anions fig 4h however as depicted in fig 4g fhxsa was revealed to have almost parallel alignment with c24 which differed from anionic pfas the distinct conformation could originate from the dipolar interaction between the perfluoroalkyl chain of fhxsa and the hydrocarbon chain of the surfactant c24 which was supported by the short f h atomic distances the interaction is strong enough to compensate for the lack of strong ionic interactions resulting in a similar adsorption capacity between pfhxs and fhxsa the md simulations of pfas on smc at lower concentration i e phase ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ were conducted by intercalating 1 phase ⅰ or 4 ⅱ ⅲ pfas anions into a 4 2 2 c24 bentonite supercell which could be found elsewhere yan et al 2020 4 4 dft based quantum calculation the molecular interactions revealed by the md simulations were further investigated through a high level dft based quantum calculation the periodic smc structure was simplified as c24 and the clusters of c24 pfoa c24 pfhxs c24 pfos c24 6 2 ftsa and c24 fhxsa were constructed and optimized at the b3lyp 6 311 g 2d 2p gd3 theory level the optimized structures are visualized in fig 5 significant overlaps were observed between the electrostatic potential surfaces of c24 and anionic pfas the negatively charged head groups red color e g coo and so2o of anionic pfas were embedded in the positively charged center blue color ammonium n the atomic distances between the n and o and α f take pfoa as an example the mean value of the two o or f atoms shortened to 4 51 and 6 13 å respectively due to the charge charge and charge dipole interactions moreover dipolar interactions between the perfluoroalkyl chain of pfoa anion and the hydrocarbon chain of the surfactant c24 were recorded in fig 5a gray dash line by contrast the amine group of fhxsa slightly overlapped with the positively charged ammonium center of c24 and the perfluoroalkyl chain aligned with the hydrocarbon chain is partially parallel although the charge dipole interaction between the c24 and pfas was not observed the charge charge and dipole diploe interactions revealed by the dft calculation were consistent with md simulation results fig 4 the geometry structure transformations of intercalant pfas and clusters lead to energy changes of adsorption a thermodynamic cycle using dft based quantum calculation was thus proposed to determine the pfas adsorption energy the aqueous environment was implicitly simulated by the smd model liu et al 2018 as presented in table 1 all the tested pfas revealed spontaneous adsorption δg 0 on smc and 6 2 ftsa demonstrated the highest adsorption energy 19 64 kcal mol and followed by pfos 18 52 kcal mol fhxsa 17 87 kcal mol pfoa 16 52 kcal mol and pfhxs 15 71 kcal mol moreover the absolute values of adsorption energy raised with an increase in perfluoroalkyl chain length e g pfba pfhxa and pfoa and pfbs pfhxs and pfos which is due to the enhancing hydrophobicity associated with perfluoroalkyl chain length revealed by the solvation free energy δ g s o l v of pfas krafft and riess 2015 to our best knowledge it is the first work that predicts the adsorption energy combing the contributions of electrostatic attractions and hydrophobic interaction solvation free energy using a quantum theory tool rather than the sole binding energy the adsorption energy of gen x 2 3 3 3 tetrafluoro 2 heptafluoropropoxy propanoic acid hfpo da and dona 4 8 dioxa 3h perfluorononanoate were estimated as well gen x 15 21 kcal mol is comparable to pfhxs which indicates the potential of smc for the removal of new pfas that has been reported in surface waters around the world munoz et al 2019 in comparison the adsorption energy for dona another new pfas replacement used for fluorinated polymer production is relatively weak the adsorption of pfas on smc could thus be concluded that the binding of pfas with the intercalant e g charge charge charge dipole and dipolar interactions overcomes the interaction between pfas and water molecules in theory dft predicted adsorption energy should predict the weighted mean site energy μ e which is derived from measured sorption isotherms however the accuracy of μ e is impacted by a compound s water solubility cs and how well experimental data fit a sorption model in reality the correlation is not always predictable or reliable because of the uncertainty linked to estimating the site energy the literature reports a wide range in water solubility of the pfas compounds the maximum adsorption capacities q m and dft predicted adsorption energies follow similar trends in terms of relative magnitude as detailed in the supplementary materials suggesting that strong c24 pfas attraction corresponds to a higher adsorption capacity it is worth noting that the aforementioned dft calculation system only includes one c24 and one pfas which considerably simplifies the actual complex system due to the limitation of gaussian software using gaussian type orbitals to describe atomic orbitals and computational capability however as revealed by the md simulation results one pfas molecule may interact with multiple intercalants and the specific number depends on the pfas species thus the application among distinct adsorbent adsorbate systems should be cautious as evidenced by the difference between pfoa c24 and fhxsa c24 although the prediction shows gen x could be effectively adsorbed by the smc further experimental validation is necessary in addition more accurate and reliable calculations may be achieved by inserting more intercalants and adsorbates and or taking the negatively charged clay sheets into account ferreira et al 2019 employed plane wave orbitals in the dft method to study the structural and electronic properties of iron doped sodium montmorillonite clays however the system only included a clay sheet without water quantum calculation incorporating clay sheets or unit cells water and organic compounds is still ongoing research furthermore the effect of ph and speciation on ionizable compounds are yet to be considered due to various pfas chemistry it is labor intensive to perform adsorption tests and to evaluate the performance of an intercalant for pfas binding md simulation and dft based thermodynamic approach visualized the adsorption process at the atomic level and allowed us to monitor specific adsorbate adsorbent interactions and determine the adsorption energy such an approach presents real possibilities to be used in the process of designing next generation adsorbents and predicting adsorption performance potential reduction in time and efforts of lab testing facilitates solving environmental problems resulted from pfas or other organic contaminants 5 conclusions considering the swelling nature we classify the adsorption sites of smc to be interlayer edge sites surface sites and inner sites pfas first occupied the high energy edge sites and surface sites then spread into the interlayer inner sites accompanied by the expansion of the smc interlayer the molecular mechanism can be concluded that the interactions between the positively charged surfactant and representative pfas e g charge charge charge dipole and dipole dipole interactions the dominant interactions vary from one pfas structure to another overcome the interaction between pfas and water allowing pfas to be retained in the smc s interlayer space clay based materials reveal the possibility of a direct replacement of granular activated carbon for water treatment notably as powerful molecular tools md simulation and dft based calculation can reduce time and efforts of lab testing facilitates spent in designing new adsorbents predicting adsorption performance and solving environmental problems such

16889,the study investigated molecular mechanisms of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas on a surfactant modified clay smc which rivals or exceeds the performance of granular activated carbon in removing long chain pfas from contaminated water the adsorption isotherms of four anionic and one neutral pfas from 1 10 9 to 1 10 5 mol l were measured to be piecewise accompanied by the expansion of the smc interlayer based on the spatial distribution of perfluorocarboxylic acid pfoa on smc at the submicron scale achieved by synchrotron based scanning transmission x ray microscopy stxm coupled

quaternary ammonia cations revealed by the all atom molecular dynamics md simulation and density functional theory based quantum calculations the interactions between the positively charged surfactant

in the exchange sites of smectite clays e g bentonite creates surfactant modified clay smc zeng et al 2003 as ionic interactions between pfas and charged groups on smc may be formed enhanced adsorption was expected du et al 2016 we recently focused on the adsorption of pfas onto smc at an environmentally relevant concentration range e g ppb level of groundwater and showed smc could exceed the performance of granular activated carbon when treating afff impacted groundwater importantly as revealed by the x ray diffraction patterns pfas molecules did not enter the interlayer only occupied the interlayer edge and surface sites to result in a piecewise isotherm phase ⅰ linear shape and phase ⅱ ⅲ langmuir type yan et al 2020 however the expansive character of smc dictates distinct adsorption behaviors with changing pfas loading amount key questions remain will pfas spread to the interlayer internal space of smc at higher loading in restricted interlayer space how pfas molecules interact with hydrocarbon intercalants at the molecular level how to quantify the effect of solvent i e water in this work and how to predict the performance of smc for pfas in addition due to diverse pfas structures adsorption mechanisms may also vary from one compound to another the predominance of a particular mechanism can shift with the perfluoroalkyl chain length or a charged group adsorption mechanisms in interlayer inner sites may resemble those on the edge sites but as these interactions occur below surfaces the direct examination is challenging synchrotron based scanning transmission x ray microscopy stxm can map out the real space full field state of particles with high spatial resolution down to tens of nanometers scale chen et al 2014 lin et al 2017 such offers the possibility for directly visualizing sorbent materials across the entire depth in a nearly non destructive manner rather than only the surface furthermore x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectroscopy extracted from the stxm image contains information in the edge energy position that can be used to quantitatively probe an atom s oxidation state and allow analyzing atom based contaminant sorbent interactions with various depth sensitivity and high resolution lin et al 2017 smith and saykally 2017 though no study has attempted the characterization technique for pfas we hypothesize stxm xanes can assist in identifying specific interactions e g charge charge interaction by visualizing pfas spatial and elemental distribution on smc with high resolutions however x ray sources cannot visualize molecular configurations generally at sub nanoscale which are essential for confirming pfas adsorbent orientations and interactions instead all atom molecular dynamics md a simulation method based on classical mechanics of multiparticle systems can achieve such characterizations adcock and mccammon 2006 this capability shows conformational changes and interacting particles e g atoms groups and molecules offering a seeing is believing way of studying the structure of adsorbent adsorbate systems at the atomic level epa et al 2012 furthermore a detailed and accurate picture of how pfas interacts with the adsorbent can also be provided by the density functional theory dft quantum calculations which determine atomic forces and system energy from first principles by approximating the schrödinger equation hermann et al 2017 the introduction of a solvation model based on density smd can implicitly simulate the aqueous environment and specify the effect of water marenich et al 2009 md and dft tools each has certain limitations but the complementary use of these tools can reduce potentially biased and inaccurate conclusions we proposed that mechanistic insights of pfas on smc can be obtained in an unprecedented way by applying stxm xanes in conjunction with molecular simulations in this study the adsorption behaviors on smc of five commonly detected pfas including pfoa pfos pfhxs 6 2 ftsa and fhxsa were explored and adsorption isotherms were obtained the uptake of pfas accompanied by the swelling of smc was recorded and analyzed by xrd patterns and site energy distribution based on quantum calculations a novel thermodynamic approach was proposed to estimate the adsorption energy in an aqueous environment not just the binding energy the results provide fundamental insights to support the future use of smc for removing a range of pfas from contaminated waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the surfactant modified clay smc fluoro sorb 200 was

adsorption experiments all adsorption experiments were carried out in a batch mode the pfas solutions were prepared through a spike in procedure 5 0 0 1 mg smc was mixed with 15 0 ml of pfas solution single solute in 15 ml polypropylene conical tubes all suspensions were shaken at 150 rpm and 298 k in the dark in a temperature controlled horizontal shaker the initial concentrations of pfas ranged from 0 38 to 50 11 μmol l during the adsorption process no ph control was attempted the contact time of 168 h was found sufficient for adsorption to reach equilibrium in our previous study yan et al 2020 the equilibrium ph values of pfoa pfhxs pfos 6 2 ftsa and fhxsa solutions with the highest concentration of the isotherms were 5 72 0 08 6 39 0 05 5 29 0 10 7 71 0 09 and 6 64 0 18 respectively revealing anion is the dominant perfluoroalkyl acid species due to the low pka 4 ding and peijnenburg 2013 goss 2008 pfas adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbents was calculated by the pfas mass difference between the blank samples without smc 168 h and equilibrated samples divided the net dry weight of smc thus minimizing the impact of sorption artifact on the final results fig s1 all experiments were conducted in triplicate the pfas concentration was determined by a shimadzu ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with an ab sciex 5500 qtrap mass spectrometer system

averaged out by a circularly polarized beam generated from the sm elliptically polarized undulator epu powder samples were dispersed in di water and then deposited on a 100 nm thick si3n4 window before being air dried under ultra high vacuum conditions the samples smc loaded with pfoa qe 19 54 mg g smc without pfoa and pfoa were raster scanned in stxm with synchronized detection of

obtained from any physical location of the sample on the image stacks the c 1s f 1s and si 1s data were collected in that order over the same area with energy steps as fine as 0 1 ev around xanes peaks and 0 4 1 0 ev in the pre edge and continuum more details on stxm experimental and data analysis can be found in the literature chen et al 2014 solomon et al 2012 3 molecular simulations 3 1 molecular models of smc and pfas the surfactant modified clay smc was produced by intercalating quaternary ammonium salt into the interlayer of sodium bentonite as such the model cell of smc was built according to a triclinic p1 orthogonalized unit with a 5 18 å b 8 98 å c 29 00 å determined by the xrd result in this work and α β γ 90 viani et al 2002 and a quaternary ammonium cation c24h49n ch3 3 c24 was inserted heinz et al 2007 one hydroxyl hydrogen atom was added to each octahedral oxygen that does not contact with the tetrahedral silicon and the o h bond distance was assigned to be 0 96 å skipper et al 1991 one aluminum atom was substituted by a magnesium atom in the octahedral sheet which resulted in a unit cell formula of c24h49n ch3 3si8al3mgo20 oh 4 a supercell consisting of 40 smc unit cells 5 4 2 was then constructed scheme 1 3 2 all atom molecular dynamics simulations the adsorption behaviors of pfoa pfos 6 2 ftsa anions and fhxsa molecules on smc represented by a 5 4 2 supercell were monitored through all atom md simulations the system was modelled by a combined all atom force field of clayff cygan et al 2004 for clay sheet and optimized potentials for liquids simulations opls 2005 banks et al 2005 for intercalant and adsorbates pfas parameter details were presented in the supplementary materials fig s2 9 and table s2 3 it was a two step process where smc supercells with diverse basal spacing values were first created and energy minimized by the forcite module of materials studio 6 0 then 20 pfas anions or molecules were inserted and the following md simulations were performed in the dl poly 4 09 with the velocity verlet integration algorithms todorov et al 2006 water molecules were added using the spc e water model the smc pfas water supercell was then relaxed dynamically via the nve constant number of molecules volume and energy integration for 400 ps with a time step of 1 fs followed by the canonical nvt constant number of molecules volume and temperature ensemble for 1 ns and the isothermal isobaric npt constant number of molecules pressure and temperature simulation for 5 ns at 298 k and 1 atm a standard md calculation with an additional geometry optimization sept was performed on every frame produced in the nve nvt and npt simulation periodic boundary conditions were applied in three dimensions the non bond electrostatic interaction was calculated by the smoothed particle mesh ewald summation method and temperature and pressure were maintained by the nose hoover langevin thermostat hoover 1985 nosé 1984 and berendsen barostat berendsen et al 1984 respectively the atom based cutoff distance for van der waals interaction and pairwise coulombic interactions was set to be 8 0 å during the simulation the smectite atoms i e mg al si o and h were frozen while all atoms of the interlayer c24 pfas and water molecules were free to move 3 3 dft based thermodynamics calculation geometry optimization for c24 pfoa pfhxs pfos 6 2 ftsa and fhxsa molecule was first conducted individually and then the clusters of c24 pfoa c24 pfhxs c24 pfos c24 6 2 ftsa and c24 fhxsa were established by combing the intercalant with pfoa pfhxs pfos 6 2 ftsa and fhxsa molecules respectively and geo optimized all these calculations were performed at the b3lyp 6 311 g 2d 2p gd3 level of theory and the solvation model based on density smd was introduced to implicitly simulate the aqueous environment using gaussian 16 liu et al 2018 the adsorption energy was determined by a thermodynamic cycle as described in supplementary materials 4 results and discussion 4 1 piecewise adsorption isotherms previously the adsorption isotherms of the five pfas were determined using afff impacted groundwater total pfas 0 158 0 004 μmol l pfoa 0 014 0 001 μmol l pfhxs 0 038 0 001 μmol l pfos 0 028 0 001 μmol l 6 2 ftsa 0 018 0 001 μmol l and fhxsa 0 031 0 001 μmol l on the same smc there was nearly no expansion of the smc interlayer due to the low concentration yan et al 2020 piecewise isotherms were developed to describe three distinct phases phases ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ as no single isotherm model could describe the data chang et al 2018 the newly obtained adsorption isotherms phase ⅳ at higher concentrations in this study were merged with the previous dataset to cover a broad concentration range as displayed in fig 1 the adsorption isotherms phase ⅳ of pfoa pfhxs pfos 6 2 ftsa and fhxsa were well fitted by the langmuir freundlich equation with high values of coefficient of determination r2 and the corresponding maximum adsorption capacity qmax was determined to be 47 7 2 8 34 5 1 6 59 8 5 7 55 5 6 0 and 36 0 3 4 μmol g presented in fig s10 14 and table s4 respectively as shown by previous results the performance of smc is superior to those of granular activated carbon or hard wood biochar and comparable to an ion exchange resin yan et al 2020 though adsorption capacities of smc for pfoa and pfos determined in this study were lower than those in the reference du et al 2016 notably smc fluoro sorb 200 is mass produced and commercially available as illustrated in scheme 1 the anionic pfoa pfhxs pfos and 6 2 ftsa may strongly interact with the cationic intercalant c24 through the ionic interaction between the negatively charged head groups i e coo or so2o and positively charged ammonium group the weak dipole dipole interaction between the partially negatively charged f atoms on the perfluoroalkyl chain and the partially positively charged h atoms on the c h chain of c24 or the methyl groups connected to the quaternary ammonium could contribute to the binding of pfas with the surfactant c24 as well particularly for the neutral fhxsa molecules importantly piecewise isotherms covered the concentration range of 1 10 9 to 1 10 5 mol l ppt to ppm phase ⅰ ⅳ were recorded for the tested five pfas pfoa for example displayed a linear isotherm in the relatively low concentration range i e phase i from 1 34 10 9 to 3 84 10 9 mol l the first langmuir type isotherm at a slightly higher concentration range i e phase ⅱ and ⅲ from 3 84 10 9 to 6 60 10 9 mol l and the second langmuir type isotherm from 9 22 10 9 to 6 26 10 6 mol l such results indicate that the adsorption behaviors of anionic and neutral pfas on smc were significantly affected by small changes of the system e g concentration and that the adsorption mechanism such as adsorption sites may be distinct with the increase in pfas concentration implying the heterogeneity of smc to investigate the heterogeneous adsorption sites we derived site energy e and its distribution f e from the piecewise adsorption isotherms under the cerofolini approximation cerofolini 1974 the site energy e has been related to the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate ce 1 e e e s r t l n c e c s where cs denotes the maximum water solubility of the adsorbate e is the approximate site energy net energy e e es e is the difference between the solute and solvent adsorption energies for a given site es is the value of the sorption energy corresponding to ce cs r is the universal gas constant and t is the absolute temperature the site energy e thus depends on the adsorbate adsorbent and solvent the cs values of pfas were pfoa 2 29 104 μmol l pfhxs 5 88 102 μmol l and pfos 1 64 103 μmol l u s environmental protection agency 2014 2017 united nations environment programme 2012 and the values of fhxsa and 6 2 ftsa were set as the same as pfhxs incorporating the ce values into eq 1 the site energy e values of pfas on smc phase ⅳ were determined and then plotted as a function of the corresponding qe values in fig 2 a e the e values of all pfas significantly decreased as qe increased the results revealed that both anionic pfoa pfbs pfhxs pfos and 6 2 ftsa or neutral fhxsa pfas first occupied the high energy adsorption sites of smc and then spread to the low energy sites moreover considering pfoa as an example the site energy values ranged from 20 3 to 36 5 kj mol in phase ⅳ that are less than those values determined for lower concentrations phase ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ 41 3 37 3 kj mol as displayed in fig 2k of afff impacted groundwater the site energy distribution f e and its weighted mean μ e for phase ⅳ were then derived to quantitatively compare the distinction between the lower pfas concentrations and higher pfas concentrations by differentiating the isotherm carter et al 1995 yan and niu 2017 2 f e d q e e d e the site energy distribution f e l f 2 nd based on the langmuir freundlich model is 3 f e l f q m n k 2 c s n e n e r t r t 1 k 2 c s n e n e r t 2 the weighted mean was determined to be 4 μ e l f 2 n d r t n ln 1 b c s n the piecewise site energy distribution and its weight mean of pfas on smc were presented in fig 2f j phase ⅳ higher concentration and p t phase ⅰ ⅲ lower concentration it has been reported that the higher the value of the weighted mean the stronger the adsorption affinity carter et al 1995 consistent with site energy ranges for the tested five pfas the μ e values of phase ⅳ were lower than those of phase ⅰ and phase ⅱ ⅲ which revealed a weaker binding between pfas and smc at a higher concentration range the diversity in site energy e and weighted mean μ e of site energy distribution revealed that the adsorption driving force of pfas on the modified clay differed with the increasing occupation of adsorption sites which may be due to heterogeneity of the adsorbent the energetical heterogeneity of the adsorbent mainly originated from the material structure e g defects crosslinking and disordered arrangement and from the diverse chemical composition such as functional groups cerofolini and cerofolini 1980 yoon et al 2006 smc was produced by intercalating quaternary ammonium salt into the interlayers of sodium bentonite that is an expansive clay mineral as illustrated in scheme 1 the adsorption sites of smc can thus be categorized as 1 sparse polarized interlayer edge sites 2 interlayer surface sites 3 internal interlayer sites that can expand as smectite clay swells we proposed that pfas anions or molecules first occupied the sparse polarized interlayer edge sites that have the highest site energy and resulted in a linear adsorption isotherm at low pfas concentration phase ⅰ then the interlayer surface sites led to the first langmuir type isotherm ⅱ ⅲ after that pfas were adsorbed by the inner interlayer sites that accompanied the interlayer expansion of smc and generated the second langmuir type isotherm phase ⅳ the detailed discussion about phases ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ could be found elsewhere yan et al 2020 4 2 stxm mapping and xanes analysis the xrd measurements were carried out to investigate the expansion of smc when adsorption occurs in the interlayers of clay based materials as illustrated in fig s15 the changes in the basal spacing d spacing of smc were observed for the main 001 diffraction peak basal spacing expanded from 29 0 å not loaded with any pfas to 35 6 å loaded with pfoa 50 8 å loaded with pfos 34 2 å loaded with 6 2 ftsa and 38 3 å loaded with fhxsa pfos with the largest molecular length and the highest q m showed the largest d spacing for other pfas d spacing was not proportional to the molecule length table s5 or the adsorption capacity table s4 the obvious increase in basal spacing differed from the adsorption of pfas in afff impacted groundwater at much lower pfas concentration onto smc that no interlayer expansion was recorded in phase ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ yan et al 2020 the expanded d spacing values revealed that pfas were adsorbed into the inner interlayer sites of smc in fig s15 smc without any pfas showed another d 001 peak with a basal spacing of 13 4 å which was attributed to unmodified na bentonite two low degree peaks d 002 and d 003 were also visible in the smc loaded with pfos which represented 1 2 and 1 3 of d 001 respectively these peaks occur on xrd patterns when the d 001 is very large synchrotron based scanning transmission x ray microscope stxm imaged the fine scale spatial distribution of pfoa on smc and displayed in fig 3 a which was the c image difference map of smc loaded with pfoa showing the distribution of c in this region the bottom stack average image the grayscale indicates thickness in optical density od due to limited beamline only pfoa was imaged as a model compound f 1s and si 1s absorption intensities fig s17 were employed to semi quantified the sample thickness since f and si are the characteristic elements of pfoa and smc based on beer lambert s law the absorbance synonymous with optical density od is directly proportional to the amount thickness of the individual compound in the x ray beam path i e pfoa and smc sheet in this work 5 a od c l where a and c are the absorbance and scale factor nm 1 and l denotes the thickness μm and the c values of f 1s and si 1s are 0 00135 nm 1 fig s16 and 0 0014 nm 1 chen et al 2014 respectively by incorporating the absorbance of f 0 25 a u fig s17a and si 0 60 a u fig s17b of smc pfoa the material thickness could be determined thus the numbers of smc sheets and pfoa anion layers were semi quantified as 120 and 52 respectively using the d spacing of smc pfoa 35 6 å the results strongly evidenced that the pfoa anions were primarily adsorbed by the inner interlayer sites rather than the surface layer sites c 1s the common element of the intercalant and pfas and f 1s the characteristic of pfas xanes spectra of smc pfoa and smc loaded with pfoa were extracted to probe the molecular interactions in particular the ionic interaction between the intercalant c24 and the model pfas as presented in fig 3b the peak of pfoa at 689 7 ev is assigned to f 1s σ c f transitions of c f bond in the cf2 cf2 chain the strong f absorbance peak in the smc pfoa spectrum evidenced that pfoa was adsorbed onto smc the fluorine cf2 cf2 chain peak position did not shift after adsorption while the f xanes spectrum exhibited subtle variations in the shape the results indicated that f atoms on pfoa molecules remain at the oxidation state after adsorption but the local geometric structure around the central absorbing atom i e f changed lin et al 2017 this could be attributed to the conformational change of pfoa resulted from the interaction with c24 the peak at 710 2 ev of smc without pfoa di water smc could be attributed to fe l edge sassi et al 2017 because smc was produced using fe containing na bentonite tan et al 2017 the peak at 709 1 ev of pfoa is σ resonance brzhezinskaya et al 2009 the c 1s spectra of pfoa smc and smc loaded with pfoa are displayed in fig 3c the resonance peak at energy 288 6 ev is attributed to c 1s π c o transition of carboxyl c of pfoa chen et al 2014 the peak at 288 0 ev of the smc spectrum represents the alkyl carbon atom attached to ammonium n of the surfactant c24 and the peak redshifted to 287 6 ev for the quaternary alkylammonium on c24 the positive charge is not localized on the nitrogen atom but around the nitrogen atom and its adjacent carbons zeng et al 2003 the redshift indicated the lower energy value of photon resonance for excitation which means c atoms representative of the positively charged quaternary ammonium group gained electron density after the adsorption of pfoa okbinoğlu 2014 considering that pfoa is anionic in an aqueous solution it is logical that the positively charged quaternary ammonium group ch2n ch3 3 of intercalant c24 could form ionic interaction with the negatively charged coo of pfoa the ionic interaction was thus proposed as one of the primary driving forces for the adsorption of pfoa on smc regarding other anionic pfas such as pfos we surmise that consistent peak shifts would be observed on the corresponding xanse spectrum e g c 1 s s 1 s and n 1 s but the peak shape and shift width may vary in addition the electronegativity difference of fluorine carbon and hydrogen gave c f and c h bonds dipole polarity moments which could result in a dipole dipole interaction between the perfluoroalkyl chain of pfas and hydrocarbon chain of the surfactant c24 such an interaction has been proposed to play a substantial role in the adsorption of surfactants brownawell and westall 1991 the adsorption of neutral pfas such as fhxsa might primarily be contributed by the dipole dipole interaction such interactions were investigated at the atomic level through the all atom md simulation dft based quantum calculation 4 3 all atom md simulations of smc with pfas the all atom md simulations of smc with pfoa anions pfos anions 6 2 ftsa anions and fhxsa molecules were performed to probe the conformational changes and molecular interactions 20 pfas anions or molecules were added to the interlayer of smc and the systems were then relaxed through nve 400 ps nvt 1 ns and npt 5 ns the stability of the system was validated by root mean square deviation rmsd analysis and presented in fig s18 to demonstrate that the optimum conformation has been obtained fig 4 a c e and g illustrate the final conformations in the case of pfoa the surfactants c24 neighbored with pfoa anions and charge charge interaction and charge dipole interaction may form between the ammonium n of c24 and the o coo and f atoms of pfoa anions the c f dipole moment is important particularly f attached to an α or β c atom has high electron density the distances between the ammonium n and the o and f atoms were recorded via the radial distribution function g r and displayed in fig 4 the function g r derived from md trajectories of atoms and molecules defines the probability of finding an atom at a distance r from the target atom which is critical to depict a species surroundings in the interlayer region cygan et al 2012 as shown in fig 4b with pfoa present in the interlayer space four o and five f atoms were detected within 6 5 å furthermore aside from the charge charge and charge dipole interaction pfoa anion might interact with c24 via the dipolar interaction between the f of perfluoroalkyl chain and h of hydrocarbon chain revealed by the short atomic distance of 2 577 å fig 4a the conformation and g r results of pfos and 6 2 ftsa were consistent with pfoa while the number of o and f neighboring atoms were distinct one pfos anion was surrounded by six o and four f atoms in 6 5 å and the shortest f h distance was determined as 2 561 å the stronger charge charge charge dipole and dipole dipole interactions of pfos with smc could interpret the highest adsorption capacity among the tested pfas no o atom of fhxsa was recorded in 6 5 å for c24 and the f n distances of the nearest f atoms were larger than those for pfoa pfos and 6 2 ftsa anions fig 4h however as depicted in fig 4g fhxsa was revealed to have almost parallel alignment with c24 which differed from anionic pfas the distinct conformation could originate from the dipolar interaction between the perfluoroalkyl chain of fhxsa and the hydrocarbon chain of the surfactant c24 which was supported by the short f h atomic distances the interaction is strong enough to compensate for the lack of strong ionic interactions resulting in a similar adsorption capacity between pfhxs and fhxsa the md simulations of pfas on smc at lower concentration i e phase ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ were conducted by intercalating 1 phase ⅰ or 4 ⅱ ⅲ pfas anions into a 4 2 2 c24 bentonite supercell which could be found elsewhere yan et al 2020 4 4 dft based quantum calculation the molecular interactions revealed by the md simulations were further investigated through a high level dft based quantum calculation the periodic smc structure was simplified as c24 and the clusters of c24 pfoa c24 pfhxs c24 pfos c24 6 2 ftsa and c24 fhxsa were constructed and optimized at the b3lyp 6 311 g 2d 2p gd3 theory level the optimized structures are visualized in fig 5 significant overlaps were observed between the electrostatic potential surfaces of c24 and anionic pfas the negatively charged head groups red color e g coo and so2o of anionic pfas were embedded in the positively charged center blue color ammonium n the atomic distances between the n and o and α f take pfoa as an example the mean value of the two o or f atoms shortened to 4 51 and 6 13 å respectively due to the charge charge and charge dipole interactions moreover dipolar interactions between the perfluoroalkyl chain of pfoa anion and the hydrocarbon chain of the surfactant c24 were recorded in fig 5a gray dash line by contrast the amine group of fhxsa slightly overlapped with the positively charged ammonium center of c24 and the perfluoroalkyl chain aligned with the hydrocarbon chain is partially parallel although the charge dipole interaction between the c24 and pfas was not observed the charge charge and dipole diploe interactions revealed by the dft calculation were consistent with md simulation results fig 4 the geometry structure transformations of intercalant pfas and clusters lead to energy changes of adsorption a thermodynamic cycle using dft based quantum calculation was thus proposed to determine the pfas adsorption energy the aqueous environment was implicitly simulated by the smd model liu et al 2018 as presented in table 1 all the tested pfas revealed spontaneous adsorption δg 0 on smc and 6 2 ftsa demonstrated the highest adsorption energy 19 64 kcal mol and followed by pfos 18 52 kcal mol fhxsa 17 87 kcal mol pfoa 16 52 kcal mol and pfhxs 15 71 kcal mol moreover the absolute values of adsorption energy raised with an increase in perfluoroalkyl chain length e g pfba pfhxa and pfoa and pfbs pfhxs and pfos which is due to the enhancing hydrophobicity associated with perfluoroalkyl chain length revealed by the solvation free energy δ g s o l v of pfas krafft and riess 2015 to our best knowledge it is the first work that predicts the adsorption energy combing the contributions of electrostatic attractions and hydrophobic interaction solvation free energy using a quantum theory tool rather than the sole binding energy the adsorption energy of gen x 2 3 3 3 tetrafluoro 2 heptafluoropropoxy propanoic acid hfpo da and dona 4 8 dioxa 3h perfluorononanoate were estimated as well gen x 15 21 kcal mol is comparable to pfhxs which indicates the potential of smc for the removal of new pfas that has been reported in surface waters around the world munoz et al 2019 in comparison the adsorption energy for dona another new pfas replacement used for fluorinated polymer production is relatively weak the adsorption of pfas on smc could thus be concluded that the binding of pfas with the intercalant e g charge charge charge dipole and dipolar interactions overcomes the interaction between pfas and water molecules in theory dft predicted adsorption energy should predict the weighted mean site energy μ e which is derived from measured sorption isotherms however the accuracy of μ e is impacted by a compound s water solubility cs and how well experimental data fit a sorption model in reality the correlation is not always predictable or reliable because of the uncertainty linked to estimating the site energy the literature reports a wide range in water solubility of the pfas compounds the maximum adsorption capacities q m and dft predicted adsorption energies follow similar trends in terms of relative magnitude as detailed in the supplementary materials suggesting that strong c24 pfas attraction corresponds to a higher adsorption capacity it is worth noting that the aforementioned dft calculation system only includes one c24 and one pfas which considerably simplifies the actual complex system due to the limitation of gaussian software using gaussian type orbitals to describe atomic orbitals and computational capability however as revealed by the md simulation results one pfas molecule may interact with multiple intercalants and the specific number depends on the pfas species thus the application among distinct adsorbent adsorbate systems should be cautious as evidenced by the difference between pfoa c24 and fhxsa c24 although the prediction shows gen x could be effectively adsorbed by the smc further experimental validation is necessary in addition more accurate and reliable calculations may be achieved by inserting more intercalants and adsorbates and or taking the negatively charged clay sheets into account ferreira et al 2019 employed plane wave orbitals in the dft method to study the structural and electronic properties of iron doped sodium montmorillonite clays however the system only included a clay sheet without water quantum calculation incorporating clay sheets or unit cells water and organic compounds is still ongoing research furthermore the effect of ph and speciation on ionizable compounds are yet to be considered due to various pfas chemistry it is labor intensive to perform adsorption tests and to evaluate the performance of an intercalant for pfas binding md simulation and dft based thermodynamic approach visualized the adsorption process at the atomic level and allowed us to monitor specific adsorbate adsorbent interactions and determine the adsorption energy such an approach presents real possibilities to be used in the process of designing next generation adsorbents and predicting adsorption performance potential reduction in time and efforts of lab testing facilitates solving environmental problems resulted from pfas or other organic contaminants 5 conclusions considering the swelling nature we classify the adsorption sites of smc to be interlayer edge sites surface sites and inner sites pfas first occupied the high energy edge sites and surface sites then spread into the interlayer inner sites accompanied by the expansion of the smc interlayer the molecular mechanism can be concluded that the interactions between the positively charged surfactant and representative pfas e g charge charge charge dipole and dipole dipole interactions the dominant interactions vary from one pfas structure to another overcome the interaction between pfas and water allowing pfas to be retained in the smc s interlayer space clay based materials reveal the possibility of a direct replacement of granular activated carbon for water treatment notably as powerful molecular tools md simulation and dft based calculation can reduce time and efforts of lab testing facilitates spent in designing new adsorbents predicting adsorption performance and solving environmental problems such as pfas or other organic contaminants declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this project is supported by the nserc collaborative research development grant crdpj 537771 18 and in
