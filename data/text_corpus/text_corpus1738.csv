8690,we exploit sudden changes in the marginal tariff scheme to estimate the price elasticity of water demand using households and firms data in tangerang regency a part of the jakarta greater metropolitan area where water demand management is imperative due to the city s growing population and industrial activities a monthly water consumption dataset at the consumer level is used in our study using the regression discontinuity in time rdit approach we find the price elasticity of water demand is 0 32 for household consumers and inelastic to changes in price in contrast elasticity for industrial and commercial consumers is 1 16 implying a more elastic response the results raise concerns that firms substitute for a cheaper water source endangering the water resources sustainability in the area keywords water demand elasticities urban water regression discontinuity in time rdit indonesia jel classification l95 r22 r53 1 introduction clean water plays an important role in fulfilling humans basic needs and access to it is one of the parameters for the quality of life of a society it highly contributes to a country in achieving sustainable development goals sdgs since it is crucial to reaching health targets food security and poverty alleviation targets 1 water provision is also essential as a production input for manufacturing activities in numerous industrial sectors such as in the food and beverages sector 2 access to clean and sustainable water remains a challenge in developing countries including indonesia despite a relatively high proportion of indonesian people having access to improved drinking water sources 1 1 unimproved drinking water sources refer to surface water such as water from rivers or lakes unprotected wells and unprotected springs most of the water comes directly from groundwater which is potentially harmful to groundwater sustainability 3 local government owned water utilities pdam perusahaan daerah air minum providing piped water services cover only a small portion of the water provision service 4 on the other hand by 2030 the industrial water demand is expected to double from its 2013 level while urban domestic demand is predicted to rise from about 205 m3 s in 2015 to 283 m3 s 4 furthermore challenges to providing clean and sustainable water services are likely to be higher in rapidly urbanized areas because of the fierce competition among economic activities 5 in this paper we aim to provide estimates of the price elasticity of water demand that can be used as a reference for the case of indonesia specifically we estimate price elasticity of water demand using the monthly water consumption of pt air aetra tangerang consumers in tangerang regency indonesia the company is privately owned together with the regional water company of tangerang and provides fresh water service for a substantial number of citizens of tangerang our monthly water consumption covers 57 months and more than 50 thousand consumers forming approximately 1 6 million monthly consumer panel observations the rich dataset also includes several types of consumers including households industries commercial enterprises and social clients which enables us to estimate the consumption effect of tariff change for both household and non household consumers based on our results desk study and regional statistics we discuss how a change in piped water tariff might affect water sustainability while investment in piped water facilities is essential for ensuring the supply of clean water understanding water demand is also imperative understanding how sensitive water demand is to changes in price will enable us to use price as a potential instrument to manage the increasing water demand over time furthermore changes in the price of one source of water supply might result in consumers substituting to other sources 6 in this case changes in the price of piped water service might result in consumers substituting to groundwater this issue becomes more relevant for indonesia since some of its urban areas have experienced a high land subsidence rate due to the high exploitation of groundwater 7 to obtain the causal impact we exploited an unprecedented tariff adjustment in november 2014 as the forcing variable in the regression discontinuity framework the company announced the tariff adjustment without advance notice we adopted 8 estimation strategy to reduce the estimation bias by controlling the consumer fixed effect the polynomial time trend and other control variables we followed the steps recommended in ref 9 to check our estimates reliability we did a robustness test using various polynomial trends we also conducted placebo tests checked the continuity of control variables and estimated a donut rd to check for the possibility of sorting behavior following the guidelines provided in ref 52 estimated standard errors were clustered to reduce potential bias due to serial correlation 10 11 we found that a sudden change in the block tariff scheme by 14 reduced household and non household water consumption by 5 and 15 respectively however social clients were not responsive to the tariff change the estimate also varied across subdistricts but was relatively stable across the time frame our results are robust to alternative time trend order the estimates also did not change much when we removed observations near the threshold suggesting that short run selection anticipation avoidance effects are less likely to be present we contribute to the literature in three aspects first we provide an alternative to the established studies using rdit as a forcing variable to minimize the estimation biases exploiting the fact that the percentage change in the tariff is relatively homogenous across blocks and consumer groups recent literature shows that the price elasticity of water demand estimates is potentially biased due to the increasing block rate structures of water pricing strategies while consumers are not always fully aware of the complex pricing schemes they experience 12 increasing block pricing ibp is the most commonly used water pricing scheme under an ibp the higher the volumes of water consumed by consumers the higher the marginal price they must pay however consumers often only respond to average local prices instead of the full price schedule 13 leading to biased demand elasticity estimates the potential bias problem due to increasing block rate structures can be solved by applying a discrete continuous model 14 we argue that our alternative rdit approach is more straightforward yet provides relatively reliable and comparable estimates our estimates remain robust under different polynomial time trends model specifications and the selection and strategic behavior assumptions as proposed by ref 9 second we analyze the case of indonesia a middle income country facing the challenges in delivering clean and sustainable water services particularly in urban areas in the context of indonesia we extended the work of 15 who estimated the residential water demand in solo indonesia our elasticity estimates are more inelastic although still relatively comparable with recent studies of water elasticity estimation furthermore to the best of our knowledge this is the first study attempting to estimate non residential water demand elasticity in indonesia also tangerang is an industrial area while many of the recent studies on non residential water demand elasticity focused on agricultural areas lastly our dataset allow us to examine the extent to which the impact of a sudden change in the block tariff scheme differed as time elapsed our paper proceeds as follows section 2 explains the current system of water provision in the tangerang regency and how pt aetra contributes to the system section 3 describes our model and data and discusses the expected effects of a sudden tariff adjustment on water consumption section 4 presents the estimation results and the final section provides a discussion and a conclusion 2 context water utility provision and the position of pt aetra air tangerang in the tangerang regency the tangerang regency is situated on java island in banten province 40 km to the west side of jakarta the capital city of indonesia the regency is part of a greater metropolitan area known as jabodetabek one of the world s largest urbanized areas it is also home to several major indonesian industrial estates 4 in 2016 there were approximately 823 thousand households in the tangerang regency spread over 29 subdistricts most households were in the pasar kemis subdistrict while the least number of households were in the mekarbaru subdistrict indonesian bureau of statistics 2017 as commonly practiced in every region in indonesia water service provision for household and non household activities in the tangerang regency is mainly delivered via piped water provided by a local government owned water company such as pdam tirta kerta raharja or from groundwater rivers and other natural sources of water nevertheless a substantial number of tangerang residents still do not have sustainable access to clean water in 2016 less than 20 of the households had access to piped water in the tangerang regency to extend the access to clean and safe water in 2011 the local government of the tangerang regency invited a private company pt aetra air tangerang to serve drinking water for eight subdistricts via a 25 year concession the partnership formed the first public private partnership project of 26 projects offered by the central government in 2006 the eight subdistricts include sepatan sepatan timur pasar kemis cikupa sindang jaya sukamulya balaraja and jayanti see fig 1 the source of the water is the cisadane river the company was initially designed to serve about 72 thousand household connections and to provide additional non household connections meanwhile customers in other subdistricts are served by the pdam tirta kerta raharja table 1 provides the tariff scheme charged by pt aetra air tangerang between november 2014 and march 2017 58 pt aetra air tangerang imposes a block pricing tariff the greater the amount of water consumed the higher per m3 water tariff to be paid the tariff is also differentiated according to consumers households as the main consumers are divided into four groups based on the potential value of their properties determined by the size and location this information was primarily obtained before they subscribed to the service households with small houses in poor neighborhoods fall into the r1 group and are charged the subsidized tariff the r4 group pays the highest tariff according to an interview conducted with the service provider a consumer can switch groups however we did not find individual consumers changing groups during our observation period non household consumers are differentiated similarly social consumers such as mosques and orphanages are subsidized other groups including government commercial and industrial consumers are charged at much higher rates than are social consumers the indonesian water tariff system is regulated strictly by the government at the national level the minister of home affairs regulation no 71 2016 on the calculation and determination of drinking water tariffs stipulates the maximum level of the water tariff that the cost borne by households for the first 10 m3 of consumption should not exceed 4 of the provincial minimum wage income in addition water utilities cannot increase their tariffs without the approval from the mayor of the regency in which they operate no change in tariff can be proposed less than two years after the most recent tariff adjustment the adjustment must follow the principles of affordability and fairness according to the minister of home affairs regulation no 71 2016 on the drinking water tariffs calculation household expenditure to fulfill drinking water standards for basic needs 10 m3 should not exceed 4 of banten s provincial minimum wage the minimum wage for banten province was about three million rupiahs in 2016 2 2 or the equivalent of us 222 2 assuming the exchange rate is 13 500 rupiah us as stipulated in the decree of the governor of banten no 561 kep huk 2016 thus according to the regulation the drinking water tariff should not exceed 71 360 rupiahs under the new tariff thus far the company has adjusted the tariff twice in november 2014 and in march 2017 53 54 the first tariff adjustment was more sudden and less anticipated by the consumers as the company announced the change after the new tariff was imposed the latter adjustment was potentially more anticipated as the plan had been disseminated in advance therefore we used the data from the first tariff adjustment to estimate the water demand elasticity we did not include the data from march 2017 and after in this study 3 method 3 1 basic model and data we estimated the impact of the november 2014 water tariff adjustment on monthly water consumption to determine the causal relationship we used the regression discontinuity technique with the time variable as an assignment variable 8 17 18 this approach identifies the effect of a policy by examining discontinuous variations around a known cutoff 19 in our case the cutoff is the month in which the new tariff was implemented the estimation can be written as 1 ln y i t 1 α i β d t x γ θ j f t ρ m y e a r τ y e a r e i t the dependent variable is the monthly water consumption of consumer i in month t presented in a natural logarithm we added one to water consumption to avoid a dropped observation under the logarithm transformation that accounts for 10 1 of the total observations subscribers may report zero consumption because of a temporal move or even a complete switch to using groundwater our monthly water consumption dataset recorded from january 2012 to september 2016 with a total consumer base of 55 7 thousand subscribers there are more than 3 2 million potential observations however some consumers canceled their subscriptions during our observation period leading to missing observations therefore our data set contains approximately 1 7 million observations in total we used monthly water consumption data as the dependent variable in our study in contrast with high frequency daily data and hourly data used in previous regression discontinuity in time studies 17 18 since only monthly data was available furthermore 9 using monthly averages of daily data used in ref 17 found that the estimates of the treatment effect using monthly data was close to the one using daily data despite with varying degree of precision similar results were also generated when they used monte carlo simulation our variable of interest is the dummy variable d t that captures the policy change in the water utility tariff the value is 1 for the period after the new tariff was applied and 0 otherwise we assumed that the effect of the change in tariff started in december 2014 as pt aetra air tangerang announced the policy by mid november 2014 table 2 the percentage of change in water consumption due to the change in the water price was calculated as 100 e β 1 20 the elasticity of the water demand for each k consumer group ε k was then calculated by dividing the percentage of change in water consumption by the percentage of change in the water price for the respective groups θ k such that ε k 100 e β 1 θ k our strategy to estimate the price elasticity assumed that the discontinuous price scheme that changed in november 2014 was the only factor captured by the variable d t therefore we included observable control variables x in equation 1 we included interpolated monthly gdp data as proxies for income our set of variables also included monthly precipitation at the village level to control activities affecting the water demand such as watering gardens the impact of the tariff adjustment was also controlled via the monthly consumer price index we introduced dummy variables for the islamic holiday month the eid al fitr celebration which is held annually following the lunar calendar we then added a dummy for the drought that occurred in august 2015 and affected the cisadane river serving as the source of aetra s water detailed explanations and the sources of data are presented in appendix a water consumption is likely to be seasonal and may be higher during certain months to capture the effect of seasonality we introduced ρ m y e a r which represents the month of the year similarly we included year dummies τ y e a r to accommodate different long term trends due to data limitations at the individual level the model cannot control for the unobservable individual factors that potentially affect water consumption such as the number of household members which may have changed during our observation period we applied a consumer fixed effect panel estimation to eliminate the potentially omitted variable bias from the unobserved time invariant variables to reduce the potential bias from the omitted time variant unobservable variables we introduced a polynomial time trend f t 8 the polynomial time trend is assumed to provide different effects across subdistrict j we later performed a robustness test of polynomial order to check the extent to which our elasticity estimates remained robust under different polynomial orders water consumption is unlikely to be independent across time in addition our dataset involves a relatively long period of 57 months both aspects potentially create serial correlation problems 10 hence we allowed an unobserved disturbance e i t to be correlated with the same consumer and year following 11 procedure to capture within consumer correlations and serial correlations the reported standard errors were then clustered according to each consumer year combination the estimates will also suffer parameter bias if the consumers can anticipate the policy by adjusting their behavior before the new tariff is announced see ref 21 besides the response parameter is potentially underestimated if consumers alter their water consumption behavior before the tariff adjustment is announced in our setting however the bias can be minimized as pt aetra air tangerang announced the new tariff in the same month as its implementation 3 3 we obtained this information via direct correspondence with pt aetra s representative we estimated equation 1 using data of both household and non household consumers we grouped household consumers into r2 middle low income consumers and r3 middle high income and r4 high income consumers we removed r1 low consumers from our sample because the sample size of this group was too small non household consumers consist of commercial and industrial consumers who pay a higher tariff and social consumers who pay a subsidized tariff 3 2 short run response in addition to the analysis of the entire observation period we were interested in examining whether consumers responses to tariff changes differed over time compared to the long run demand can be more elastic or inelastic depending on the nature of the goods in the short run to obtain the response in the first n month we modified an asymmetric model which divides independent variables of interest into two states 22 23 in brief we estimate 2 ln y i t 1 α i β 1 d t 1 β 2 d t 2 x γ θ j f t ρ m y e a r τ y e a r e i t where d t 1 is a dummy variable taking values equal to 1 for the first several months after the tariff increase and 0 otherwise meanwhile dummy d t 2 takes the value of 0 before the tariff increase and the first several months after the tariff increase as in d t 1 and 1 otherwise this setting allowed us to distinguish between the average effect for the first several months after the tariff increase β 1 and the effect thereafter β 2 we estimated equation 2 from the first two months to 12 months after the tariff increase 3 2 1 expected response to the water tariff adjustment what was the impact of the water tariff increase on the monthly water consumption of pt aetra air tangerang s customers the basic economic theory of demand states that a tariff increase reduces water consumption nevertheless the percentage of the reduction is expected to be relatively smaller than is the percentage of the tariff increase as water is a basic need however the response may differ across consumer groups an empirical study by ref 24 in arizona found that high income households tended to respond less than did low income households furthermore we expected non household groups particularly industrial and commercial consumers to be less responsive to the tariff adjustment as they had fewer options to substitute pt aetra s water source similarly we expected the short term and long term response to be different fig 2 clarifies our understanding of water consumption behavior near the tariff adjustment by illustrating average monthly residuals of water consumption from our raw data for household and non household consumers in a natural logarithm the graphs plot the average residual monthly water consumption of households against the month distance in november 2014 by controlling covariates and the time trend presented in equation 1 4 4 the average monthly water consumption for households is 14 1 m3 with standard deviation 16 3 m3 while the average monthly water consumption for non households is 245 2 m3 with standard deviation 2130 4 m3 we present complete descriptive statistics of the variables in appendix b to provide better visualization we added a linear regression line for water consumption as a function of time first we focused on household consumers as this group accounts for more than 90 of aetra s total consumers figure a depicts the negative local average treatment effect due to the change in tariff in november 2014 after controlling other covariates a smaller immediate effect was found on non household consumers as depicted in figure b nevertheless non household consumers are likely to substantially reduce their consumption several months after the tariff adjustment this is a cause for concern since it appears that overtime non household consumers are likely to find a substitute for piped water and change their consumption of piped water substantially this result provides initial evidence of the adverse effect of the tariff adjustment on water consumption the subsequent section provides empirical evidence for such an effect 4 results 4 1 baseline estimates table 3 presents our panel data estimates from the estimation of equation 1 to control the potential heterogeneity among consumer groups the sample was divided into two groups household and non household the first column for each group represents the estimate using all available observations to account for the evidence of potential heterogeneity within these groups we then disaggregated them into two sub samples household consumers were divided into r2 middle low income and r3 r4 middle and high income the non household sub sample consists of commercial industrial consumers and social consumers we excluded r1 low asset household consumers so that the dummy policy represented a relatively uniform 14 change in the tariff adjustment for consumers nevertheless the estimates may not have been affected significantly since the proportion of r1 consumers was relatively low for household consumers looking at the full sample the tariff increase in november 2014 resulted in a decrease in water consumption by 4 7 statistically significant at 1 level as presented in table 2 the tariff change varies from 13 2 to 15 1 for middle low income households or 14 4 on average given a 14 4 tariff increase the price elasticity of water demand for household consumers was 0 316 as shown in the last row of table 3 these results were driven by the middle low income households which represent around 95 of the sample of households the price elasticity of water demand for this group was 0 300 the price elasticity of water demand for higher income households was 0 493 statistically significant at the 1 level this number is higher than that of middle low income households suggesting that the group is more responsive to changes in the tariff however the statistical tests show that the difference is not statistically significant 5 5 we compared the 95 confidence interval for both coefficients and performed a t test with assumption of zero covariance to test the difference between the two estimates 46 the confidence interval of the two estimates overlaps suggesting the difference is not statistically significant detailed test is provided in the supplementary materials the t statistics t 0 891 further confirming the result of the comparison of the confidence interval therefore we conclude that the price elasticity of water demand is similar across household groups in our study the estimates in table 3 suggest that the water demand of non household consumers was more responsive to the tariff adjustment compared to household consumers 6 6 the 95 confidence intervals still overlap but t test with assumption of zero covariance suggest there is a difference in the impact between the groups detailed test is provided in the supplementary materials this finding was driven by the results of the commercial and industrial groups a 13 increase in the tariff reduced their monthly water consumption by 16 3 on average indicating an elastic response thus the water demand elasticity of non household consumers is 1 157 the water demand from commercial and industrial consumers was even more elastic with an elasticity of 1 306 on the other hand the estimate for social consumers suggests that the water consumption of social consumers was not affected by the tariff adjustment this result as well as the tighter distribution depicted in fig 2b is concerning because a decrease in water demand for the provided service does not automatically mean that the establishments decrease their water use we also found that our strategy of adding one to water consumption to avoid a dropped observation did not significantly alter the result under the non transformation result appendix c provides the non transformation estimate and shows that both estimates have a relatively similar magnitude table 3 does not provide coefficients for control variables in this section we provide a discussion of these coefficients water consumption is likely to increase by approximately 0 1 0 2 when the precipitation rate increases by 1 this result is unusual but piped water consumption sometimes increases with precipitation when the level of precipitation is low 25 which is the case for tangerang residency that frequently experiences droughts we also found gdp elasticity for water consumption of 0 5 and 0 6 for household and non household consumers respectively the consumer price index had no impact on households water consumption our finding revealed a positive and significant effect of the eid al fitr holiday period and for the number of days in each month due to a very low cisadane river water level there was a water outage on 16 17 august 2015 during the time pt aetra could not provide water to its customers estimates for the drought in august 2015 variable implied that household consumers were likely to respond to the mid august 2015 drought event by stockpiling water to anticipate a possible water outage this was confirmed by the interview with the customers conducted in 2016 it was found that customers stocked up on water in the days immediately after the incidents for several weeks because they were worried that there would be another water outage lastly water consumption is seasonal with the lowest monthly consumptions in august and january for household and non household consumers respectively the highest consumption was in november for both groups ceteris paribus besides heterogeneity across consumers and seasons there might be considerable regional and temporal variations in the elasticity table 4 provides the estimation results after controlling the heterogeneity across the three subdistricts with the highest number of consumers namely pasar kemis sepatan and cikupa the estimates were drawn by interacting the intervening variable and the subdistrict dummies we did not divide our household sample into subdistrict sub samples we assumed that except for the tariff adjustment there was no substantial difference in the estimates of the other control variables the elasticity of the water demand in two subdistricts pasar kemis and sepatan was higher than was our baseline estimate of 0 316 by contrast households in cikupa had a much more inelastic response 7 7 detail of the statistical tests for the estimates is provided in the supplementary materials there are various reasons for this spatial response for some subdistricts it is relatively more difficult to find alternative and cheaper water sources such as groundwater which means that the change in the tariff had an inelastic impact this reasoning applies to cikupa which has poor quality groundwater and land subsidence 26 8 8 appendix c provides an illustration of the quality of groundwater in tangerang in addition there might be subdistricts inhabited by a substantial number of new consumers to whom pt aetra air tangerang offered a flat tariff for a limited and pre determined period and who were thus not affected by the tariff adjustment tariff adjustments had less impact in the dry season as indicated by the estimate for the interaction of the tariff increase and dry season dummy for household consumers the water price elasticity was 0 194 in the dry season it was lower than 0 316 the elasticity for household consumers reported in table 3 so it was around 61 of the elasticity without the dry season interaction we do not report the results for non household consumers here as we found that the difference across seasons was not statistically significant our data however does not contain information on the breakdown of consumers water use hence our discussion of the mechanism behind our result on dry season remains speculative we argue that less impact on the dry season is likely from reductions of indoor water use which relatively has fewer substitutes than outdoor water use 4 2 short run response we now examine the short term response to the tariff adjustment the estimates are divided according to household and non household consumers fig 3 presents the first n month price elasticity panel a shows that the point estimates of elasticity ranged from 0 34 to 0 12 which was relatively similar to our household estimate in table 4 and statistically significant nevertheless the magnitude tended to be slightly less elastic for longer months household consumers adjusted their water consumption more in the first several months and the effect of the tariff change was less apparent in the longer term panel b displays the short term response of consumers to the tariff change for non households which was within the interval of 1 27 to 0 52 all point estimates were statistically different from zero at the 5 level of significance except for the estimate for the 12th month nevertheless focusing on the point estimates alone we found that water consumption was more inelastic in the longer run which was relatively similar to the response of the household consumers 4 3 robustness check we adopted the method described by ref 8 to examine the robustness of our model regarding changes in the time trend order the check was performed for both household and non household consumers table 5 displays the estimation results up to quintic time trend order we obtained different windows of robust time trend order for the household and non household estimates the estimates for household consumers were robust in sign and magnitude up to quartic time trend the estimates were statistically significant at the 1 level except for the linear order the estimates are comparable with the baseline estimate provided in table 3 however our robustness check provided a less intuitive result for the higher polynomial time trend the sign of the estimates was reversed beyond the fourth order becoming positive and statistically significant meanwhile the estimates for the non household group were robust in magnitude and significance beyond the quartic time trend this result indicates that the estimates were affected substantially by choice of polynomial order 8 we consider that our time frame which is relatively shorter than those in other similar regression discontinuity studies is partially responsible for the inconsistency in household estimates for the higher polynomial order however the use of higher order polynomials could lead to noisy estimates at times as well as sensitivity to the degree of the polynomial and poor coverage of the confidence intervals 27 28 one might be concerned that although the company believed that they announced the tariff change without advance notice customers may have anticipated the tariff change from insider information thus we tested the extent to which our estimates were sensitive to the anticipation effect table 6 provides our baseline estimates by removing observations in the months immediately before the new tariff was applied to household and non household customers respectively we dropped observations until three months before the cutoff and found that our estimates were relatively robust all estimates were negative and statistically different from zero we further checked our identification strategy by examining the effect of a tariff increase on covariates and expected no discontinuity around the threshold four covariates were considered including the consumer price index income number of days and precipitation figures in appendix e illustrate the results and support our hypothesis we found no clear discontinuity for all covariates 5 discussion in this paper we estimated water demand elasticities using an unprecedented tariff adjustment event in the tangerang regency indonesia we applied a regression discontinuity framework using time as a forcing variable to elicit the causal impact between the tariff change and monthly water consumption this approach enabled us to avoid the endogeneity problem or estimation complexity of dcc if the average or marginal price is used respectively we found that the estimates were relatively robust the robustness check using various orders of time trends also showed that the estimated elasticities at certain levels of time polynomials were mainly consistent being less than one or not statistically different from zero for household consumers by contrast we found an elastic result for non household consumers our estimated results showed that the monthly water demand elasticities of pt aetra air tangerang s household consumers in the tangerang regency in indonesia were 0 316 on average this result confirms recent international evidence that the elasticities of water demand are likely to be less than one table 7 summarizes the selected prior estimates of water demand elasticity specifically our results are comparable with the overview of the estimates for developing countries found by ref 35 ranging from 0 3 to 0 6 our estimates are also close to ref 36 meta analysis of price elasticities of water demand from the 1980s to 1990 comparing the results to other studies conducted in indonesia our estimates are much lower than those of 15 estimates for solo indonesia however our estimates are relatively comparable to other similar studies conducted in various countries the estimates are slightly higher than 12 estimates of 0 12 for santa cruz california but comparable to ref 37 estimate of 0 33 for 11 north american cities 34 estimate of 0 25 for cyprus 32 estimate of 0 34 for 11 urban areas in the united states and canada 33 estimate of 0 23 for aurora colorado and 31 estimate of 0 10 to 0 50 for spain 24 reported a higher elasticity of 0 9 for the case of phoenix arizona in addition our short term estimates are slightly higher than the long term estimates despite remaining inelastic 31 used the error correction model to distinguish between the short term and the long term water demand elasticity in spain and found that his short term estimates were more inelastic than the long term estimates 14 provided differentiated estimates between the summer and winter periods for phoenix arizona they found that the water demand was less elastic in summer than in winter but their point estimates varied widely we also found that non household consumers were more sensitive to the tariff adjustment on average specifically our preferred point estimate was 1 16 nevertheless the demand is likely to be less elastic in the long run our estimates of water demand elasticity could be used to parameterize the aggregate demand for water and thus to project the water demand supply balance in the future 4 reported that the current local government s water utilities only covered 30 40 of the service area and the trend of this gap is widening given the estimated elasticities the government could formulate pricing strategies for water utilities to manage the demand while simultaneously expanding the service our study found that household water demand is inelastic to changes in price consequently an increase in price will only have a small effect on water consumption therefore the government will probably need an additional policy to encourage water conservation however an increase in price will also increase the revenue for providers this increase in revenue can be utilized to expand the service to people who still have no access to clean water using the information from our dataset we provide a back of the envelope calculation of the impact of a 10 increase in price for household customers the tariff increase will cause a 7 increase in revenue which is equivalent to around 2 5 billion rupiahs if the company invests all this increase in revenue in providing new installations 1238 people who previously had no access to clean water can have access to the service there are fewer concerns that household consumers will switch to other sources to satisfy their needs for water the quality of groundwater in most populous subdistricts of the tangerang regency is critical 51 see appendix d the chemicals contained in the water are twice higher than the permissible limit 38 the water is therefore unsafe for direct consumption households would have to put the water through a cleaning process before they could use it moreover based on indonesian government regulation no 82 2001 on water quality and water pollution management it is against the law to use this water for drinking or input for drinking water 9 9 translation of the relevant regulations can be found in supplementary materials therefore due to the lack of substitutions there is generally low price elasticity of demand we found that the non household water demand was much more elastic than was the households demand however the government must be careful when setting the price as a decrease in piped water consumption does not automatically mean that the establishments consume the water more efficiently an increase in price might lead to substituting the piped water service with groundwater or river water we suspect that this mechanism might happen as our data showed that non household consumers were likely to substantially reduce their consumption several months after the tariff adjustment some consumers even reported zero consumption this suggests that non household consumers are likely to find a substitute for piped water service banten province regulation no 7 2004 on groundwater management and regulation no 82 2001 allows the majority of firms to access groundwater and river for their water needs regardless of the water quality we ruled out a possibility of migration or firms shut down since there had been no major changes in the manufacturing output during the tariff adjustment 10 10 share of manufacturing output has been declining steadily from 2013 to 2015 but there has been no big jump from 2013 to 2015 relevant regional statistics can be found in supplementary materials the potential switching water source behavior may lead to excessive groundwater use of non household consumers while the exact amount of groundwater consumption during the study period is unavailable 70 of 5018 industries in tangerang regency still use groundwater for their activities 59 there are also many more industries that use unregistered wells 11 the problem becomes direr in the tangerang regency a part of the greater jakarta metropolitan area because excessive extraction of groundwater has caused rapid land subsidence that could lead to rapid sinking of the area 11 39 50 we propose that water demand management through price policy must consider the impact of such a policy on the possibility of consumers to substitute for less sustainable resources a policy to periodically increase the tariff of piped water must be complemented by policies that govern the use of other water resources some efforts have been taken by the regional government to tackle this problem based on governor regulation 35 2018 56 tangerang residency government increased groundwater tariff to 5600 rupiah per m3 starting in late 2019 although it is a step forward to conserve groundwater the tariff is much lower compared to the piped water service for the industry which is around 15 000 rupiahs per m3 thus the effectiveness of the policy remains to be seen declaration of competing interest this research received

8690,we exploit sudden changes in the marginal tariff scheme to estimate the price elasticity of water demand using households and firms data in tangerang regency a part of the jakarta greater metropolitan area where water demand management is imperative due to the city s growing population and industrial activities a monthly water consumption dataset at the consumer level is used in our study using the regression discontinuity in time rdit approach we find the price elasticity of water demand is 0 32 for household consumers and inelastic to changes in price in contrast elasticity for industrial and commercial consumers is 1 16 implying a more elastic response the results raise concerns that firms substitute for a cheaper water source endangering the water resources sustainability in the area keywords water demand elasticities urban water regression discontinuity in time rdit indonesia jel classification l95 r22 r53 1 introduction clean water plays an important role in fulfilling humans basic needs and access to it is one of the parameters for the quality of life of a society it highly contributes to a country in achieving sustainable development goals sdgs since it is crucial to reaching health targets food security and poverty alleviation targets 1 water provision is also essential as a production input for manufacturing activities in numerous industrial sectors such as in the food and beverages sector 2 access to clean and sustainable water remains a challenge in developing countries including indonesia despite a relatively high proportion of indonesian people having access to improved drinking water sources 1 1 unimproved drinking water sources refer to surface water such as water from rivers or lakes unprotected wells and unprotected springs most of the water comes directly from groundwater which is potentially harmful to groundwater sustainability 3 local government owned water utilities pdam perusahaan daerah air minum providing piped water services cover only a small portion of the water provision service 4 on the other hand by 2030 the industrial water demand is expected to double from its 2013 level while urban domestic demand is predicted to rise from about 205 m3 s in 2015 to 283 m3 s 4 furthermore challenges to providing clean and sustainable water services are likely to be higher in rapidly urbanized areas because of the fierce competition among economic activities 5 in this paper we aim to provide estimates of the price elasticity of water demand that can be used as a reference for the case of indonesia specifically we estimate price elasticity of water demand using the monthly water consumption of pt air aetra tangerang consumers in tangerang regency indonesia the company is privately owned together with the regional water company of tangerang and provides fresh water service for a substantial number of citizens of tangerang our monthly water consumption covers 57 months and more than 50 thousand consumers forming approximately 1 6 million monthly consumer panel observations the rich dataset also includes several types of consumers including households industries commercial enterprises and social clients which enables us to estimate the consumption effect of tariff change for both household and non household consumers based on our results desk study and regional statistics we discuss how a change in piped water tariff might affect water sustainability while investment in piped water facilities is essential for ensuring the supply of clean water understanding water demand is also imperative understanding how sensitive water demand is to changes in price will enable us to use price as a potential instrument to manage the increasing water demand over time furthermore changes in the price of one source of water supply might result in consumers substituting to other sources 6 in this case changes in the price of piped water service might result in consumers substituting to groundwater this issue becomes more relevant for indonesia since some of its urban areas have experienced a high land subsidence rate due to the high exploitation of groundwater 7 to obtain the causal impact we exploited an unprecedented tariff adjustment in november 2014 as the forcing variable in the regression discontinuity framework the company announced the tariff adjustment without advance notice we adopted 8 estimation strategy to reduce the estimation bias by controlling the consumer fixed effect the polynomial time trend and other control variables we followed the steps recommended in ref 9 to check our estimates reliability we did a robustness test using various polynomial trends we also conducted placebo tests checked the continuity of control variables and estimated a donut rd to check for the possibility of sorting behavior following the guidelines provided in ref 52 estimated standard errors were clustered to reduce potential bias due to serial correlation 10 11 we found that a sudden change in the block tariff scheme by 14 reduced household and non household water consumption by 5 and 15 respectively however social clients were not responsive to the tariff change the estimate also varied across subdistricts but was relatively stable across the time frame our results are robust to alternative time trend order the estimates also did not change much when we removed observations near the threshold suggesting that short run selection anticipation avoidance effects are less likely to be present we contribute to the literature in three aspects first we provide an alternative to the established studies using rdit as a forcing variable to minimize the estimation biases exploiting the fact that the percentage change in the tariff is relatively homogenous across blocks and consumer groups recent literature shows that the price elasticity of water demand estimates is potentially biased due to the increasing block rate structures of water pricing strategies while consumers are not always fully aware of the complex pricing schemes they experience 12 increasing block pricing ibp is the most commonly used water pricing scheme under an ibp the higher the volumes of water consumed by consumers the higher the marginal price they must pay however consumers often only respond to average local prices instead of the full price schedule 13 leading to biased demand elasticity estimates the potential bias problem due to increasing block rate structures can be solved by applying a discrete continuous model 14 we argue that our alternative rdit approach is more straightforward yet provides relatively reliable and comparable estimates our estimates remain robust under different polynomial time trends model specifications and the selection and strategic behavior assumptions as proposed by ref 9 second we analyze the case of indonesia a middle income country facing the challenges in delivering clean and sustainable water services particularly in urban areas in the context of indonesia we extended the work of 15 who estimated the residential water demand in solo indonesia our elasticity estimates are more inelastic although still relatively comparable with recent studies of water elasticity estimation furthermore to the best of our knowledge this is the first study attempting to estimate non residential water demand elasticity in indonesia also tangerang is an industrial area while many of the recent studies on non residential water demand elasticity focused on agricultural areas lastly our dataset allow us to examine the extent to which the impact of a sudden change in the block tariff scheme differed as time elapsed our paper proceeds as follows section 2 explains the current system of water provision in the tangerang regency and how pt aetra contributes to the system section 3 describes our model and data and discusses the expected effects of a sudden tariff adjustment on water consumption section 4 presents the estimation results and the final section provides a discussion and a conclusion 2 context water utility provision and the position of pt aetra air tangerang in the tangerang regency the tangerang regency is situated on java island in banten province 40 km to the west side of jakarta the capital city of indonesia the regency is part of a greater metropolitan area known as jabodetabek one of the world s largest urbanized areas it is also home to several major indonesian industrial estates 4 in 2016 there were approximately 823 thousand households in the tangerang regency spread over 29 subdistricts most households were in the pasar kemis subdistrict while the least number of households were in the mekarbaru subdistrict indonesian bureau of statistics 2017 as commonly practiced in every region in indonesia water service provision for household and non household activities in the tangerang regency is mainly delivered via piped water provided by a local government owned water company such as pdam tirta kerta raharja or from groundwater rivers and other natural sources of water nevertheless a substantial number of tangerang residents still do not have sustainable access to clean water in 2016 less than 20 of the households had access to piped water in the tangerang regency to extend the access to clean and safe water in 2011 the local government of the tangerang regency invited a private company pt aetra air tangerang to serve drinking water for eight subdistricts via a 25 year concession the partnership formed the first public private partnership project of 26 projects offered by the central government in 2006 the eight subdistricts include sepatan sepatan timur pasar kemis cikupa sindang jaya sukamulya balaraja and jayanti see fig 1 the source of the water is the cisadane river the company was initially designed to serve about 72 thousand household connections and to provide additional non household connections meanwhile customers in other subdistricts are served by the pdam tirta kerta raharja table 1 provides the tariff scheme charged by pt aetra air tangerang between november 2014 and march 2017 58 pt aetra air tangerang imposes a block pricing tariff the greater the amount of water consumed the higher per m3 water tariff to be paid the tariff is also differentiated according to consumers households as the main consumers are divided into four groups based on the potential value of their properties determined by the size and location this information was primarily obtained before they subscribed to the service households with small houses in poor neighborhoods fall into the r1 group and are charged the subsidized tariff the r4 group pays the highest tariff according to an interview conducted with the service provider a consumer can switch groups however we did not find individual consumers changing groups during our observation period non household consumers are differentiated similarly social consumers such as mosques and orphanages are subsidized other groups including government commercial and industrial consumers are charged at much higher rates than are social consumers the indonesian water tariff system is regulated strictly by the government at the national level the minister of home affairs regulation no 71 2016 on the calculation and determination of drinking water tariffs stipulates the maximum level of the water tariff that the cost borne by households for the first 10 m3 of consumption should not exceed 4 of the provincial minimum wage income in addition water utilities cannot increase their tariffs without the approval from the mayor of the regency in which they operate no change in tariff can be proposed less than two years after the most recent tariff adjustment the adjustment must follow the principles of affordability and fairness according to the minister of home affairs regulation no 71 2016 on the drinking water tariffs calculation household expenditure to fulfill drinking water standards for basic needs 10 m3 should not exceed 4 of banten s provincial minimum wage the minimum wage for banten province was about three million rupiahs in 2016 2 2 or the equivalent of us 222 2 assuming the exchange rate is 13 500 rupiah us as stipulated in the decree of the governor of banten no 561 kep huk 2016 thus according to the regulation the drinking water tariff should not exceed 71 360 rupiahs under the new tariff thus far the company has adjusted the tariff twice in november 2014 and in march 2017 53 54 the first tariff adjustment was more sudden and less anticipated by the consumers as the company announced the change after the new tariff was imposed the latter adjustment was potentially more anticipated as the plan had been disseminated in advance therefore we used the data from the first tariff adjustment to estimate the water demand elasticity we did not include the data from march 2017 and after in this study 3 method 3 1 basic model and data we estimated the impact of the november 2014 water tariff adjustment on monthly water consumption to determine the causal relationship we used the regression discontinuity technique with the time variable as an assignment variable 8 17 18 this approach identifies the effect of a policy by examining discontinuous variations around a known cutoff 19 in our case the cutoff is the month in which the new tariff was implemented the estimation can be written as 1 ln y i t 1 α i β d t x γ θ j f t ρ m y e a r τ y e a r e i t the dependent variable is the monthly water consumption of consumer i in month t presented in a natural logarithm we added one to water consumption to avoid a dropped observation under the logarithm transformation that accounts for 10 1 of the total observations subscribers may report zero consumption because of a temporal move or even a complete switch to using groundwater our monthly water consumption dataset recorded from january 2012 to september 2016 with a total consumer base of 55 7 thousand subscribers there are more than 3 2 million potential observations however some consumers canceled their subscriptions during our observation period leading to missing observations therefore our data set contains approximately 1 7 million observations in total we used monthly water consumption data as the dependent variable in our study in contrast with high frequency daily data and hourly data used in previous regression discontinuity in time studies 17 18 since only monthly data was available furthermore 9 using monthly averages of daily data used in ref 17 found that the estimates of the treatment effect using monthly data was close to the one using daily data despite with varying degree of precision similar results were also generated when they used monte carlo simulation our variable of interest is the dummy variable d t that captures the policy change in the water utility tariff the value is 1 for the period after the new tariff was applied and 0 otherwise we assumed that the effect of the change in tariff started in december 2014 as pt aetra air tangerang announced the policy by mid november 2014 table 2 the percentage of change in water consumption due to the change in the water price was calculated as 100 e β 1 20 the elasticity of the water demand for each k consumer group ε k was then calculated by dividing the percentage of change in water consumption by the percentage of change in the water price for the respective groups θ k such that ε k 100 e β 1 θ k our strategy to estimate the price elasticity assumed that the discontinuous price scheme that changed in november 2014 was the only factor captured by the variable d t therefore we included observable control variables x in equation 1 we included interpolated monthly gdp data as proxies for income our set of variables also included monthly precipitation at the village level to control activities affecting the water demand such as watering gardens the impact of the tariff adjustment was also controlled via the monthly consumer price index we introduced dummy variables for the islamic holiday month the eid al fitr celebration which is held annually following the lunar calendar we then added a dummy for the drought that occurred in august 2015 and affected the cisadane river serving as the source of aetra s water detailed explanations and the sources of data are presented in appendix a water consumption is likely to be seasonal and may be higher during certain months to capture the effect of seasonality we introduced ρ m y e a r which represents the month of the year similarly we included year dummies τ y e a r to accommodate different long term trends due to data limitations at the individual level the model cannot control for the unobservable individual factors that potentially affect water consumption such as the number of household members which may have changed during our observation period we applied a consumer fixed effect panel estimation to eliminate the potentially omitted variable bias from the unobserved time invariant variables to reduce the potential bias from the omitted time variant unobservable variables we introduced a polynomial time trend f t 8 the polynomial time trend is assumed to provide different effects across subdistrict j we later performed a robustness test of polynomial order to check the extent to which our elasticity estimates remained robust under different polynomial orders water consumption is unlikely to be independent across time in addition our dataset involves a relatively long period of 57 months both aspects potentially create serial correlation problems 10 hence we allowed an unobserved disturbance e i t to be correlated with the same consumer and year following 11 procedure to capture within consumer correlations and serial correlations the reported standard errors were then clustered according to each consumer year combination the estimates will also suffer parameter bias if the consumers can anticipate the policy by adjusting their behavior before the new tariff is announced see ref 21 besides the response parameter is potentially underestimated if consumers alter their water consumption behavior before the tariff adjustment is announced in our setting however the bias can be minimized as pt aetra air tangerang announced the new tariff in the same month as its implementation 3 3 we obtained this information via direct correspondence with pt aetra s representative we estimated equation 1 using data of both household and non household consumers we grouped household consumers into r2 middle low income consumers and r3 middle high income and r4 high income consumers we removed r1 low consumers from our sample because the sample size of this group was too small non household consumers consist of commercial and industrial consumers who pay a higher tariff and social consumers who pay a subsidized tariff 3 2 short run response in addition to the analysis of the entire observation period we were interested in examining whether consumers responses to tariff changes differed over time compared to the long run demand can be more elastic or inelastic depending on the nature of the goods in the short run to obtain the response in the first n month we modified an asymmetric model which divides independent variables of interest into two states 22 23 in brief we estimate 2 ln y i t 1 α i β 1 d t 1 β 2 d t 2 x γ θ j f t ρ m y e a r τ y e a r e i t where d t 1 is a dummy variable taking values equal to 1 for the first several months after the tariff increase and 0 otherwise meanwhile dummy d t 2 takes the value of 0 before the tariff increase and the first several months after the tariff increase as in d t 1 and 1 otherwise this setting allowed us to distinguish between the average effect for the first several months after the tariff increase β 1 and the effect thereafter β 2 we estimated equation 2 from the first two months to 12 months after the tariff increase 3 2 1 expected response to the water tariff adjustment what was the impact of the water tariff increase on the monthly water consumption of pt aetra air tangerang s customers the basic economic theory of demand states that a tariff increase reduces water consumption nevertheless the percentage of the reduction is expected to be relatively smaller than is the percentage of the tariff increase as water is a basic need however the response may differ across consumer groups an empirical study by ref 24 in arizona found that high income households tended to respond less than did low income households furthermore we expected non household groups particularly industrial and commercial consumers to be less responsive to the tariff adjustment as they had fewer options to substitute pt aetra s water source similarly we expected the short term and long term response to be different fig 2 clarifies our understanding of water consumption behavior near the tariff adjustment by illustrating average monthly residuals of water consumption from our raw data for household and non household consumers in a natural logarithm the graphs plot the average residual monthly water consumption of households against the month distance in november 2014 by controlling covariates and the time trend presented in equation 1 4 4 the average monthly water consumption for households is 14 1 m3 with standard deviation 16 3 m3 while the average monthly water consumption for non households is 245 2 m3 with standard deviation 2130 4 m3 we present complete descriptive statistics of the variables in appendix b to provide better visualization we added a linear regression line for water consumption as a function of time first we focused on household consumers as this group accounts for more than 90 of aetra s total consumers figure a depicts the negative local average treatment effect due to the change in tariff in november 2014 after controlling other covariates a smaller immediate effect was found on non household consumers as depicted in figure b nevertheless non household consumers are likely to substantially reduce their consumption several months after the tariff adjustment this is a cause for concern since it appears that overtime non household consumers are likely to find a substitute for piped water and change their consumption of piped water substantially this result provides initial evidence of the adverse effect of the tariff adjustment on water consumption the subsequent section provides empirical evidence for such an effect 4 results 4 1 baseline estimates table 3 presents our panel data estimates from the estimation of equation 1 to control the potential heterogeneity among consumer groups the sample was divided into two groups household and non household the first column for each group represents the estimate using all available observations to account for the evidence of potential heterogeneity within these groups we then disaggregated them into two sub samples household consumers were divided into r2 middle low income and r3 r4 middle and high income the non household sub sample consists of commercial industrial consumers and social consumers we excluded r1 low asset household consumers so that the dummy policy represented a relatively uniform 14 change in the tariff adjustment for consumers nevertheless the estimates may not have been affected significantly since the proportion of r1 consumers was relatively low for household consumers looking at the full sample the tariff increase in november 2014 resulted in a decrease in water consumption by 4 7 statistically significant at 1 level as presented in table 2 the tariff change varies from 13 2 to 15 1 for middle low income households or 14 4 on average given a 14 4 tariff increase the price elasticity of water demand for household consumers was 0 316 as shown in the last row of table 3 these results were driven by the middle low income households which represent around 95 of the sample of households the price elasticity of water demand for this group was 0 300 the price elasticity of water demand for higher income households was 0 493 statistically significant at the 1 level this number is higher than that of middle low income households suggesting that the group is more responsive to changes in the tariff however the statistical tests show that the difference is not statistically significant 5 5 we compared the 95 confidence interval for both coefficients and performed a t test with assumption of zero covariance to test the difference between the two estimates 46 the confidence interval of the two estimates overlaps suggesting the difference is not statistically significant detailed test is provided in the supplementary materials the t statistics t 0 891 further confirming the result of the comparison of the confidence interval therefore we conclude that the price elasticity of water demand is similar across household groups in our study the estimates in table 3 suggest that the water demand of non household consumers was more responsive to the tariff adjustment compared to household consumers 6 6 the 95 confidence intervals still overlap but t test with assumption of zero covariance suggest there is a difference in the impact between the groups detailed test is provided in the supplementary materials this finding was driven by the results of the commercial and industrial groups a 13 increase in the tariff reduced their monthly water consumption by 16 3 on average indicating an elastic response thus the water demand elasticity of non household consumers is 1 157 the water demand from commercial and industrial consumers was even more elastic with an elasticity of 1 306 on the other hand the estimate for social consumers suggests that the water consumption of social consumers was not affected by the tariff adjustment this result as well as the tighter distribution depicted in fig 2b is concerning because a decrease in water demand for the provided service does not automatically mean that the establishments decrease their water use we also found that our strategy of adding one to water consumption to avoid a dropped observation did not significantly alter the result under the non transformation result appendix c provides the non transformation estimate and shows that both estimates have a relatively similar magnitude table 3 does not provide coefficients for control variables in this section we provide a discussion of these coefficients water consumption is likely to increase by approximately 0 1 0 2 when the precipitation rate increases by 1 this result is unusual but piped water consumption sometimes increases with precipitation when the level of precipitation is low 25 which is the case for tangerang residency that frequently experiences droughts we also found gdp elasticity for water consumption of 0 5 and 0 6 for household and non household consumers respectively the consumer price index had no impact on households water consumption our finding revealed a positive and significant effect of the eid al fitr holiday period and for the number of days in each month due to a very low cisadane river water level there was a water outage on 16 17 august 2015 during the time pt aetra could not provide water to its customers estimates for the drought in august 2015 variable implied that household consumers were likely to respond to the mid august 2015 drought event by stockpiling water to anticipate a possible water outage this was confirmed by the interview with the customers conducted in 2016 it was found that customers stocked up on water in the days immediately after the incidents for several weeks because they were worried that there would be another water outage lastly water consumption is seasonal with the lowest monthly consumptions in august and january for household and non household consumers respectively the highest consumption was in november for both groups ceteris paribus besides heterogeneity across consumers and seasons there might be considerable regional and temporal variations in the elasticity table 4 provides the estimation results after controlling the heterogeneity across the three subdistricts with the highest number of consumers namely pasar kemis sepatan and cikupa the estimates were drawn by interacting the intervening variable and the subdistrict dummies we did not divide our household sample into subdistrict sub samples we assumed that except for the tariff adjustment there was no substantial difference in the estimates of the other control variables the elasticity of the water demand in two subdistricts pasar kemis and sepatan was higher than was our baseline estimate of 0 316 by contrast households in cikupa had a much more inelastic response 7 7 detail of the statistical tests for the estimates is provided in the supplementary materials there are various reasons for this spatial response for some subdistricts it is relatively more difficult to find alternative and cheaper water sources such as groundwater which means that the change in the tariff had an inelastic impact this reasoning applies to cikupa which has poor quality groundwater and land subsidence 26 8 8 appendix c provides an illustration of the quality of groundwater in tangerang in addition there might be subdistricts inhabited by a substantial number of new consumers to whom pt aetra air tangerang offered a flat tariff for a limited and pre determined period and who were thus not affected by the tariff adjustment tariff adjustments had less impact in the dry season as indicated by the estimate for the interaction of the tariff increase and dry season dummy for household consumers the water price elasticity was 0 194 in the dry season it was lower than 0 316 the elasticity for household consumers reported in table 3 so it was around 61 of the elasticity without the dry season interaction we do not report the results for non household consumers here as we found that the difference across seasons was not statistically significant our data however does not contain information on the breakdown of consumers water use hence our discussion of the mechanism behind our result on dry season remains speculative we argue that less impact on the dry season is likely from reductions of indoor water use which relatively has fewer substitutes than outdoor water use 4 2 short run response we now examine the short term response to the tariff adjustment the estimates are divided according to household and non household consumers fig 3 presents the first n month price elasticity panel a shows that the point estimates of elasticity ranged from 0 34 to 0 12 which was relatively similar to our household estimate in table 4 and statistically significant nevertheless the magnitude tended to be slightly less elastic for longer months household consumers adjusted their water consumption more in the first several months and the effect of the tariff change was less apparent in the longer term panel b displays the short term response of consumers to the tariff change for non households which was within the interval of 1 27 to 0 52 all point estimates were statistically different from zero at the 5 level of significance except for the estimate for the 12th month nevertheless focusing on the point estimates alone we found that water consumption was more inelastic in the longer run which was relatively similar to the response of the household consumers 4 3 robustness check we adopted the method described by ref 8 to examine the robustness of our model regarding changes in the time trend order the check was performed for both household and non household consumers table 5 displays the estimation results up to quintic time trend order we obtained different windows of robust time trend order for the household and non household estimates the estimates for household consumers were robust in sign and magnitude up to quartic time trend the estimates were statistically significant at the 1 level except for the linear order the estimates are comparable with the baseline estimate provided in table 3 however our robustness check provided a less intuitive result for the higher polynomial time trend the sign of the estimates was reversed beyond the fourth order becoming positive and statistically significant meanwhile the estimates for the non household group were robust in magnitude and significance beyond the quartic time trend this result indicates that the estimates were affected substantially by choice of polynomial order 8 we consider that our time frame which is relatively shorter than those in other similar regression discontinuity studies is partially responsible for the inconsistency in household estimates for the higher polynomial order however the use of higher order polynomials could lead to noisy estimates at times as well as sensitivity to the degree of the polynomial and poor coverage of the confidence intervals 27 28 one might be concerned that although the company believed that they announced the tariff change without advance notice customers may have anticipated the tariff change from insider information thus we tested the extent to which our estimates were sensitive to the anticipation effect table 6 provides our baseline estimates by removing observations in the months immediately before the new tariff was applied to household and non household customers respectively we dropped observations until three months before the cutoff and found that our estimates were relatively robust all estimates were negative and statistically different from zero we further checked our identification strategy by examining the effect of a tariff increase on covariates and expected no discontinuity around the threshold four covariates were considered including the consumer price index income number of days and precipitation figures in appendix e illustrate the results and support our hypothesis we found no clear discontinuity for all covariates 5 discussion in this paper we estimated water demand elasticities using an unprecedented tariff adjustment event in the tangerang regency indonesia we applied a regression discontinuity framework using time as a forcing variable to elicit the causal impact between the tariff change and monthly water consumption this approach enabled us to avoid the endogeneity problem or estimation complexity of dcc if the average or marginal price is used respectively we found that the estimates were relatively robust the robustness check using various orders of time trends also showed that the estimated elasticities at certain levels of time polynomials were mainly consistent being less than one or not statistically different from zero for household consumers by contrast we found an elastic result for non household consumers our estimated results showed that the monthly water demand elasticities of pt aetra air tangerang s household consumers in the tangerang regency in indonesia were 0 316 on average this result confirms recent international evidence that the elasticities of water demand are likely to be less than one table 7 summarizes the selected prior estimates of water demand elasticity specifically our results are comparable with the overview of the estimates for developing countries found by ref 35 ranging from 0 3 to 0 6 our estimates are also close to ref 36 meta analysis of price elasticities of water demand from the 1980s to 1990 comparing the results to other studies conducted in indonesia our estimates are much lower than those of 15 estimates for solo indonesia however our estimates are relatively comparable to other similar studies conducted in various countries the estimates are slightly higher than 12 estimates of 0 12 for santa cruz california but comparable to ref 37 estimate of 0 33 for 11 north american cities 34 estimate of 0 25 for cyprus 32 estimate of 0 34 for 11 urban areas in the united states and canada 33 estimate of 0 23 for aurora colorado and 31 estimate of 0 10 to 0 50 for spain 24 reported a higher elasticity of 0 9 for the case of phoenix arizona in addition our short term estimates are slightly higher than the long term estimates despite remaining inelastic 31 used the error correction model to distinguish between the short term and the long term water demand elasticity in spain and found that his short term estimates were more inelastic than the long term estimates 14 provided differentiated estimates between the summer and winter periods for phoenix arizona they found that the water demand was less elastic in summer than in winter but their point estimates varied widely we also found that non household consumers were more sensitive to the tariff adjustment on average specifically our preferred point estimate was 1 16 nevertheless the demand is likely to be less elastic in the long run our estimates of water demand elasticity could be used to parameterize the aggregate demand for water and thus to project the water demand supply balance in the future 4 reported that the current local government s water utilities only covered 30 40 of the service area and the trend of this gap is widening given the estimated elasticities the government could formulate pricing strategies for water utilities to manage the demand while simultaneously expanding the service our study found that household water demand is inelastic to changes in price consequently an increase in price will only have a small effect on water consumption therefore the government will probably need an additional policy to encourage water conservation however an increase in price will also increase the revenue for providers this increase in revenue can be utilized to expand the service to people who still have no access to clean water using the information from our dataset we provide a back of the envelope calculation of the impact of a 10 increase in price for household customers the tariff increase will cause a 7 increase in revenue which is equivalent to around 2 5 billion rupiahs if the company invests all this increase in revenue in providing new installations 1238 people who previously had no access to clean water can have access to the service there are fewer concerns that household consumers will switch to other sources to satisfy their needs for water the quality of groundwater in most populous subdistricts of the tangerang regency is critical 51 see appendix d the chemicals contained in the water are twice higher than the permissible limit 38 the water is therefore unsafe for direct consumption households would have to put the water through a cleaning process before they could use it moreover based on indonesian government regulation no 82 2001 on water quality and water pollution management it is against the law to use this water for drinking or input for drinking water 9 9 translation of the relevant regulations can be found in supplementary materials therefore due to the lack of substitutions there is generally low price elasticity of demand we found that the non household water demand was much more elastic than was the households demand however the government must be careful when setting the price as a decrease in piped water consumption does not automatically mean that the establishments consume the water more efficiently an increase in price might lead to substituting the piped water service with groundwater or river water we suspect that this mechanism might happen as our data showed that non household consumers were likely to substantially reduce their consumption several months after the tariff adjustment some consumers even reported zero consumption this suggests that non household consumers are likely to find a substitute for piped water service banten province regulation no 7 2004 on groundwater management and regulation no 82 2001 allows the majority of firms to access groundwater and river for their water needs regardless of the water quality we ruled out a possibility of migration or firms shut down since there had been no major changes in the manufacturing output during the tariff adjustment 10 10 share of manufacturing output has been declining steadily from 2013 to 2015 but there has been no big jump from 2013 to 2015 relevant regional statistics can be found in supplementary materials the potential switching water source behavior may lead to excessive groundwater use of non household consumers while the exact amount of groundwater consumption during the study period is unavailable 70 of 5018 industries in tangerang regency still use groundwater for their activities 59 there are also many more industries that use unregistered wells 11 the problem becomes direr in the tangerang regency a part of the greater jakarta metropolitan area because excessive extraction of groundwater has caused rapid land subsidence that could lead to rapid sinking of the area 11 39 50 we propose that water demand management through price policy must consider the impact of such a policy on the possibility of consumers to substitute for less sustainable resources a policy to periodically increase the tariff of piped water must be complemented by policies that govern the use of other water resources some efforts have been taken by the regional government to tackle this problem based on governor regulation 35 2018 56 tangerang residency government increased groundwater tariff to 5600 rupiah per m3 starting in late 2019 although it is a step forward to conserve groundwater the tariff is much lower compared to the piped water service for the industry which is around 15 000 rupiahs per m3 thus the effectiveness of the policy remains to be seen declaration of competing interest this research received

8691,this paper studies the conflict between economic and environmental sustainability objectives faced by a water agency when she allocates water quotas to farmers this conflict consists in a water allocation problem between the amount of water claimed by farmers to irrigate their crops and the water flows needed for the conservation and the preservation of the ecosystems this conflict in objectives is analysed in a dynamic hydro economic model in discrete time using the viability approach the viability kernel that defines the states of the resource yielding intertemporal feasible paths able to satisfy the set of constraints over time is analytically identified the associated set of viable quota policies and the trade off between food production and ecosystem conservation objectives are characterized the theoretical results of the paper are illustrated with numerical simulations based on the western la mancha aquifer in spain keywords groundwater agriculture irrigation environmental flows individual permits sustainability dynamic model viability kernel water budget jel classification q15 q25 c61 1 introduction in aquifers managed with quotas water agencies are facing conflicting objectives between ensuring minimum environmental flows for the preservation of groundwater dependent ecosystems and satisfying the water claims of the farmers to irrigate their crops 1 this conflict can result from a lack of coordination between two distinct agencies trying to implement their own policies as in ref 2 or arise when an agency wants to achieved simultaneously quantity and quality objectives as in ref 3 handling the potential conflict between economic and environmental objectives is a major concern to achieve sustainability 4 5 this paper analyses the existing trade off between these objectives as a problem of constraints fulfillment hydroeconomic models are generally developed as constraint optimization problems with environmental constraints represented by minimum flow requirements 6 at each period the dynamics of an aquifer depend on the balance between the natural recharge the natural discharge and the amount of extracted water the natural discharge consists in water flows which sustain groundwater dependent ecosystems fish and other aquatic species the health of riparian and wetland ecosystems and other environmental needs 7 starting from an initial situation in which there is no water extraction the natural discharge is equal to the natural recharge once water is extracted the natural discharge decreases affecting groundwater dependent ecosystems 8 as modelled by refs 9 10 this natural discharge is assumed to be an affine function of the water table it allows to defined a critical boundary value of the water table for which the natural discharge is nil a first requirement of a sustainable management is then to keep the water table above this critical value this specification of stream aquifer flows is an example of interaction between groundwater and surface water but differs from ref 11 who consider the dynamics of two state variables one for each water sources or 12 who deal with embedded multi reservoirs the protection of environmental flows has also been introduced as an objective management for regulating agency in terms of ecosystem damages 13 15 however the lack of consideration of natural drainage in the aquifer water balance in the above cited papers has promoted the persistent water budget myth that net withdrawals can equal groundwater recharge on the long run without causing harmful damages 16 18 shows how the introduction of natural drainage in the water budget impacts the amount of water extraction and the dynamics of the water table the allocation of water quotas to farmers is also a problem of constraint the use of market based instruments such as tradable permits has been proposed as a promising way to replenish an aquifer 19 or to efficiently manage groundwater aquifers for irrigated agriculture 20 21 or to protect streams 22 tradable permits ensure that water will be used by farmers with maximum efficiency however like all cap and trade systems the way the cap which consists in the available amount of water for users is set remains a difficult issue as pointed out by ref 1 irrigation contributes to maintain rural development and employment in arid regions it can justify the objective of allocating minimum amount of quotas to farmers and to ensuring that the least efficient farmers will remain active a second requirement of a sustainable management is then to implement relevant strategies in the allocation of water quotas for every farmer by a regulating agency to deal with these two requirements which take the form of constraints the use of the viability approach has shown to be well adapted 23 the interest of this method is to focus on identifying inter temporal feasible paths within a set of desirable objectives or constraints this framework has been applied to renewable resource management 24 like fisheries 25 27 or groundwater 21 with respect to the literature 21 28 29 a first contribution of the paper is to introduce explicitly the natural discharge in the water budget of the aquifer and as an objective for the water agency a second contribution is to address the trade offs that arise between ecosystem conservation and economic development the paper is structured as follows section 2 is devoted to the description of the dynamic hydro economic model and the objectives of the water agency section 3 characterizes the feasible resource states and water policies under several constraints an application based on the western la mancha aquifer spain illustrates the main results in section 4 the last section concludes 2 the hydro economic model 2 1 the aquifer dynamics the dynamics of an aquifer are described by changes in the water table measured by h t 0 h max at time t where h max stands for the maximum height of the aquifer the water table increases with the constant natural recharge r 0 and is reduced by water extraction q t dedicated to irrigation and flows for the natural discharge w f t the total volume of extracted water q t corresponds to the quota set by a water agency a proportion μ of the water used for irrigation is assumed to come back to the aquifer where 0 μ 1 stands for the non absorption coefficient total extraction is thus 1 μ q t the natural discharge consists in water flows for groundwater dependent ecosystems fish and other aquatic species the health of riparian and wetland ecosystems and other environmental needs based on 10 34 the dynamics of the resource are 1 a s h t 1 h t r 1 μ q t w f h t h 0 h 0 where a stands for the area of the aquifer and s the storage coefficient following 9 10 30 31 the natural discharge depends on the water table as follows 2 w f h t 0 for h h min α γ h t for h h min the assumption of a linear conductance model is mainly accepted in the literature for the description of stream aquifer flow as shown by ref 32 or 33 coefficients α γ 0 respectively stand for the intercept and the slope of the natural discharge function 2 and are equal to α r h min h max h min γ r h max h min where h min α γ refers to the minimum level of the water table for which the natural discharge is nil it is worth mentioning that the natural discharge w f t appears in ref 34 but is not modelled in the sequel of that paper however this is done in the model of 10 which is an integration of the two aquifers model of 9 into a single one it can be checked that this is not the net natural recharge or the exploitable recharge equal to annual recharge minus annual discharge which is considered but the natural recharge minus evapotranspiration it implies that environmental flows and the water extraction problem cannot be monitored separately without being subject to the water myth budget criticism substitute eq 2 into eq 1 yields 3 h t 1 1 γ a s h t r α a s 1 μ a s q t with 0 γ a s 1 at the steady state the water balance equation yields a negative relationship between q and h 4 q r α 1 μ γ 1 μ h the water balance at the steady state takes the form of a decreasing line in the state control h q space as shown in fig 1 above the line given by eq 4 the water table diminishes with extraction and below the water table increases however eq 4 does not correspond to the whole set of the steady sate water extraction due to the natural discharge term the condition h h min ensuring a positive natural discharge w f t 0 also implies a constraint of the amount of extracted water such that q r 1 μ the set of steady state water extraction and water table satisfying the environmental constraint consists in h max h h min and 0 q r 1 μ because all the value of q greater than r 1 μ located between r α 1 μ and r 1 μ implies h h min 2 2 the farmers a set of n farmers are assumed to use water extracted from the aquifer denoted by w i as the only input to irrigate their crops the total crop income is given by the product of the crop yield y i and the constant price of the agricultural product p y the crop water production function y i w i is assumed to be quadratic 20 35 5 y i w i t a w i t b i 2 w i 2 t where a 0 is a technical parameter of production common to all farmers heterogeneity between farmers relies on the parameter b i 0 associated to the quadratic term of the production function 5 individual production reaches a maximum for w i a b i yielding y i a 2 2 b i a w i 2 it implies that individual water extraction w i 0 w i the maximum amount of water consumption is w i 1 n w i and the maximum amount of production is then y i 1 n y i farmers can be ranked according their efficiency y 1 y 2 y n for b 1 b 2 b n farmer n is the less efficient while farmer 1 is the most productive farmer 1 is able to produce more agricultural output than other farmers with the same amount of water lastly farmers are supposed to be price takers on the product market the pumping cost function is assumed to be decreasing and convex with respect to the water table the externality occurs through the extraction cost which increases when the water table becomes lower moreover the unit extraction cost is assumed to be the same for farmers at each point of the aquifer the unitary cost c h t is given by 6 c h t c 0 c 1 h t where c 0 c 1 h m a x and c 1 respectively stand for the intercept and the slope of the pumping cost function 6 as in ref 21 it is further assumed that farmers receive for free individual water quotas q i t at the beginning of each period t each farmer can buy or sell quota units on the market at a unit price m t to have the right to extract water the amount of quota held by farmer i after trade is q i t the individual profit of farmer i can be written as follows 7 π i h t w i t p y y i w i t c h t w i t m t w i t q i t using eqs 5 and 6 each farmer maximizes his payoff it gives the individual quota water demand 8 q i t a b i 1 b i p y c 0 c 1 h t m t it is a decreasing function of the quota price and an increasing function of the water table 2 3 the water agency a water agency has to manage the quota market by setting the supply of quota q s t q t using eq 8 the aggregate water demand for quotas q t i 1 n q i t is given by 9 q t a β β p y c 0 c 1 h t m t with β i 1 n 1 b i the market clearing condition q t q t yields the equilibrium water quota price m t 10 m t a p y c 0 c 1 h t p y β q t it shows that the equilibrium water quota price decreases with the quota supply and increases with the water table as we show in subsection 2 4 the water quota market is solved by assuming that the less efficient farmer is active the water agency needs to ensure a positive demand for quotas implying a positive price for the water permit in eq 10 11 m t 0 this positivity condition on the quota price yields a state control constraint 12 q t q m h t with 13 q m h t β a c 0 p y β c 1 p y h t the tradable water permit constraint entails a superior limit for the total water extraction q t this superior bound q m h t is an increasing function of the state variable h t in the state control h q space this bound depends on the economic parameters of farmers below the bound q m h t the low pumping costs increase the demand for quotas and the quota price in the opposite case the pumping cost is so high that there is no demand for quotas 2 4 the objectives we assume that the water agency faces conflicting objectives between maintaining minimum environmental flows to sustain dependent ecosystems and satisfying the individual water claims of farmers for irrigation the environmental objective of the water agency takes the form 14 w f t w f the value w f may be thought as a norm being set up by a decision maker or by the european water framework directive for instance such a value remains exogenous in our framework but its choice will impact the associated trade off for water irrigation substitute w f h t by its expression 2 implies a value on the level of the water table such that 15 h t h w w f α γ eq 15 means that to satisfy the environmental objective the level of the water table has to be greater than h w it turns out that h w is always greater or equal than the minimal value h min since for w f 0 h w h min concerning the amount of individual water claimed by the farmers to irrigate their crops we assume that farmers aim at ensuring an agricultural production target denoted by y such that 16 y i t y as mentioned in the introduction 1 argued that the social impact of irrigation can justify to maintain employment in arid areas this can take the form of constraint like eq 16 from 5 it implies 17 q i t a b i a 2 2 b i y b i substitute 10 in 8 gives 18 q i t 1 b i β q t combining 17 and 18 implies a corresponding amount of water quotas needed for irrigation since water is the only input used by farmers to ensure that all the farmers will be active condition 16 implies q t sup i β a a 2 2 b i y which can be rewritten as q t β a a 2 2 y sup i b i it states that the amount of water quotas has to be such that the least efficient farmer is active since sup i b i b n condition 16 entails the following bound on the water supply q t 19 q t q a where q a is constant and independent of the state variable 20 q a a β β 2 b n y n y it shows that q a increases with the agricultural production target y the payoff of farmer i can be written as 21 π i t 1 2 b i p y q i t 2 m t q i t 2 5 the economic and environmental trade off two cases have to be considered concerning the maximum feasible target value for the agricultural production the water agency can choose assume that the water agency has no environmental constraint to achieved the maximum target value for the agricultural production denoted by y max is obtained when the tradable water permit constraint given by eq 12 intercepts the steady state water balance given by eq 4 giving 22 q c 1 β p y r α γ β a c 0 p y c 1 β p y 1 μ γ substituting the above expression in eq 20 yields 23 y max y n 1 2 b n a c 1 p y r α γ a c 0 p y c 1 β p y 1 μ γ 2 in such a situation this maximum value can imply an extraction of water which makes the water table below h min however when the environmental constraint is binding the water agency has to keep the water table above h min in that case she faces a conflict between the productive and the environmental objectives to determine the existing trade off between the two targets substitute the value of h w given by eq 15 in the steady state water balance eq 4 it gives q r α 1 μ γ 1 μ w f α γ which can be rewritten as 24 q r w f 1 μ substitute eq 24 in eq 20 yields 25 y f y n 1 2 b n a r w f β 1 μ 2 eq 25 implies a decreasing and concave relationship between the two targets an increase in the agricultural production can only be obtained at the expense of a decrease in the environmental flows fig 2 illustrates such a trade off between the two targets or constraints the value of y f max is obtained when w f 0 in eq 25 fig 2 illustrates the antagonism between economic and ecological performances in water policies and extends the trade off put forward by ref 36 or 37 for agricultural policies starting from y f m a x an increase in w f implies a small cost in terms of production loss however for larger value of w f the production cost become more important when the environmental flow objective is equal to the natural recharge w f r it means that the water table is at its highest value h t h max and then no water extraction for irrigation is allowed 3 viability analysis 3 1 the resource constraints the first constraint for the water agency concerning the environmental flow requirement on the form h t h w has already be introduced in the above section a second constraint results from the constraint q t q a due to the productive objective of the farmers and the water permit price constraint q t q m h t combining eqs 12 and 19 gives 26 q a q t q m h t this yields a second critical threshold on the water table 27 h t h y where h y is such that h y h max p y c 1 2 b n y n y it shows that h y increases with the target on agricultural production y the resource constraint becomes 28 h t h c where the critical value of the water table h c is defined as 29 h c h y when h y h min h w when h w h min when h y h min the constraint derived from the environmental flows objective is not binding the decrease in the water table below the minimal value h min is such that no environmental flows can sustain the ecosystem implying its collapse however when h w h min the environmental constraint holds and there exists a trade off between satisfying the environmental flows for the ecosystem and the water available for agricultural irrigation as shown by fig 2 3 2 the viability kernel the dynamics of the aquifer given by eq 1 are taken into account together with the resource constraint 28 in an infinite horizon context the viability kernel can be formally defined as the set of initial situations h 0 such that there exists water extraction q t and resources h t which satisfy the previous constraints for all time t 0 1 it can be written as 30 v i a b h 0 q satisfying 28 t 0 1 according to the values of q a and the associated h c several cases can be distinguished based on the water balance at the steady state 4 the steady state amount of extracted water q c related to the water table stock level h c is defined as follows 31 q c r α 1 μ γ 1 μ h c since h c can take two values h y and h w the associated steady state water extraction h c can also take two values h c and q w this gives the following proposition for the viability kernel 1 1 the proof is given in the appendix proposition 1 assuming that y i y max when h y h min or y i y f when h w h min it can be shown that if q a q c the viability kernel is empty v i a b ϕ if q a q c the viability kernel is v i a b h c h max in the no viability case the viability kernel is empty it means that for every initial water table state h 0 every trajectory q a greater than q c q y violates the constraints at least for a period of time however if and only if h 0 h c there exists a water quota strategy complying with the constraints over time and the definition of the viability kernel 30 fig 3 illustrates two viable cases when there is no conflict between the two objectives of the water agency h y h min case a and when the two objectives are conflicting h w h min case b in case a the critical value of the water table h y is obtained at the intersection of the q m h t line and the horizontal q a line for this value h y corresponds the steady state extraction q y which is higher than q a and the viability kernel is v i a b h c h max the viability domain corresponds to the area which lies above q a and below q m h t in this area the viability kernel allows increasing and decreasing water dynamics depending on whether the system is above or below the steady state water balance in case b the environmental target yields a critical h w for which the value of the steady state extraction is q a q w the viability kernel is then v i a b h w h max 3 3 the viable quota corridor the water quotas q t set by the water agency have to comply with the additional dynamic viability condition h t 1 h c it is assumed that at each period farmers buy the amount of quotas q i t they need to maximise their annual rent at the equilibrium quota price m t since farmers received an equal fraction of the quota supply q i t some farmers will sell their quotas when q i t q i t while others will buy them when q i t q i t using eq 3 condition h t 1 h c yields q t r α 1 μ a s 1 μ h c a s 1 μ 1 γ a s h t using the steady state water budget given by eq 31 the dynamic condition entails a superior bound for the water extraction 32 q t q d h t with 33 q d h t q c a s 1 μ 1 γ a s h t h c this superior limit is an affine and increasing function of the state variable h t by definition h t h c entails q t q c the following proposition specifies the set of viable water quota policies q viab associated with the viable water tables proposition 2 considering that q a q c the viable quotas associated with v i a b h c h max are when h y h min q viab q a m i n q m h t q d h t when h w h min q viab q a q d h t when h y h min the comparison between the slopes of q d h t and q m h t shows 2 2 see appendix that the dynamic viability constraint q d h t is binding and reduces the viability domain under the following condition 34 β c 1 p y 1 μ a s γ 1 condition 34 ensures that the water agency is dynamically constrained in the setting of the available water quota when this condition is not binding it implies that the viability domain and the viable quota policies domain are the same this case refers to the gisser sanchez effect stating the inefficiency of a water policy that occurs when the term in condition 34 is closed to zero fig 4 shows the set of viable quotas when condition 34 is binding consider a configuration in which q a is equal to q a q y while the viability domain was lying in the area above q a and below q m the viable quota domain is now reduced due to the dynamic viability condition h t 1 h y the set of viable quotas lies now in the area between q y and q d to illustrate the objective conflict faced by the water agency assume that the environmental objective of the water agency implies a critical water table level equal to h w h min and corresponding to higher environmental flows for the ecosystem such an objective means a lower production target such that q a q w and a new constraint represented by q d derived from the condition h t 1 h w it turns out that the viable quota domain is reduced and lies now in the area between q w and q d 3 4 some viable quota strategies the set of viable quotas when h y h min under condition 34 and when h w h min can be rewritten as 35 q viab ρ q a 1 ρ q d h with 0 ρ 1 eq 35 shows that several viable quota policies may exist depending the value of the parameter ρ the minimal viable quota q a is obtained when ρ 1 this quota corresponds to an ecological and conservation viewpoint in the sense that it favors the resource on the opposite the maximal viable quota consists in implementing q d h when ρ 0 such a policy is more economic oriented since it allows a high water extraction however this quota can only be implemented one time consider the dynamics given in eq 3 36 h t 1 1 γ a s h t r α a s 1 μ a s q viab t assuming q viab t q d and using the expression of q d given by 33 yields 37 h t 1 h c after implementing q d in period t the water table is set at h c and the amount of water extraction is constrained to q c for the next period t 1 4 numerical illustration the model is numerically tested using data on the western la mancha aquifer spain parameters values are provided by ref 38 13 15 29

8691,this paper studies the conflict between economic and environmental sustainability objectives faced by a water agency when she allocates water quotas to farmers this conflict consists in a water allocation problem between the amount of water claimed by farmers to irrigate their crops and the water flows needed for the conservation and the preservation of the ecosystems this conflict in objectives is analysed in a dynamic hydro economic model in discrete time using the viability approach the viability kernel that defines the states of the resource yielding intertemporal feasible paths able to satisfy the set of constraints over time is analytically identified the associated set of viable quota policies and the trade off between food production and ecosystem conservation objectives are characterized the theoretical results of the paper are illustrated with numerical simulations based on the western la mancha aquifer in spain keywords groundwater agriculture irrigation environmental flows individual permits sustainability dynamic model viability kernel water budget jel classification q15 q25 c61 1 introduction in aquifers managed with quotas water agencies are facing conflicting objectives between ensuring minimum environmental flows for the preservation of groundwater dependent ecosystems and satisfying the water claims of the farmers to irrigate their crops 1 this conflict can result from a lack of coordination between two distinct agencies trying to implement their own policies as in ref 2 or arise when an agency wants to achieved simultaneously quantity and quality objectives as in ref 3 handling the potential conflict between economic and environmental objectives is a major concern to achieve sustainability 4 5 this paper analyses the existing trade off between these objectives as a problem of constraints fulfillment hydroeconomic models are generally developed as constraint optimization problems with environmental constraints represented by minimum flow requirements 6 at each period the dynamics of an aquifer depend on the balance between the natural recharge the natural discharge and the amount of extracted water the natural discharge consists in water flows which sustain groundwater dependent ecosystems fish and other aquatic species the health of riparian and wetland ecosystems and other environmental needs 7 starting from an initial situation in which there is no water extraction the natural discharge is equal to the natural recharge once water is extracted the natural discharge decreases affecting groundwater dependent ecosystems 8 as modelled by refs 9 10 this natural discharge is assumed to be an affine function of the water table it allows to defined a critical boundary value of the water table for which the natural discharge is nil a first requirement of a sustainable management is then to keep the water table above this critical value this specification of stream aquifer flows is an example of interaction between groundwater and surface water but differs from ref 11 who consider the dynamics of two state variables one for each water sources or 12 who deal with embedded multi reservoirs the protection of environmental flows has also been introduced as an objective management for regulating agency in terms of ecosystem damages 13 15 however the lack of consideration of natural drainage in the aquifer water balance in the above cited papers has promoted the persistent water budget myth that net withdrawals can equal groundwater recharge on the long run without causing harmful damages 16 18 shows how the introduction of natural drainage in the water budget impacts the amount of water extraction and the dynamics of the water table the allocation of water quotas to farmers is also a problem of constraint the use of market based instruments such as tradable permits has been proposed as a promising way to replenish an aquifer 19 or to efficiently manage groundwater aquifers for irrigated agriculture 20 21 or to protect streams 22 tradable permits ensure that water will be used by farmers with maximum efficiency however like all cap and trade systems the way the cap which consists in the available amount of water for users is set remains a difficult issue as pointed out by ref 1 irrigation contributes to maintain rural development and employment in arid regions it can justify the objective of allocating minimum amount of quotas to farmers and to ensuring that the least efficient farmers will remain active a second requirement of a sustainable management is then to implement relevant strategies in the allocation of water quotas for every farmer by a regulating agency to deal with these two requirements which take the form of constraints the use of the viability approach has shown to be well adapted 23 the interest of this method is to focus on identifying inter temporal feasible paths within a set of desirable objectives or constraints this framework has been applied to renewable resource management 24 like fisheries 25 27 or groundwater 21 with respect to the literature 21 28 29 a first contribution of the paper is to introduce explicitly the natural discharge in the water budget of the aquifer and as an objective for the water agency a second contribution is to address the trade offs that arise between ecosystem conservation and economic development the paper is structured as follows section 2 is devoted to the description of the dynamic hydro economic model and the objectives of the water agency section 3 characterizes the feasible resource states and water policies under several constraints an application based on the western la mancha aquifer spain illustrates the main results in section 4 the last section concludes 2 the hydro economic model 2 1 the aquifer dynamics the dynamics of an aquifer are described by changes in the water table measured by h t 0 h max at time t where h max stands for the maximum height of the aquifer the water table increases with the constant natural recharge r 0 and is reduced by water extraction q t dedicated to irrigation and flows for the natural discharge w f t the total volume of extracted water q t corresponds to the quota set by a water agency a proportion μ of the water used for irrigation is assumed to come back to the aquifer where 0 μ 1 stands for the non absorption coefficient total extraction is thus 1 μ q t the natural discharge consists in water flows for groundwater dependent ecosystems fish and other aquatic species the health of riparian and wetland ecosystems and other environmental needs based on 10 34 the dynamics of the resource are 1 a s h t 1 h t r 1 μ q t w f h t h 0 h 0 where a stands for the area of the aquifer and s the storage coefficient following 9 10 30 31 the natural discharge depends on the water table as follows 2 w f h t 0 for h h min α γ h t for h h min the assumption of a linear conductance model is mainly accepted in the literature for the description of stream aquifer flow as shown by ref 32 or 33 coefficients α γ 0 respectively stand for the intercept and the slope of the natural discharge function 2 and are equal to α r h min h max h min γ r h max h min where h min α γ refers to the minimum level of the water table for which the natural discharge is nil it is worth mentioning that the natural discharge w f t appears in ref 34 but is not modelled in the sequel of that paper however this is done in the model of 10 which is an integration of the two aquifers model of 9 into a single one it can be checked that this is not the net natural recharge or the exploitable recharge equal to annual recharge minus annual discharge which is considered but the natural recharge minus evapotranspiration it implies that environmental flows and the water extraction problem cannot be monitored separately without being subject to the water myth budget criticism substitute eq 2 into eq 1 yields 3 h t 1 1 γ a s h t r α a s 1 μ a s q t with 0 γ a s 1 at the steady state the water balance equation yields a negative relationship between q and h 4 q r α 1 μ γ 1 μ h the water balance at the steady state takes the form of a decreasing line in the state control h q space as shown in fig 1 above the line given by eq 4 the water table diminishes with extraction and below the water table increases however eq 4 does not correspond to the whole set of the steady sate water extraction due to the natural discharge term the condition h h min ensuring a positive natural discharge w f t 0 also implies a constraint of the amount of extracted water such that q r 1 μ the set of steady state water extraction and water table satisfying the environmental constraint consists in h max h h min and 0 q r 1 μ because all the value of q greater than r 1 μ located between r α 1 μ and r 1 μ implies h h min 2 2 the farmers a set of n farmers are assumed to use water extracted from the aquifer denoted by w i as the only input to irrigate their crops the total crop income is given by the product of the crop yield y i and the constant price of the agricultural product p y the crop water production function y i w i is assumed to be quadratic 20 35 5 y i w i t a w i t b i 2 w i 2 t where a 0 is a technical parameter of production common to all farmers heterogeneity between farmers relies on the parameter b i 0 associated to the quadratic term of the production function 5 individual production reaches a maximum for w i a b i yielding y i a 2 2 b i a w i 2 it implies that individual water extraction w i 0 w i the maximum amount of water consumption is w i 1 n w i and the maximum amount of production is then y i 1 n y i farmers can be ranked according their efficiency y 1 y 2 y n for b 1 b 2 b n farmer n is the less efficient while farmer 1 is the most productive farmer 1 is able to produce more agricultural output than other farmers with the same amount of water lastly farmers are supposed to be price takers on the product market the pumping cost function is assumed to be decreasing and convex with respect to the water table the externality occurs through the extraction cost which increases when the water table becomes lower moreover the unit extraction cost is assumed to be the same for farmers at each point of the aquifer the unitary cost c h t is given by 6 c h t c 0 c 1 h t where c 0 c 1 h m a x and c 1 respectively stand for the intercept and the slope of the pumping cost function 6 as in ref 21 it is further assumed that farmers receive for free individual water quotas q i t at the beginning of each period t each farmer can buy or sell quota units on the market at a unit price m t to have the right to extract water the amount of quota held by farmer i after trade is q i t the individual profit of farmer i can be written as follows 7 π i h t w i t p y y i w i t c h t w i t m t w i t q i t using eqs 5 and 6 each farmer maximizes his payoff it gives the individual quota water demand 8 q i t a b i 1 b i p y c 0 c 1 h t m t it is a decreasing function of the quota price and an increasing function of the water table 2 3 the water agency a water agency has to manage the quota market by setting the supply of quota q s t q t using eq 8 the aggregate water demand for quotas q t i 1 n q i t is given by 9 q t a β β p y c 0 c 1 h t m t with β i 1 n 1 b i the market clearing condition q t q t yields the equilibrium water quota price m t 10 m t a p y c 0 c 1 h t p y β q t it shows that the equilibrium water quota price decreases with the quota supply and increases with the water table as we show in subsection 2 4 the water quota market is solved by assuming that the less efficient farmer is active the water agency needs to ensure a positive demand for quotas implying a positive price for the water permit in eq 10 11 m t 0 this positivity condition on the quota price yields a state control constraint 12 q t q m h t with 13 q m h t β a c 0 p y β c 1 p y h t the tradable water permit constraint entails a superior limit for the total water extraction q t this superior bound q m h t is an increasing function of the state variable h t in the state control h q space this bound depends on the economic parameters of farmers below the bound q m h t the low pumping costs increase the demand for quotas and the quota price in the opposite case the pumping cost is so high that there is no demand for quotas 2 4 the objectives we assume that the water agency faces conflicting objectives between maintaining minimum environmental flows to sustain dependent ecosystems and satisfying the individual water claims of farmers for irrigation the environmental objective of the water agency takes the form 14 w f t w f the value w f may be thought as a norm being set up by a decision maker or by the european water framework directive for instance such a value remains exogenous in our framework but its choice will impact the associated trade off for water irrigation substitute w f h t by its expression 2 implies a value on the level of the water table such that 15 h t h w w f α γ eq 15 means that to satisfy the environmental objective the level of the water table has to be greater than h w it turns out that h w is always greater or equal than the minimal value h min since for w f 0 h w h min concerning the amount of individual water claimed by the farmers to irrigate their crops we assume that farmers aim at ensuring an agricultural production target denoted by y such that 16 y i t y as mentioned in the introduction 1 argued that the social impact of irrigation can justify to maintain employment in arid areas this can take the form of constraint like eq 16 from 5 it implies 17 q i t a b i a 2 2 b i y b i substitute 10 in 8 gives 18 q i t 1 b i β q t combining 17 and 18 implies a corresponding amount of water quotas needed for irrigation since water is the only input used by farmers to ensure that all the farmers will be active condition 16 implies q t sup i β a a 2 2 b i y which can be rewritten as q t β a a 2 2 y sup i b i it states that the amount of water quotas has to be such that the least efficient farmer is active since sup i b i b n condition 16 entails the following bound on the water supply q t 19 q t q a where q a is constant and independent of the state variable 20 q a a β β 2 b n y n y it shows that q a increases with the agricultural production target y the payoff of farmer i can be written as 21 π i t 1 2 b i p y q i t 2 m t q i t 2 5 the economic and environmental trade off two cases have to be considered concerning the maximum feasible target value for the agricultural production the water agency can choose assume that the water agency has no environmental constraint to achieved the maximum target value for the agricultural production denoted by y max is obtained when the tradable water permit constraint given by eq 12 intercepts the steady state water balance given by eq 4 giving 22 q c 1 β p y r α γ β a c 0 p y c 1 β p y 1 μ γ substituting the above expression in eq 20 yields 23 y max y n 1 2 b n a c 1 p y r α γ a c 0 p y c 1 β p y 1 μ γ 2 in such a situation this maximum value can imply an extraction of water which makes the water table below h min however when the environmental constraint is binding the water agency has to keep the water table above h min in that case she faces a conflict between the productive and the environmental objectives to determine the existing trade off between the two targets substitute the value of h w given by eq 15 in the steady state water balance eq 4 it gives q r α 1 μ γ 1 μ w f α γ which can be rewritten as 24 q r w f 1 μ substitute eq 24 in eq 20 yields 25 y f y n 1 2 b n a r w f β 1 μ 2 eq 25 implies a decreasing and concave relationship between the two targets an increase in the agricultural production can only be obtained at the expense of a decrease in the environmental flows fig 2 illustrates such a trade off between the two targets or constraints the value of y f max is obtained when w f 0 in eq 25 fig 2 illustrates the antagonism between economic and ecological performances in water policies and extends the trade off put forward by ref 36 or 37 for agricultural policies starting from y f m a x an increase in w f implies a small cost in terms of production loss however for larger value of w f the production cost become more important when the environmental flow objective is equal to the natural recharge w f r it means that the water table is at its highest value h t h max and then no water extraction for irrigation is allowed 3 viability analysis 3 1 the resource constraints the first constraint for the water agency concerning the environmental flow requirement on the form h t h w has already be introduced in the above section a second constraint results from the constraint q t q a due to the productive objective of the farmers and the water permit price constraint q t q m h t combining eqs 12 and 19 gives 26 q a q t q m h t this yields a second critical threshold on the water table 27 h t h y where h y is such that h y h max p y c 1 2 b n y n y it shows that h y increases with the target on agricultural production y the resource constraint becomes 28 h t h c where the critical value of the water table h c is defined as 29 h c h y when h y h min h w when h w h min when h y h min the constraint derived from the environmental flows objective is not binding the decrease in the water table below the minimal value h min is such that no environmental flows can sustain the ecosystem implying its collapse however when h w h min the environmental constraint holds and there exists a trade off between satisfying the environmental flows for the ecosystem and the water available for agricultural irrigation as shown by fig 2 3 2 the viability kernel the dynamics of the aquifer given by eq 1 are taken into account together with the resource constraint 28 in an infinite horizon context the viability kernel can be formally defined as the set of initial situations h 0 such that there exists water extraction q t and resources h t which satisfy the previous constraints for all time t 0 1 it can be written as 30 v i a b h 0 q satisfying 28 t 0 1 according to the values of q a and the associated h c several cases can be distinguished based on the water balance at the steady state 4 the steady state amount of extracted water q c related to the water table stock level h c is defined as follows 31 q c r α 1 μ γ 1 μ h c since h c can take two values h y and h w the associated steady state water extraction h c can also take two values h c and q w this gives the following proposition for the viability kernel 1 1 the proof is given in the appendix proposition 1 assuming that y i y max when h y h min or y i y f when h w h min it can be shown that if q a q c the viability kernel is empty v i a b ϕ if q a q c the viability kernel is v i a b h c h max in the no viability case the viability kernel is empty it means that for every initial water table state h 0 every trajectory q a greater than q c q y violates the constraints at least for a period of time however if and only if h 0 h c there exists a water quota strategy complying with the constraints over time and the definition of the viability kernel 30 fig 3 illustrates two viable cases when there is no conflict between the two objectives of the water agency h y h min case a and when the two objectives are conflicting h w h min case b in case a the critical value of the water table h y is obtained at the intersection of the q m h t line and the horizontal q a line for this value h y corresponds the steady state extraction q y which is higher than q a and the viability kernel is v i a b h c h max the viability domain corresponds to the area which lies above q a and below q m h t in this area the viability kernel allows increasing and decreasing water dynamics depending on whether the system is above or below the steady state water balance in case b the environmental target yields a critical h w for which the value of the steady state extraction is q a q w the viability kernel is then v i a b h w h max 3 3 the viable quota corridor the water quotas q t set by the water agency have to comply with the additional dynamic viability condition h t 1 h c it is assumed that at each period farmers buy the amount of quotas q i t they need to maximise their annual rent at the equilibrium quota price m t since farmers received an equal fraction of the quota supply q i t some farmers will sell their quotas when q i t q i t while others will buy them when q i t q i t using eq 3 condition h t 1 h c yields q t r α 1 μ a s 1 μ h c a s 1 μ 1 γ a s h t using the steady state water budget given by eq 31 the dynamic condition entails a superior bound for the water extraction 32 q t q d h t with 33 q d h t q c a s 1 μ 1 γ a s h t h c this superior limit is an affine and increasing function of the state variable h t by definition h t h c entails q t q c the following proposition specifies the set of viable water quota policies q viab associated with the viable water tables proposition 2 considering that q a q c the viable quotas associated with v i a b h c h max are when h y h min q viab q a m i n q m h t q d h t when h w h min q viab q a q d h t when h y h min the comparison between the slopes of q d h t and q m h t shows 2 2 see appendix that the dynamic viability constraint q d h t is binding and reduces the viability domain under the following condition 34 β c 1 p y 1 μ a s γ 1 condition 34 ensures that the water agency is dynamically constrained in the setting of the available water quota when this condition is not binding it implies that the viability domain and the viable quota policies domain are the same this case refers to the gisser sanchez effect stating the inefficiency of a water policy that occurs when the term in condition 34 is closed to zero fig 4 shows the set of viable quotas when condition 34 is binding consider a configuration in which q a is equal to q a q y while the viability domain was lying in the area above q a and below q m the viable quota domain is now reduced due to the dynamic viability condition h t 1 h y the set of viable quotas lies now in the area between q y and q d to illustrate the objective conflict faced by the water agency assume that the environmental objective of the water agency implies a critical water table level equal to h w h min and corresponding to higher environmental flows for the ecosystem such an objective means a lower production target such that q a q w and a new constraint represented by q d derived from the condition h t 1 h w it turns out that the viable quota domain is reduced and lies now in the area between q w and q d 3 4 some viable quota strategies the set of viable quotas when h y h min under condition 34 and when h w h min can be rewritten as 35 q viab ρ q a 1 ρ q d h with 0 ρ 1 eq 35 shows that several viable quota policies may exist depending the value of the parameter ρ the minimal viable quota q a is obtained when ρ 1 this quota corresponds to an ecological and conservation viewpoint in the sense that it favors the resource on the opposite the maximal viable quota consists in implementing q d h when ρ 0 such a policy is more economic oriented since it allows a high water extraction however this quota can only be implemented one time consider the dynamics given in eq 3 36 h t 1 1 γ a s h t r α a s 1 μ a s q viab t assuming q viab t q d and using the expression of q d given by 33 yields 37 h t 1 h c after implementing q d in period t the water table is set at h c and the amount of water extraction is constrained to q c for the next period t 1 4 numerical illustration the model is numerically tested using data on the western la mancha aquifer spain parameters values are provided by ref 38 13 15 29

full aquifer h 0 h max implying a maximum discharge w f r and no water for irrigation the policy parameter ρ in eq 35 is set to ρ 0 5 we first consider the case when the environmental constraint is not binding it corresponds to case a in figs 3 and 4 the maximum production target is set to y max 5321 8 tons and entails a quota q a q y 666 2 m m 3 and a water table h y 568 7 m which is lower than the critical value h min 600 m fig 5 displays different trajectories of the water table the quota the quota price the natural discharge the mean individual rent and the pumping cost when the environmental constraint becomes binding according case b in figs 3 and 4 the water table is constraint to remain above h min 600 m for a target w f 150 m m 3 fig 6 displays the trajectories for the different variables of interest for that particular value the production objective is set at its maximum value y max 2201 tons and requires a steady state water extraction quota q w 262 5 m m 3 this quota is lower than the extraction value one will expect when environmental flows are not explicitly introduced in the water budget equation equal to r 1 μ 450 m m 3 to satisfy this objective the critical value of the water table is h w 627 m the following table shows the existing trade off between the two conflicting objectives as suggested by fig 2 w f y f max h w q w 0 3691 h min 600 r 1 μ

between economic and environmental objectives we assumed that a water agency aims at sustaining minimum environmental flows for the conservation of the ecosystems and satisfying a production objective for farmers in a dynamic viability framework including natural drainage in the water budget equation these two objectives have been interpreted in terms of constraints to be satisfied over time results show that the trade off water agencies have to deal with when setting and allocating quotas to farmers can be measured in terms of agricultural production losses for a rise in water flows dedicated to the preservation of ecosystems future extensions could be considered a first one consists in introducing other water demands than irrigated agricultural like urban water services 39 and addressing the trade off of these demands with environmental objectives 40 in a global water market a second extension will be to relax the assumption of deterministic framework and consider different

8692,agriculture in sub saharan africa ssa countries is predominantly rainfed but ssa could develop greater dependence on supplemental irrigation due to a changing climate with greater rainfall uncertainty and higher frequency of dry spells supplemental irrigation through small scale water harvesting sswh plays a vital role in helping rainfed small scale farmers overcome the risk of dry spells and promotes greater investment in agriculture this study employs a contingent valuation approach to estimate the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation in ghana the study finds the mean willingness to pay estimates for sswh supplemental irrigation to be ghc 25 36 usd 6 67 per acre per season for open canal irrigation system and 24 76 usd 6 52 per acre per season for pipeline irrigation system drought experience access to credit agricultural income and land ownership are key determinants of the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation the findings are particularly important for pricing small scale irrigation services from rainwater harvesting public water reservoirs the study recommends that investing in rainwater harvesting in rainfed agriculture should form a cornerstone of any country s strategy for adapting to drought particularly in developing countries where rainfed agriculture plays an important economic role keywords small scale water harvesting supplemental irrigation contingent valuation drought agriculture 1 introduction weather variability risk mainly drought is among the more pronounced agricultural production risks faced by small scale farmers in sub saharan africa ssa owing to the predominance of rainfed rather than irrigated agricultural practices 1 the vast majority of small scale farmers in ssa countries depend on rainfed agriculture for their livelihoods and they are often afflicted by the vagaries of drought risk in the form of regular dry spells during critical periods of crop growth indeed rainfed agriculture provides about 95 of ssa s food and feed 2 and contributes to the livelihood of more than 70 of the population 3 therefore for millions of poor small scale farmers drought poses a major threat that if not properly addressed could pull farmers into or keep them in poverty trap drought has both direct and indirect impacts on small scale farmers livelihood drought directly affects their production crops and livestock lives health assets and infrastructure direct impacts occur when drought destroys small scale farmers assets therefore not only do the farmers and their families go hungry but if they own livestock they are forced to sell or consume them in order to survive 4 then when the next farming season arrives they are significantly less able to farm effectively these impacts can last for years in the form of diminished productive capacity and weakened livelihoods 5 the indirect impacts are no less important the threat of drought or dry spell makes farmers highly risk averse they avoid investing in agricultural innovations that could enhance their farms yield since these investments may turn into losses in the event of drought in additional micro creditors are not willing to lend to small scale farmers if drought might result in widespread defaults even if loans can be paid back easily in most years the following measures have been identified among small scale farmers in ssa to mitigate the risk of drought careful diversification of crops and livestock diversification from farm to non farm activities a change in crop varieties temporal adjustments of cropping patterns and planting dates although these measures are particularly important to small scale farmers they are not enough to mitigate the risk of drought they focus on reducing the risk of drought by reducing the dependence on agriculture or by reducing its productivity insurance specifically index insurance offers another opportunity to small scale farmers to transfer this risk of drought to a less vulnerable third party however small scale farmers are severely cash and credit constrained so that they cannot afford even a fair insurance premium 6 because index insurance does not cover the actual loss and the problem of basis risk are other considerable constraints to the low demand for insurance by small scale farmers 7 the challenge of how to cope with dry spells or frequent short periods of water stress during crop growth remains largely unsolved experimental research shows that supplemental irrigation through small scale water harvesting sswh can be an effective tool for small scale farmers to stabilize crop water supply and thereby increase yields and create incentives for increased investment in innovative agricultural technologies 8 9 the landscape of many ssa countries combined with high surface runoff and intensive rains make sswh supplemental irrigation an option for bridging intra seasonal dry spells sswh supplemental irrigation is defined as the application of additional surface runoff harvesting water 1 1 although surface runoff is proved to be the efficient source of water for supplemental irrigation 79 other sources of water including surface water underground water and treated industrial waste water can be used for supplemental irrigation systems the characteristics of sswh supplemental irrigation include the following 1 surface runoff stored water is applied to rainfed crops which is normally produced without irrigation and 2 it is applied only when rainfall is inadequate because rainfall is the prime source of water for rainfed crops to otherwise rainfed crops when rainfall fails to provide essential moisture for normal crop growth or to improve and stabilize productivity this simple but highly effective technology allows farmers to plant and manage crops at the optimal time without being at the mercy of unpredictable rainfall sswh supplemental irrigation contributes to small scale farmers livelihoods in three ways 1 it improves yield 2 it stabilizes production from year to year and 3 it provides suitable conditions for economic use of higher technology inputs the critical importance of sswh supplemental irrigation lies in its capacity to bridge dry spells and thereby reduce risks of drought in rainfed agriculture the potential of sswh supplemental irrigation must therefore be explored to make better use of the limited resources available to meet future food demand and growing competition for water sswh supplemental irrigation has been successfully developed and piloted with small scale farmers over the past decades sswh supplemental irrigation helps to mitigate low food production caused by dry spells but its adoption and application has not reached significant scale and indeed is rare among small scale farmers in ssa countries many field experimental studies have demonstrated the benefit of supplemental irrigation for quality and quantity production as well as for wealth creation and poverty eradication supplemental irrigation is found to be affordable and appropriate for small scale farmers who are the cornerstone of food production in many developing countries although rainfall amount is enough to sustain crop growth its distribution during the crop season is suboptimal in many ssa countries crop season climate varies between a heavy rainfall period and a period of severe dry spells sswh supplemental irrigation provides multiple benefits higher and more stable yields lower risk of crop failure and significantly higher water productivity the amount of grain or biomass produced per unit of water 10 for example 8 assessed the effect of sswh supplemental irrigation on sorghum in northern burkina faso they found that adding about 60 90 mm supplemental irrigation per hectare during dry spell induced crop water stress resulted in an average sorghum yield of 712 kg ha compared to 455 kg ha without supplemental irrigation in addition when supplemental irrigation was combined with fertilizer the yield of sorghum increased to about 1403 kg ha 11 in an analysis of the benefit of sswh supplemental irrigation for sorghum and maize in burkina faso and kenya found net profits of usd 73 ha and usd 390 ha annually for sorghum and maize respectively compared with net income losses in traditional systems of usd 165 ha and usd 221 ha in traditional systems respectively 12 carried out multiple tests of sswh supplemental irrigation on sorghum in the sahelian and sudano sahelian agro climatic zones he found that supplemental irrigation increases yields by 10 85 depending on the agricultural season similarly 13 found that sswh supplemental irrigation increased yields of upland rice by more than 90 in sandy soil packed with organic material in the sudanian zone therefore the collection and storage of surface runoff water for supplemental irrigation substantially improved crop yields compared to the status quo sswh supplemental irrigation contributes equally to water productivity the water productivity under supplemental irrigation is about 2 5 kg m3 compared to 0 3 1 kg m3 under only rainfed conditions and 0 75 kg m3 under full irrigation 14 therefore sswh supplemental irrigation is a climate smart solution for drought stress in dry areas despite the underlying contributions of sswh supplemental irrigation to crop yields improvement water productivity and farmers livelihoods its application among small scale farmers is still rare on the supply side little has been done to provide irrigation facilities in ssa the share of area equipped for irrigation that is area fitted with technical irrigation facilities is only about 4 and the average rate of expansion of irrigated area over the past 30 years is only 2 3 in ssa 15 the constraints to the supply of irrigation facilities in ssa include high cost of construction low involvement of government and other stakeholders low involvement of farmers and concern about health and environmental consequences the collection and storage of runoff water for supplemental irrigation may have some negative consequences for the health of the surrounding population such studies as 16 and 17 found that dams or reservoirs increase the incidence of diseases such as malaria which would therefore reduce the labor force of households and increase households health spending however much effort is been made to increase the use of irrigation in many ssa countries in ghana for example the government has initiated a new flagship program called one village one dam 1v1d in the northern savannah agro ecological zone 18 which is the site of this study the policy consists of constructing of at least one dam per village to provide water for livelihood and the agricultural needs of the village there are few studies that have investigated the demand side of sswh supplemental irrigation in developing countries 19 in burkina faso 20 in northern ghana 21 in uganda these studies found that high usage fees lack of land ownership high land leasing price lack of extension services and low household are keys constraints that undermine the adoption of supplemental irrigation in ssa however these studies employed the open ended willingness to pay wtp elicitation framework according to this framework respondents are asked whether they are willing to adopt sswh supplemental irrigation in their plots during the wet season and to indicate their willingness to pay the framework has been shown to suffer from incentive compatibility problems in which respondents can influence potential outcomes by revealing value other than their true wtp this study employs an experimental design to elicit the wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation in northern ghana using both open canal and pipeline technologies the study uses the single bounded dichotomous choice method and controls for hypothetical bias in the wtp which previous studies did not account for the study also considers heterogeneity among farmers especially the distance between farmers fields and the nearest river using gps co ordinates to adjust for wtp the rest of the paper is presented in three sections the next section provides details on the materials and methods of the study including the experimental design study area model and descriptive statistics the third section presents and discusses the results the fourth section concludes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design many approaches have been used to value non market goods in the field of water resource economics including stated preference methods discrete choice experiment contingent valuation residual imputation production function and revealed preference methods based on market prices 22 23 both discrete choice experiment and contingent valuation methods appear to be the most recognized and widely used method 24 25 however the argument of which valuation methodology to use should be based on whether the overall objective is the valuation of the policy package in its entirety or the valuation of each of the policy s distinct outputs 26 27 the objective of this study is to assess farmers willingness to pay for the whole package of open canal and pipeline irrigation systems and not attributes of each of the irrigation systems in this context contingent valuation method cvm appears to be the suitable model to use the cvm assess individuals demand for a non market good or service and requires individuals to state their preferences via a wtp framework 28 29 cvm is employed in this study in order to measure the value of sswh supplemental irrigation despite its wide use the cvm has some limitations it suffers from i elicitation format or question framing open ended closed ended dichotomous choice or payment card which affects the wtp estimates differently 30 31 ii hypothetical bias due to the hypothetical nature of the question which inflates stated wtp relative to actual wtp 32 33 iii strategic bias as respondents may misrepresent their preferences in order to influence the decision making process 34 37 following the recommendations of 30 2 2 30 studied the applications of the cvm and provided insightful recommendations to maximize the reliability of cvm estimates those relevant to our study are i use of a representative sample 2 phrasing cvm questions in the form of hypothetical referenda in which respondents are told how much they would have to pay for each product before asking them to provide a simple yes or no answer and iii reminding respondents of their actual budget constraint which lead to maximizing the reliability of the cvm estimates and the contemporary guidance for stated preference studies provided by ref 38 this study employed single bounded dichotomous choice questions for each question field researchers explain the concept of sswh supplemental irrigation as follows supplemental irrigation through surface runoff small scale water harvesting supplemental irrigation is defined as the application of additional surface runoff water harvested in a reservoir or pond to otherwise rainfed crops when rainfall fails to provide essential moisture for normal plant growth this is done to improve and stabilize productivity upon subscription to sswh supplemental irrigation your field would be connected to the sswh reservoir or pond using either open canal or pipeline however the decision to release water to your field during the agricultural season is conditional upon rainfall shortages in the area and would be determined by the reservoir or pond authority 3 3 the reservoir authority a team formed of community leader and members of famer based organization and designated by the water user association of the village under the supervision of the ghana irrigation development authority makes the decision on whether to release water based on the precipitation recorded by the rain gauge located at the dam or reservoir area however farmers could also call upon the reservoir authority in case the rain gauge failed to record properly to explain this to the farmers the research team used different case illustrations water released when farmers do not need it and water not release when farmers need water owing to rain gauge failure in addition it was explained to farmers that in most cases water would be released when they faced a dry spell you can also call the reservoir or pond authority anytime you feel your field lacks water during the agricultural season the explanation was translated into the local language and field researchers conducted visual demonstrated to farmers using pictures of open canal and pipeline ground drawings as well as relate to existing open canal and pipeline irrigation infrastructures in the communities or nearby communities after explaining how sswh supplemental irrigation is applied the farmer was asked whether he or she understood if not the concept was explained again until the farmer fully understood the farmer was then asked to answer yes or no to the following question would you be willing to subscribe to the service for a seasonal subscription fee per acre the subscription fee would be paid at the beginning of the season to the dam or reservoir authority it could then be paid in multiple installments but the farmer had to pay the subscription fee in full before the start of the agricultural season this study designed contingent valuation questions in the form of hypothetical referenda in which respondents were told how much they would have to pay for each product before being asked to respond with a simple yes or no this is done first to mirror the real world market in which a price is given and the consumer chooses whether to purchase it at the stated price second it avoids bias induced by asking the follow up wtp questions as with double bounded dichotomous choice questions 30 39 40 the difficulty of the double bounded dichotomous model is that strategic behavior seems to be evident in the responses to the follow up questions one consistent finding with double bounded dichotomous models is that the mean wtp for the sample is smaller when the second question is introduced this is explained by the proclivity of the initial yes respondents to answer no to the second question regardless of the amount the consequence is that the aggregate proportion of yes to a given bid is lower and the double bounded responses yield a smaller mean wtp the respondent who initially answers yes may feel he or she is being exploited when asked to pay an even higher amount the respondent who answers no may feel that the quality of the good may be lowered on the second question therefore the fundamental problem is that the respondent s expectations have changed after the first question initially assuming no untoward strategic behavior the respondent has no reason to believe that the first question will be followed by a second question but when the second question is asked the respondent may wonder whether another will follow and adjust his or her response strategically 31 41 in the extreme the maximum efficiency gain for estimating mean wtp is obtained by offering a single bid equal to the true mean of wtp to all respondents but if the true wtp is known then there is no need to perform a cvm study thus if there is information available on the distribution of the wtp that information should be used to help design the vector of offered bids this information may come from focus groups or pretests the vector of offered bids could therefore have been randomized and offered to respondent using a single bounded dichotomous model the seasonal subscription fee per acre was one of seven values which were determined based on the referred fee per acre of ghc 20 00 usd 5 3 at 2015 average exchange rate of ghc 3 8 usd obtained from focus groups discussion and from similar services in ghana burkina faso kenya and india 19 20 42 the seven bid values used in the study include the referred fee with six additional values namely 75 85 95 105 115 125 of the referred fee bids ghc 15 17 19 20 21 23 25 one of these bids was randomly assigned to each farmer in the study each farmer was presented with two wtp questions i one for open canal irrigation system and ii one for pipeline irrigation system the open canal irrigation system is very common in the study area each region of the study has at least one big and well known open canal irrigation scheme for instance bontanga irrigation scheme in northern region tono irrigation scheme in upper east and sankana irrigation scheme in upper west all use open canal to drive water from the reservoir to farmers fields during the focus group discussions farmers mentioned that open canal irrigation in addition to providing water to their farms serves as a water source for household usage and livestock as farmers and their livestock can easily obtain access to the water flowing in the open canal on the contrary as the research team explained to farmers open canal irrigation entails significant water losses owing to seepage spillways evaporation and so on in piped irrigation no such losses occur the pipeline irrigation or piped irrigation conveys and distributes the irrigation water to the farmer field using pvc pipes and thus is protected from farming operations seepage spillways and evaporation loss both open canal and pipeline systems were demonstrated to farmers by the research team through a short photo visualization the order of the two tasks was randomized but each farmer received the same random bid for the two systems to what extent do the above mentioned hypothetical choices correspond to real economic choices this has been the main controversy of the classic cvm 43 several studies have noted that the classic cvm overestimates real economic choices and the values of products and services which leads to overvaluation of the goods or services in question this is known as hypothetical bias 44 45 there is little reason to suppose that the alternative stated preference method the choice experiment could reduce this hypothetical bias more than the cvm could 46 50 the majority of studies that have assessed the discrepancy between hypothetical and real payments have found that hypothetical payment is greater than real payment 51 52 53 explained that if a good or service provides a positive value to the respondent and if his or her response to the valuation question may increase the likelihood of the good s provision at little or no cost to him or her then it may make sense for him or her to report a high value in novel cvm approaches two methodological improvements have been introduced to mitigate the hypothetical bias problem these are i cheap talk introduced by ref 54 and ii the certainty adjustment bias by ref 55 cheap talk alerts respondents about the hypothetical nature of the questionnaire and the respondents are then asked to respond to the wtp question as if it were in a real life situation cheap talk also reminds respondents about their budget constraint 56 this study adapted cummings et al s 1999 cheap talk script and repeated it to the respondent anytime the wtp question was asked the cummings et al cheap talk script was adapted as follows now that i have explained the concept of supplemental irrigation i will proceed with the questions before that i would like to ask you please to take a moment to think after each question before you answer and to answer in the way that you would as if i was really providing this sswh supplemental irrigation service to you at the offered price please consider your financial situation and your ability to afford the product at the price given certainty adjustment bias as the name may suggest consists of asking a follow up question after an affirmative response to the payment question about how certain the respondents are in respect of their statements two different forms of the certainty adjustment bias have been used depending on the scale the first form is a 10 point scale in which 1 is very uncertain and 10 is very certain and respondents are asked to state their certainty level this form is then used to assess the degree of certainty in hypothetical wtp responses 44 57 a caveat of the 10 point scale form relies on the cut off level point above which the respondent s yes response is considered as yes and below which as no the cut off level of certainty varies from one study to another but most studies find that to mitigate hypothetical bias effectively seven or eight cut off levels of certainty are needed 57 58 the second form of certainty adjustment bias consists of a two point scale certainty probably sure and definitely sure 44 in this form only yes responses that respondents reported they were definitely sure about were treated as yes while yes responses that respondents reported they were probably sure about were treated as no another cause of hypothetical bias in the cvm is the fact that some respondents may fail to take the wtp questions seriously as the results of the surveys are not binding and do not require respondents commitment 30 53 59 for this reason the two point scale certainty question was adopted in this study to isolate the effect of cut off level certainty calibration in the 10 point scale as follows how sure are you that you would pay ghc to subscribe to sswh supplemental irrigation 1 definitely sure 2 probably sure 3 cannot say in addition a signed consent was issued to respondents who agreed to take part in the questionnaire in this way some level of seriousness of the respondents could be inferred 2 2 area of study this study took place in the northern savannah agro ecological zone of ghana northern upper east and upper west regions the choice of study area was based on its contribution to the entire country s food production and the great threat of drought and dry spells in the zone the northern savannah zone has two thirds of the country s grassland and is the largest agricultural zone in ghana the northern savannah zone of ghana is characterized by uni modal rainfall of short duration a high incidence of droughts and excessive evapotranspiration allowing only 4 5 months of farming and leaving 7 8 months of extended dry season agriculture in the zone is predominantly rainfed with less than 0 4 of the agricultural land irrigated as a result droughts often severely impact small scale farmers livelihoods in the area 60 the effects of drought on food production in the area are greater than anywhere else in the country 61 62 rainfall variability in the zone is exacerbated by climate change resulting in a rise in the frequency of dry spells during the agricultural season 63 however adaptation policies with regard to drought in this region have been insufficient 64 65 the major sources of water for irrigation in the rural northern savannah zone of ghana are surface water and rainwater harvesting these are also major sources of drinking water in this zone as the coverage of public piped potable water supply is very low 66 this study s novel contribution is that it estimates farmers wtp for supplemental irrigation services which could be useful to policy makers in the design of irrigation program desperately needed in ssa the wtp results could contribute to the implementation of the government of ghana s new flagship program the 1v1d in the northern savannah zone the program is to construct one dam in each village to provide water for the livelihoods and agricultural needs of the village the construction phase of the dams started in 2016 18 each dam would have the capacity and irrigation facilities to allow for at least supplemental irrigation in the wet season and in some cases full irrigation in the dry season the dam would source its water mainly from runoff during the wet season farmers would have to subscribe for a fee to help pay for the operating and maintenance costs of the dam the government would oversee the construction of the reservoirs and the operation and maintenance will be done by the reservoir authority a team form of community leaders and members of farmer based organization with the supervision of the ghana irrigation development authority the map of the study area presented in fig 1 indicates the number of farmers groups involved in the experiment per district and region 2 3 sampling the sswh supplemental irrigation experiment was conducted as part of an ongoing 3 year randomized control trial rct impact evaluation study funded by the us agency for international development the rct consisted at randomly assigned farmers on one of the following three groups i microinsured in which farmers were offered production loans coupled with index insurance and payouts were made to borrowers farmers ii mesoinsured in which farmers were offered production loans coupled with index insurance and payouts were made to the lenders for the express purpose of repaying the loan and iii control in which farmers were offered loans without index insurance the study aims to investigate how insured loans 4 4 the insured loan is a loan with an insurance policy designed to cover the risk of drought in the case of drought the farmer would be compensated with a cash payout made directly to the farmer microinsured or to the farmer s bank for the repayment of all or part of the farmer s loan mesoinsured the amount of the insurance payout would be determined by rainfall measured at a local rainfall station these rainfall data are collected regularly by the ghana meteorologically agency impacts access to credit and agricultural technology adoption among small scale farmers including fertilizer and high yield seed varieties the study team visited the study area in november 2014 for a pilot test of the survey instrument and to establish direct working relationships with key partners rural and community banks rcbs and the ghana agricultural insurance pool gaip in addition the team held about 10 focus group discussions with several farmers during the pilot test a preliminary sample of 791 farmer groups both existing and potential borrowers was obtained from the 14 rcbs each farmer group listed in the sample contained information on total number of group members gender breakdown community location loan size main crops farmed acreage planted and loan status in the previous year to ensure that the study targeted the farmer groups of greatest interest to us we applied the following three criteria to select our final sample i farmer groups should belong to districts with low rainfall areas between 800 and 1100 mm annually since the impact of insured loans is more likely to be evident when rainfall is low ii farmers groups should have 7 15 members to account for budget constraints and logistics of maintaining smoother fieldwork and iii the highest loan that farmers should have taken out was less than 10 000 ghc so as to maintain a focus on the most low income groups this process resulted in a sample of 279 farmer groups representing about 2500 farmers for the rct baseline survey six farmers were randomly selected from each of the 279 farmer groups using a uniform distribution with the intent to interview the first three farmers and the second three farmers as a back up in case the first three farmers were unavailable for the interview a total of 781 farmers were interviewed and 777 farmers responded adequately during the baseline survey conducted in march 2015 during the preparation of the agricultural season an experimental field survey was undertaken to elicit small scale farmers wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation table 1 presents the composition of the sample size by region and gender 2 4 model a contingent valuation methodology was employed to assess the wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation in northern ghana the single bounded dichotomous choices method was used in a single bounded dichotomous choice setting respondents were asked to respond yes if they were willing to pay a single randomly assigned bid to increase their status quo utility to the proposed change of utility due to the application of sswh supplemental irrigation or to respond no otherwise in general in a wtp approach the proposed change corresponds to an amelioration or improvement of the status quo 80 also respondents were asked to respond to two types of irrigation system open canal and pipeline thus the following random effects probit model adaptable to the clustered type of irrigation system was used to estimate the mean wtp and the determinants of the wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation w t p t i α β b i d i δ x i γ e n i ϕ t i t i μ i ε t i w t p t i is the binary response to the wtp question for farmer i for the type of irrigation system t t 1 for open canals irrigation system and t 2 for pipeline irrigation system b i d i is the proposed price 5 5 same random bid was proposed for both open canals and pipeline irrigation systems of the sswh supplemental irrigation system to farmer i x i is the vector of exogenous farmer i characteristics which is comprised of farmers experiences with climate measured here by two proxies i climate condition in the last agricultural season 1 good rainfall 0 otherwise which recalls whether farmers had good rainfall or not in precedent agricultural season and ii climate condition in the last five agricultural season which measures the number of time farmers had experienced good rainfall in the past 5 agricultural seasons this variable is likely to increase the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation studies including 39 67 68 and 69 found that respondents who experienced recent adverse weather conditions had high demand for drought mitigation strategies including insurance and irrigation risk and time preference whereby wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation is likely to increase with risk aversion and decrease with the discount rate 39 risk preference and the discount rate were elicited via a list of lottery questions for risk preference elicitation respondents were asked to respond to three lottery questions the first lottery question is which of the following choices would you prefer i a fixed amount of money ghc 30 or ii a coin toss whereby head earns you ghc 100 and tails earns you ghc 0 for the second and third questions the fixed amount changed to ghc 40 and ghc 50 respectively the risk preference coefficient was then generated following 70 the risk coefficients were categorized into two groups risk averse and risk loving similarly six lottery questions were asked to farmers to elicit their time preference the first time preference question is which of the following choices would you prefer i receive 15 ghc tomorrow or ii receive 16 ghc in 3 months risk perception is measured by asking farmers the likelihood that they would be a drought in the next 5 years and farmers were to choose 1 very likely 2 likely 3 unlikely 4 very unlikely distance to nearest river measures the distance between the farmer field and the nearest river during the baseline survey farmer gps locations were recorded and used to estimate the distance between their locations and the nearest river fig 2 presents the distance between the farmers location and nearest river in five categories 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 and 4 km this study tested the hypothesis that farmers who were closer to the river would be less likely to subscribe for irrigation farmers house structure another indicator of wealth considered in this study takes the value 1 if the household is built with mud 2 if concrete and 3 if bricks since house structure is a proxy for wealth status it may have positive as well as negative influence on the farmers willingness to pay for sswh supplemental irrigation extension service access measured by the number of times a farmer has been visited by an extension service officer is likely to increase demand for sswh supplemental irrigation extension service access increases the farmers knowledge about modern and productive practices and therefore is likely to increase the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation distance to market measured in hours of walking main mode of transportation in rural areas where this study took place from the household to the nearby input and output market is considered as another proxy for extension service household dependency ratio measured by the ratio of inactive household members household members between 0 and 14 and 65 plus of age and active household members households members between 15 and 65 years of age has an ambiguous effect on the demand for supplemental irrigation large household size may be a source of labor for the household and thus may contribute positively to increase household income and the demand for supplemental irrigation large household size may also deplete household income especially when the dependency ratio is greater than 1 many studies have shown that households with high dependency ratio invest less in farming 71 73 credit measured here by the amount of credit received by the farmer is likely to increase the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation however the worry with credit is that in most circumstances credit is cashless in fact 80 of credit received by farmers in this study is cashless the other household characteristics include age gender support received during negative economic shocks number of plots remittance livestock endowment land ownership education refer to appendix 1 for the definition and sign of these variables e n i is the vector of farmer i characteristics that are endogenous in nature and we estimate our models with and without them to assess the stability of the estimates and the potential importance of these endogenous variables these variables include agricultural income savings and share of land allocated to rice crop agricultural income and savings represent farmers financial resources necessary to afford sswh supplemental irrigation but could also reflect the ability of farmers to cope with the risk of drought farmers who are wealthy can easily smooth their consumption or can afford to own small scale private irrigation technologies or other alternative

representing mean marginal effects 2 5 descriptive statistic table 2 presents the summary statistic of farmers in the sample farmers on average are 46 years old and 83 of them have no formal education male respondents comprise 52 of the sample farmers households are composed of predominantly dependent members the average households size is about 11 members with a dependency ratio of 1 4 in other words every employed member of the household is in charge of more than one dependent member on average about six members of the household participate in agricultural labour households on average earn ghc 1334 00 usd 351 05 from agriculture compared to the average total income of ghc 2889 00 usd 760 26 per year households typically obtain about 60 of their income from agriculture compared to less than 6 from remittances nearly all 96 farmers rely on only rainfall for crop production the majority of farmers households 97 own at least one unit of livestock the average livestock endowment measured in tropical livestock units tlu is 3 43 landholdings in ghana are typically small small farms predominate throughout the country although they tend to be larger on average in the savannah zones with land distribution more skewed when closer to the coast the average landholding in the sample is 6 2 acres with more than 62 holding less than 5 acres which is considerably higher than the national average of 5 6 acres 74 extension service officers visit farmers about twice a season the average walking time to the market is 1 h on average 49 of farmers experienced drought the previous cropping season and about 47 and 91 had experienced drought at least thrice and twice respectively in the previous five cropping seasons on average 53 of farmers believed there would be a drought in the next cropping season farmers could call upon two to three people household member friend or neighbor for help in years of drought 3 results and discussions 3 1 factors affecting demand for supplemental irrigation there are a number of factors that explain farmers wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation as summarised in table 2 figs 3 and 4 present the probability of yes responses of farmers associated with each bid value the probability of yes responses dicrease with the increase of the bid values and the probability of yes responses is higher when the certainty scale adjustment csa is not taken into consideration table 3 presents the covariate marginal effect results of a random effects probit model estimation of the determinants of the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation columns 2 3 and 4 of table 3 present the estimates of the random effect probit model with no covariates with only exogenous covariates and with endogenous covariates respectively 6 6 covariates here include endogenous variables the results of the open canal and pipeline choice tasks modeled separately via a probit model are presented in appendix 2 since the csa is preferred ex ante this study reports only the results of the csa models as demand theory predicts the wtp price bid value is negatively correlated with demand for sswh supplemental irrigation at a statistically significant level of 1 in all specifications specifically every ghc 1 increase in the bid value is associated with a reduction of the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation of about 0 03 0 04 0 04 point for the models with no covariates with only exogenous covariates and with endogenous covariates respectively the likelihood ratio lr test of the difference between the model with only exogenous covariates and the model with endogenous covariates results on a test statistic of 21 52 and the associated p value is very low 0 0002 the results of the lr test show that adding endogenous variables agriculture income saving and land allocated to rice results in a statistically significant improvement in model fit the interpretation below is therefore based on the model with endogenous covariates agricultural income has a positive and statistically significant effect at 1 level on farmers demand for sswh supplemental irrigation in addition farmers wtp increases with land ownership the amount of loan received as well as the better structure of their housing this demonstrates the overwhelming wealth effect on the demand or adoption of technology as shown in previous studies 75 77 the two proxies for farmers experiences with climate are negative and statistically significant at 1 and 5 levels this shows that farmers who previously experienced good rainfall are less likely to adopt supplemental irrigation compared to farmers who experience dry spells or drought therefore dry spell or drought experience increases the wtp for supplemental irrigation for both open canal and pipeline because rice crops have high water demand it is expected that farmers with large land share allocated to rice would be more likely to subscribe for supplemental irrigation farmers who mostly cultivate rice or have a large share of their land allocated to rice are very vulnerable to the risk of dry spells as rice production requires much more water than do other crops such as maize as anticipated a positive correlation is found between the variable for the share of land allocated to rice and demand for sswh supplemental irrigation its coefficient is however not statistically significant as the investment in supplemental irrigation is likely to enhance farm productivity beyond the agricultural season farmers who own the land are more likely to adopt supplemental irrigation than are those who rent as the estimation result confirms we found that land ownership effect on wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation is positive and statistically significant at 5 level this is similar to the literature on the effect of farm certificate on farm investment 78 the effect of risk preference on the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation is negative and statistically significant at 10 level this shows that risk averse farmers are less likely to invest in sswh supplemental irrigation although we anticipated a positive effect the observed results can be explained by the fact that risk averse farmers prefer to keep their investment in agriculture to the minimum to diverse from the downside risk that may arrive from pest lack of market etc the nearest distance to river variable is negatively correlated with the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation but the effect is not statistically significant also there is no statistically significant difference between the two types of irrigation systems farmers education level which could provide some indication of cognitive ability to understand the mechanics of sswh supplemental irrigation is shown to have positive but no significant effect on the decision to opt for sswh supplemental irrigation the observations are percentage p 0 01 p 0 05 p 0 1 the standard errors are estimated using delta method log l 455 13 for the model without endogenous variables and 441 70 for the model with endogenous variables the panel level variance sigma u is 5 95 std err 0 50 for the model without endogenous variables and 4 47 0 26 for the model with endogenous variables to control for ordering bias the study randomly assigns the wtp questions for open canal and pipeline to respondents and included a wtp questions order variable in the regression model the control order question is negative but not statistically significant so the order of the wtp questions did not affect the behavior of famers 3 2 wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation estimates the results of sample mean and total wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation in the model with csa are presented in table 4 while the distributions of individual wtp estimates for both open canal and pipeline are presented in figs 5 and 6 the mean wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation using open canal is ghc 25 25 usd6 64 per acre per season without covariates and ghc 25 36 usd 6 67 per acre per season with covariates similarly the mean wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation using pipeline is ghc 25 55 usd 6 72 per acre per season without covariates and 24 76 usd 6 52 per acre per season with covariates the total wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation using open canal with covariates is ghc 19 705 usd 5 186 and exceeds that of pipeline by ghc 466 usd 123 4 conclusion whilst most agriculture in ssa countries is rainfed greater dependence on supplemental irrigation could become more important due to a changing climate in which there is greater rainfall uncertainty and higher frequency of droughts for millions of poor small scale farmers drought critically restricts their options limits development and pull them into a poverty trap sswh supplemental irrigation as a potential drought risk management tool can help to reinforce farmers decisions to adopt new productive agricultural technology in drought prone areas the objective of this study was to assess the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation in northern ghana the study found high demand for sswh supplemental irrigation with mean wtp estimate of ghc 25 36 usd 6 67 per acre per season for both open canal irrigation system and 24 76 usd 6 52 per acre per season for pipeline irrigation system the analysis of the determinants indicated that drought experience agricultural income loan received and landownership and risk aversion were key drivers of the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation this analysis also sheds light on the need to improve the wtp methodology commonly employed in the literature to elicit the demand for supplemental irrigation the study employed a certainty scale adjustment method to control for hypothetical bias that has a robust effect on the results without certainty scale adjustment farmers tend to overstate their wtp but the certainty scale adjustment provides a more conservative estimate of wtp value in light of the increasing pressure on water resources and uncertainty due to climate change rainfed agriculture will continue to play a dominant role in providing food and sustaining livelihoods particularly in ssa several studies indicate that supplemental irrigation systems are affordable for small scale farmers this study found a strong demand for sswh supplemental irrigation however policy frameworks institutional structures and human capacity are required for the successful application of supplemental irrigation in rainfed agriculture in ssa the findings of this study are reassuring for the financial sustainability of the ghanaian government s flagship program to provide every village of the northern savannah zone with its own dam farmers contributions could pay for the operation and maintenance costs of the dams reducing

8692,agriculture in sub saharan africa ssa countries is predominantly rainfed but ssa could develop greater dependence on supplemental irrigation due to a changing climate with greater rainfall uncertainty and higher frequency of dry spells supplemental irrigation through small scale water harvesting sswh plays a vital role in helping rainfed small scale farmers overcome the risk of dry spells and promotes greater investment in agriculture this study employs a contingent valuation approach to estimate the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation in ghana the study finds the mean willingness to pay estimates for sswh supplemental irrigation to be ghc 25 36 usd 6 67 per acre per season for open canal irrigation system and 24 76 usd 6 52 per acre per season for pipeline irrigation system drought experience access to credit agricultural income and land ownership are key determinants of the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation the findings are particularly important for pricing small scale irrigation services from rainwater harvesting public water reservoirs the study recommends that investing in rainwater harvesting in rainfed agriculture should form a cornerstone of any country s strategy for adapting to drought particularly in developing countries where rainfed agriculture plays an important economic role keywords small scale water harvesting supplemental irrigation contingent valuation drought agriculture 1 introduction weather variability risk mainly drought is among the more pronounced agricultural production risks faced by small scale farmers in sub saharan africa ssa owing to the predominance of rainfed rather than irrigated agricultural practices 1 the vast majority of small scale farmers in ssa countries depend on rainfed agriculture for their livelihoods and they are often afflicted by the vagaries of drought risk in the form of regular dry spells during critical periods of crop growth indeed rainfed agriculture provides about 95 of ssa s food and feed 2 and contributes to the livelihood of more than 70 of the population 3 therefore for millions of poor small scale farmers drought poses a major threat that if not properly addressed could pull farmers into or keep them in poverty trap drought has both direct and indirect impacts on small scale farmers livelihood drought directly affects their production crops and livestock lives health assets and infrastructure direct impacts occur when drought destroys small scale farmers assets therefore not only do the farmers and their families go hungry but if they own livestock they are forced to sell or consume them in order to survive 4 then when the next farming season arrives they are significantly less able to farm effectively these impacts can last for years in the form of diminished productive capacity and weakened livelihoods 5 the indirect impacts are no less important the threat of drought or dry spell makes farmers highly risk averse they avoid investing in agricultural innovations that could enhance their farms yield since these investments may turn into losses in the event of drought in additional micro creditors are not willing to lend to small scale farmers if drought might result in widespread defaults even if loans can be paid back easily in most years the following measures have been identified among small scale farmers in ssa to mitigate the risk of drought careful diversification of crops and livestock diversification from farm to non farm activities a change in crop varieties temporal adjustments of cropping patterns and planting dates although these measures are particularly important to small scale farmers they are not enough to mitigate the risk of drought they focus on reducing the risk of drought by reducing the dependence on agriculture or by reducing its productivity insurance specifically index insurance offers another opportunity to small scale farmers to transfer this risk of drought to a less vulnerable third party however small scale farmers are severely cash and credit constrained so that they cannot afford even a fair insurance premium 6 because index insurance does not cover the actual loss and the problem of basis risk are other considerable constraints to the low demand for insurance by small scale farmers 7 the challenge of how to cope with dry spells or frequent short periods of water stress during crop growth remains largely unsolved experimental research shows that supplemental irrigation through small scale water harvesting sswh can be an effective tool for small scale farmers to stabilize crop water supply and thereby increase yields and create incentives for increased investment in innovative agricultural technologies 8 9 the landscape of many ssa countries combined with high surface runoff and intensive rains make sswh supplemental irrigation an option for bridging intra seasonal dry spells sswh supplemental irrigation is defined as the application of additional surface runoff harvesting water 1 1 although surface runoff is proved to be the efficient source of water for supplemental irrigation 79 other sources of water including surface water underground water and treated industrial waste water can be used for supplemental irrigation systems the characteristics of sswh supplemental irrigation include the following 1 surface runoff stored water is applied to rainfed crops which is normally produced without irrigation and 2 it is applied only when rainfall is inadequate because rainfall is the prime source of water for rainfed crops to otherwise rainfed crops when rainfall fails to provide essential moisture for normal crop growth or to improve and stabilize productivity this simple but highly effective technology allows farmers to plant and manage crops at the optimal time without being at the mercy of unpredictable rainfall sswh supplemental irrigation contributes to small scale farmers livelihoods in three ways 1 it improves yield 2 it stabilizes production from year to year and 3 it provides suitable conditions for economic use of higher technology inputs the critical importance of sswh supplemental irrigation lies in its capacity to bridge dry spells and thereby reduce risks of drought in rainfed agriculture the potential of sswh supplemental irrigation must therefore be explored to make better use of the limited resources available to meet future food demand and growing competition for water sswh supplemental irrigation has been successfully developed and piloted with small scale farmers over the past decades sswh supplemental irrigation helps to mitigate low food production caused by dry spells but its adoption and application has not reached significant scale and indeed is rare among small scale farmers in ssa countries many field experimental studies have demonstrated the benefit of supplemental irrigation for quality and quantity production as well as for wealth creation and poverty eradication supplemental irrigation is found to be affordable and appropriate for small scale farmers who are the cornerstone of food production in many developing countries although rainfall amount is enough to sustain crop growth its distribution during the crop season is suboptimal in many ssa countries crop season climate varies between a heavy rainfall period and a period of severe dry spells sswh supplemental irrigation provides multiple benefits higher and more stable yields lower risk of crop failure and significantly higher water productivity the amount of grain or biomass produced per unit of water 10 for example 8 assessed the effect of sswh supplemental irrigation on sorghum in northern burkina faso they found that adding about 60 90 mm supplemental irrigation per hectare during dry spell induced crop water stress resulted in an average sorghum yield of 712 kg ha compared to 455 kg ha without supplemental irrigation in addition when supplemental irrigation was combined with fertilizer the yield of sorghum increased to about 1403 kg ha 11 in an analysis of the benefit of sswh supplemental irrigation for sorghum and maize in burkina faso and kenya found net profits of usd 73 ha and usd 390 ha annually for sorghum and maize respectively compared with net income losses in traditional systems of usd 165 ha and usd 221 ha in traditional systems respectively 12 carried out multiple tests of sswh supplemental irrigation on sorghum in the sahelian and sudano sahelian agro climatic zones he found that supplemental irrigation increases yields by 10 85 depending on the agricultural season similarly 13 found that sswh supplemental irrigation increased yields of upland rice by more than 90 in sandy soil packed with organic material in the sudanian zone therefore the collection and storage of surface runoff water for supplemental irrigation substantially improved crop yields compared to the status quo sswh supplemental irrigation contributes equally to water productivity the water productivity under supplemental irrigation is about 2 5 kg m3 compared to 0 3 1 kg m3 under only rainfed conditions and 0 75 kg m3 under full irrigation 14 therefore sswh supplemental irrigation is a climate smart solution for drought stress in dry areas despite the underlying contributions of sswh supplemental irrigation to crop yields improvement water productivity and farmers livelihoods its application among small scale farmers is still rare on the supply side little has been done to provide irrigation facilities in ssa the share of area equipped for irrigation that is area fitted with technical irrigation facilities is only about 4 and the average rate of expansion of irrigated area over the past 30 years is only 2 3 in ssa 15 the constraints to the supply of irrigation facilities in ssa include high cost of construction low involvement of government and other stakeholders low involvement of farmers and concern about health and environmental consequences the collection and storage of runoff water for supplemental irrigation may have some negative consequences for the health of the surrounding population such studies as 16 and 17 found that dams or reservoirs increase the incidence of diseases such as malaria which would therefore reduce the labor force of households and increase households health spending however much effort is been made to increase the use of irrigation in many ssa countries in ghana for example the government has initiated a new flagship program called one village one dam 1v1d in the northern savannah agro ecological zone 18 which is the site of this study the policy consists of constructing of at least one dam per village to provide water for livelihood and the agricultural needs of the village there are few studies that have investigated the demand side of sswh supplemental irrigation in developing countries 19 in burkina faso 20 in northern ghana 21 in uganda these studies found that high usage fees lack of land ownership high land leasing price lack of extension services and low household are keys constraints that undermine the adoption of supplemental irrigation in ssa however these studies employed the open ended willingness to pay wtp elicitation framework according to this framework respondents are asked whether they are willing to adopt sswh supplemental irrigation in their plots during the wet season and to indicate their willingness to pay the framework has been shown to suffer from incentive compatibility problems in which respondents can influence potential outcomes by revealing value other than their true wtp this study employs an experimental design to elicit the wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation in northern ghana using both open canal and pipeline technologies the study uses the single bounded dichotomous choice method and controls for hypothetical bias in the wtp which previous studies did not account for the study also considers heterogeneity among farmers especially the distance between farmers fields and the nearest river using gps co ordinates to adjust for wtp the rest of the paper is presented in three sections the next section provides details on the materials and methods of the study including the experimental design study area model and descriptive statistics the third section presents and discusses the results the fourth section concludes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design many approaches have been used to value non market goods in the field of water resource economics including stated preference methods discrete choice experiment contingent valuation residual imputation production function and revealed preference methods based on market prices 22 23 both discrete choice experiment and contingent valuation methods appear to be the most recognized and widely used method 24 25 however the argument of which valuation methodology to use should be based on whether the overall objective is the valuation of the policy package in its entirety or the valuation of each of the policy s distinct outputs 26 27 the objective of this study is to assess farmers willingness to pay for the whole package of open canal and pipeline irrigation systems and not attributes of each of the irrigation systems in this context contingent valuation method cvm appears to be the suitable model to use the cvm assess individuals demand for a non market good or service and requires individuals to state their preferences via a wtp framework 28 29 cvm is employed in this study in order to measure the value of sswh supplemental irrigation despite its wide use the cvm has some limitations it suffers from i elicitation format or question framing open ended closed ended dichotomous choice or payment card which affects the wtp estimates differently 30 31 ii hypothetical bias due to the hypothetical nature of the question which inflates stated wtp relative to actual wtp 32 33 iii strategic bias as respondents may misrepresent their preferences in order to influence the decision making process 34 37 following the recommendations of 30 2 2 30 studied the applications of the cvm and provided insightful recommendations to maximize the reliability of cvm estimates those relevant to our study are i use of a representative sample 2 phrasing cvm questions in the form of hypothetical referenda in which respondents are told how much they would have to pay for each product before asking them to provide a simple yes or no answer and iii reminding respondents of their actual budget constraint which lead to maximizing the reliability of the cvm estimates and the contemporary guidance for stated preference studies provided by ref 38 this study employed single bounded dichotomous choice questions for each question field researchers explain the concept of sswh supplemental irrigation as follows supplemental irrigation through surface runoff small scale water harvesting supplemental irrigation is defined as the application of additional surface runoff water harvested in a reservoir or pond to otherwise rainfed crops when rainfall fails to provide essential moisture for normal plant growth this is done to improve and stabilize productivity upon subscription to sswh supplemental irrigation your field would be connected to the sswh reservoir or pond using either open canal or pipeline however the decision to release water to your field during the agricultural season is conditional upon rainfall shortages in the area and would be determined by the reservoir or pond authority 3 3 the reservoir authority a team formed of community leader and members of famer based organization and designated by the water user association of the village under the supervision of the ghana irrigation development authority makes the decision on whether to release water based on the precipitation recorded by the rain gauge located at the dam or reservoir area however farmers could also call upon the reservoir authority in case the rain gauge failed to record properly to explain this to the farmers the research team used different case illustrations water released when farmers do not need it and water not release when farmers need water owing to rain gauge failure in addition it was explained to farmers that in most cases water would be released when they faced a dry spell you can also call the reservoir or pond authority anytime you feel your field lacks water during the agricultural season the explanation was translated into the local language and field researchers conducted visual demonstrated to farmers using pictures of open canal and pipeline ground drawings as well as relate to existing open canal and pipeline irrigation infrastructures in the communities or nearby communities after explaining how sswh supplemental irrigation is applied the farmer was asked whether he or she understood if not the concept was explained again until the farmer fully understood the farmer was then asked to answer yes or no to the following question would you be willing to subscribe to the service for a seasonal subscription fee per acre the subscription fee would be paid at the beginning of the season to the dam or reservoir authority it could then be paid in multiple installments but the farmer had to pay the subscription fee in full before the start of the agricultural season this study designed contingent valuation questions in the form of hypothetical referenda in which respondents were told how much they would have to pay for each product before being asked to respond with a simple yes or no this is done first to mirror the real world market in which a price is given and the consumer chooses whether to purchase it at the stated price second it avoids bias induced by asking the follow up wtp questions as with double bounded dichotomous choice questions 30 39 40 the difficulty of the double bounded dichotomous model is that strategic behavior seems to be evident in the responses to the follow up questions one consistent finding with double bounded dichotomous models is that the mean wtp for the sample is smaller when the second question is introduced this is explained by the proclivity of the initial yes respondents to answer no to the second question regardless of the amount the consequence is that the aggregate proportion of yes to a given bid is lower and the double bounded responses yield a smaller mean wtp the respondent who initially answers yes may feel he or she is being exploited when asked to pay an even higher amount the respondent who answers no may feel that the quality of the good may be lowered on the second question therefore the fundamental problem is that the respondent s expectations have changed after the first question initially assuming no untoward strategic behavior the respondent has no reason to believe that the first question will be followed by a second question but when the second question is asked the respondent may wonder whether another will follow and adjust his or her response strategically 31 41 in the extreme the maximum efficiency gain for estimating mean wtp is obtained by offering a single bid equal to the true mean of wtp to all respondents but if the true wtp is known then there is no need to perform a cvm study thus if there is information available on the distribution of the wtp that information should be used to help design the vector of offered bids this information may come from focus groups or pretests the vector of offered bids could therefore have been randomized and offered to respondent using a single bounded dichotomous model the seasonal subscription fee per acre was one of seven values which were determined based on the referred fee per acre of ghc 20 00 usd 5 3 at 2015 average exchange rate of ghc 3 8 usd obtained from focus groups discussion and from similar services in ghana burkina faso kenya and india 19 20 42 the seven bid values used in the study include the referred fee with six additional values namely 75 85 95 105 115 125 of the referred fee bids ghc 15 17 19 20 21 23 25 one of these bids was randomly assigned to each farmer in the study each farmer was presented with two wtp questions i one for open canal irrigation system and ii one for pipeline irrigation system the open canal irrigation system is very common in the study area each region of the study has at least one big and well known open canal irrigation scheme for instance bontanga irrigation scheme in northern region tono irrigation scheme in upper east and sankana irrigation scheme in upper west all use open canal to drive water from the reservoir to farmers fields during the focus group discussions farmers mentioned that open canal irrigation in addition to providing water to their farms serves as a water source for household usage and livestock as farmers and their livestock can easily obtain access to the water flowing in the open canal on the contrary as the research team explained to farmers open canal irrigation entails significant water losses owing to seepage spillways evaporation and so on in piped irrigation no such losses occur the pipeline irrigation or piped irrigation conveys and distributes the irrigation water to the farmer field using pvc pipes and thus is protected from farming operations seepage spillways and evaporation loss both open canal and pipeline systems were demonstrated to farmers by the research team through a short photo visualization the order of the two tasks was randomized but each farmer received the same random bid for the two systems to what extent do the above mentioned hypothetical choices correspond to real economic choices this has been the main controversy of the classic cvm 43 several studies have noted that the classic cvm overestimates real economic choices and the values of products and services which leads to overvaluation of the goods or services in question this is known as hypothetical bias 44 45 there is little reason to suppose that the alternative stated preference method the choice experiment could reduce this hypothetical bias more than the cvm could 46 50 the majority of studies that have assessed the discrepancy between hypothetical and real payments have found that hypothetical payment is greater than real payment 51 52 53 explained that if a good or service provides a positive value to the respondent and if his or her response to the valuation question may increase the likelihood of the good s provision at little or no cost to him or her then it may make sense for him or her to report a high value in novel cvm approaches two methodological improvements have been introduced to mitigate the hypothetical bias problem these are i cheap talk introduced by ref 54 and ii the certainty adjustment bias by ref 55 cheap talk alerts respondents about the hypothetical nature of the questionnaire and the respondents are then asked to respond to the wtp question as if it were in a real life situation cheap talk also reminds respondents about their budget constraint 56 this study adapted cummings et al s 1999 cheap talk script and repeated it to the respondent anytime the wtp question was asked the cummings et al cheap talk script was adapted as follows now that i have explained the concept of supplemental irrigation i will proceed with the questions before that i would like to ask you please to take a moment to think after each question before you answer and to answer in the way that you would as if i was really providing this sswh supplemental irrigation service to you at the offered price please consider your financial situation and your ability to afford the product at the price given certainty adjustment bias as the name may suggest consists of asking a follow up question after an affirmative response to the payment question about how certain the respondents are in respect of their statements two different forms of the certainty adjustment bias have been used depending on the scale the first form is a 10 point scale in which 1 is very uncertain and 10 is very certain and respondents are asked to state their certainty level this form is then used to assess the degree of certainty in hypothetical wtp responses 44 57 a caveat of the 10 point scale form relies on the cut off level point above which the respondent s yes response is considered as yes and below which as no the cut off level of certainty varies from one study to another but most studies find that to mitigate hypothetical bias effectively seven or eight cut off levels of certainty are needed 57 58 the second form of certainty adjustment bias consists of a two point scale certainty probably sure and definitely sure 44 in this form only yes responses that respondents reported they were definitely sure about were treated as yes while yes responses that respondents reported they were probably sure about were treated as no another cause of hypothetical bias in the cvm is the fact that some respondents may fail to take the wtp questions seriously as the results of the surveys are not binding and do not require respondents commitment 30 53 59 for this reason the two point scale certainty question was adopted in this study to isolate the effect of cut off level certainty calibration in the 10 point scale as follows how sure are you that you would pay ghc to subscribe to sswh supplemental irrigation 1 definitely sure 2 probably sure 3 cannot say in addition a signed consent was issued to respondents who agreed to take part in the questionnaire in this way some level of seriousness of the respondents could be inferred 2 2 area of study this study took place in the northern savannah agro ecological zone of ghana northern upper east and upper west regions the choice of study area was based on its contribution to the entire country s food production and the great threat of drought and dry spells in the zone the northern savannah zone has two thirds of the country s grassland and is the largest agricultural zone in ghana the northern savannah zone of ghana is characterized by uni modal rainfall of short duration a high incidence of droughts and excessive evapotranspiration allowing only 4 5 months of farming and leaving 7 8 months of extended dry season agriculture in the zone is predominantly rainfed with less than 0 4 of the agricultural land irrigated as a result droughts often severely impact small scale farmers livelihoods in the area 60 the effects of drought on food production in the area are greater than anywhere else in the country 61 62 rainfall variability in the zone is exacerbated by climate change resulting in a rise in the frequency of dry spells during the agricultural season 63 however adaptation policies with regard to drought in this region have been insufficient 64 65 the major sources of water for irrigation in the rural northern savannah zone of ghana are surface water and rainwater harvesting these are also major sources of drinking water in this zone as the coverage of public piped potable water supply is very low 66 this study s novel contribution is that it estimates farmers wtp for supplemental irrigation services which could be useful to policy makers in the design of irrigation program desperately needed in ssa the wtp results could contribute to the implementation of the government of ghana s new flagship program the 1v1d in the northern savannah zone the program is to construct one dam in each village to provide water for the livelihoods and agricultural needs of the village the construction phase of the dams started in 2016 18 each dam would have the capacity and irrigation facilities to allow for at least supplemental irrigation in the wet season and in some cases full irrigation in the dry season the dam would source its water mainly from runoff during the wet season farmers would have to subscribe for a fee to help pay for the operating and maintenance costs of the dam the government would oversee the construction of the reservoirs and the operation and maintenance will be done by the reservoir authority a team form of community leaders and members of farmer based organization with the supervision of the ghana irrigation development authority the map of the study area presented in fig 1 indicates the number of farmers groups involved in the experiment per district and region 2 3 sampling the sswh supplemental irrigation experiment was conducted as part of an ongoing 3 year randomized control trial rct impact evaluation study funded by the us agency for international development the rct consisted at randomly assigned farmers on one of the following three groups i microinsured in which farmers were offered production loans coupled with index insurance and payouts were made to borrowers farmers ii mesoinsured in which farmers were offered production loans coupled with index insurance and payouts were made to the lenders for the express purpose of repaying the loan and iii control in which farmers were offered loans without index insurance the study aims to investigate how insured loans 4 4 the insured loan is a loan with an insurance policy designed to cover the risk of drought in the case of drought the farmer would be compensated with a cash payout made directly to the farmer microinsured or to the farmer s bank for the repayment of all or part of the farmer s loan mesoinsured the amount of the insurance payout would be determined by rainfall measured at a local rainfall station these rainfall data are collected regularly by the ghana meteorologically agency impacts access to credit and agricultural technology adoption among small scale farmers including fertilizer and high yield seed varieties the study team visited the study area in november 2014 for a pilot test of the survey instrument and to establish direct working relationships with key partners rural and community banks rcbs and the ghana agricultural insurance pool gaip in addition the team held about 10 focus group discussions with several farmers during the pilot test a preliminary sample of 791 farmer groups both existing and potential borrowers was obtained from the 14 rcbs each farmer group listed in the sample contained information on total number of group members gender breakdown community location loan size main crops farmed acreage planted and loan status in the previous year to ensure that the study targeted the farmer groups of greatest interest to us we applied the following three criteria to select our final sample i farmer groups should belong to districts with low rainfall areas between 800 and 1100 mm annually since the impact of insured loans is more likely to be evident when rainfall is low ii farmers groups should have 7 15 members to account for budget constraints and logistics of maintaining smoother fieldwork and iii the highest loan that farmers should have taken out was less than 10 000 ghc so as to maintain a focus on the most low income groups this process resulted in a sample of 279 farmer groups representing about 2500 farmers for the rct baseline survey six farmers were randomly selected from each of the 279 farmer groups using a uniform distribution with the intent to interview the first three farmers and the second three farmers as a back up in case the first three farmers were unavailable for the interview a total of 781 farmers were interviewed and 777 farmers responded adequately during the baseline survey conducted in march 2015 during the preparation of the agricultural season an experimental field survey was undertaken to elicit small scale farmers wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation table 1 presents the composition of the sample size by region and gender 2 4 model a contingent valuation methodology was employed to assess the wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation in northern ghana the single bounded dichotomous choices method was used in a single bounded dichotomous choice setting respondents were asked to respond yes if they were willing to pay a single randomly assigned bid to increase their status quo utility to the proposed change of utility due to the application of sswh supplemental irrigation or to respond no otherwise in general in a wtp approach the proposed change corresponds to an amelioration or improvement of the status quo 80 also respondents were asked to respond to two types of irrigation system open canal and pipeline thus the following random effects probit model adaptable to the clustered type of irrigation system was used to estimate the mean wtp and the determinants of the wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation w t p t i α β b i d i δ x i γ e n i ϕ t i t i μ i ε t i w t p t i is the binary response to the wtp question for farmer i for the type of irrigation system t t 1 for open canals irrigation system and t 2 for pipeline irrigation system b i d i is the proposed price 5 5 same random bid was proposed for both open canals and pipeline irrigation systems of the sswh supplemental irrigation system to farmer i x i is the vector of exogenous farmer i characteristics which is comprised of farmers experiences with climate measured here by two proxies i climate condition in the last agricultural season 1 good rainfall 0 otherwise which recalls whether farmers had good rainfall or not in precedent agricultural season and ii climate condition in the last five agricultural season which measures the number of time farmers had experienced good rainfall in the past 5 agricultural seasons this variable is likely to increase the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation studies including 39 67 68 and 69 found that respondents who experienced recent adverse weather conditions had high demand for drought mitigation strategies including insurance and irrigation risk and time preference whereby wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation is likely to increase with risk aversion and decrease with the discount rate 39 risk preference and the discount rate were elicited via a list of lottery questions for risk preference elicitation respondents were asked to respond to three lottery questions the first lottery question is which of the following choices would you prefer i a fixed amount of money ghc 30 or ii a coin toss whereby head earns you ghc 100 and tails earns you ghc 0 for the second and third questions the fixed amount changed to ghc 40 and ghc 50 respectively the risk preference coefficient was then generated following 70 the risk coefficients were categorized into two groups risk averse and risk loving similarly six lottery questions were asked to farmers to elicit their time preference the first time preference question is which of the following choices would you prefer i receive 15 ghc tomorrow or ii receive 16 ghc in 3 months risk perception is measured by asking farmers the likelihood that they would be a drought in the next 5 years and farmers were to choose 1 very likely 2 likely 3 unlikely 4 very unlikely distance to nearest river measures the distance between the farmer field and the nearest river during the baseline survey farmer gps locations were recorded and used to estimate the distance between their locations and the nearest river fig 2 presents the distance between the farmers location and nearest river in five categories 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 and 4 km this study tested the hypothesis that farmers who were closer to the river would be less likely to subscribe for irrigation farmers house structure another indicator of wealth considered in this study takes the value 1 if the household is built with mud 2 if concrete and 3 if bricks since house structure is a proxy for wealth status it may have positive as well as negative influence on the farmers willingness to pay for sswh supplemental irrigation extension service access measured by the number of times a farmer has been visited by an extension service officer is likely to increase demand for sswh supplemental irrigation extension service access increases the farmers knowledge about modern and productive practices and therefore is likely to increase the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation distance to market measured in hours of walking main mode of transportation in rural areas where this study took place from the household to the nearby input and output market is considered as another proxy for extension service household dependency ratio measured by the ratio of inactive household members household members between 0 and 14 and 65 plus of age and active household members households members between 15 and 65 years of age has an ambiguous effect on the demand for supplemental irrigation large household size may be a source of labor for the household and thus may contribute positively to increase household income and the demand for supplemental irrigation large household size may also deplete household income especially when the dependency ratio is greater than 1 many studies have shown that households with high dependency ratio invest less in farming 71 73 credit measured here by the amount of credit received by the farmer is likely to increase the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation however the worry with credit is that in most circumstances credit is cashless in fact 80 of credit received by farmers in this study is cashless the other household characteristics include age gender support received during negative economic shocks number of plots remittance livestock endowment land ownership education refer to appendix 1 for the definition and sign of these variables e n i is the vector of farmer i characteristics that are endogenous in nature and we estimate our models with and without them to assess the stability of the estimates and the potential importance of these endogenous variables these variables include agricultural income savings and share of land allocated to rice crop agricultural income and savings represent farmers financial resources necessary to afford sswh supplemental irrigation but could also reflect the ability of farmers to cope with the risk of drought farmers who are wealthy can easily smooth their consumption or can afford to own small scale private irrigation technologies or other alternative drought mitigation technologies such as insurance farmers wtp may also be informed by their desires to increase their incomes as well as to grow more water demanding crop such as rice t i t i is the type of irrigation system t for farmer i ε t i is an independent residual distribution n 0 σ 2 here μ i represents a coefficient for the random cluster effect β γ δ ϕ are vectors of parameters representing mean marginal effects 2 5 descriptive statistic table 2 presents the summary statistic of farmers in the sample farmers on average are 46 years old and 83 of them have no formal education male respondents comprise 52 of the sample farmers households are composed of predominantly dependent members the average households size is about 11 members with a dependency ratio of 1 4 in other words every employed member of the household is in charge of more than one dependent member on average about six members of the household participate in agricultural labour households on average earn ghc 1334 00 usd 351 05 from agriculture compared to the average total income of ghc 2889 00 usd 760 26 per year households typically obtain about 60 of their income from agriculture compared to less than 6 from remittances nearly all 96 farmers rely on only rainfall for crop production the majority of farmers households 97 own at least one unit of livestock the average livestock endowment measured in tropical livestock units tlu is 3 43 landholdings in ghana are typically small small farms predominate throughout the country although they tend to be larger on average in the savannah zones with land distribution more skewed when closer to the coast the average landholding in the sample is 6 2 acres with more than 62 holding less than 5 acres which is considerably higher than the national average of 5 6 acres 74 extension service officers visit farmers about twice a season the average walking time to the market is 1 h on average 49 of farmers experienced drought the previous cropping season and about 47 and 91 had experienced drought at least thrice and twice respectively in the previous five cropping seasons on average 53 of farmers believed there would be a drought in the next cropping season farmers could call upon two to three people household member friend or neighbor for help in years of drought 3 results and discussions 3 1 factors affecting demand for supplemental irrigation there are a number of factors that explain farmers wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation as summarised in table 2 figs 3 and 4 present the probability of yes responses of farmers associated with each bid value the probability of yes responses dicrease with the increase of the bid values and the probability of yes responses is higher when the certainty scale adjustment csa is not taken into consideration table 3 presents the covariate marginal effect results of a random effects probit model estimation of the determinants of the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation columns 2 3 and 4 of table 3 present the estimates of the random effect probit model with no covariates with only exogenous covariates and with endogenous covariates respectively 6 6 covariates here include endogenous variables the results of the open canal and pipeline choice tasks modeled separately via a probit model are presented in appendix 2 since the csa is preferred ex ante this study reports only the results of the csa models as demand theory predicts the wtp price bid value is negatively correlated with demand for sswh supplemental irrigation at a statistically significant level of 1 in all specifications specifically every ghc 1 increase in the bid value is associated with a reduction of the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation of about 0 03 0 04 0 04 point for the models with no covariates with only exogenous covariates and with endogenous covariates respectively the likelihood ratio lr test of the difference between the model with only exogenous covariates and the model with endogenous covariates results on a test statistic of 21 52 and the associated p value is very low 0 0002 the results of the lr test show that adding endogenous variables agriculture income saving and land allocated to rice results in a statistically significant improvement in model fit the interpretation below is therefore based on the model with endogenous covariates agricultural income has a positive and statistically significant effect at 1 level on farmers demand for sswh supplemental irrigation in addition farmers wtp increases with land ownership the amount of loan received as well as the better structure of their housing this demonstrates the overwhelming wealth effect on the demand or adoption of technology as shown in previous studies 75 77 the two proxies for farmers experiences with climate are negative and statistically significant at 1 and 5 levels this shows that farmers who previously experienced good rainfall are less likely to adopt supplemental irrigation compared to farmers who experience dry spells or drought therefore dry spell or drought experience increases the wtp for supplemental irrigation for both open canal and pipeline because rice crops have high water demand it is expected that farmers with large land share allocated to rice would be more likely to subscribe for supplemental irrigation farmers who mostly cultivate rice or have a large share of their land allocated to rice are very vulnerable to the risk of dry spells as rice production requires much more water than do other crops such as maize as anticipated a positive correlation is found between the variable for the share of land allocated to rice and demand for sswh supplemental irrigation its coefficient is however not statistically significant as the investment in supplemental irrigation is likely to enhance farm productivity beyond the agricultural season farmers who own the land are more likely to adopt supplemental irrigation than are those who rent as the estimation result confirms we found that land ownership effect on wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation is positive and statistically significant at 5 level this is similar to the literature on the effect of farm certificate on farm investment 78 the effect of risk preference on the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation is negative and statistically significant at 10 level this shows that risk averse farmers are less likely to invest in sswh supplemental irrigation although we anticipated a positive effect the observed results can be explained by the fact that risk averse farmers prefer to keep their investment in agriculture to the minimum to diverse from the downside risk that may arrive from pest lack of market etc the nearest distance to river variable is negatively correlated with the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation but the effect is not statistically significant also there is no statistically significant difference between the two types of irrigation systems farmers education level which could provide some indication of cognitive ability to understand the mechanics of sswh supplemental irrigation is shown to have positive but no significant effect on the decision to opt for sswh supplemental irrigation the observations are percentage p 0 01 p 0 05 p 0 1 the standard errors are estimated using delta method log l 455 13 for the model without endogenous variables and 441 70 for the model with endogenous variables the panel level variance sigma u is 5 95 std err 0 50 for the model without endogenous variables and 4 47 0 26 for the model with endogenous variables to control for ordering bias the study randomly assigns the wtp questions for open canal and pipeline to respondents and included a wtp questions order variable in the regression model the control order question is negative but not statistically significant so the order of the wtp questions did not affect the behavior of famers 3 2 wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation estimates the results of sample mean and total wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation in the model with csa are presented in table 4 while the distributions of individual wtp estimates for both open canal and pipeline are presented in figs 5 and 6 the mean wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation using open canal is ghc 25 25 usd6 64 per acre per season without covariates and ghc 25 36 usd 6 67 per acre per season with covariates similarly the mean wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation using pipeline is ghc 25 55 usd 6 72 per acre per season without covariates and 24 76 usd 6 52 per acre per season with covariates the total wtp for sswh supplemental irrigation using open canal with covariates is ghc 19 705 usd 5 186 and exceeds that of pipeline by ghc 466 usd 123 4 conclusion whilst most agriculture in ssa countries is rainfed greater dependence on supplemental irrigation could become more important due to a changing climate in which there is greater rainfall uncertainty and higher frequency of droughts for millions of poor small scale farmers drought critically restricts their options limits development and pull them into a poverty trap sswh supplemental irrigation as a potential drought risk management tool can help to reinforce farmers decisions to adopt new productive agricultural technology in drought prone areas the objective of this study was to assess the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation in northern ghana the study found high demand for sswh supplemental irrigation with mean wtp estimate of ghc 25 36 usd 6 67 per acre per season for both open canal irrigation system and 24 76 usd 6 52 per acre per season for pipeline irrigation system the analysis of the determinants indicated that drought experience agricultural income loan received and landownership and risk aversion were key drivers of the demand for sswh supplemental irrigation this analysis also sheds light on the need to improve the wtp methodology commonly employed in the literature to elicit the demand for supplemental irrigation the study employed a certainty scale adjustment method to control for hypothetical bias that has a robust effect on the results without certainty scale adjustment farmers tend to overstate their wtp but the certainty scale adjustment provides a more conservative estimate of wtp value in light of the increasing pressure on water resources and uncertainty due to climate change rainfed agriculture will continue to play a dominant role in providing food and sustaining livelihoods particularly in ssa several studies indicate that supplemental irrigation systems are affordable for small scale farmers this study found a strong demand for sswh supplemental irrigation however policy frameworks institutional structures and human capacity are required for the successful application of supplemental irrigation in rainfed agriculture in ssa the findings of this study are reassuring for the financial sustainability of the ghanaian government s flagship program to provide every village of the northern savannah zone with its own dam farmers contributions could pay for the operation and maintenance costs of the dams reducing

need to be made to achieve a good environmental status for all water bodies by 2027 at the latest this article examines three principal water protection measures used in forestry buffer zones overland flow fields and sedimentation ponds we analytically develop marginal abatement cost functions for each of these measures and apply them numerically for the finnish forestry we find that the marginal abatement costs of nutrients using buffer zones in clear cut mineral soil forests are very high as they entail leaving financially mature and uncut trees in contrast the marginal costs of using overland flow fields in conjunction with ditch cleaning and clear cutting in peatlands are very low furthermore for sediments using overland flow fields as a water protection measure entails significantly lower abatement costs than does using sedimentation ponds in conjunction with ditch cleaning in peatland forests a cost effective solution in a river basin entails that the highest nutrient reductions are made in agriculture but that forestry also does its share a cost effective allocation of abatement measures entails that the proportions of the overall nutrient reduction are 3 1 in forestry and 97 99 in agriculture when the reduction target is set as 10 30 keywords ditch cleaning clear cutting nutrient load sediment load buffer zone overland flow field 1 introduction the european water framework directive wfd requires that member states take actions to reach good environmental status of all water bodies by 2027 at the latest the key tools for achieving this goal are river basin management plans in these plans member states design actions and policies requiring all polluting sectors to reduce their effluents the allocation of nutrient reductions between sectors should follow the principle of cost effectiveness which means achieving the required reduction of nutrient loading with minimum costs in its simplest form cost effectiveness requires that the marginal abatement costs of different sectors and agents are equalized for any target level of water quality for regional pollutants such as nutrients in waterways this rule is modified into a requirement that the marginal abatement costs of reducing pollution at any given receptor point are equalized between all polluters thus one must account for the transfer of nutrients from the source to the receptor points 1 the main polluting sectors in finland are agriculture and municipal waste waters the current estimate of the forestry induced nitrogen load is 1600 mg year 1 and the phosphorus load is 130 mg year 1 they constitute only approximately 5 of the total load of nitrogen and 8 of the total phosphorus load in finland 2 recent studies by nieminen et al 3 indicate however that peatlands drained for forestry 5 mha or 20 of the land cover provide significantly larger nitrogen and phosphorus loads than do pristine peatlands thus forestry may account for a 10 to 15 times larger proportion of the total loads than previously estimated 4 furthermore in finland forestry is an exceptionally high source of sediments due to forest drainage in peatlands the main sources of nutrient and sediment loads from forest management are clear cutting site preparation fertilization and ditching e g 5 6 7 while in mineral soils the source of the nutrient load is predominantly clear cutting ditch cleaning and clear cuts are the sources of the nutrient and sediment loads in drained peatland forests a typical water protection measure in mineral soils is the use of buffer zones which are unharvested land areas between the clear cut area and waterway 5 8 9 in peatlands sedimentation ponds overland flow fields and other measures such as sedimentation pits and ditch breaks are used to mitigate increased loading e g 10 11 12 13 14 15 for well designed river basin management plans the member states need information on nutrient reduction costs in forestry in the same manner as provided for instance in wastewater treatment plants 16 or agriculture 17 19 or 20 this helps in comparing the marginal abatement costs in forestry with those in other polluting sectors unfortunately well developed estimates of marginal abatement costs for forestry are missing making designing cost effective policies difficult the aim of our study is to fill this gap in the knowledge and to develop marginal abatement costs of the three most frequently applied water protection measures in forestry buffer zones sedimentation ponds and overland flow fields to our knowledge this study is the first of its kind in forest economics given that forest management decisions relating harvesting and water protection are made infrequently over tens of years in boreal forests we do not start with bare land but instead postulate an initial stand and let the forest landowner decide upon forest management and harvesting as well as water protection measures we derive the analytical features of marginal abatement cost functions in forestry and then apply them numerically using finnish data on forest management focusing on water protection measures we define the marginal abatement costs of water protection measures in forestry at the time when these measures are implemented we then put the derived marginal abatement cost functions in action and examine how to allocate abatement in a cost effective way between agriculture and forestry the model comprises both nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus the comparison of the marginal abatement costs of nutrients in forestry to the respective costs in other sectors especially in agriculture provides a special challenge because the management decisions in forestry and agriculture differ unlike in forestry in agriculture most water protection measures are chosen every year as a part of cultivation decisions furthermore the nutrient and sediment loads from single harvesting or ditching decisions may last even longer than ten years 2 while in agriculture most nutrient loads depend mainly on annual decisions nevertheless the approach taken in deriving the marginal abatement costs provides an adequate basis for the allocation of water protection measures between agriculture and forestry as we solve the cost efficient solution for agriculture and for annually harvested or treated forest land the only previous study resembling our research is by lauren et al 21 who calculated the unit cost of nitrogen reduction using buffer zones to our knowledge there are no earlier studies on the marginal abatement costs of reducing sediment loads in forestry previous economic studies focusing on forestry and water protection from viewpoints other than cost effectiveness are found in miller and everett 22 matero 23 25 matero and saastamoinen 26 creedy and wurzbacher 27 sun 28 eriksson 29 miettinen et al 30 and hökkä et al 31 our approach follows that of miettinen et al 30 32 who were the first to include nutrient load damage in the faustmann rotation model analyses focusing on the cost effectiveness of non point source pollution in river basins in finland are scarce the cost effective reduction of phosphorus discharging from agricultural land forestry land scattered settlements and peat mining at the catchment scale was analyzed by hjerppe and väisänen 33 lankoski et al 34 used a river basin model to analyze trading between point and non point sources but they did not include forestry in their analysis the rest of the study is organized as follows first we analytically present the marginal abatement cost functions for water protection measures used in forestry second we provide the numerical marginal abatement costs at various levels of nutrients and sediment abatement in forestry third based on the marginal abatement cost functions of nutrients we develop a river basin application and analyze the cost effective solution including agriculture and forestry as polluting sectors 2 marginal abatement functions of water protection measures for forestry the marginal abatement cost function describes how abatement costs increase when abatement is increased by one unit we focus on water protection measures to reduce nutrient loads from clear cuts in mineral soils buffer zones and ditch cleaning and clear cuts in drained peatland forests overland flow fields we restrict our analysis to short term marginal abatement costs meaning that we consider one rotation period 2 1 marginal abatement costs of nutrients in mineral soils consider an even aged stand of trees growing on mineral soil adjoining a watercourse let the initial stand age be a the stand is clear cut and a buffer zone is left between the clear cut area and the downstream watercourse a buffer zone is often left uncut but partial harvesting is also possible 1 1 in finland the national forest laws and forest certification system ffcs allows partial harvesting in the buffer zone the fsc certification system requires that the buffer zone is left unmanaged we assume that no trees are harvested from the buffer zone the time of clear cutting at the end of the rotation period is denoted by t and the length of time until clear cutting is t a the growth function is denoted by f t a let the timber price be p and the real interest rate be r we denote the share of the buffer zone relative to the total forest stand area as m in the absence of water protection the harvest revenue under the given rotation age is p f t a and under the established buffer zone it is 1 m p f t a indicating that the buffer zone decreases the harvested forest area and that the lost harvest revenue constitutes the abatement costs of buffer zones as a function of the nutrient reduction target the nutrient load from a clear cut area starts after clear cutting and the loading is assumed to last for a fixed period of time x years the nutrient load after clear cutting h s is a function of time s the buffer zone fixes nutrients released from the clear cut area into the zone and we express the share of the nutrient load reduction as a function of the size of the buffer zone by g m which is a concave function in m g m 0 but g m m 0 indicating that the buffer zone has a decreasing ability to fix nutrients thus the reduction of nutrients is given by g m h s we assume that the forest landowner focuses on the sum of the nutrient loads from years after clear cutting because controlling annual loads is not feasible in practice as a buffer zone is established once and becomes permanent thus we integrate over time to sum the nutrient loads and let z m denote the upper limit on nutrient loads set by society such that the periodic loads from clear cutting cannot exceed it z m 0 x 1 g m h s subscript m refers to mineral soils then the objective of the landowner is to choose the optimal single rotation period and the optimal size of the buffer zone to maximize the harvest revenue subject to the constraint on the upper limit on emissions m a x 1 m p f t a e r t a s t z m 0 x 1 g m h s this constrained optimization problem is conveniently solved by forming a lagrangian function l where the lagrangian multiplier λ links the objective function and the constraint thus providing the shadow price of the environmental quality the lagrangian function is as follows 2 2 formulation of the problem in equation 1 means that the nutrient load constraint is binding at the time of the clear cutting alternatively the lagrangian function could be formulated as l 1 m p f t a e r t a λ z m 0 x 1 g m h s e r t a when the nutrient load constraint is binding at all periods of time and the present value of future nutrient loads is not allowed to exceed the constraint when the problem is formulated as in equation 1 the nutrient load reduction is reached using only the buffer zone the alternative formulation of the problem means that both postponing rotation age and the buffer zone can be used to decrease the nutrient loads from clear cutting in both cases the lambda is a function of the same parameters 1 l 1 m p f t a e r t a λ z m 0 x 1 g m h s e r t a the choice of the optimal rotation period and the size of the buffer zone can be characterized by the following first order conditions 2 l t 1 m p f t t a r p f t a r λ z m 0 x 1 g m h s 0 3 l m p f t a λ 0 x g m m h s 0 4 l λ z m 0 x 1 g m h s 0 from equation 3 we obtain p f t a λ 0 x g m m h s and substituting in 2 gives λ p f t t a r 0 x g m m h s 0 thus lambda is positive and indicates the marginal abatement cost at the given upper limit on loads this marginal abatement cost depends on the ratio of the marginal harvest revenue lost by increasing the size of the buffer zone by one unit over the marginal reduction in nutrient loading equation 4 simply requires that the upper limit on the nutrient load is binding that is the loads are equal to the limit 0 x 1 g m h s z m by equation 4 equation 2 shows that the optimal rotation age is determined independently of the nutrient load constraint and the buffer zone size the second order conditions for the problem hold and are given in appendix a thus we can use comparative statics to examine how exogenous variables impact the optimal rotation age the size of the buffer zone and the marginal costs of establishing it first we have that m z m 0 and λ z m 0 indicating that an increase in the upper limit on the nutrient load allows higher loads and decreases the buffer zone and the marginal abatement costs of nutrients the effect of the upper limit of the nutrient load on the optimal rotation age is ambiguous for an increase in timber price we have that t p 0 m p 0 and λ p 0 thus the impact of the timber price on the optimal rotation age is conventional a higher timber price does not change the size of the buffer zone because the upper limit on the nutrient load is binding and the size of the buffer zone cannot be changed instead a higher timber price increases the marginal abatement costs finally t r 0 m r 0 and λ r 0 similar to the case for the timber price the effect of the real interest rate on the optimal rotation age is conventional and it does not have any impact on the optimal size of the buffer zone however a higher interest rate decreases the optimal marginal abatement costs of nutrients as seen from the above definition of lambda as the marginal benefit of increasing the size of the buffer zone by one unit increases the optimal marginal abatement costs of nutrients decrease in summary the marginal abatement cost function is defined by m a c λ z m p r for given timber prices and real interest rates the mac curve increases as the upper limit on the nutrient load tightens note finally that under some regularity assumptions the cost functions represent the underlying production technology 35 so that these functions can be applied to guide the choice of water protection measures in the river basin model in section 4 2 2 marginal abatement costs of mitigating nutrient exports in drained peatland forests consider now a forest stand on a peatland adjoining a watercourse stand management requires ditch cleaning because the drainage capacity of the ditches weakens over time and seriously reduces the growth of the stand 3 3 the analysis starts at the time of ditch cleaning thus if there is any harvesting before ditch cleaning such as harvesting of trees alongside ditches to enable ditch cleaning with an excavator it is not considered in our model ditch cleaning causes nutrient loading which is expected to last for approximately 10 years 2 when the stand becomes financially mature and is harvested clear cutting is an additional source of nutrient loads an overland flow field is used as a water protection measure to reduce the nutrient loads from ditch cleaning and clear cutting overland flow fields are pristine or restored mires over which the discharge waters from the upstream drained catchment are conveyed 36 37 suppose again that the forest landowner has an initial stand of age a the time of clear cutting is denoted by t and the length of time until clear cutting is t a forest growth depends also on the ditch cleaning effort n ditch cleaning is performed at time a after the first commercial thinning of the stand and the growth function is denoted by f t a n 38 39 4 4 chang 38 maximizes the land expectation value with respect to both the rotation age and the planting density amacher et al 39 examines the effects of forest productivity taxes when the landowner chooses the optimal rotation age and initial stand investment let the unit cost of ditch cleaning be w while γ denotes the unit cost of the overland flow field the size of the overland flow field is denoted by b and the upper limit on the loads is z p subscript p refers to peatlands the nutrient loading from ditch cleaning is k d s n and that after the clear cut is k c s n nutrient loading from both sources is assumed to last for the same x years and we again integrate over time to sum the nutrient loads for years following the forest management methods the nutrient reduction as function of the size of the overland flow field is g b we assume that this function is concave in b with a positive first and negative second derivative the overland flow field is established at the time of ditch cleaning but its size is chosen by also accounting for loading after the clear cut at the end of the rotation period thus the reduction of nutrients from both sources as a share of the original load is defined as g b k d s n and g b k c s n respectively the net harvest revenue is given by p f t a n e r t a w n γ b the forest manager maximizes net harvest revenue by choosing the rotation age under technologically fixed ditching and the size of the overland flow field subject to the constraint on the upper limit of the nutrient load thus the economic problem of the landowner over one rotation period is m a x p f t a n e r t a w n γ b s t z p 0 x 1 g b k d s n 0 x 1 g b k c s n e r t a recall that the loads from ditch cleaning start immediately but loading from clear cutting starts naturally after the cutting therefore the latter term is discounted the lagrangian function l of the problem reads 5 l p f t a n e r t a w n γ b λ z p 0 x 1 g b k d s n 0 x 1 g b k c s n e r t a the first order conditions of the maximization problem can be expressed as follows 6 l t p f t t a n r p f t a n λ r 0 x 1 g b k c s n 0 7 l b γ λ 0 x g b b k d s n 0 x g b b k c s n e r t a 0 8 l λ z p 0 x 1 g b k d s n 0 x 1 g b k c s n e r t a 0 from equation 6 the optimal time to clear cut the stand is affected in addition to the first conventional terms by the lagrangian multiplier and the interest cost term it multiplies this term tends to postpone the clear cut and the associated nutrient loading to reduce the cost of establishing the overland flow field equation 7 indicates the choice of the overland flow field area depending on the constraints on nutrient flows the unit cost is constant but the benefits from nutrient reduction depend via lambda on the tightness of the nutrient load constraint the lower this value the larger must be the size of the overflow field finally equation 8 simply requires that the constraint on the upper limit of the nutrient load is binding note that lambda is present in equations 6 and 7 it depends via 6 on the timber price and via 7 on the unit costs of the overflow field as well as on the ability of the field to reduce nutrients we cannot solve lambda explicitly but use comparative statics to examine its dependences the second order conditions of the problem are given in appendix a we assume that direct impacts dominate starting comparative statics with the constraint the upper limit on the loads we have that t z p 0 b z p 0 and λ z p 0 thus increasing the upper limit on nutrient loads prepones the optimal time of the clear cut and decreases the optimal size of the overland flow field furthermore it also decreases the marginal abatement costs of nutrients for an increase in timber price we have that t p 0 b p 0 and λ p 0 thus a higher timber price shortens the optimal time of the clear cut and increases the size of the overflow field naturally a higher timber price increases the marginal abatement costs for an increase in the unit cost of the overland flow field we have that t γ 0 b γ 0 and λ γ 0 thus an increase in the unit cost of the overland flow field postpones the optimal time of the clear cut and decreases the optimal size of the overland flow field as the unit cost of the overland flow field increases the marginal abatement costs increase finally the effects of the real interest rate on the optimal time of the clear cut the size of the overland flow field and the marginal abatement costs are ambiguous thus the marginal abatement cost of the overflow field can be expressed as m a c λ z p γ p r again for a given unit cost of the overland flow field timber prices and a real interest rate the mac curve increases as the upper limit on the nutrient loads tightens 3 a numerical application to finnish forestry and water protection based on the theoretical model we now calculate the numerical marginal abatement costs using buffer zones overland flow fields and sedimentation ponds as water protection measures the actual decision of using buffer zones as a water protection measure in mineral soil forestry is made at the time of clear cutting of the stand thus we calculate the marginal abatement costs of reducing the nutrient loads using buffer zones at the time of the clear cut which takes place at the optimal rotation age mathematica was used to calculate the marginal abatement costs 3 1 marginal abatement costs of nutrient load reduction in mineral soil forests buffer zone in our numerical model we use the growth of norway spruce in southern finland calibrated by tahvonen and salo 40 9 f t 500 1 49 e 0 048 t equation 9 represents a logistic forest growth as a function of the rotation age and produces the maximum stock by 500 m3 ha 1 the parameters in the denominator determine the rate and concavity of forest growth clear cuts in mineral soils cause both nitrogen and phosphorus loads to watercourses the nitrogen load data in the absence of a buffer zone is based on miettinen et al 30 and the phosphorus load data is derived from finér et al 2 the loads are assumed to be similar with or without any soil preparation 2 the phosphorus load is converted to nitrogen equivalents ne using the redfield ratio which is the constant ratio of nitrogen and phosphorus mass among marine plankton 41 thus the phosphorus load is multiplied by 7 2 to estimate the phosphorus load as nitrogen equivalents the nutrient load h s kg ha 1 year 1 thus consists of both the nitrogen and phosphorus loads the nitrogen retention capacity of the buffer zone was estimated by the femma model 5 5 a more detailed description of the ecohydrologic model is found in miettinen et al 30 which simulates retention when the share of the buffer zone relative to the total clear cut area changes from zero to 20 the nitrogen reduction as a share of the loads is a concave function of the size of the buffer zone m as follows 10 g m 0 4962 m 0 3983 as fig 1 shows the share of nitrogen reduction increases with the size of the buffer zone but in a decreasing fashion the exponent parameter determines the degree of concavity of the retention that is the decreasing marginal productivity of the buffer zone as there are no estimated reduction functions for phosphorus retention we use the same reduction function for phosphorus as used for nitrogen the timber price is 34 m 3 for stem wood 6 6 the timber price estimate is based on timber price statistics from the year 2016 for spruce saw logs and pulpwood the estimate is calculated as a weighted average according to the share of spruce saw logs and pulpwood measured in the national forest inventory vmi11 for finland 42 43 and the real interest rate used is 2 the time of the clear cut is set at 83 years giving a timber volume of 262 m3 ha 1 for the clear cutting the marginal abatement cost and the buffer zone size are calculated for consecutively tightening levels of the upper limit on the nutrient load the results are collected in table 1 the first two columns indicate the reduction targets based on the tightening levels of the upper limits on the nutrient load the third column gives the size of the buffer zone and the next two provide the marginal and total costs of abatement the marginal abatement costs of nutrients ne are high and increase strongly with the reduction target the reason for this effect is that leaving mature trees standing is very costly and the nutrient reductions per hectare are low the last two columns provide a generalization to the annual clear cut area in finland which was 141 044 ha in 2016 43 we use the estimate of the shoreline length per forest area 11 m ha 1 23 to estimate the total costs assuming that buffer zones are applied to all clear cut areas with shorelines 15 515 ha under the nutrient reduction target the resulting reductions in loads would be relatively small but the costs would be very high 7 7 as the calculation is based on the average value of the shoreline length per forest land area the fact that the costs of buffer zones differ between locations is not included in the estimates of the total costs fig 2 illustrates the marginal abatement cost function which is increasing and convex in abatement the marginal abatement cost function using the buffer zone b z as a water protection measure as a function of the nutrient abatement a is given by 11 m a c b z 236 77 a 2 371 79 a we provide a sensitivity analysis with respect to timber prices in appendix b in table b 1 the timber prices are changed to 25 below and above the basic run estimate 3 2 marginal abatement costs of nutrients and sediment in drained peatland forests overland flow field and sedimentation pond we next determine the marginal abatement costs of nutrients using overland flow fields as a water protection measure in peatland forestry as an additional result we also calculate the marginal abatement costs of sediments using either an overland flow field or a sedimentation pond the analytical derivation of the abatement cost function is given in appendix a sedimentation ponds are excavated in the main outlet ditch of the drainage area to slow down the flow of water and enable sedimentation 6 we postulate a catchment area of 50 ha out of which 30 15 ha is subjected to ditch cleaning after the first commercial thinning of the stand at the end of the rotation period the same area is assumed to be clear cut the average stumpage prices from regeneration felling northern ostrobothnia area in central western finland are 52 43 m 3 for saw logs and 18 10 m 3 for pulpwood 43 these prices differ from those used above for mineral soils because they are regional and relevant to peatland forestry ditch cleaning costs are 196 ha 1 43 8 8 water protection costs are excluded the cost estimate is based on statistics from the year 2014 converted to the 2016 price level 44 and the real interest rate is 2 the costs of the overland flow field are 750 ha 1 9 9 the estimated costs of the overland flow field are based on the project cost effective water protection measures by tapio ltd to this estimate we also added the value of lost land area using the bare land value of 115 ha 1 overland flow fields are established on peatlands but corresponding bare land value estimates were not available thus the value here is calculated based on the estimate for low productivity mineral soil forests in the northern ostrobothnia area in central western finland 45 the final estimate of the cost of the overland flow field was converted to 2016 prices 44 46 and the costs of the sedimentation pond 1 m 1 seppäkoski 2016 personal communication 29 january forest growth in peatlands is estimated using the motti stand simulator which predicts growth and mortality of the trees and the effects of silvicultural treatments on tree growth at the stand level under finnish conditions motti software 3 2 http www metla fi metinfo motti index en htm last accessed february 2017 see refs 47 48 for drained peatlands motti predicts both the need for ditch network maintenance and the respective growth response 49 51 we derive the forest growth functions using motti simulations and assuming ditch cleaning the stand growing on the ptkg і drained peatland site type according to laine and vasander 52 10 10 drained peatland site types according to the finnish nomenclature 52 ptkg vaccinium vitis idaea type is assumed to be dominated by scots pine and located in the commune of liminka northern ostrobothnia area in central western finland where the average temperature sum is 1045 2 d d at the beginning of the simulation the stand age was 20 years based on the drainage age i e the time elapsed since the initial drainage 11 11 the stands in the ptkg і site are not even aged in practise as there are trees born both before and after the first drainage when estimating the stand growth in peatlands motti simulator does not use the age of the trees to predict the tree growth the average stand basal area was 17 4 m2 ha 1 the stem number was 2332 stems ha 1 the basal area weighted mean diameter was 12 4 cm the dominant height was 11 4 m and the volume was 88 9 m3 ha 1 thinning ditch cleaning and clear cutting followed the finnish silvicultural recommendations 53 the nitrogen and phosphorus loads from the clear cut areas in drained peatlands and the sediment loads due to ditch cleaning are based on the average loads in finland 2 we assume that clear cuts in drained peatland forests follow the best management practices harvesting during the frozen soil period in winter and using harvest residues as mats against heavy harvesting machinery and only increase the dissolved nutrient exports in contrast to clear cuts ditch cleaning has a minor impact on dissolved nutrient exports 54 nitrogen and phosphorus loads from ditch cleaning are thus bound to the sediment loads the amount of nitrogen is estimated to be 0 666 of the sediment load and that of phosphorus is 0 1 the estimate for nitrogen is based on the average sediment nitrogen content in nieminen et al 3 and the estimate for phosphorus is derived from finér et al 2 we employ the matlab curve fitting tool to estimate the retention functions first we describe how the overland flow field retains nitrogen phosphorus and sediment from clear cuts and ditch cleaning in peatlands we assume that an overland flow field reduces only 30 of the dissolved nitrogen load caused by clear cutting in peatlands because approximately 70 of the nitrogen load from peatland clear cuts is in the form of dissolved organic nitrogen 55 and overland flow fields retain only inorganic nutrients 56 drawing on hynninen et al 15 12 12 in hynninen et al 15 the sizes of the overland flow fields varied between 0 09 and 4 88 of the catchment areas the retention function is estimated using the data where the amount of ammonium entering the overland flow field is at least 5 kg year even though the data in hynninen et al 15 is only for ammonium the function 12 is applied for both ammonium and nitrate vikman et al 14 reported similar nitrate and ammonium retentions by overland flow fields and showed that their retentions were similarly affected by overland flow field and catchment characteristics in fig 3 the share of inorganic nitrogen load reduction g b f n as a function of the size of the overland flow field b f n subscript f refers to the overland flow field and n to nitrogen is fitted to 12 g b f n 1 791 b f n 0 0656 3 158 there is no data to estimate the retention function of phosphorus loads from clear cuts we assume that clear cuts only increase dissolved nutrients and that overland flow fields retain only inorganic forms of dissolved nutrients 56 according to nieminen 57 approximately 77 of the dissolved phosphorus load from clear cuts in peatland forests is in inorganic form drawing on the average retention of dissolved inorganic phosphorus in väänänen et al 13 and silvan et al 58 we assume that overland flow fields are able to retain 77 of this load furthermore a nonlinear regression of the sediment load reduction as a function of the size of the overland flow field is based on the data by nieminen et al 12 and sallantaus et al 59 eight overland flow fields were included in the analysis and the overland flow field sizes varied from 0 05 to 4 88 of the catchment areas from fig 4 we can see that the share of the sediment load reduction g b f s as a function of the size of the overland flow field b f s subscript f refers to overland flow field and s to sediment is given by 13 g b f s 0 02437 b f s 0 4997 1 016 the overland flow field is assumed to retain sediment bound nitrogen and phosphorus similarly as sediment according to the retention function in equation 13 the retention capacity of a sediment pond is based on nieminen et al 60 13 13 the original data consisted of 37 sedimentation ponds of which 17 were excavated on erosion sensitive soils and increased rather than decreased the suspended solids concentrations the excavation of such ponds is no longer recommended the retention function in equation 14 is estimated using data from 12 sedimentation ponds which clearly decreased the sediment load and received a sediment loading of 10 000 kg year 1 60 with lower input loadings sedimentation ponds had negligible retention capacity the maximum efficiency of sedimentation ponds is approximately 55 of the sediment load further increasing the pond volume after reaching this level has very little effect on the retention as fig 5 shows the share of the sediment load reduction g b p s as a function of the pond volume b p s subscript p refers to sedimentation pond and s to sediment is 14 g b p s 0 03089 b p s 0 4625 3 2 1 marginal abatement costs of nutrients overland flow fields we include both the nitrogen and phosphorus loads from peatland clear cuts and ditch cleaning and calculate the marginal abatement costs of nutrients when the phosphorus load is included as nitrogen equivalents ne table 2 suggests that the marginal abatement costs of nutrients are 0 02 kg 1 ne when the reduction target is set to 8 and the interest rate is 2 the marginal abatement costs increase to 0 04 kg 1 ne when the reduction target is set as high as 30 a comparison to marginal abatement costs in mineral soil forestry and agriculture shows that overland flow fields in peatland forestry clearly have the lowest marginal abatement costs of nutrients fig 6 shows that the marginal abatement costs of using overland flow fields are surprisingly low albeit increasing with abatement the marginal abatement cost function of using an overland flow field f as a water protection measure as a function of abatement a is given by 15 m a c f 0 00011 a 2 0 000016 a 0 01443 3 2 2 marginal abatement costs of sediment overland flow field and sedimentation pond forestry in finland is an exceptionally high source of sediments due to forest drainage in peatlands therefore we also define the marginal abatement cost of sediment reduction for the analytical derivation of the abatement cost function see appendix a we estimate the marginal abatement costs of sediment for both overland flow fields and sedimentation ponds as both are used to decrease sediment transport in peatland forestry sediment loads are assumed to be caused only by ditch cleaning and the loads are based on the average loads in finland 2 however here we double these loads because it is not realistic to assess the efficiency of sediment ponds with average loads this is because they are efficient in reducing sediment loads only from larger than average input loads at about 10 000 kg ha 1 year 1 60 for overland flow fields table 3 shows that the marginal abatement costs of sediment are 0 002 kg 1 when the reduction target is set to 20 and the interest rate is 2 the marginal abatement costs increase to 0 011 kg 1 when the reduction target is set as 55 for using a sedimentation pond as a water protection measure in conjunction with ditch cleaning the marginal abatement costs of sediment are 0 015 kg 1 when the sediment reduction is set to 20 they increase to 0 048 kg 1 when the target level for sediment reduction is increased to 55 thus the marginal abatement costs of sediment retention are significantly lower for overland flow fields than for sedimentation ponds fig 7 provides a graphical illustration of the marginal abatement costs of overland flow fields and sedimentation bonds the marginal abatement costs are rather small for both when the sediment abatement increases the difference between the marginal abatement costs increases the marginal abatement cost functions using an overland flow field f and a sedimentation pond p as water protection measures as a function of sediment abatement u are 16 m a c f 4 0 10 11 u 2 6 6 10 7 u 0 005 17 m a c p 1 4 10 11 u 2 1 8 10 6 u 0 001 table b 2 in appendix b presents the sensitivity analysis and shows that an overland flow field also provides lower marginal costs when the establishment costs are increased or decreased by 25 we have now derived the marginal abatement costs of nutrients and sediments for forestry we next put the defined marginal abatement costs of nutrients into action and examine how a cost effective water protection policy in a river basin would look buffer strips and restrictions on nitrogen fertilization in agriculture as water protection measures are included in the model for forestry we include the use of buffer zones in mineral soils and overland flow fields in peatlands in the analysis 4 the river basin model we consider a river running into the baltic sea where agriculture and forestry are sources of nutrient loads through the river to the sea for modeling we choose the river temmesjoki located in northern ostrobothnia and running into the bothnian sea a subregion of the baltic sea the water quality in the bothnian sea is better than that in many other subregions of the baltic sea but nevertheless it suffers from eutrophication caused by excess nutrient loads we first sketch the cost effectiveness conditions of the river basin model and then apply the marginal abatement curves in forestry and those in agriculture 4 1 the cost effectiveness conditions let the length of the river from its mouth to the head be t the distance of each location from the river head is denoted by i i 1 7 nitrogen and phosphorus loads from agriculture and forestry degrade in the stream before entering the sea according to the average degradation rate δ i this rate indicates the share of nutrient loads from the source entering the sea depending on location i thus 0 δ i 1 the water quality is monitored at the river mouth the nitrogen equivalent load ne to the sea before abatement is e i j and abatement at the source is denoted by a i j where j 1 2 3 defines agricultural land mineral soil forests and peatland forests respectively thus the nutrient load at the river mouth z r r refers to the loads at the river mouth is 18 z r i 1 7 j 1 3 δ i e i j a i j let z r denote the upper limit on the nutrient load into the baltic sea and the total abatement costs be c i j a i j then the economic problem of the social planner is to minimize the sum of the total abatement costs subject to the imposed upper limit on the nutrient loads the lagrangian function for the constrained minimization problem is 19 l i 1 7 j 1 3 c i j a i j μ i 1 7 j 1 3 δ i e i j a i j z r the first order conditions are as follows 20 l a i j c i j a i j μ δ i 0 21 l μ i 1 7 j 1 3 δ i e i j a i j z r 0 the shadow price associated with the constraint is μ the marginal abatement cost is c i j a i j from equation 20 for any two sources j 1 2 the cost effective solution requires that 22 c i 1 a i 1 δ i c i 2 a i 2 δ i μ this condition simply requires that the marginal abatement costs weighted by the share with which each source pollutes the sea should be equal between polluters in other words the marginal costs from reducing pollution at the river mouth must be equal 4 2 a numerical application to the river temmesjoki the length of the river temmesjoki is 73 km and the catchment size is 1145 km2 open gis data from the finnish environment institute 61 natural resources institute finland 62 and national land survey of finland 63 was used to divide the river into 7 locations 10 km each along the river and estimate the areas of agriculture and forestry separately for mineral soils and peatlands in each location unlike in agriculture management measures are not conducted every year in forestry we thus needed to estimate the areas of annual clear cuts in minerals soils and the annual ditch cleaning operations and clear cuts in peatlands the different management cycles in agriculture annual management measures and forestry infrequent measures imply that agricultural land provides a significantly larger area for water protection annually than does forest land at approximately 16 438 ha agriculture versus 255 ha forestry 14 14 our gis analysis showed that the forest area in the river temmesjoki catchment was 80 835 ha and the share of mineral soil forests was 45 of the forest area based on these estimates and statistics on clear cut areas and forest land areas in northern ostrobothnia from the year 2016 we estimated that 0 52 of the mineral soils are clear cut annually in the river temmesjoki catchment similarly based on statistics on ditch cleaning and peatland areas in northern ostrobothnia ditch cleaning is estimated to be conducted on 0 2 of the peatlands 43 and here we assume that the same area is clear cut at the end of the rotation period in the river temmesjoki previous literature on cost effectiveness in water protection also covers different sectors the marginal costs of reducing nitrogen and phosphorus in agriculture water treatment plants atmospheric deposits and wetlands were quantified by gren et al 64 turner et al 65 helin et al 66 lankoski and ollikainen 17 hautakangas et al 16 helin 18 and lötjönen and ollikainen 20 iho 67 studied the cost effectiveness of water protection measures to reduce the phosphorus load in agriculture nitrogen abatement in agriculture is included in the studies by laukkanen and nauges 19 68 in the baltic sea scale gren et al 69 elofsson 70 gren and elofsson 71 and wulff et al 72 estimated the minimum cost solutions and cost effectiveness for reaching specified nutrient reduction targets and hautakangas and ollikainen 73 studied nutrient trading between wastewater treatment plants we develop the marginal abatement costs of nutrients in agriculture using data from lötjönen and ollikainen 74 15 15 data from lötjönen and ollikainen 74 is presented in appendix c except that we convert the prices and costs to the 2016 price level 44 the phosphorus load is again converted to nitrogen equivalents ne the marginal abatement costs of nutrients in agriculture are presented in fig 8 it shows that the marginal abatement costs of nutrients increase with the load reduction target but strongly only after the target implies a 20 reduction where the nutrient reduction ne is over 5 kg ha the choices of buffer strips and fertilizer input as well as costs are reported in more detail in appendix c in table c 1 the marginal abatement cost function for agriculture a as a function of the nutrient abatement a is given by 22a m a c a 0 1018 a 2 0 0457 a we next assume that overland flow fields can be used as a water protection measure for 50 of the ditch cleaning and clear cut areas in the drained peatlands for many reasons it is often unfeasible to construct an overland flow field downstream from a peatland drainage area 3 we use an estimate of 0 003 as the rate of nutrient degradation along the river 34 the cost effective solution is solved subject to the nutrient reduction target at the river mouth which is set either to 10 or 30 from the baseline condition with no water protection the model was solved with excel solver the levels of marginal abatement costs μ when the nutrient reduction target is set to 10 and 30 are 0 53 kg 1 and 5 67 kg 1 respectively we report the key results in table 4 including locations source based loads total loads and reductions under the targeted reduction rates the highest nutrient reductions in the cost effective solution are in agriculture given that the marginal abatement costs of nutrients using buffer zones in mineral soil forests are high table 1 their role is minor in the cost effective solution if the nutrient reduction target is set as 10 the overall nutrient reduction in the catchment is 39 690 kg ne with agriculture accounting for approximately 38 643 kg ne 97 and forestry 1047 kg ne 3 if the target rises to 30 the total nutrient reduction increases to 119 070 kg ne of which agriculture accounts for 118 010 kg ne 99 and forestry 1060 kg ne 1 table 5 shows the costs of nutrient reductions and the sizes of the different water protection measures when the target level varies from 10 to 30 with the 10 reduction target the size of the buffer strips in agriculture varies from 0 04 to 0 07 of the land area the nitrogen fertilizer application rate in agriculture varies only slightly from 120 6 kg ha 1 to 121 2 kg ha 1 in forestry on mineral soils no buffer zones are used due to their high abatement costs in peatland forestry the size of the overland flow field varies from 0 08 to 0 21 of the total peatland catchment area under the 30 reduction target the size of the buffer strip in agriculture is between 1 05 and 1 59 of the land area the nitrogen fertilizer level varies from 110 2 kg ha 1 to 112 5 kg ha 1 despite increased targets no buffer zones are used in mineral soil forests the size of the overland flow field varies from 0 08 to 0 22 of the total catchment area these results are as expected as the marginal abatement cost of nutrients for overland flow fields are the lowest and the marginal abatement costs of nutrients for buffer zones in mineral soil forestry are the highest out of these three water protection measures at the same time agricultural land provides a much larger area for water protection than do forest areas when the nutrient reduction target is set at 10 the total cost of nutrient reduction is 6124 the share of agriculture is 6057 99 and that of forestry is 67 1 with forestry sector portion consisting almost entirely of costs in peatland forests when the nutrient reduction target is set higher at 30 the total cost of nutrient reductions increases to 216 196 the share of agriculture is 216 121 99 97 and that of forestry is 76 0 03 5 discussion and conclusions we examined the analytical features of the marginal abatement cost functions of three water protection measures buffer zones in mineral soil forests and overland flow fields and sedimentation ponds in peatland forestry we used finnish data to numerically estimate the marginal abatement costs of these measures for nutrient and sediment reductions the marginal abatement costs of nutrients were put into action in a river basin model designed for analysis of the cost effective abatement solution with agriculture and forestry as polluting sectors to our knowledge this is the first study on the marginal abatement costs of nutrients and sediment using different water protection measures in peatland and mineral soil forests interestingly our study is timely as recent results suggest that forestry may be a significantly higher source of nutrients and sediments to watercourses than previously estimated particularly in peatland dominated regions such as finland 4 37 75 our results show that there is a need for abatement actions in forestry even though agriculture carries the main share of abatement efforts our main findings concerning the nutrient abatement costs can be condensed as follows buffer zones in mineral soils are very expensive measures with the marginal costs of nutrients ranging from 470 kg 1 ne to 2472 kg 1 ne when the nutrient reduction target is 10 and 30 respectively in contrast the marginal abatement costs of nutrients using overland flow fields in peatlands are rather low ranging from 0 02 kg 1 ne at the 10 level to 0 04 kg 1 ne when abatement is 30 and the interest rate is 2 how do these costs compare with costs in agriculture or in point sources finnish studies on the marginal abatement costs of nitrogen in the agricultural sector are summarized by ollikainen et al 76 the marginal abatement costs of nitrogen in agriculture in the study by lankoski and ollikainen 17 varied from 4 4 to 15 2 kg 1 n when the nitrogen reduction target was increased from 10 to 30 in the case of wastewater treatment plants hautakangas et al 16 the marginal abatement costs of nitrogen varied between 7 6 and 11 7 kg 1 n when the nitrogen reduction target was similarly increased between 10 and 30 from the baseline level with a 4 real interest rate additionally in studies by helin et al 66 and helin 18 the marginal abatement costs of nitrogen in agriculture range from 7 0 to 24 8 kg 1 n thus our results indicate that the marginal abatement costs of nutrients in mineral soil forests using buffer zones are considerably higher than those in agriculture and wastewater treatment plants in contrast the marginal abatement costs of nutrients using overland flow fields in peatland forestry are much lower than those in agriculture and wastewater treatment plants lauren et al 21 calculated estimates of the unit costs of nitrogen reduction with different intensities of harvesting in the buffer zone area and found that the unit costs of nitrogen reduction were between 219 and 1578 kg 1 n without any harvesting in the buffer zone area the unit costs of nitrogen reduction were between 634 and 1578 kg 1 n although lauren et al 21 estimated the unit costs of nitrogen reduction rather than the marginal abatement costs this study confirms our finding that reducing nutrient exports in mineral soil forests using buffer zones is significantly more expensive than reducing nutrient exports in other polluting sectors the numerical results also showed that the marginal abatement costs of sediment reduction are significantly higher when using sedimentation ponds compared to overland flow fields as a water protection measure in conjunction with ditch cleaning in peatland forests we thus recommend the use of overland flow fields as the water protection measure in ditch cleaning instead of sedimentation ponds however a major limitation in their use is that creating an overland flow field by restoring a small section of drained peatland area results in the water table rising not only in the overland flow itself but also in the upstream area potentially decreasing tree growth there the river basin model showed that when the four water protection measures buffer strips and restrictions on nitrogen fertilizer in agriculture buffer zones in mineral soil forests and overland flow fields in drained peatlands are included in the same cost effective framework the highest nutrient ne reductions in the cost effective solution are made in agriculture a cost effective allocation of abatement measures entails that the nutrient reduction portions of the overall nutrient reduction are 3 1 in forestry and 97 99 in agriculture when the reduction target is set as 10 30 we find that databases concerning the detailed costs of work items in preparing overflow fields and sedimentation ponds are still scarce and additional data would be valuable furthermore more research on the ability of the measures to reduce both nutrients and sediments is clearly needed in the future it is also important to assess whether permanent like water protection structures would be needed in peatland forests similar to mandatory buffer strips in agriculture current practice in forestry focuses on the use of water protection measures only infrequently recent studies indicate high chronic nitrogen and phosphorus exports from drained peatland forests even when there have been no recent forest operations 37 75 these exports are likely to constitute the bulk of nutrient exports from forest land in peatland dominated regions if water protection structures were used continuously in peatland forests forested areas would provide a much larger area for water protection than estimated in our river basin model this would result in fundamental changes in cost

8693,the european water framework directive wfd strongly emphasizes that all water polluting sectors must enhance the protection of water bodies in a cost effective way river basin management plans need to be made to achieve a good environmental status for all water bodies by 2027 at the latest this article examines three principal water protection measures used in forestry buffer zones overland flow fields and sedimentation ponds we analytically develop marginal abatement cost functions for each of these measures and apply them numerically for the finnish forestry we find that the marginal abatement costs of nutrients using buffer zones in clear cut mineral soil forests are very high as they entail leaving financially mature and uncut trees in contrast the marginal costs of using overland flow fields in conjunction with ditch cleaning and clear cutting in peatlands are very low furthermore for sediments using overland flow fields as a water protection measure entails significantly lower abatement costs than does using sedimentation ponds in conjunction with ditch cleaning in peatland forests a cost effective solution in a river basin entails that the highest nutrient reductions are made in agriculture but that forestry also does its share a cost effective allocation of abatement measures entails that the proportions of the overall nutrient reduction are 3 1 in forestry and 97 99 in agriculture when the reduction target is set as 10 30 keywords ditch cleaning clear cutting nutrient load sediment load buffer zone overland flow field 1 introduction the european water framework directive wfd requires that member states take actions to reach good environmental status of all water bodies by 2027 at the latest the key tools for achieving this goal are river basin management plans in these plans member states design actions and policies requiring all polluting sectors to reduce their effluents the allocation of nutrient reductions between sectors should follow the principle of cost effectiveness which means achieving the required reduction of nutrient loading with minimum costs in its simplest form cost effectiveness requires that the marginal abatement costs of different sectors and agents are equalized for any target level of water quality for regional pollutants such as nutrients in waterways this rule is modified into a requirement that the marginal abatement costs of reducing pollution at any given receptor point are equalized between all polluters thus one must account for the transfer of nutrients from the source to the receptor points 1 the main polluting sectors in finland are agriculture and municipal waste waters the current estimate of the forestry induced nitrogen load is 1600 mg year 1 and the phosphorus load is 130 mg year 1 they constitute only approximately 5 of the total load of nitrogen and 8 of the total phosphorus load in finland 2 recent studies by nieminen et al 3 indicate however that peatlands drained for forestry 5 mha or 20 of the land cover provide significantly larger nitrogen and phosphorus loads than do pristine peatlands thus forestry may account for a 10 to 15 times larger proportion of the total loads than previously estimated 4 furthermore in finland forestry is an exceptionally high source of sediments due to forest drainage in peatlands the main sources of nutrient and sediment loads from forest management are clear cutting site preparation fertilization and ditching e g 5 6 7 while in mineral soils the source of the nutrient load is predominantly clear cutting ditch cleaning and clear cuts are the sources of the nutrient and sediment loads in drained peatland forests a typical water protection measure in mineral soils is the use of buffer zones which are unharvested land areas between the clear cut area and waterway 5 8 9 in peatlands sedimentation ponds overland flow fields and other measures such as sedimentation pits and ditch breaks are used to mitigate increased loading e g 10 11 12 13 14 15 for well designed river basin management plans the member states need information on nutrient reduction costs in forestry in the same manner as provided for instance in wastewater treatment plants 16 or agriculture 17 19 or 20 this helps in comparing the marginal abatement costs in forestry with those in other polluting sectors unfortunately well developed estimates of marginal abatement costs for forestry are missing making designing cost effective policies difficult the aim of our study is to fill this gap in the knowledge and to develop marginal abatement costs of the three most frequently applied water protection measures in forestry buffer zones sedimentation ponds and overland flow fields to our knowledge this study is the first of its kind in forest economics given that forest management decisions relating harvesting and water protection are made infrequently over tens of years in boreal forests we do not start with bare land but instead postulate an initial stand and let the forest landowner decide upon forest management and harvesting as well as water protection measures we derive the analytical features of marginal abatement cost functions in forestry and then apply them numerically using finnish data on forest management focusing on water protection measures we define the marginal abatement costs of water protection measures in forestry at the time when these measures are implemented we then put the derived marginal abatement cost functions in action and examine how to allocate abatement in a cost effective way between agriculture and forestry the model comprises both nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus the comparison of the marginal abatement costs of nutrients in forestry to the respective costs in other sectors especially in agriculture provides a special challenge because the management decisions in forestry and agriculture differ unlike in forestry in agriculture most water protection measures are chosen every year as a part of cultivation decisions furthermore the nutrient and sediment loads from single harvesting or ditching decisions may last even longer than ten years 2 while in agriculture most nutrient loads depend mainly on annual decisions nevertheless the approach taken in deriving the marginal abatement costs provides an adequate basis for the allocation of water protection measures between agriculture and forestry as we solve the cost efficient solution for agriculture and for annually harvested or treated forest land the only previous study resembling our research is by lauren et al 21 who calculated the unit cost of nitrogen reduction using buffer zones to our knowledge there are no earlier studies on the marginal abatement costs of reducing sediment loads in forestry previous economic studies focusing on forestry and water protection from viewpoints other than cost effectiveness are found in miller and everett 22 matero 23 25 matero and saastamoinen 26 creedy and wurzbacher 27 sun 28 eriksson 29 miettinen et al 30 and hökkä et al 31 our approach follows that of miettinen et al 30 32 who were the first to include nutrient load damage in the faustmann rotation model analyses focusing on the cost effectiveness of non point source pollution in river basins in finland are scarce the cost effective reduction of phosphorus discharging from agricultural land forestry land scattered settlements and peat mining at the catchment scale was analyzed by hjerppe and väisänen 33 lankoski et al 34 used a river basin model to analyze trading between point and non point sources but they did not include forestry in their analysis the rest of the study is organized as follows first we analytically present the marginal abatement cost functions for water protection measures used in forestry second we provide the numerical marginal abatement costs at various levels of nutrients and sediment abatement in forestry third based on the marginal abatement cost functions of nutrients we develop a river basin application and analyze the cost effective solution including agriculture and forestry as polluting sectors 2 marginal abatement functions of water protection measures for forestry the marginal abatement cost function describes how abatement costs increase when abatement is increased by one unit we focus on water protection measures to reduce nutrient loads from clear cuts in mineral soils buffer zones and ditch cleaning and clear cuts in drained peatland forests overland flow fields we restrict our analysis to short term marginal abatement costs meaning that we consider one rotation period 2 1 marginal abatement costs of nutrients in mineral soils consider an even aged stand of trees growing on mineral soil adjoining a watercourse let the initial stand age be a the stand is clear cut and a buffer zone is left between the clear cut area and the downstream watercourse a buffer zone is often left uncut but partial harvesting is also possible 1 1 in finland the national forest laws and forest certification system ffcs allows partial harvesting in the buffer zone the fsc certification system requires that the buffer zone is left unmanaged we assume that no trees are harvested from the buffer zone the time of clear cutting at the end of the rotation period is denoted by t and the length of time until clear cutting is t a the growth function is denoted by f t a let the timber price be p and the real interest rate be r we denote the share of the buffer zone relative to the total forest stand area as m in the absence of water protection the harvest revenue under the given rotation age is p f t a and under the established buffer zone it is 1 m p f t a indicating that the buffer zone decreases the harvested forest area and that the lost harvest revenue constitutes the abatement costs of buffer zones as a function of the nutrient reduction target the nutrient load from a clear cut area starts after clear cutting and the loading is assumed to last for a fixed period of time x years the nutrient load after clear cutting h s is a function of time s the buffer zone fixes nutrients released from the clear cut area into the zone and we express the share of the nutrient load reduction as a function of the size of the buffer zone by g m which is a concave function in m g m 0 but g m m 0 indicating that the buffer zone has a decreasing ability to fix nutrients thus the reduction of nutrients is given by g m h s we assume that the forest landowner focuses on the sum of the nutrient loads from years after clear cutting because controlling annual loads is not feasible in practice as a buffer zone is established once and becomes permanent thus we integrate over time to sum the nutrient loads and let z m denote the upper limit on nutrient loads set by society such that the periodic loads from clear cutting cannot exceed it z m 0 x 1 g m h s subscript m refers to mineral soils then the objective of the landowner is to choose the optimal single rotation period and the optimal size of the buffer zone to maximize the harvest revenue subject to the constraint on the upper limit on emissions m a x 1 m p f t a e r t a s t z m 0 x 1 g m h s this constrained optimization problem is conveniently solved by forming a lagrangian function l where the lagrangian multiplier λ links the objective function and the constraint thus providing the shadow price of the environmental quality the lagrangian function is as follows 2 2 formulation of the problem in equation 1 means that the nutrient load constraint is binding at the time of the clear cutting alternatively the lagrangian function could be formulated as l 1 m p f t a e r t a λ z m 0 x 1 g m h s e r t a when the nutrient load constraint is binding at all periods of time and the present value of future nutrient loads is not allowed to exceed the constraint when the problem is formulated as in equation 1 the nutrient load reduction is reached using only the buffer zone the alternative formulation of the problem means that both postponing rotation age and the buffer zone can be used to decrease the nutrient loads from clear cutting in both cases the lambda is a function of the same parameters 1 l 1 m p f t a e r t a λ z m 0 x 1 g m h s e r t a the choice of the optimal rotation period and the size of the buffer zone can be characterized by the following first order conditions 2 l t 1 m p f t t a r p f t a r λ z m 0 x 1 g m h s 0 3 l m p f t a λ 0 x g m m h s 0 4 l λ z m 0 x 1 g m h s 0 from equation 3 we obtain p f t a λ 0 x g m m h s and substituting in 2 gives λ p f t t a r 0 x g m m h s 0 thus lambda is positive and indicates the marginal abatement cost at the given upper limit on loads this marginal abatement cost depends on the ratio of the marginal harvest revenue lost by increasing the size of the buffer zone by one unit over the marginal reduction in nutrient loading equation 4 simply requires that the upper limit on the nutrient load is binding that is the loads are equal to the limit 0 x 1 g m h s z m by equation 4 equation 2 shows that the optimal rotation age is determined independently of the nutrient load constraint and the buffer zone size the second order conditions for the problem hold and are given in appendix a thus we can use comparative statics to examine how exogenous variables impact the optimal rotation age the size of the buffer zone and the marginal costs of establishing it first we have that m z m 0 and λ z m 0 indicating that an increase in the upper limit on the nutrient load allows higher loads and decreases the buffer zone and the marginal abatement costs of nutrients the effect of the upper limit of the nutrient load on the optimal rotation age is ambiguous for an increase in timber price we have that t p 0 m p 0 and λ p 0 thus the impact of the timber price on the optimal rotation age is conventional a higher timber price does not change the size of the buffer zone because the upper limit on the nutrient load is binding and the size of the buffer zone cannot be changed instead a higher timber price increases the marginal abatement costs finally t r 0 m r 0 and λ r 0 similar to the case for the timber price the effect of the real interest rate on the optimal rotation age is conventional and it does not have any impact on the optimal size of the buffer zone however a higher interest rate decreases the optimal marginal abatement costs of nutrients as seen from the above definition of lambda as the marginal benefit of increasing the size of the buffer zone by one unit increases the optimal marginal abatement costs of nutrients decrease in summary the marginal abatement cost function is defined by m a c λ z m p r for given timber prices and real interest rates the mac curve increases as the upper limit on the nutrient load tightens note finally that under some regularity assumptions the cost functions represent the underlying production technology 35 so that these functions can be applied to guide the choice of water protection measures in the river basin model in section 4 2 2 marginal abatement costs of mitigating nutrient exports in drained peatland forests consider now a forest stand on a peatland adjoining a watercourse stand management requires ditch cleaning because the drainage capacity of the ditches weakens over time and seriously reduces the growth of the stand 3 3 the analysis starts at the time of ditch cleaning thus if there is any harvesting before ditch cleaning such as harvesting of trees alongside ditches to enable ditch cleaning with an excavator it is not considered in our model ditch cleaning causes nutrient loading which is expected to last for approximately 10 years 2 when the stand becomes financially mature and is harvested clear cutting is an additional source of nutrient loads an overland flow field is used as a water protection measure to reduce the nutrient loads from ditch cleaning and clear cutting overland flow fields are pristine or restored mires over which the discharge waters from the upstream drained catchment are conveyed 36 37 suppose again that the forest landowner has an initial stand of age a the time of clear cutting is denoted by t and the length of time until clear cutting is t a forest growth depends also on the ditch cleaning effort n ditch cleaning is performed at time a after the first commercial thinning of the stand and the growth function is denoted by f t a n 38 39 4 4 chang 38 maximizes the land expectation value with respect to both the rotation age and the planting density amacher et al 39 examines the effects of forest productivity taxes when the landowner chooses the optimal rotation age and initial stand investment let the unit cost of ditch cleaning be w while γ denotes the unit cost of the overland flow field the size of the overland flow field is denoted by b and the upper limit on the loads is z p subscript p refers to peatlands the nutrient loading from ditch cleaning is k d s n and that after the clear cut is k c s n nutrient loading from both sources is assumed to last for the same x years and we again integrate over time to sum the nutrient loads for years following the forest management methods the nutrient reduction as function of the size of the overland flow field is g b we assume that this function is concave in b with a positive first and negative second derivative the overland flow field is established at the time of ditch cleaning but its size is chosen by also accounting for loading after the clear cut at the end of the rotation period thus the reduction of nutrients from both sources as a share of the original load is defined as g b k d s n and g b k c s n respectively the net harvest revenue is given by p f t a n e r t a w n γ b the forest manager maximizes net harvest revenue by choosing the rotation age under technologically fixed ditching and the size of the overland flow field subject to the constraint on the upper limit of the nutrient load thus the economic problem of the landowner over one rotation period is m a x p f t a n e r t a w n γ b s t z p 0 x 1 g b k d s n 0 x 1 g b k c s n e r t a recall that the loads from ditch cleaning start immediately but loading from clear cutting starts naturally after the cutting therefore the latter term is discounted the lagrangian function l of the problem reads 5 l p f t a n e r t a w n γ b λ z p 0 x 1 g b k d s n 0 x 1 g b k c s n e r t a the first order conditions of the maximization problem can be expressed as follows 6 l t p f t t a n r p f t a n λ r 0 x 1 g b k c s n 0 7 l b γ λ 0 x g b b k d s n 0 x g b b k c s n e r t a 0 8 l λ z p 0 x 1 g b k d s n 0 x 1 g b k c s n e r t a 0 from equation 6 the optimal time to clear cut the stand is affected in addition to the first conventional terms by the lagrangian multiplier and the interest cost term it multiplies this term tends to postpone the clear cut and the associated nutrient loading to reduce the cost of establishing the overland flow field equation 7 indicates the choice of the overland flow field area depending on the constraints on nutrient flows the unit cost is constant but the benefits from nutrient reduction depend via lambda on the tightness of the nutrient load constraint the lower this value the larger must be the size of the overflow field finally equation 8 simply requires that the constraint on the upper limit of the nutrient load is binding note that lambda is present in equations 6 and 7 it depends via 6 on the timber price and via 7 on the unit costs of the overflow field as well as on the ability of the field to reduce nutrients we cannot solve lambda explicitly but use comparative statics to examine its dependences the second order conditions of the problem are given in appendix a we assume that direct impacts dominate starting comparative statics with the constraint the upper limit on the loads we have that t z p 0 b z p 0 and λ z p 0 thus increasing the upper limit on nutrient loads prepones the optimal time of the clear cut and decreases the optimal size of the overland flow field furthermore it also decreases the marginal abatement costs of nutrients for an increase in timber price we have that t p 0 b p 0 and λ p 0 thus a higher timber price shortens the optimal time of the clear cut and increases the size of the overflow field naturally a higher timber price increases the marginal abatement costs for an increase in the unit cost of the overland flow field we have that t γ 0 b γ 0 and λ γ 0 thus an increase in the unit cost of the overland flow field postpones the optimal time of the clear cut and decreases the optimal size of the overland flow field as the unit cost of the overland flow field increases the marginal abatement costs increase finally the effects of the real interest rate on the optimal time of the clear cut the size of the overland flow field and the marginal abatement costs are ambiguous thus the marginal abatement cost of the overflow field can be expressed as m a c λ z p γ p r again for a given unit cost of the overland flow field timber prices and a real interest rate the mac curve increases as the upper limit on the nutrient loads tightens 3 a numerical application to finnish forestry and water protection based on the theoretical model we now calculate the numerical marginal abatement costs using buffer zones overland flow fields and sedimentation ponds as water protection measures the actual decision of using buffer zones as a water protection measure in mineral soil forestry is made at the time of clear cutting of the stand thus we calculate the marginal abatement costs of reducing the nutrient loads using buffer zones at the time of the clear cut which takes place at the optimal rotation age mathematica was used to calculate the marginal abatement costs 3 1 marginal abatement costs of nutrient load reduction in mineral soil forests buffer zone in our numerical model we use the growth of norway spruce in southern finland calibrated by tahvonen and salo 40 9 f t 500 1 49 e 0 048 t equation 9 represents a logistic forest growth as a function of the rotation age and produces the maximum stock by 500 m3 ha 1 the parameters in the denominator determine the rate and concavity of forest growth clear cuts in mineral soils cause both nitrogen and phosphorus loads to watercourses the nitrogen load data in the absence of a buffer zone is based on miettinen et al 30 and the phosphorus load data is derived from finér et al 2 the loads are assumed to be similar with or without any soil preparation 2 the phosphorus load is converted to nitrogen equivalents ne using the redfield ratio which is the constant ratio of nitrogen and phosphorus mass among marine plankton 41 thus the phosphorus load is multiplied by 7 2 to estimate the phosphorus load as nitrogen equivalents the nutrient load h s kg ha 1 year 1 thus consists of both the nitrogen and phosphorus loads the nitrogen retention capacity of the buffer zone was estimated by the femma model 5 5 a more detailed description of the ecohydrologic model is found in miettinen et al 30 which simulates retention when the share of the buffer zone relative to the total clear cut area changes from zero to 20 the nitrogen reduction as a share of the loads is a concave function of the size of the buffer zone m as follows 10 g m 0 4962 m 0 3983 as fig 1 shows the share of nitrogen reduction increases with the size of the buffer zone but in a decreasing fashion the exponent parameter determines the degree of concavity of the retention that is the decreasing marginal productivity of the buffer zone as there are no estimated reduction functions for phosphorus retention we use the same reduction function for phosphorus as used for nitrogen the timber price is 34 m 3 for stem wood 6 6 the timber price estimate is based on timber price statistics from the year 2016 for spruce saw logs and pulpwood the estimate is calculated as a weighted average according to the share of spruce saw logs and pulpwood measured in the national forest inventory vmi11 for finland 42 43 and the real interest rate used is 2 the time of the clear cut is set at 83 years giving a timber volume of 262 m3 ha 1 for the clear cutting the marginal abatement cost and the buffer zone size are calculated for consecutively tightening levels of the upper limit on the nutrient load the results are collected in table 1 the first two columns indicate the reduction targets based on the tightening levels of the upper limits on the nutrient load the third column gives the size of the buffer zone and the next two provide the marginal and total costs of abatement the marginal abatement costs of nutrients ne are high and increase strongly with the reduction target the reason for this effect is that leaving mature trees standing is very costly and the nutrient reductions per hectare are low the last two columns provide a generalization to the annual clear cut area in finland which was 141 044 ha in 2016 43 we use the estimate of the shoreline length per forest area 11 m ha 1 23 to estimate the total costs assuming that buffer zones are applied to all clear cut areas with shorelines 15 515 ha under the nutrient reduction target the resulting reductions in loads would be relatively small but the costs would be very high 7 7 as the calculation is based on the average value of the shoreline length per forest land area the fact that the costs of buffer zones differ between locations is not included in the estimates of the total costs fig 2 illustrates the marginal abatement cost function which is increasing and convex in abatement the marginal abatement cost function using the buffer zone b z as a water protection measure as a function of the nutrient abatement a is given by 11 m a c b z 236 77 a 2 371 79 a we provide a sensitivity analysis with respect to timber prices in appendix b in table b 1 the timber prices are changed to 25 below and above the basic run estimate 3 2 marginal abatement costs of nutrients and sediment in drained peatland forests overland flow field and sedimentation pond we next determine the marginal abatement costs of nutrients using overland flow fields as a water protection measure in peatland forestry as an additional result we also calculate the marginal abatement costs of sediments using either an overland flow field or a sedimentation pond the analytical derivation of the abatement cost function is given in appendix a sedimentation ponds are excavated in the main outlet ditch of the drainage area to slow down the flow of water and enable sedimentation 6 we postulate a catchment area of 50 ha out of which 30 15 ha is subjected to ditch cleaning after the first commercial thinning of the stand at the end of the rotation period the same area is assumed to be clear cut the average stumpage prices from regeneration felling northern ostrobothnia area in central western finland are 52 43 m 3 for saw logs and 18 10 m 3 for pulpwood 43 these prices differ from those used above for mineral soils because they are regional and relevant to peatland forestry ditch cleaning costs are 196 ha 1 43 8 8 water protection costs are excluded the cost estimate is based on statistics from the year 2014 converted to the 2016 price level 44 and the real interest rate is 2 the costs of the overland flow field are 750 ha 1 9 9 the estimated costs of the overland flow field are based on the project cost effective water protection measures by tapio ltd to this estimate we also added the value of lost land area using the bare land value of 115 ha 1 overland flow fields are established on peatlands but corresponding bare land value estimates were not available thus the value here is calculated based on the estimate for low productivity mineral soil forests in the northern ostrobothnia area in central western finland 45 the final estimate of the cost of the overland flow field was converted to 2016 prices 44 46 and the costs of the sedimentation pond 1 m 1 seppäkoski 2016 personal communication 29 january forest growth in peatlands is estimated using the motti stand simulator which predicts growth and mortality of the trees and the effects of silvicultural treatments on tree growth at the stand level under finnish conditions motti software 3 2 http www metla fi metinfo motti index en htm last accessed february 2017 see refs 47 48 for drained peatlands motti predicts both the need for ditch network maintenance and the respective growth response 49 51 we derive the forest growth functions using motti simulations and assuming ditch cleaning the stand growing on the ptkg і drained peatland site type according to laine and vasander 52 10 10 drained peatland site types according to the finnish nomenclature 52 ptkg vaccinium vitis idaea type is assumed to be dominated by scots pine and located in the commune of liminka northern ostrobothnia area in central western finland where the average temperature sum is 1045 2 d d at the beginning of the simulation the stand age was 20 years based on the drainage age i e the time elapsed since the initial drainage 11 11 the stands in the ptkg і site are not even aged in practise as there are trees born both before and after the first drainage when estimating the stand growth in peatlands motti simulator does not use the age of the trees to predict the tree growth the average stand basal area was 17 4 m2 ha 1 the stem number was 2332 stems ha 1 the basal area weighted mean diameter was 12 4 cm the dominant height was 11 4 m and the volume was 88 9 m3 ha 1 thinning ditch cleaning and clear cutting followed the finnish silvicultural recommendations 53 the nitrogen and phosphorus loads from the clear cut areas in drained peatlands and the sediment loads due to ditch cleaning are based on the average loads in finland 2 we assume that clear cuts in drained peatland forests follow the best management practices harvesting during the frozen soil period in winter and using harvest residues as mats against heavy harvesting machinery and only increase the dissolved nutrient exports in contrast to clear cuts ditch cleaning has a minor impact on dissolved nutrient exports 54 nitrogen and phosphorus loads from ditch cleaning are thus bound to the sediment loads the amount of nitrogen is estimated to be 0 666 of the sediment load and that of phosphorus is 0 1 the estimate for nitrogen is based on the average sediment nitrogen content in nieminen et al 3 and the estimate for phosphorus is derived from finér et al 2 we employ the matlab curve fitting tool to estimate the retention functions first we describe how the overland flow field retains nitrogen phosphorus and sediment from clear cuts and ditch cleaning in peatlands we assume that an overland flow field reduces only 30 of the dissolved nitrogen load caused by clear cutting in peatlands because approximately 70 of the nitrogen load from peatland clear cuts is in the form of dissolved organic nitrogen 55 and overland flow fields retain only inorganic nutrients 56 drawing on hynninen et al 15 12 12 in hynninen et al 15 the sizes of the overland flow fields varied between 0 09 and 4 88 of the catchment areas the retention function is estimated using the data where the amount of ammonium entering the overland flow field is at least 5 kg year even though the data in hynninen et al 15 is only for ammonium the function 12 is applied for both ammonium and nitrate vikman et al 14 reported similar nitrate and ammonium retentions by overland flow fields and showed that their retentions were similarly affected by overland flow field and catchment characteristics in fig 3 the share of inorganic nitrogen load reduction g b f n as a function of the size of the overland flow field b f n subscript f refers to the overland flow field and n to nitrogen is fitted to 12 g b f n 1 791 b f n 0 0656 3 158 there is no data to estimate the retention function of phosphorus loads from clear cuts we assume that clear cuts only increase dissolved nutrients and that overland flow fields retain only inorganic forms of dissolved nutrients 56 according to nieminen 57 approximately 77 of the dissolved phosphorus load from clear cuts in peatland forests is in inorganic form drawing on the average retention of dissolved inorganic phosphorus in väänänen et al 13 and silvan et al 58 we assume that overland flow fields are able to retain 77 of this load furthermore a nonlinear regression of the sediment load reduction as a function of the size of the overland flow field is based on the data by nieminen et al 12 and sallantaus et al 59 eight overland flow fields were included in the analysis and the overland flow field sizes varied from 0 05 to 4 88 of the catchment areas from fig 4 we can see that the share of the sediment load reduction g b f s as a function of the size of the overland flow field b f s subscript f refers to overland flow field and s to sediment is given by 13 g b f s 0 02437 b f s 0 4997 1 016 the overland flow field is assumed to retain sediment bound nitrogen and phosphorus similarly as sediment according to the retention function in equation 13 the retention capacity of a sediment pond is based on nieminen et al 60 13 13 the original data consisted of 37 sedimentation ponds of which 17 were excavated on erosion sensitive soils and increased rather than decreased the suspended solids concentrations the excavation of such ponds is no longer recommended the retention function in equation 14 is estimated using data from 12 sedimentation ponds which clearly decreased the sediment load and received a sediment loading of 10 000 kg year 1 60 with lower input loadings sedimentation ponds had negligible retention capacity the maximum efficiency of sedimentation ponds is approximately 55 of the sediment load further increasing the pond volume after reaching this level has very little effect on the retention as fig 5 shows the share of the sediment load reduction g b p s as a function of the pond volume b p s subscript p refers to sedimentation pond and s to sediment is 14 g b p s 0 03089 b p s 0 4625 3 2 1 marginal abatement costs of nutrients overland flow fields we include both the nitrogen and phosphorus loads from peatland clear cuts and ditch cleaning and calculate the marginal abatement costs of nutrients when the phosphorus load is included as nitrogen equivalents ne table 2 suggests that the marginal abatement costs of nutrients are 0 02 kg 1 ne when the reduction target is set to 8 and the interest rate is 2 the marginal abatement costs increase to 0 04 kg 1 ne when the reduction target is set as high as 30 a comparison to marginal abatement costs in mineral soil forestry and agriculture shows that overland flow fields in peatland forestry clearly have the lowest marginal abatement costs of nutrients fig 6 shows that the marginal abatement costs of using overland flow fields are surprisingly low albeit increasing with abatement the marginal abatement cost function of using an overland flow field f as a water protection measure as a function of abatement a is given by 15 m a c f 0 00011 a 2 0 000016 a 0 01443 3 2 2 marginal abatement costs of sediment overland flow field and sedimentation pond forestry in finland is an exceptionally high source of sediments due to forest drainage in peatlands therefore we also define the marginal abatement cost of sediment reduction for the analytical derivation of the abatement cost function see appendix a we estimate the marginal abatement costs of sediment for both overland flow fields and sedimentation ponds as both are used to decrease sediment transport in peatland forestry sediment loads are assumed to be caused only by ditch cleaning and the loads are based on the average loads in finland 2 however here we double these loads because it is not realistic to assess the efficiency of sediment ponds with average loads this is because they are efficient in reducing sediment loads only from larger than average input loads at about 10 000 kg ha 1 year 1 60 for overland flow fields table 3 shows that the marginal abatement costs of sediment are 0 002 kg 1 when the reduction target is set to 20 and the interest rate is 2 the marginal abatement costs increase to 0 011 kg 1 when the reduction target is set as 55 for using a sedimentation pond as a water protection measure in conjunction with ditch cleaning the marginal abatement costs of sediment are 0 015 kg 1 when the sediment reduction is set to 20 they increase to 0 048 kg 1 when the target level for sediment reduction is increased to 55 thus the marginal abatement costs of sediment retention are significantly lower for overland flow fields than for sedimentation ponds fig 7 provides a graphical illustration of the marginal abatement costs of overland flow fields and sedimentation bonds the marginal abatement costs are rather small for both when the sediment abatement increases the difference between the marginal abatement costs increases the marginal abatement cost functions using an overland flow field f and a sedimentation pond p as water protection measures as a function of sediment abatement u are 16 m a c f 4 0 10 11 u 2 6 6 10 7 u 0 005 17 m a c p 1 4 10 11 u 2 1 8 10 6 u 0 001 table b 2 in appendix b presents the sensitivity analysis and shows that an overland flow field also provides lower marginal costs when the establishment costs are increased or decreased by 25 we have now derived the marginal abatement costs of nutrients and sediments for forestry we next put the defined marginal abatement costs of nutrients into action and examine how a cost effective water protection policy in a river basin would look buffer strips and restrictions on nitrogen fertilization in agriculture as water protection measures are included in the model for forestry we include the use of buffer zones in mineral soils and overland flow fields in peatlands in the analysis 4 the river basin model we consider a river running into the baltic sea where agriculture and forestry are sources of nutrient loads through the river to the sea for modeling we choose the river temmesjoki located in northern ostrobothnia and running into the bothnian sea a subregion of the baltic sea the water quality in the bothnian sea is better than that in many other subregions of the baltic sea but nevertheless it suffers from eutrophication caused by excess nutrient loads we first sketch the cost effectiveness conditions of the river basin model and then apply the marginal abatement curves in forestry and those in agriculture 4 1 the cost effectiveness conditions let the length of the river from its mouth to the head be t the distance of each location from the river head is denoted by i i 1 7 nitrogen and phosphorus loads from agriculture and forestry degrade in the stream before entering the sea according to the average degradation rate δ i this rate indicates the share of nutrient loads from the source entering the sea depending on location i thus 0 δ i 1 the water quality is monitored at the river mouth the nitrogen equivalent load ne to the sea before abatement is e i j and abatement at the source is denoted by a i j where j 1 2 3 defines agricultural land mineral soil forests and peatland forests respectively thus the nutrient load at the river mouth z r r refers to the loads at the river mouth is 18 z r i 1 7 j 1 3 δ i e i j a i j let z r denote the upper limit on the nutrient load into the baltic sea and the total abatement costs be c i j a i j then the economic problem of the social planner is to minimize the sum of the total abatement costs subject to the imposed upper limit on the nutrient loads the lagrangian function for the constrained minimization problem is 19 l i 1 7 j 1 3 c i j a i j μ i 1 7 j 1 3 δ i e i j a i j z r the first order conditions are as follows 20 l a i j c i j a i j μ δ i 0 21 l μ i 1 7 j 1 3 δ i e i j a i j z r 0 the shadow price associated with the constraint is μ the marginal abatement cost is c i j a i j from equation 20 for any two sources j 1 2 the cost effective solution requires that 22 c i 1 a i 1 δ i c i 2 a i 2 δ i μ this condition simply requires that the marginal abatement costs weighted by the share with which each source pollutes the sea should be equal between polluters in other words the marginal costs from reducing pollution at the river mouth must be equal 4 2 a numerical application to the river temmesjoki the length of the river temmesjoki is 73 km and the catchment size is 1145 km2 open gis data from the finnish environment institute 61 natural resources institute finland 62 and national land survey of finland 63 was used to divide the river into 7 locations 10 km each along the river and estimate the areas of agriculture and forestry separately for mineral soils and peatlands in each location unlike in agriculture management measures are not conducted every year in forestry we thus needed to estimate the areas of annual clear cuts in minerals soils and the annual ditch cleaning operations and clear cuts in peatlands the different management cycles in agriculture annual management measures and forestry infrequent measures imply that agricultural land provides a significantly larger area for water protection annually than does forest land at approximately 16 438 ha agriculture versus 255 ha forestry 14 14 our gis analysis showed that the forest area in the river temmesjoki catchment was 80 835 ha and the share of mineral soil forests was 45 of the forest area based on these estimates and statistics on clear cut areas and forest land areas in northern ostrobothnia from the year 2016 we estimated that 0 52 of the mineral soils are clear cut annually in the river temmesjoki catchment similarly based on statistics on ditch cleaning and peatland areas in northern ostrobothnia ditch cleaning is estimated to be conducted on 0 2 of the peatlands 43 and here we assume that the same area is clear cut at the end of the rotation period in the river temmesjoki previous literature on cost effectiveness in water protection also covers different sectors the marginal costs of reducing nitrogen and phosphorus in agriculture water treatment plants atmospheric deposits and wetlands were quantified by gren et al 64 turner et al 65 helin et al 66 lankoski and ollikainen 17 hautakangas et al 16 helin 18 and lötjönen and ollikainen 20 iho 67 studied the cost effectiveness of water protection measures to reduce the phosphorus load in agriculture nitrogen abatement in agriculture is included in the studies by laukkanen and nauges 19 68 in the baltic sea scale gren et al 69 elofsson 70 gren and elofsson 71 and wulff et al 72 estimated the minimum cost solutions and cost effectiveness for reaching specified nutrient reduction targets and hautakangas and ollikainen 73 studied nutrient trading between wastewater treatment plants we develop the marginal abatement costs of nutrients in agriculture using data from lötjönen and ollikainen 74 15 15 data from lötjönen and ollikainen 74 is presented in appendix c except that we convert the prices and costs to the 2016 price level 44 the phosphorus load is again converted to nitrogen equivalents ne the marginal abatement costs of nutrients in agriculture are presented in fig 8 it shows that the marginal abatement costs of nutrients increase with the load reduction target but strongly only after the target implies a 20 reduction where the nutrient reduction ne is over 5 kg ha the choices of buffer strips and fertilizer input as well as costs are reported in more detail in appendix c in table c 1 the marginal abatement cost function for agriculture a as a function of the nutrient abatement a is given by 22a m a c a 0 1018 a 2 0 0457 a we next assume that overland flow fields can be used as a water protection measure for 50 of the ditch cleaning and clear cut areas in the drained peatlands for many reasons it is often unfeasible to construct an overland flow field downstream from a peatland drainage area 3 we use an estimate of 0 003 as the rate of nutrient degradation along the river 34 the cost effective solution is solved subject to the nutrient reduction target at the river mouth which is set either to 10 or 30 from the baseline condition with no water protection the model was solved with excel solver the levels of marginal abatement costs μ when the nutrient reduction target is set to 10 and 30 are 0 53 kg 1 and 5 67 kg 1 respectively we report the key results in table 4 including locations source based loads total loads and reductions under the targeted reduction rates the highest nutrient reductions in the cost effective solution are in agriculture given that the marginal abatement costs of nutrients using buffer zones in mineral soil forests are high table 1 their role is minor in the cost effective solution if the nutrient reduction target is set as 10 the overall nutrient reduction in the catchment is 39 690 kg ne with agriculture accounting for approximately 38 643 kg ne 97 and forestry 1047 kg ne 3 if the target rises to 30 the total nutrient reduction increases to 119 070 kg ne of which agriculture accounts for 118 010 kg ne 99 and forestry 1060 kg ne 1 table 5 shows the costs of nutrient reductions and the sizes of the different water protection measures when the target level varies from 10 to 30 with the 10 reduction target the size of the buffer strips in agriculture varies from 0 04 to 0 07 of the land area the nitrogen fertilizer application rate in agriculture varies only slightly from 120 6 kg ha 1 to 121 2 kg ha 1 in forestry on mineral soils no buffer zones are used due to their high abatement costs in peatland forestry the size of the overland flow field varies from 0 08 to 0 21 of the total peatland catchment area under the 30 reduction target the size of the buffer strip in agriculture is between 1 05 and 1 59 of the land area the nitrogen fertilizer level varies from 110 2 kg ha 1 to 112 5 kg ha 1 despite increased targets no buffer zones are used in mineral soil forests the size of the overland flow field varies from 0 08 to 0 22 of the total catchment area these results are as expected as the marginal abatement cost of nutrients for overland flow fields are the lowest and the marginal abatement costs of nutrients for buffer zones in mineral soil forestry are the highest out of these three water protection measures at the same time agricultural land provides a much larger area for water protection than do forest areas when the nutrient reduction target is set at 10 the total cost of nutrient reduction is 6124 the share of agriculture is 6057 99 and that of forestry is 67 1 with forestry sector portion consisting almost entirely of costs in peatland forests when the nutrient reduction target is set higher at 30 the total cost of nutrient reductions increases to 216 196 the share of agriculture is 216 121 99 97 and that of forestry is 76 0 03 5 discussion and conclusions we examined the analytical features of the marginal abatement cost functions of three water protection measures buffer zones in mineral soil forests and overland flow fields and sedimentation ponds in peatland forestry we used finnish data to numerically estimate the marginal abatement costs of these measures for nutrient and sediment reductions the marginal abatement costs of nutrients were put into action in a river basin model designed for analysis of the cost effective abatement solution with agriculture and forestry as polluting sectors to our knowledge this is the first study on the marginal abatement costs of nutrients and sediment using different water protection measures in peatland and mineral soil forests interestingly our study is timely as recent results suggest that forestry may be a significantly higher source of nutrients and sediments to watercourses than previously estimated particularly in peatland dominated regions such as finland 4 37 75 our results show that there is a need for abatement actions in forestry even though agriculture carries the main share of abatement efforts our main findings concerning the nutrient abatement costs can be condensed as follows buffer zones in mineral soils are very expensive measures with the marginal costs of nutrients ranging from 470 kg 1 ne to 2472 kg 1 ne when the nutrient reduction target is 10 and 30 respectively in contrast the marginal abatement costs of nutrients using overland flow fields in peatlands are rather low ranging from 0 02 kg 1 ne at the 10 level to 0 04 kg 1 ne when abatement is 30 and the interest rate is 2 how do these costs compare with costs in agriculture or in point sources finnish studies on the marginal abatement costs of nitrogen in the agricultural sector are summarized by ollikainen et al 76 the marginal abatement costs of nitrogen in agriculture in the study by lankoski and ollikainen 17 varied from 4 4 to 15 2 kg 1 n when the nitrogen reduction target was increased from 10 to 30 in the case of wastewater treatment plants hautakangas et al 16 the marginal abatement costs of nitrogen varied between 7 6 and 11 7 kg 1 n when the nitrogen reduction target was similarly increased between 10 and 30 from the baseline level with a 4 real interest rate additionally in studies by helin et al 66 and helin 18 the marginal abatement costs of nitrogen in agriculture range from 7 0 to 24 8 kg 1 n thus our results indicate that the marginal abatement costs of nutrients in mineral soil forests using buffer zones are considerably higher than those in agriculture and wastewater treatment plants in contrast the marginal abatement costs of nutrients using overland flow fields in peatland forestry are much lower than those in agriculture and wastewater treatment plants lauren et al 21 calculated estimates of the unit costs of nitrogen reduction with different intensities of harvesting in the buffer zone area and found that the unit costs of nitrogen reduction were between 219 and 1578 kg 1 n without any harvesting in the buffer zone area the unit costs of nitrogen reduction were between 634 and 1578 kg 1 n although lauren et al 21 estimated the unit costs of nitrogen reduction rather than the marginal abatement costs this study confirms our finding that reducing nutrient exports in mineral soil forests using buffer zones is significantly more expensive than reducing nutrient exports in other polluting sectors the numerical results also showed that the marginal abatement costs of sediment reduction are significantly higher when using sedimentation ponds compared to overland flow fields as a water protection measure in conjunction with ditch cleaning in peatland forests we thus recommend the use of overland flow fields as the water protection measure in ditch cleaning instead of sedimentation ponds however a major limitation in their use is that creating an overland flow field by restoring a small section of drained peatland area results in the water table rising not only in the overland flow itself but also in the upstream area potentially decreasing tree growth there the river basin model showed that when the four water protection measures buffer strips and restrictions on nitrogen fertilizer in agriculture buffer zones in mineral soil forests and overland flow fields in drained peatlands are included in the same cost effective framework the highest nutrient ne reductions in the cost effective solution are made in agriculture a cost effective allocation of abatement measures entails that the nutrient reduction portions of the overall nutrient reduction are 3 1 in forestry and 97 99 in agriculture when the reduction target is set as 10 30 we find that databases concerning the detailed costs of work items in preparing overflow fields and sedimentation ponds are still scarce and additional data would be valuable furthermore more research on the ability of the measures to reduce both nutrients and sediments is clearly needed in the future it is also important to assess whether permanent like water protection structures would be needed in peatland forests similar to mandatory buffer strips in agriculture current practice in forestry focuses on the use of water protection measures only infrequently recent studies indicate high chronic nitrogen and phosphorus exports from drained peatland forests even when there have been no recent forest operations 37 75 these exports are likely to constitute the bulk of nutrient exports from forest land in peatland dominated regions if water protection structures were used continuously in peatland forests forested areas would provide a much larger area for water protection than estimated in our river basin model this would result in fundamental changes in cost

8694,basin wide planning requires tools and strategies that allow comparison of alternative pathways and priorities at relevant spatial and temporal scales in this paper we apply a hydroeconomic model the western nepal energy water model that better accounts for feedbacks between water and energy markets to optimize water allocations across energy agriculture municipal and environmental sectors the model maximizes total economic benefits accounting for trade offs both within and across sectors in western nepal we find that surface water availability is generally sufficient to meet existing and growing demands in energy and agricultural sectors however expansion of water storage and irrigation infrastructure may limit environmental flows below levels needed to maintain the full integrity of important aquatic ecosystems we also find substantial trade offs between irrigation in nepal and satisfaction of the institutional requirements implied by international water use agreements with the downstream riparian india similar trade offs do not exist with hydropower however model results and allocations are sensitive to future domestic and international energy demands and valuations keywords ecosystem integrity economic optimization development priorities water resources planning hydropower irrigation 1 introduction in underdeveloped countries rich in water resources the harnessing of water for productive uses creates opportunities for economic development water resources provide options for energy generation agricultural production industrial development and navigation importantly though these various productive uses often entail complex and inter sectoral trade offs including with nonmarket purposes such as support of basic livelihoods activities and environmental conservation for example water stored and released for steady electricity generation may conflict with release patterns desired by irrigators 1 waterways preserved for navigation or ecosystem services may be ill suited for infrastructure development 2 3 export focused production may discount or disregard local resource dependence 4 and upstream abstractions may threaten the water security of downstream users 5 6 development of water resources has often been considered a threat to environmental quality and many argue that environmental costs are too often ignored 7 8 the possibility of acute resource use trade offs highlights the need for careful consideration of competing water demands within a given river system using appropriate tools without such tools inefficient decision making in terms of infrastructure choices institutional pressures and sectoral prioritization appears likely for several reasons first water resources systems span diverse geographies and administrative boundaries and are physically complex such that an intuitive or common understanding of their behavior and benefits in both past and future may diverge substantially from reality second many water resources planning decisions particularly those related to infrastructure investment are irreversible except in the very long term such that mistakes in planning may have significant negative consequences 9 10 third political realities and exigencies imply that diverse stakeholders and perspectives will weigh in heavily on critical infrastructure and resource allocation decisions such dynamics complicate policymaking and implementation and potentially lead to unequal weighting of water demands and infrastructure needs 6 particularly in transboundary rivers critically it is often the needs of local marginal communities or environmental considerations that receive lower priority in this decision making process coordinated and integrated river basin planning is just as essential from a national perspective for both efficiency and equity reasons 11 considering first the efficiency lens the free flow of rivers outside of typical administrative institutional boundaries such as districts or regions creates interdependence in water resource utilization across political zones 12 thus productive water use may be constrained when water resources are misallocated in one region of a basin due to its geographical or legal advantages over other regions for example a small run of the river hydropower plant may electrify a small locality and be preferred on financial or environmental grounds however a large storage project in the same locality might more efficiently electrify the entire region and provide revenues from export of excess electricity in the absence of basin scale plans resources may be allocated to small projects at the expense of more efficient and larger ones 13 looking next through an equity lens consider for example an irrigation project that diverts water from one tributary to another such a diversion disrupts natural river flow and reduces water access to communities downstream of the diversion these localities may then face food and water insecurity if insufficient water flows past the diversion to meet existing irrigation and municipal demands concerns over equity are particularly relevant in the presence of an unequal distribution of power disadvantaged populations or small localities often bear the costs of development of water resources without enjoying its benefits equity issues can arise for instance due to locational asymmetries upstream downstream dynamics 12 legal ambiguities 14 or differences in socio economic or political power between different stakeholders 15 though trade offs may be inevitable a basin wide perspective is again essential to evaluate the magnitude of such concerns and to adequately account for cross sectoral interdependencies this paper implements a modular hydroeconomic model hem to provide an integrated perspective on water resources development in the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins of western nepal 16 the modular approach incorporates energy agricultural domestic and environmental perspectives around a core water balance model from which water control and allocations can be specified the objective of the constrained optimization wnewm western nepal energy water model is to maximize total economic benefits within these river basins accounting for trade offs both within and across sectors as western nepal is on the cusp of economic development and the region s water endowments are often highlighted as a key asset to be leveraged for future growth our multi sector analysis approach provides information on potential benefits and their distribution across space time sectors and populations all of which are of interest to policy makers in nepal to frame the analysis we work from scenarios oriented around three differentiated stakeholder visions large scale infrastructure development limited infrastructure development and environmentally sensitive development the development of which was informed by detailed document reviews and stakeholder consultations as described elsewhere 17 we consider several specific questions in our analysis of these different water resources development visions for western nepal first what are the economic benefits associated with various development pathways for western nepal second how does incorporation of environmental and municipal water demands constrain the benefits derived from energy generation and irrigation development and third how are these benefits distributed across space and sectors the remainder of the paper is as follows section 2 provides background on relevant hem literature that helps to inform construction of the wnewm model section 3 describes the context of our analysis which covers the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins section 4 describes the key features and assumptions of the wnewm including details regarding model parameterization data sources and model simplifications required due to data limitations section 5 reports the overall results and highlights the trade offs within and across regional development pathways section 6 concludes with a discussion of these results limitations of the analysis and implications for policy 2 background hydroeconomic modeling in providing an economic perspective on more efficient water use hems represent an important tool for river basin planning they offer a way to compare the economic benefits of potential competing water use allocation schemes or infrastructure choices within a flexible and customizable framework that accounts for system interdependencies 18 such models help to inform policy makers regarding the efficient use and distribution of water resources and benefits throughout a system incorporating tools and principles from engineering hydrology and economics a major strength of such models is their usefulness for analyzing the sectoral spatial and temporal trade offs inherent in water resource use decisions hems have traditionally been grouped into simulation or optimization models 18 19 depending on the approach used for scenario analysis or generation of efficient water allocations wu et al 6 note a blurring of these categorizations in their discussion of hems that compare optimal or near optimal solutions based on extensive analysis of potential scenarios pure optimization models are designed to generate the most efficient water allocation under specific conditions that are specified by the user which may however not be optimal under even slightly modified conditions simulation methods meanwhile can more readily be used to explore a wide variety of situations and their results can be analyzed to identify solutions that are both nearly optimal and more robust across assumptions about a system s future 19 hems are also commonly used to calculate the marginal productivity of various water uses rendering these tools valuable to analysis of alternative productive water uses e g agriculture irrigation and energy hydropower 6 studies in the global south using hems have focused on optimization of water allocations and infrastructure development for expansion of productive usage of rivers e g for hydropower generation and irrigation while balancing existing needs and water rights for example previous studies have examined water allocation trade offs in the nile 20 22 ganges 6 23 and mekong 24 25 as well as across multiple basins in nepal 26 indeed these tools have been applied in major river basin systems in all global regions prior applications have most often focused on specific policy or infrastructure proposals i e the expansion of hydropower infrastructure or use of water storage to regulate river flows or were developed to consider the implications of exogenous system changes e g climate perturbations as they percolate through complex and dynamic water resources systems for example in the ganges basin of which the karnali mohana and mahakali basins considered in this paper are a part wu et al 6 found that upstream storage infrastructure would do little to reduce downstream flooding which challenged standard assumptions about infrastructure development in the region at the time 27 jeuland et al 23 used the same model to show that hydropower production from upstream storage projects could meanwhile deliver major benefits despite sensitivity to uncertainties about future climate change considering these results in tandem points to the need to examine multiple water use options and drivers of change with these integrated modeling tools at the same time recent reviews of hems have emphasized that some sectoral interactions remain weak or incompletely specified in most applications of these tools 18 19 water energy nexus issues are often underspecified since typical hems only model energy generation using water ignoring feedbacks that drive water use e g energy demand in agricultural production further transmission systems for water and energy are often excluded in addition nonmarket or ecosystem values have only rarely or partially been included 28 29 hems are also typically deficient in their representation of political constraints on behavior which limits the relevance and accuracy of their predictions in many river basins that span multiple institutional boundaries in an effort to tackle some of these deficiencies this paper implements a new hem the wnewm that spans two river basins and crosses provinces 6 and 7 in nepal by specifying the spatial scope of the model in this way multiple sectors agriculture energy municipal and environmental can be modeled and linked to hydrological and governance systems in parallel with linkages between sectors e g energy flows to agriculture and between each sector and river hydrology e g return flows from agriculture to water systems we additionally incorporate political constraints based on existing water sharing agreements between india and nepal as well as linkages that allow for energy export from nepal 3 application water resources development in the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins of western nepal the focal area for this study is the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins which together span nearly 55 500 square kilometers of the karnali and sudurpaschim provinces of nepal fig 1 the region has three distinct ecological zones running north to south the mountains mid hills and tarai more than a third of the region is covered by forests which reflects the underdeveloped nature of the region much of the region s land 14 of the karnali mohana and 7 of the mahakali basin is also classified as protected such areas are key to meeting national conservation and biodiversity preservation goals these protected areas include four national parks one wildlife reserve one hunting reserve and two buffer zones nevertheless agriculture is the dominant economic activity throughout the region but the most productive areas are in the flat plains of the southern tarai 30 in addition to agriculture the region s economy is heavily dependent on remittance payments with almost 40 of income in the region coming from migrants sending money home from abroad 17 nepal s monsoon climate is the dominant factor in determining water availability over time and space even though nepal has ample water resources on average nearly 80 of rainfall occurs during monsoon months june september and water is especially scarce in the dry winter and pre monsoon months irregular surface water flows challenge all water dependent sectors for example run of the river hydropower projects are less expensive and environmentally disruptive than storage infrastructure but their power production is inefficient and unreliable in years or months with low flows lack of reliable power in turn constrains investment in energy intensive industries that might drive economic growth and limits household productivity gains from regular use of appliances or machinery 31 meanwhile irrigators or fishers who depend on water for livelihood activities are typically unable to maintain steady income in agriculture this is exacerbated by a lack of energy for water pumping 32 while rich in natural resources and most notably water resources and biodiversity the western regions lag in economic development even in comparison to central and eastern nepal 33 a variety of factors besides water availability both political and geographical have constrained development of water resources in western nepal for example while the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins have a total hydropower generation potential of around 35 000 mw 34 installed capacity within these basins rests at just 8 5 mw not including projects smaller than 1 mw i e micro hydro for which the government of nepal does not issue licenses 35 36 similarly only about 40 of cultivated land in western nepal is irrigated 37 while the lack of infrastructure in the region may be indicative of poverty low investment or a lack of development minded priorities there is also considerable difference of opinion over the appropriate extent and scale of infrastructure for development 17 this lack of consensus makes it difficult for policy makers to both raise financial resources for projects and to implement them as such the region is a sort of training ground for analyzing using hydro economic modeling and other approaches what conflicting development visions might mean at a regional scale for food production water utilization energy generation export or locally driven growth and sustainable development 4 methods 4 1 the wnewm framework the objective of the wnewm is to maximize the total economic benefit within the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins from four water related sectors i energy ii agriculture iii municipal and iv environmental each sector is included as a separate but interconnected module in the model the general model structure is described in bekchanov et al 16 the wnewm solves a nonlinear constrained optimization problem that has a monthly time step it is solved using the conopt solver of the general algebraic modeling system gams software it optimizes monthly water allocations over a flexible user specified time horizon we use a 12 year period for our analysis the core of the model is based around a water system module whose structure is provided by a system of nodes and linkages consistent with the surface flow structure of the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins as depicted in the schematic shown in fig 2 the basin hydrology is obtained from historical data or flows that are generated outside the model the basin runoff then runs through a system of 151 nodes 112 of which are in the karnali mohana river basin and 39 of which are part of the mahakali river basin some of these nodes accommodate storage or run of river hydropower facilities and some include diversions for specific agricultural or municipal uses the outlet node from each river basin captures water flows that cross the border into india accordingly the model can accommodate inclusion of water distribution agreements surrounding transboundary rivers i e the mahakali treaty or project specific treaties such as the grandhi mallikarjuna rao treaty while the model core maintains the integrity of the hydrology of the system each of the four sectors i e energy agriculture municipal environmental can be activated in the modular structure allowing each water system node to communicate with energy and agricultural production nodes municipal industrial and environmental water demands and energy and food markets the parameters of each of these are specified based on population hydrological and or infrastructure development data the wnewm model includes 55 energy production nodes of these nodes 1 is an existing run of the river scheme 19 are proposed storage projects with reservoirs and 35 are proposed run of the river schemes as documented in basin master plans other planning reports 38 39 and lists of licenses granted by the department of electricity development additionally the model includes 37 agricultural nodes 25 are existing projects and 12 are proposed or currently under construction these are similarly specified based on irrigation database reports from the department of irrigation project summaries and master plans municipal demand and energy demand constraints are estimated using a population based approach applied to the 2011 national census data in our application municipal demands are included at each river node while three energy markets represent domestic demand in western nepal domestic demand in kathmandu and export demand in north india similarly one agricultural market exists to represent domestic demand in western nepal because we only model major crops and all of these are consumed locally in the region which is a net importer of food 40 finally environmental constraints maintain minimum flows according to specific rules as described further below we include several simplifications to the basic model to allow its application to western nepal accommodating the context of the region and in accordance with data availability as described below energy and agriculture benefits are calculated based on the value of hydropower produced and the net benefits from crops grown using basin water with productive revenues and costs calculated based on location specific parameters related to marginal benefits yields and marginal production costs municipal and environmental water demands for which valuation parameters are not readily available in nepal nonetheless constrain water allocations according to location and time varying demand requirements the shadow values on these allocations thus indicate the opportunity costs associated with these guarantees importantly the model flexibly allows for examination of various development pathways facilitating analysis of trade offs that occur across them for example model scenarios that focus exclusively on storage based hydropower expansion can be compared to those that include reduced control e g run of the river schemes furthermore both of these can be analyzed under current and increased energy demand conditions including those that account for energy export opportunities in india while the wnewm hem approach attempts to incorporate benefits from productive water use while also maintaining municipal and environmental water demands the objective of benefit maximization may not directly align with stakeholders and policy makers goals in particular policy makers may be concerned about risks associated with various projects and development pathways accordingly they may seek to implement policy decisions that minimize risk even if potential payoffs of such conservative strategies are limited 10 furthermore data limitations can affect the accuracy of predictions from the model 6 as such our wnewm analyses provide only one of many necessary inputs to planners and are not well suited for generating advice on detailed operations 4 2 key equations the objective function solved by the wnewm is expressed as 1 max b n s n s l i n k n b n s where b is the total economic benefit us calculated as the sum of the net benefits n b n s accruing to each sector s associated with each river node n 1 1 here and throughout nodes are connected by linking across sets for example in equation 4 2 s n s l i n k provides the link between sector and river node within each sector the net benefits are calculated according to the productivity of the sector as given by the optimal water allocations which depend on region specific price and cost parameters as illustrated for the energy e and agricultural a sectors by equations 1a and 1b respectively 1a n b n e t e n e l i n k p e e p e t r o r e p e t h p c e t t e t here the net benefits in the energy sector that accrue at each node n b n e are calculated by summing the difference between the price of electricity p e multiplied by total energy produced from ror and storage projects e p e t r o r and e p e t h p respectively and the costs of producing c e t and transmitting t e t energy across time t and energy production sites e 1b n b n a a n a l i n k c r p a c r q a c r c a c r similarly the net benefits in the agriculture sector accrued at each node n b n a are calculated by summing the differences between the price of each crop p a c r multiplied by the quantity of each crop produced q a c r and the costs of production c a c r across agricultural production sites a and crops c r the core module maintains the water balance at each river node n at time t while the other modules track flows of energy and water as inputs to production or for use in final demand accordingly the following water balance equation is maintained at each node 2 n u n n u l i n k w f n u t w s r c n t g n g l i n k g w s g t s n s l i n k r f s t r n r l i n k e v r

of equation 4 captures all hydrological outflows summing across i reservoir evaporation e v r t ii change in reservoir storage δ v r r t iii surface water lost to groundwater g w c g t iv water diverted to productive sectors d i v s t and v water flowing downstream w f n d t notably productive use of water in one sector may enhance productivity in another a clear example of this is electricity generation water may be utilized in energy production primarily through hydropower in western nepal this electricity may then be used as an input in agricultural or municipal sectors in the agriculture sector mechanization may increase agricultural productivity or electric water pumps may improve irrigation efficiency in a dynamic system then these linkages between sectors must be included the energy balance is expressed in equation 3 3 d e m d e l i n k p r d d e t n m n l i n k s n s l i n k e d i v s t t b m t here the energy produced across all energy nodes p r d d e t associated with market m must be equal to the sum of the energy diverted to each sector e d i v s t and the energy available at market m t b m t across all nodes n associated with market m and sector s there are additional inter sectoral linkages in the wnewm as well some of these linkages span the entire set of sectors similar to the energy balance expressed in equation 3 others may only link two sectors fig 3 depicts these many interlinkages between the hydrological core of the nexus based hem and productive water use sectors and also illustrates schematically the linkages between water use sectors 4 3 model assumptions simplifications and parameterization while the wnewm endeavors to flexibly represent river basin systems for planning purposes specific applications of the model require additional assumptions and simplifications based on the application context and data availability this section details these model assumptions and simplifications for each module along with the data used in model parameterization table 1 then summarizes general parameters that are specified although many project specific parameters are omitted for the sake of brevity a database of project specific parameters used in this specific application is available in appendix a 4 3 1 hydrology core hydrological data used as inputs for the wnewm were generated from a soil water assessment tool swat model set up and calibrated using historical observed flows for the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins as described elsewhere 47 48 swat is a rainfall runoff model that incorporates physical characteristics of rivers and forcing climate datasets to simulate their flows and water availability over time 49 reflecting the limited good quality data availability for rivers in the region the model provides a daily streamflow time series covering a recent but limited period of 12 years 1996 2007 that nonetheless includes some high and low flow periods these daily time series were aggregated to a monthly level for use in the hydrology core 4 3 2 energy given that over 99 of nepal s electricity is from hydropower 50 the current version of the wnewm limits domestic energy production sites to hydropower accordingly energy production is assigned to nodes that are directly downstream of existing planned or proposed projects as much of this energy production infrastructure does not yet exist there is variation in the extent of project plans available for example while the productive capacity of every project is known specific project parameters particularly related to storage dam heights and reservoir capacities are often lacking we made two specific assumptions related to reservoir parameters whenever data were insufficient i linear parameterization of volume height relationships and ii transfer of similar parameters such as tail end levels and minimum and maximum reservoir heights and volumes from nearby projects for which plans were available we note here that linear volume height reservoir relationships dictate that reservoir height key in energy production is lost at a faster rate than it would be in a non linear relationship that is more typical of reservoir sites as such hydropower production that is calculated in the model may be underestimated the value of electricity was obtained from the official price for energy it and the cost of electricity production were parameterized using data from recent annual reports from the nepal electricity authority nea 41 the use of this electricity price likely understates the marginal benefits of energy consumption since the economy has historically been energy constrained the model also incorporates transmission costs and inefficiencies within the system calculated based on linear distances between energy production sites and the tarai as this region is the most populous in western nepal and represents the major market for electricity in the region for distribution to other parts of nepal transmission costs and losses were calculated based on linear distances to the national capital of kathmandu finally for distribution to india these parameters were calculated based on linear distances to the edge of a single potential nearby market in uttar pradesh in northern india 4 3 3 agriculture the agricultural sector already uses substantial water resources but also has potential for expanded use in the agricultural module water demand was calculated for irrigable areas by differencing crop water requirements calculated using the cropwat and climwat tools developed by the food and agricultural organization fao and effective rainfall irrigation requirements were then increased to account for inefficiencies in conveyance and application which together were assumed to be 60 throughout the region consistent with regions that use similar flood based irrigation systems cropping patterns and cultivable land areas were specified based on district specific data from the statistical information on nepalese agriculture reports which are released annually by the ministry of agricultural development 44 crop yields were then determined based on historical agricultural productivity and constrained to avoid water shortages in the most water constrained month of the growing period finally costs associated with agricultural production energy demand in agriculture and farmgate prices were parameterized using region specific data from governmental reports 44 51 53 and primary sources survey data as described in 30 based on this parameterization and constraints the model determines the allocation of land to both irrigated and rainfed agriculture maintaining current cropping patterns at each agricultural site we note that fisheries and livestock typically considered to be part of the agriculture sector in nepal have not been represented here owing to lack of data on costs and water usage for these categories 4 3 4 municipal municipal constraints are included for both domestic water and electricity demand to represent water demand in the model each village development committee vdc was matched to the nearest hydrology node and demand was approximated by assigning that vdc s population as reported in the 2011 census to the node 2 2 at the time of model construction these village development committees were the lowest administrative unit in nepal but this unit no longer exists under the new federal system in nepal nonetheless data on local demands largely comes from vdc level reports a daily per capita water requirement was assumed to be 40 l furthermore it was assumed based on data from a representative survey from the basin 30 that 10 of domestic water needs come from surface water sources 3 3 according to household survey data the other 90 of water for domestic needs come from groundwater specifically from shallow tubewells households report using river water for some drinking and cooking water needs but in general river water is used by inhabitants in the river for bathing washing and fishing electricity demands were calculated similarly annual electricity demand was assumed to be 139 kwh per capita 46 this demand was disaggregated to the monthly level assuming uniform distribution across months and combined with vdc population estimates from the 2011 census to obtain overall demand energy import from outside the basin is allowed without penalty to the objective function for scenarios where production is insufficient to meet this demand 4 3 5 environmental environmental constraints were included to reflect the environmental levels considered to be necessary for maintaining basic ecological functions in nepalese rivers the hydropower development policy 2001 54 requires that disruptions to river systems caused by hydropower development ensure maintenance of a minimum of 10 of undisturbed flow across the river system using this guide in our base analysis an environmental constraint that maintains 10 of monthly flow was incorporated into the wnewm in working with basin stakeholders to consider environmental objectives however we found that there is substantial variation in opinion regarding the appropriate level of environmental flows accordingly we run the hem with more stringent environmental flow requirements that are motivated by a desire to maintain the natural hydrological regime in certain key river stretches or tributaries we also opt for more stringent requirements to indirectly represent water requirements that would maintain fish population in the karnali mohana basin where fisheries are an important source of livelihood for many marginalized communities these more stringent environmental flows were calculated using the western nepal environmental flow calculator and follow the hydrological method for natural or slightly modified river basins outlined in smakhtin and anputhas 55 while all environmental constraints maintain minimum flows within each sub basin catchment they do so at a monthly time step that is while ten percent of natural flows must be maintained at the beginning and end of each month the model cannot guarantee that these minima would be continuous 4 4 scenario analysis the wnewm was used to model water allocations and economic benefits in the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins under baseline conditions and for three scenarios that reflect different conceptions of how development should proceed all runs used the hydrological time series from 1996 to 2007 and the 10 minimum environmental flow constraint was imposed in the base analysis model scenarios were specified to be consistent with development visions elicited from key water resources stakeholders representing both national and local perspectives described in detail in pakhtigian et al 17 in brief priorities represented in national planning documents and policies for the region as well as a rich collection of local water use reports were combined with development perspectives elicited from stakeholders representing both local and national interests in workshop discussions from these sources three development pathways were developed for comparison with the status quo which we model here as status quo infrastructure development limited infrastructure development and environmentally sensitive development 4 4 in pakhtigian et al 17 the development pathways are defined as state led development demand driven development and preservation of ecosystem integrity these pathways correspond with our model scenarios as infrastructure development limited infrastructure development and environmentally sensitive development respectively all four sector modules energy agriculture municipal and environment were included in these scenarios but their parameterization was modified to reflect differences in priorities and project designs the 4 scenarios fig 4 modeled using the wnewm are thus 1 status quo current irrigation and hydropower infrastructure supply to domestic municipal energy and water demands 2 infrastructure development development of all planned and proposed hydropower and irrigation projects supply to domestic municipal energy and water demands and excess energy export 3 limited infrastructure development development of all planned projects and proposed run of the river hydropower and irrigation projects supply to domestic municipal energy and water demands and limited energy export 4 environmentally sensitive development development of all planned projects and proposed run of the river hydropower and irrigation projects outside of two ecologically significant tributaries near bardia national park and shey phoksundo national parks respectively supply to domestic municipal energy and water demands 4 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted to provide greater insight on the importance of specific modeling assumptions three types of sensitivity analysis altered i environmental flow constraints ii downstream flow requirements into india and iii alternative depictions of energy demand and export markets the deviations from the base model for each sensitivity analysis are reported in table 2 and summarized here as there is not unified agreement that a 10 minimum flow requirement is sufficient to maintain aquatic ecosystems the first sensitivity analysis provides understanding of how more stringent e flow definitions may lead to forgone benefits from the water uses that are monetized in the model s objective function these more stringent environmental flows are calculated using the western nepal environmental flow calculator which yields flow calculations in accordance with the environmental management classes outlined in smakhtin and anputhas 55 in particular we utilize environmental flows calculated to correspond with the slightly modified environmental management class in which infrastructure development is permitted yet water diversions are limited to maintain aquatic ecosystems 5 5 smakhtin and anputhas 55 describe the slightly modified environmental management class as largely intact biodiversity and habitats despite water resources development and or basin modifications varying downstream flow requirements incorporates the political dimension of water resources management in this region specifically as it relates to water user agreements between india and nepal finally by modeling variation in energy demands and prices in both domestic markets we examine trade offs in energy distribution and access 5 results comparisons between the results of alternative development scenarios provide insights on the economic trade offs inherent in different potential development pathways for the western nepal region we also consider the spatial and sectoral distribution of benefits and examine the effects of inclusion of different environmental cross border and energy demand constraints as described above 5 1 trade off analysis across the 12 year time horizon for which flow data are available the expansion of western nepal s agricultural and energy sectors through irrigation and hydropower infrastructure would yield between 9 1 and 28 4 billion us depending on the extent of infrastructure development table 3 any of the development visions would lead to substantial increases in benefits over those produced with existing infrastructure scenario 1 which are just above 1 billion us over the 12 year period the upper bound of this range of economic benefits corresponds to the large infrastructure vision in which all proposed hydropower and irrigation projects would be developed scenario 2 of course these economic benefits would require establishment of an export energy market between nepal and india as the annual electricity generation in scenario 2 eclipses current demand in western nepal by approximately 69 twh unsurprisingly the economic benefits generated from this high infrastructure scenario are not distributed evenly across the energy and agricultural sectors about 80 is generated by the energy sector scenarios with more conservative infrastructure development scenarios 3 and 4 provide lower economic benefits yet still each generate over 9 billion us in productive benefits over the 12 year period the decreased economic benefit in these scenarios is driven entirely by the energy sector with these scenarios generating only 15 17 of the electricity that would be generated under the high infrastructure storage backed hydropower scenario modeled in scenario 2 the distribution of economic benefits across sectors is thus more evenly distributed with just over 40 of monetized benefits coming from the energy sector and the rest of the benefits originating in the agricultural sector further sensitivity analyses reveal that more stringent e flow constraints and limits to water diversion for use in nepal as per treaties with india would entail economic trade offs with more stringent e flows table 4 overall economic benefits decline between 2 and 6 with the greatest declines coming in scenarios with moderate development and limited water storage the majority of these declines come from reductions in agricultural output due to reduced water availability for irrigation though there are minimal reductions in energy generation as well table 5 reports results from the sensitivity analysis that limits water withdrawals for both basins in nepal in accordance with those implied in the mahakali river treaty we find that these constrained withdrawals lead to a reduction in productive benefits by 7 24 depending on the scenario again in percentage terms the largest losses are among scenarios that include less water storage infrastructure the cost of the trade off between water use in nepal and water flowing downstream is entirely borne by the agricultural sector where agricultural output is reduced by 45 the energy sector does not bear any burden if anything generation increases slightly within the scenario that contains storage infrastructure as storage backed water releases increase dry season flow in the river our final sensitivity analysis addresses the uncertainty associated with future electricity demand and relative values from energy use in the different markets of this broader region if western nepal were to build up its energy generating infrastructure in accordance with the development scenarios presented here it would generate excess electricity in the short to medium term our base model assumes that electricity demand could double in western nepal without generating declines in the value of electricity given that demand may not increase in this way the analysis presented in table 6 sets prices in nepal at current levels 0 09 us kwh and then lets this value vary linearly to zero once current domestic demand has been met this means that at some point it becomes more beneficial for nepal to export energy to india markets for which the value is set at 0 06 us kwh based on current tariffs for imported energy in india power trade agreements between india and its neighbors and power generation costs in nepal 41 42 leading to a different distribution of energy overall this lower local demand scenario reduces energy generation benefits by 2 3 the agricultural sector remains unaffected by these changes in energy demand and pricing 5 2 benefit distribution just as there exist sectoral trade offs from optimizing water use allocations across the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins from an economic perspective so too are there spatial trade offs we consider these spatial trade offs from the perspective of generation recognizing that the true distribution of benefits from productive water use may not occur at the location of generation maps of total economic benefits from generation demonstrate the spatial variation across development scenarios fig 5 in the status quo scenario 1 we find economic productivity concentrated primarily across several districts in the southern tarai and one district in the north western portion of the basins these are locations that currently have irrigation and hydropower infrastructure respectively transitioning to an infrastructure development scenario scenario 2 we find an intensification of this pattern with high levels of productivity in the tarai the higher levels of productivity in the mountains and hills meanwhile reflect the distribution of hydropower production that dominates in this scenario the scenarios representing limited infrastructure development and environmentally sensitive development 3 and 4 respectively also show a concentration of economic productivity from agriculture in the tarai notably these scenarios generate fewer productive benefits from hydropower additionally scenario 4 preserves tributaries near conservation areas and reduces production in those locations these efforts are most apparent in the central tarai region near bardia national park 5 3 infrastructure cost considerations while development through investment in hydropower and irrigation infrastructure appears to align with priorities of policy makers and stakeholders across sectors and institutional levels 17 the appropriate scale of infrastructure remains an open question the hem results presented in this paper indicate that substantial economic benefits on the order of over 9 of nepal s annual gdp could be realized through infrastructure investment particularly in hydropower yet these potential economic benefits would also be balanced by the costs of the infrastructure development needed to produce them detailed cost information is not available for most of the projects included in the planning documents we used to parameterize the three development visions in this paper but we nonetheless consider here three illustrative projects for which such information exists these are i the kalanga gad hydroelectric project a 15 3 mw run of the river project proposed in the bajhang district ii the west seti hydropower project a 750 mw storage project proposed in the doti dadeldhura districts and iii the bheri babai multipurpose project a 51 000 ha irrigation and 48 mw run of the river project under construction in the banke and bardia districts the kalanga gad project is a small run of the river scheme that might be taken as an example of one of the more than 30 other projects that are interspersed throughout the basin and considered in our analysis the estimated cost of this project is just under 24 million us 60 demonstrating that even for small projects substantial financial capital is required to develop the infrastructure necessary for electricity generation the west seti project is a massive storage reservoir which has substantial electricity generation potential while this project is one of the larger proposed reservoirs there are 19 additional storage projects considered in the wnewn the estimated project cost is 1 2 billion us 56 6 6 other sources estimate project costs up to 1 8 billion us but we utilize the 1 2 billion figure in our analysis 59 finally the bheri babai multipurpose project is an irrigation project currently under construction which exemplifies large scale irrigation infrastructure rather than smaller schemes the project s estimated cost is 136 million us 61 in addition to the comparison of annual benefits and costs of these projects it must be recognized that the full set of infrastructure projects we consider in our analysis would entail substantial capital needs in a country like nepal and would require a flow of both foreign and domestic investment maintained over a long period we report basic cost benefit comparisons for these three projects in table 7 here we estimate the annualized infrastructure costs for each project assuming a 30 year lifespan and using discount rates of 5 and 10 as well as the annualized project specific benefits from the wnewm we find that comparing annualized benefits and infrastructure costs kalanga gad and the bheri babai multipurpose project have positive net benefits while the west seti project faces costs that exceed benefits specifically comparing the kalanga gad costs and benefits we find that annualized benefits exceed annualized infrastructure costs by 0 1 1 1 million us depending on the discount rate applied see the notes in table 7 for additional details pertaining to the calculation the bheri babi multipurpose project has an even more favorable benefit cost comparison with benefits exceeding costs by 63 8 69 4 million us depending on the discount rate applied finally the west seti project has costs that exceed its annual estimated benefits by 10 9 60 2 million us depending on the discount rate applied nepal has faced challenges in constructing the west seti project most recently with the chinese power company china three gorges international pulling out of the 1 2 billion agreement citing financial infeasibility in 2018 56 these back of the envelope cost benefit calculations thus appear to confirm financial concerns related to this project in addition infrastructure costs of the projects themselves are not the only relevant ones for large hydropower projects to be economically viable for the region establishing energy trade with india would be paramount which would entail investment in greater transmission capacity needed to facilitate energy trade as well as negotiation costs furthermore the risk of environmental degradation and relocation costs would increase with the extent and scale of infrastructure development and these should be carefully studied on a project by project basis pakhtigian and jeuland 30 find that residents in western nepal ascribe non trivial values to environmental conservation about one percent of household income which suggests that environmental costs could be substantial especially if regional economic growth proceeds 6 discussion and conclusion western nepal is a region that in on the cusp of economic development and enhanced management of its vast water resource wealth provides a rich set of options for investment to advance economic growth objectives this paper considered pathways that put differential priority on various productive uses that aimed to consider agricultural productivity enhancements through irrigation electricity generation via hydropower investment and preservation of ecosystem functioning we analyzed scenarios spanning investment in large scale irrigation and energy infrastructure development smaller locally managed investments and avoidance of projects in more environmentally sensitive locations while more intensive infrastructure leads to economic benefits that are nearly three times those entailed by smaller scale and environmentally sensitive development trajectories the realization of these benefits would depend on favorable energy trading terms the availability of capital and may also come with substantial environmental and social costs nonetheless imposing more stringent environmental flow constraints relative to the 10 rule of thumb currently used by the nepali government would only decrease productive benefits by 0 5 billion us in our model suggesting that infrastructure could be managed to balance environmental needs without severely compromising other benefits alternatively these results suggest that more stringent environmental flows would be optimal from an economic perspective so long as they yielded benefits greater than 0 5 billion us through ecotourism harvesting of medicinal herbs non use benefits etc with more comprehensive data on the value of these environmental benefits environmental preservation could enter the wnewm framework through productive benefits rather than as a set of constraints the results produced by the wnewm and others like it provide policymakers with one perspective on enhanced basin level water resources planning of course there are key limitations to the implementation of any hem to which this tool is not immune first we rely on existing data to parameterize the model and in the case of western nepal several data limitations deserve mention perhaps most critical is the lack of inclusion of groundwater in the model which limited our focus to surface water demands and expansion of infrastructure related to surface water in the agricultural sector there is growing interest in turning to groundwater for irrigation expansion as these data become available they would provide meaningful extensions to the surface water analysis presented in this paper in addition our sensitivity analyses shed light on environmental concerns institutional constraints and future energy demand however limited data are available to support these analyses first we lack valuation data regarding different levels of e flows which guided our choice to include environmental constraints rather than value environmental services in the objective function thus we are able to speak to the benefits forgone in agriculture or energy production due to the imposition of more stringent e flow constraints yet we are unable to compare these to benefits stemming from their inclusion second while our efforts to incorporate more stringent environmental flow constraints and maintain municipal water access speak to livelihood concerns related to infrastructure development we have little data on which to base the calculation of costs and benefits associated with local livelihoods such as fisheries destruction or preservation third we conduct analysis at the basin scale for nepal without analyzing the downstream system and trade offs induced in india by including institutional constraints we consider the geopolitical realities of maintaining transboundary rivers but we do not value benefits in india outside of these constraints and energy export markets relatedly we do not consider flood control implications for nepal or downstream india of built infrastructure in the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins while flood control can be a vital benefit of water resources infrastructure existing models of the full ganges basin suggest that storage infrastructure in nepal would not significantly curtail flooding in downstream countries india and bangladesh due to the spatial distribution of rainfall and flooding failures in embankment protection and limited storage capacity relative to the flows in downstream rivers even under high infrastructure scenarios 23 dams in nepal might however reduce the severity of some types of local riverine flooding events especially in the flatter portions of the tarai future analyses of flooding implications though beyond the scope of this research could provide insight on the value of more local flood control and on the institutional agreements needed to realize such benefits finally we have little data on which to base our projections of future energy demand and value both in nepal and in export markets our baseline models and sensitivity analysis provide estimates for different energy demand scenarios however with more precise projections of demand and value the model could expand to consider alternative energy scenarios all in all the analysis suggests that there are considerable benefits in nepal to water resources development but that the value of specific projects should be evaluated carefully our simple benefit cost assessments of three example projects for example indicate that one project bheri babi is highly attractive a second kalanga gad modestly so while a third west seti looks to have costs that exceed benefits this confirms the wide variation associated with infrastructure projects that has been observed in other syntheses and reviews 57 58 water resources in western nepal can play an instrumental role in fostering regional economic development however prioritizing water resources for one sector is not without trade offs the wnewm generates insights into these trade offs at the basin level and demonstrates both the compatibilities and divergences between priorities in energy generation agricultural production environmental conservation and municipal demands it also clarifies the influence of institutional constraints providing a

8694,basin wide planning requires tools and strategies that allow comparison of alternative pathways and priorities at relevant spatial and temporal scales in this paper we apply a hydroeconomic model the western nepal energy water model that better accounts for feedbacks between water and energy markets to optimize water allocations across energy agriculture municipal and environmental sectors the model maximizes total economic benefits accounting for trade offs both within and across sectors in western nepal we find that surface water availability is generally sufficient to meet existing and growing demands in energy and agricultural sectors however expansion of water storage and irrigation infrastructure may limit environmental flows below levels needed to maintain the full integrity of important aquatic ecosystems we also find substantial trade offs between irrigation in nepal and satisfaction of the institutional requirements implied by international water use agreements with the downstream riparian india similar trade offs do not exist with hydropower however model results and allocations are sensitive to future domestic and international energy demands and valuations keywords ecosystem integrity economic optimization development priorities water resources planning hydropower irrigation 1 introduction in underdeveloped countries rich in water resources the harnessing of water for productive uses creates opportunities for economic development water resources provide options for energy generation agricultural production industrial development and navigation importantly though these various productive uses often entail complex and inter sectoral trade offs including with nonmarket purposes such as support of basic livelihoods activities and environmental conservation for example water stored and released for steady electricity generation may conflict with release patterns desired by irrigators 1 waterways preserved for navigation or ecosystem services may be ill suited for infrastructure development 2 3 export focused production may discount or disregard local resource dependence 4 and upstream abstractions may threaten the water security of downstream users 5 6 development of water resources has often been considered a threat to environmental quality and many argue that environmental costs are too often ignored 7 8 the possibility of acute resource use trade offs highlights the need for careful consideration of competing water demands within a given river system using appropriate tools without such tools inefficient decision making in terms of infrastructure choices institutional pressures and sectoral prioritization appears likely for several reasons first water resources systems span diverse geographies and administrative boundaries and are physically complex such that an intuitive or common understanding of their behavior and benefits in both past and future may diverge substantially from reality second many water resources planning decisions particularly those related to infrastructure investment are irreversible except in the very long term such that mistakes in planning may have significant negative consequences 9 10 third political realities and exigencies imply that diverse stakeholders and perspectives will weigh in heavily on critical infrastructure and resource allocation decisions such dynamics complicate policymaking and implementation and potentially lead to unequal weighting of water demands and infrastructure needs 6 particularly in transboundary rivers critically it is often the needs of local marginal communities or environmental considerations that receive lower priority in this decision making process coordinated and integrated river basin planning is just as essential from a national perspective for both efficiency and equity reasons 11 considering first the efficiency lens the free flow of rivers outside of typical administrative institutional boundaries such as districts or regions creates interdependence in water resource utilization across political zones 12 thus productive water use may be constrained when water resources are misallocated in one region of a basin due to its geographical or legal advantages over other regions for example a small run of the river hydropower plant may electrify a small locality and be preferred on financial or environmental grounds however a large storage project in the same locality might more efficiently electrify the entire region and provide revenues from export of excess electricity in the absence of basin scale plans resources may be allocated to small projects at the expense of more efficient and larger ones 13 looking next through an equity lens consider for example an irrigation project that diverts water from one tributary to another such a diversion disrupts natural river flow and reduces water access to communities downstream of the diversion these localities may then face food and water insecurity if insufficient water flows past the diversion to meet existing irrigation and municipal demands concerns over equity are particularly relevant in the presence of an unequal distribution of power disadvantaged populations or small localities often bear the costs of development of water resources without enjoying its benefits equity issues can arise for instance due to locational asymmetries upstream downstream dynamics 12 legal ambiguities 14 or differences in socio economic or political power between different stakeholders 15 though trade offs may be inevitable a basin wide perspective is again essential to evaluate the magnitude of such concerns and to adequately account for cross sectoral interdependencies this paper implements a modular hydroeconomic model hem to provide an integrated perspective on water resources development in the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins of western nepal 16 the modular approach incorporates energy agricultural domestic and environmental perspectives around a core water balance model from which water control and allocations can be specified the objective of the constrained optimization wnewm western nepal energy water model is to maximize total economic benefits within these river basins accounting for trade offs both within and across sectors as western nepal is on the cusp of economic development and the region s water endowments are often highlighted as a key asset to be leveraged for future growth our multi sector analysis approach provides information on potential benefits and their distribution across space time sectors and populations all of which are of interest to policy makers in nepal to frame the analysis we work from scenarios oriented around three differentiated stakeholder visions large scale infrastructure development limited infrastructure development and environmentally sensitive development the development of which was informed by detailed document reviews and stakeholder consultations as described elsewhere 17 we consider several specific questions in our analysis of these different water resources development visions for western nepal first what are the economic benefits associated with various development pathways for western nepal second how does incorporation of environmental and municipal water demands constrain the benefits derived from energy generation and irrigation development and third how are these benefits distributed across space and sectors the remainder of the paper is as follows section 2 provides background on relevant hem literature that helps to inform construction of the wnewm model section 3 describes the context of our analysis which covers the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins section 4 describes the key features and assumptions of the wnewm including details regarding model parameterization data sources and model simplifications required due to data limitations section 5 reports the overall results and highlights the trade offs within and across regional development pathways section 6 concludes with a discussion of these results limitations of the analysis and implications for policy 2 background hydroeconomic modeling in providing an economic perspective on more efficient water use hems represent an important tool for river basin planning they offer a way to compare the economic benefits of potential competing water use allocation schemes or infrastructure choices within a flexible and customizable framework that accounts for system interdependencies 18 such models help to inform policy makers regarding the efficient use and distribution of water resources and benefits throughout a system incorporating tools and principles from engineering hydrology and economics a major strength of such models is their usefulness for analyzing the sectoral spatial and temporal trade offs inherent in water resource use decisions hems have traditionally been grouped into simulation or optimization models 18 19 depending on the approach used for scenario analysis or generation of efficient water allocations wu et al 6 note a blurring of these categorizations in their discussion of hems that compare optimal or near optimal solutions based on extensive analysis of potential scenarios pure optimization models are designed to generate the most efficient water allocation under specific conditions that are specified by the user which may however not be optimal under even slightly modified conditions simulation methods meanwhile can more readily be used to explore a wide variety of situations and their results can be analyzed to identify solutions that are both nearly optimal and more robust across assumptions about a system s future 19 hems are also commonly used to calculate the marginal productivity of various water uses rendering these tools valuable to analysis of alternative productive water uses e g agriculture irrigation and energy hydropower 6 studies in the global south using hems have focused on optimization of water allocations and infrastructure development for expansion of productive usage of rivers e g for hydropower generation and irrigation while balancing existing needs and water rights for example previous studies have examined water allocation trade offs in the nile 20 22 ganges 6 23 and mekong 24 25 as well as across multiple basins in nepal 26 indeed these tools have been applied in major river basin systems in all global regions prior applications have most often focused on specific policy or infrastructure proposals i e the expansion of hydropower infrastructure or use of water storage to regulate river flows or were developed to consider the implications of exogenous system changes e g climate perturbations as they percolate through complex and dynamic water resources systems for example in the ganges basin of which the karnali mohana and mahakali basins considered in this paper are a part wu et al 6 found that upstream storage infrastructure would do little to reduce downstream flooding which challenged standard assumptions about infrastructure development in the region at the time 27 jeuland et al 23 used the same model to show that hydropower production from upstream storage projects could meanwhile deliver major benefits despite sensitivity to uncertainties about future climate change considering these results in tandem points to the need to examine multiple water use options and drivers of change with these integrated modeling tools at the same time recent reviews of hems have emphasized that some sectoral interactions remain weak or incompletely specified in most applications of these tools 18 19 water energy nexus issues are often underspecified since typical hems only model energy generation using water ignoring feedbacks that drive water use e g energy demand in agricultural production further transmission systems for water and energy are often excluded in addition nonmarket or ecosystem values have only rarely or partially been included 28 29 hems are also typically deficient in their representation of political constraints on behavior which limits the relevance and accuracy of their predictions in many river basins that span multiple institutional boundaries in an effort to tackle some of these deficiencies this paper implements a new hem the wnewm that spans two river basins and crosses provinces 6 and 7 in nepal by specifying the spatial scope of the model in this way multiple sectors agriculture energy municipal and environmental can be modeled and linked to hydrological and governance systems in parallel with linkages between sectors e g energy flows to agriculture and between each sector and river hydrology e g return flows from agriculture to water systems we additionally incorporate political constraints based on existing water sharing agreements between india and nepal as well as linkages that allow for energy export from nepal 3 application water resources development in the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins of western nepal the focal area for this study is the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins which together span nearly 55 500 square kilometers of the karnali and sudurpaschim provinces of nepal fig 1 the region has three distinct ecological zones running north to south the mountains mid hills and tarai more than a third of the region is covered by forests which reflects the underdeveloped nature of the region much of the region s land 14 of the karnali mohana and 7 of the mahakali basin is also classified as protected such areas are key to meeting national conservation and biodiversity preservation goals these protected areas include four national parks one wildlife reserve one hunting reserve and two buffer zones nevertheless agriculture is the dominant economic activity throughout the region but the most productive areas are in the flat plains of the southern tarai 30 in addition to agriculture the region s economy is heavily dependent on remittance payments with almost 40 of income in the region coming from migrants sending money home from abroad 17 nepal s monsoon climate is the dominant factor in determining water availability over time and space even though nepal has ample water resources on average nearly 80 of rainfall occurs during monsoon months june september and water is especially scarce in the dry winter and pre monsoon months irregular surface water flows challenge all water dependent sectors for example run of the river hydropower projects are less expensive and environmentally disruptive than storage infrastructure but their power production is inefficient and unreliable in years or months with low flows lack of reliable power in turn constrains investment in energy intensive industries that might drive economic growth and limits household productivity gains from regular use of appliances or machinery 31 meanwhile irrigators or fishers who depend on water for livelihood activities are typically unable to maintain steady income in agriculture this is exacerbated by a lack of energy for water pumping 32 while rich in natural resources and most notably water resources and biodiversity the western regions lag in economic development even in comparison to central and eastern nepal 33 a variety of factors besides water availability both political and geographical have constrained development of water resources in western nepal for example while the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins have a total hydropower generation potential of around 35 000 mw 34 installed capacity within these basins rests at just 8 5 mw not including projects smaller than 1 mw i e micro hydro for which the government of nepal does not issue licenses 35 36 similarly only about 40 of cultivated land in western nepal is irrigated 37 while the lack of infrastructure in the region may be indicative of poverty low investment or a lack of development minded priorities there is also considerable difference of opinion over the appropriate extent and scale of infrastructure for development 17 this lack of consensus makes it difficult for policy makers to both raise financial resources for projects and to implement them as such the region is a sort of training ground for analyzing using hydro economic modeling and other approaches what conflicting development visions might mean at a regional scale for food production water utilization energy generation export or locally driven growth and sustainable development 4 methods 4 1 the wnewm framework the objective of the wnewm is to maximize the total economic benefit within the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins from four water related sectors i energy ii agriculture iii municipal and iv environmental each sector is included as a separate but interconnected module in the model the general model structure is described in bekchanov et al 16 the wnewm solves a nonlinear constrained optimization problem that has a monthly time step it is solved using the conopt solver of the general algebraic modeling system gams software it optimizes monthly water allocations over a flexible user specified time horizon we use a 12 year period for our analysis the core of the model is based around a water system module whose structure is provided by a system of nodes and linkages consistent with the surface flow structure of the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins as depicted in the schematic shown in fig 2 the basin hydrology is obtained from historical data or flows that are generated outside the model the basin runoff then runs through a system of 151 nodes 112 of which are in the karnali mohana river basin and 39 of which are part of the mahakali river basin some of these nodes accommodate storage or run of river hydropower facilities and some include diversions for specific agricultural or municipal uses the outlet node from each river basin captures water flows that cross the border into india accordingly the model can accommodate inclusion of water distribution agreements surrounding transboundary rivers i e the mahakali treaty or project specific treaties such as the grandhi mallikarjuna rao treaty while the model core maintains the integrity of the hydrology of the system each of the four sectors i e energy agriculture municipal environmental can be activated in the modular structure allowing each water system node to communicate with energy and agricultural production nodes municipal industrial and environmental water demands and energy and food markets the parameters of each of these are specified based on population hydrological and or infrastructure development data the wnewm model includes 55 energy production nodes of these nodes 1 is an existing run of the river scheme 19 are proposed storage projects with reservoirs and 35 are proposed run of the river schemes as documented in basin master plans other planning reports 38 39 and lists of licenses granted by the department of electricity development additionally the model includes 37 agricultural nodes 25 are existing projects and 12 are proposed or currently under construction these are similarly specified based on irrigation database reports from the department of irrigation project summaries and master plans municipal demand and energy demand constraints are estimated using a population based approach applied to the 2011 national census data in our application municipal demands are included at each river node while three energy markets represent domestic demand in western nepal domestic demand in kathmandu and export demand in north india similarly one agricultural market exists to represent domestic demand in western nepal because we only model major crops and all of these are consumed locally in the region which is a net importer of food 40 finally environmental constraints maintain minimum flows according to specific rules as described further below we include several simplifications to the basic model to allow its application to western nepal accommodating the context of the region and in accordance with data availability as described below energy and agriculture benefits are calculated based on the value of hydropower produced and the net benefits from crops grown using basin water with productive revenues and costs calculated based on location specific parameters related to marginal benefits yields and marginal production costs municipal and environmental water demands for which valuation parameters are not readily available in nepal nonetheless constrain water allocations according to location and time varying demand requirements the shadow values on these allocations thus indicate the opportunity costs associated with these guarantees importantly the model flexibly allows for examination of various development pathways facilitating analysis of trade offs that occur across them for example model scenarios that focus exclusively on storage based hydropower expansion can be compared to those that include reduced control e g run of the river schemes furthermore both of these can be analyzed under current and increased energy demand conditions including those that account for energy export opportunities in india while the wnewm hem approach attempts to incorporate benefits from productive water use while also maintaining municipal and environmental water demands the objective of benefit maximization may not directly align with stakeholders and policy makers goals in particular policy makers may be concerned about risks associated with various projects and development pathways accordingly they may seek to implement policy decisions that minimize risk even if potential payoffs of such conservative strategies are limited 10 furthermore data limitations can affect the accuracy of predictions from the model 6 as such our wnewm analyses provide only one of many necessary inputs to planners and are not well suited for generating advice on detailed operations 4 2 key equations the objective function solved by the wnewm is expressed as 1 max b n s n s l i n k n b n s where b is the total economic benefit us calculated as the sum of the net benefits n b n s accruing to each sector s associated with each river node n 1 1 here and throughout nodes are connected by linking across sets for example in equation 4 2 s n s l i n k provides the link between sector and river node within each sector the net benefits are calculated according to the productivity of the sector as given by the optimal water allocations which depend on region specific price and cost parameters as illustrated for the energy e and agricultural a sectors by equations 1a and 1b respectively 1a n b n e t e n e l i n k p e e p e t r o r e p e t h p c e t t e t here the net benefits in the energy sector that accrue at each node n b n e are calculated by summing the difference between the price of electricity p e multiplied by total energy produced from ror and storage projects e p e t r o r and e p e t h p respectively and the costs of producing c e t and transmitting t e t energy across time t and energy production sites e 1b n b n a a n a l i n k c r p a c r q a c r c a c r similarly the net benefits in the agriculture sector accrued at each node n b n a are calculated by summing the differences between the price of each crop p a c r multiplied by the quantity of each crop produced q a c r and the costs of production c a c r across agricultural production sites a and crops c r the core module maintains the water balance at each river node n at time t while the other modules track flows of energy and water as inputs to production or for use in final demand accordingly the following water balance equation is maintained at each node 2 n u n n u l i n k w f n u t w s r c n t g n g l i n k g w s g t s n s l i n k r f s t r n r l i n k e v r

of equation 4 captures all hydrological outflows summing across i reservoir evaporation e v r t ii change in reservoir storage δ v r r t iii surface water lost to groundwater g w c g t iv water diverted to productive sectors d i v s t and v water flowing downstream w f n d t notably productive use of water in one sector may enhance productivity in another a clear example of this is electricity generation water may be utilized in energy production primarily through hydropower in western nepal this electricity may then be used as an input in agricultural or municipal sectors in the agriculture sector mechanization may increase agricultural productivity or electric water pumps may improve irrigation efficiency in a dynamic system then these linkages between sectors must be included the energy balance is expressed in equation 3 3 d e m d e l i n k p r d d e t n m n l i n k s n s l i n k e d i v s t t b m t here the energy produced across all energy nodes p r d d e t associated with market m must be equal to the sum of the energy diverted to each sector e d i v s t and the energy available at market m t b m t across all nodes n associated with market m and sector s there are additional inter sectoral linkages in the wnewm as well some of these linkages span the entire set of sectors similar to the energy balance expressed in equation 3 others may only link two sectors fig 3 depicts these many interlinkages between the hydrological core of the nexus based hem and productive water use sectors and also illustrates schematically the linkages between water use sectors 4 3 model assumptions simplifications and parameterization while the wnewm endeavors to flexibly represent river basin systems for planning purposes specific applications of the model require additional assumptions and simplifications based on the application context and data availability this section details these model assumptions and simplifications for each module along with the data used in model parameterization table 1 then summarizes general parameters that are specified although many project specific parameters are omitted for the sake of brevity a database of project specific parameters used in this specific application is available in appendix a 4 3 1 hydrology core hydrological data used as inputs for the wnewm were generated from a soil water assessment tool swat model set up and calibrated using historical observed flows for the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins as described elsewhere 47 48 swat is a rainfall runoff model that incorporates physical characteristics of rivers and forcing climate datasets to simulate their flows and water availability over time 49 reflecting the limited good quality data availability for rivers in the region the model provides a daily streamflow time series covering a recent but limited period of 12 years 1996 2007 that nonetheless includes some high and low flow periods these daily time series were aggregated to a monthly level for use in the hydrology core 4 3 2 energy given that over 99 of nepal s electricity is from hydropower 50 the current version of the wnewm limits domestic energy production sites to hydropower accordingly energy production is assigned to nodes that are directly downstream of existing planned or proposed projects as much of this energy production infrastructure does not yet exist there is variation in the extent of project plans available for example while the productive capacity of every project is known specific project parameters particularly related to storage dam heights and reservoir capacities are often lacking we made two specific assumptions related to reservoir parameters whenever data were insufficient i linear parameterization of volume height relationships and ii transfer of similar parameters such as tail end levels and minimum and maximum reservoir heights and volumes from nearby projects for which plans were available we note here that linear volume height reservoir relationships dictate that reservoir height key in energy production is lost at a faster rate than it would be in a non linear relationship that is more typical of reservoir sites as such hydropower production that is calculated in the model may be underestimated the value of electricity was obtained from the official price for energy it and the cost of electricity production were parameterized using data from recent annual reports from the nepal electricity authority nea 41 the use of this electricity price likely understates the marginal benefits of energy consumption since the economy has historically been energy constrained the model also incorporates transmission costs and inefficiencies within the system calculated based on linear distances between energy production sites and the tarai as this region is the most populous in western nepal and represents the major market for electricity in the region for distribution to other parts of nepal transmission costs and losses were calculated based on linear distances to the national capital of kathmandu finally for distribution to india these parameters were calculated based on linear distances to the edge of a single potential nearby market in uttar pradesh in northern india 4 3 3 agriculture the agricultural sector already uses substantial water resources but also has potential for expanded use in the agricultural module water demand was calculated for irrigable areas by differencing crop water requirements calculated using the cropwat and climwat tools developed by the food and agricultural organization fao and effective rainfall irrigation requirements were then increased to account for inefficiencies in conveyance and application which together were assumed to be 60 throughout the region consistent with regions that use similar flood based irrigation systems cropping patterns and cultivable land areas were specified based on district specific data from the statistical information on nepalese agriculture reports which are released annually by the ministry of agricultural development 44 crop yields were then determined based on historical agricultural productivity and constrained to avoid water shortages in the most water constrained month of the growing period finally costs associated with agricultural production energy demand in agriculture and farmgate prices were parameterized using region specific data from governmental reports 44 51 53 and primary sources survey data as described in 30 based on this parameterization and constraints the model determines the allocation of land to both irrigated and rainfed agriculture maintaining current cropping patterns at each agricultural site we note that fisheries and livestock typically considered to be part of the agriculture sector in nepal have not been represented here owing to lack of data on costs and water usage for these categories 4 3 4 municipal municipal constraints are included for both domestic water and electricity demand to represent water demand in the model each village development committee vdc was matched to the nearest hydrology node and demand was approximated by assigning that vdc s population as reported in the 2011 census to the node 2 2 at the time of model construction these village development committees were the lowest administrative unit in nepal but this unit no longer exists under the new federal system in nepal nonetheless data on local demands largely comes from vdc level reports a daily per capita water requirement was assumed to be 40 l furthermore it was assumed based on data from a representative survey from the basin 30 that 10 of domestic water needs come from surface water sources 3 3 according to household survey data the other 90 of water for domestic needs come from groundwater specifically from shallow tubewells households report using river water for some drinking and cooking water needs but in general river water is used by inhabitants in the river for bathing washing and fishing electricity demands were calculated similarly annual electricity demand was assumed to be 139 kwh per capita 46 this demand was disaggregated to the monthly level assuming uniform distribution across months and combined with vdc population estimates from the 2011 census to obtain overall demand energy import from outside the basin is allowed without penalty to the objective function for scenarios where production is insufficient to meet this demand 4 3 5 environmental environmental constraints were included to reflect the environmental levels considered to be necessary for maintaining basic ecological functions in nepalese rivers the hydropower development policy 2001 54 requires that disruptions to river systems caused by hydropower development ensure maintenance of a minimum of 10 of undisturbed flow across the river system using this guide in our base analysis an environmental constraint that maintains 10 of monthly flow was incorporated into the wnewm in working with basin stakeholders to consider environmental objectives however we found that there is substantial variation in opinion regarding the appropriate level of environmental flows accordingly we run the hem with more stringent environmental flow requirements that are motivated by a desire to maintain the natural hydrological regime in certain key river stretches or tributaries we also opt for more stringent requirements to indirectly represent water requirements that would maintain fish population in the karnali mohana basin where fisheries are an important source of livelihood for many marginalized communities these more stringent environmental flows were calculated using the western nepal environmental flow calculator and follow the hydrological method for natural or slightly modified river basins outlined in smakhtin and anputhas 55 while all environmental constraints maintain minimum flows within each sub basin catchment they do so at a monthly time step that is while ten percent of natural flows must be maintained at the beginning and end of each month the model cannot guarantee that these minima would be continuous 4 4 scenario analysis the wnewm was used to model water allocations and economic benefits in the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins under baseline conditions and for three scenarios that reflect different conceptions of how development should proceed all runs used the hydrological time series from 1996 to 2007 and the 10 minimum environmental flow constraint was imposed in the base analysis model scenarios were specified to be consistent with development visions elicited from key water resources stakeholders representing both national and local perspectives described in detail in pakhtigian et al 17 in brief priorities represented in national planning documents and policies for the region as well as a rich collection of local water use reports were combined with development perspectives elicited from stakeholders representing both local and national interests in workshop discussions from these sources three development pathways were developed for comparison with the status quo which we model here as status quo infrastructure development limited infrastructure development and environmentally sensitive development 4 4 in pakhtigian et al 17 the development pathways are defined as state led development demand driven development and preservation of ecosystem integrity these pathways correspond with our model scenarios as infrastructure development limited infrastructure development and environmentally sensitive development respectively all four sector modules energy agriculture municipal and environment were included in these scenarios but their parameterization was modified to reflect differences in priorities and project designs the 4 scenarios fig 4 modeled using the wnewm are thus 1 status quo current irrigation and hydropower infrastructure supply to domestic municipal energy and water demands 2 infrastructure development development of all planned and proposed hydropower and irrigation projects supply to domestic municipal energy and water demands and excess energy export 3 limited infrastructure development development of all planned projects and proposed run of the river hydropower and irrigation projects supply to domestic municipal energy and water demands and limited energy export 4 environmentally sensitive development development of all planned projects and proposed run of the river hydropower and irrigation projects outside of two ecologically significant tributaries near bardia national park and shey phoksundo national parks respectively supply to domestic municipal energy and water demands 4 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted to provide greater insight on the importance of specific modeling assumptions three types of sensitivity analysis altered i environmental flow constraints ii downstream flow requirements into india and iii alternative depictions of energy demand and export markets the deviations from the base model for each sensitivity analysis are reported in table 2 and summarized here as there is not unified agreement that a 10 minimum flow requirement is sufficient to maintain aquatic ecosystems the first sensitivity analysis provides understanding of how more stringent e flow definitions may lead to forgone benefits from the water uses that are monetized in the model s objective function these more stringent environmental flows are calculated using the western nepal environmental flow calculator which yields flow calculations in accordance with the environmental management classes outlined in smakhtin and anputhas 55 in particular we utilize environmental flows calculated to correspond with the slightly modified environmental management class in which infrastructure development is permitted yet water diversions are limited to maintain aquatic ecosystems 5 5 smakhtin and anputhas 55 describe the slightly modified environmental management class as largely intact biodiversity and habitats despite water resources development and or basin modifications varying downstream flow requirements incorporates the political dimension of water resources management in this region specifically as it relates to water user agreements between india and nepal finally by modeling variation in energy demands and prices in both domestic markets we examine trade offs in energy distribution and access 5 results comparisons between the results of alternative development scenarios provide insights on the economic trade offs inherent in different potential development pathways for the western nepal region we also consider the spatial and sectoral distribution of benefits and examine the effects of inclusion of different environmental cross border and energy demand constraints as described above 5 1 trade off analysis across the 12 year time horizon for which flow data are available the expansion of western nepal s agricultural and energy sectors through irrigation and hydropower infrastructure would yield between 9 1 and 28 4 billion us depending on the extent of infrastructure development table 3 any of the development visions would lead to substantial increases in benefits over those produced with existing infrastructure scenario 1 which are just above 1 billion us over the 12 year period the upper bound of this range of economic benefits corresponds to the large infrastructure vision in which all proposed hydropower and irrigation projects would be developed scenario 2 of course these economic benefits would require establishment of an export energy market between nepal and india as the annual electricity generation in scenario 2 eclipses current demand in western nepal by approximately 69 twh unsurprisingly the economic benefits generated from this high infrastructure scenario are not distributed evenly across the energy and agricultural sectors about 80 is generated by the energy sector scenarios with more conservative infrastructure development scenarios 3 and 4 provide lower economic benefits yet still each generate over 9 billion us in productive benefits over the 12 year period the decreased economic benefit in these scenarios is driven entirely by the energy sector with these scenarios generating only 15 17 of the electricity that would be generated under the high infrastructure storage backed hydropower scenario modeled in scenario 2 the distribution of economic benefits across sectors is thus more evenly distributed with just over 40 of monetized benefits coming from the energy sector and the rest of the benefits originating in the agricultural sector further sensitivity analyses reveal that more stringent e flow constraints and limits to water diversion for use in nepal as per treaties with india would entail economic trade offs with more stringent e flows table 4 overall economic benefits decline between 2 and 6 with the greatest declines coming in scenarios with moderate development and limited water storage the majority of these declines come from reductions in agricultural output due to reduced water availability for irrigation though there are minimal reductions in energy generation as well table 5 reports results from the sensitivity analysis that limits water withdrawals for both basins in nepal in accordance with those implied in the mahakali river treaty we find that these constrained withdrawals lead to a reduction in productive benefits by 7 24 depending on the scenario again in percentage terms the largest losses are among scenarios that include less water storage infrastructure the cost of the trade off between water use in nepal and water flowing downstream is entirely borne by the agricultural sector where agricultural output is reduced by 45 the energy sector does not bear any burden if anything generation increases slightly within the scenario that contains storage infrastructure as storage backed water releases increase dry season flow in the river our final sensitivity analysis addresses the uncertainty associated with future electricity demand and relative values from energy use in the different markets of this broader region if western nepal were to build up its energy generating infrastructure in accordance with the development scenarios presented here it would generate excess electricity in the short to medium term our base model assumes that electricity demand could double in western nepal without generating declines in the value of electricity given that demand may not increase in this way the analysis presented in table 6 sets prices in nepal at current levels 0 09 us kwh and then lets this value vary linearly to zero once current domestic demand has been met this means that at some point it becomes more beneficial for nepal to export energy to india markets for which the value is set at 0 06 us kwh based on current tariffs for imported energy in india power trade agreements between india and its neighbors and power generation costs in nepal 41 42 leading to a different distribution of energy overall this lower local demand scenario reduces energy generation benefits by 2 3 the agricultural sector remains unaffected by these changes in energy demand and pricing 5 2 benefit distribution just as there exist sectoral trade offs from optimizing water use allocations across the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins from an economic perspective so too are there spatial trade offs we consider these spatial trade offs from the perspective of generation recognizing that the true distribution of benefits from productive water use may not occur at the location of generation maps of total economic benefits from generation demonstrate the spatial variation across development scenarios fig 5 in the status quo scenario 1 we find economic productivity concentrated primarily across several districts in the southern tarai and one district in the north western portion of the basins these are locations that currently have irrigation and hydropower infrastructure respectively transitioning to an infrastructure development scenario scenario 2 we find an intensification of this pattern with high levels of productivity in the tarai the higher levels of productivity in the mountains and hills meanwhile reflect the distribution of hydropower production that dominates in this scenario the scenarios representing limited infrastructure development and environmentally sensitive development 3 and 4 respectively also show a concentration of economic productivity from agriculture in the tarai notably these scenarios generate fewer productive benefits from hydropower additionally scenario 4 preserves tributaries near conservation areas and reduces production in those locations these efforts are most apparent in the central tarai region near bardia national park 5 3 infrastructure cost considerations while development through investment in hydropower and irrigation infrastructure appears to align with priorities of policy makers and stakeholders across sectors and institutional levels 17 the appropriate scale of infrastructure remains an open question the hem results presented in this paper indicate that substantial economic benefits on the order of over 9 of nepal s annual gdp could be realized through infrastructure investment particularly in hydropower yet these potential economic benefits would also be balanced by the costs of the infrastructure development needed to produce them detailed cost information is not available for most of the projects included in the planning documents we used to parameterize the three development visions in this paper but we nonetheless consider here three illustrative projects for which such information exists these are i the kalanga gad hydroelectric project a 15 3 mw run of the river project proposed in the bajhang district ii the west seti hydropower project a 750 mw storage project proposed in the doti dadeldhura districts and iii the bheri babai multipurpose project a 51 000 ha irrigation and 48 mw run of the river project under construction in the banke and bardia districts the kalanga gad project is a small run of the river scheme that might be taken as an example of one of the more than 30 other projects that are interspersed throughout the basin and considered in our analysis the estimated cost of this project is just under 24 million us 60 demonstrating that even for small projects substantial financial capital is required to develop the infrastructure necessary for electricity generation the west seti project is a massive storage reservoir which has substantial electricity generation potential while this project is one of the larger proposed reservoirs there are 19 additional storage projects considered in the wnewn the estimated project cost is 1 2 billion us 56 6 6 other sources estimate project costs up to 1 8 billion us but we utilize the 1 2 billion figure in our analysis 59 finally the bheri babai multipurpose project is an irrigation project currently under construction which exemplifies large scale irrigation infrastructure rather than smaller schemes the project s estimated cost is 136 million us 61 in addition to the comparison of annual benefits and costs of these projects it must be recognized that the full set of infrastructure projects we consider in our analysis would entail substantial capital needs in a country like nepal and would require a flow of both foreign and domestic investment maintained over a long period we report basic cost benefit comparisons for these three projects in table 7 here we estimate the annualized infrastructure costs for each project assuming a 30 year lifespan and using discount rates of 5 and 10 as well as the annualized project specific benefits from the wnewm we find that comparing annualized benefits and infrastructure costs kalanga gad and the bheri babai multipurpose project have positive net benefits while the west seti project faces costs that exceed benefits specifically comparing the kalanga gad costs and benefits we find that annualized benefits exceed annualized infrastructure costs by 0 1 1 1 million us depending on the discount rate applied see the notes in table 7 for additional details pertaining to the calculation the bheri babi multipurpose project has an even more favorable benefit cost comparison with benefits exceeding costs by 63 8 69 4 million us depending on the discount rate applied finally the west seti project has costs that exceed its annual estimated benefits by 10 9 60 2 million us depending on the discount rate applied nepal has faced challenges in constructing the west seti project most recently with the chinese power company china three gorges international pulling out of the 1 2 billion agreement citing financial infeasibility in 2018 56 these back of the envelope cost benefit calculations thus appear to confirm financial concerns related to this project in addition infrastructure costs of the projects themselves are not the only relevant ones for large hydropower projects to be economically viable for the region establishing energy trade with india would be paramount which would entail investment in greater transmission capacity needed to facilitate energy trade as well as negotiation costs furthermore the risk of environmental degradation and relocation costs would increase with the extent and scale of infrastructure development and these should be carefully studied on a project by project basis pakhtigian and jeuland 30 find that residents in western nepal ascribe non trivial values to environmental conservation about one percent of household income which suggests that environmental costs could be substantial especially if regional economic growth proceeds 6 discussion and conclusion western nepal is a region that in on the cusp of economic development and enhanced management of its vast water resource wealth provides a rich set of options for investment to advance economic growth objectives this paper considered pathways that put differential priority on various productive uses that aimed to consider agricultural productivity enhancements through irrigation electricity generation via hydropower investment and preservation of ecosystem functioning we analyzed scenarios spanning investment in large scale irrigation and energy infrastructure development smaller locally managed investments and avoidance of projects in more environmentally sensitive locations while more intensive infrastructure leads to economic benefits that are nearly three times those entailed by smaller scale and environmentally sensitive development trajectories the realization of these benefits would depend on favorable energy trading terms the availability of capital and may also come with substantial environmental and social costs nonetheless imposing more stringent environmental flow constraints relative to the 10 rule of thumb currently used by the nepali government would only decrease productive benefits by 0 5 billion us in our model suggesting that infrastructure could be managed to balance environmental needs without severely compromising other benefits alternatively these results suggest that more stringent environmental flows would be optimal from an economic perspective so long as they yielded benefits greater than 0 5 billion us through ecotourism harvesting of medicinal herbs non use benefits etc with more comprehensive data on the value of these environmental benefits environmental preservation could enter the wnewm framework through productive benefits rather than as a set of constraints the results produced by the wnewm and others like it provide policymakers with one perspective on enhanced basin level water resources planning of course there are key limitations to the implementation of any hem to which this tool is not immune first we rely on existing data to parameterize the model and in the case of western nepal several data limitations deserve mention perhaps most critical is the lack of inclusion of groundwater in the model which limited our focus to surface water demands and expansion of infrastructure related to surface water in the agricultural sector there is growing interest in turning to groundwater for irrigation expansion as these data become available they would provide meaningful extensions to the surface water analysis presented in this paper in addition our sensitivity analyses shed light on environmental concerns institutional constraints and future energy demand however limited data are available to support these analyses first we lack valuation data regarding different levels of e flows which guided our choice to include environmental constraints rather than value environmental services in the objective function thus we are able to speak to the benefits forgone in agriculture or energy production due to the imposition of more stringent e flow constraints yet we are unable to compare these to benefits stemming from their inclusion second while our efforts to incorporate more stringent environmental flow constraints and maintain municipal water access speak to livelihood concerns related to infrastructure development we have little data on which to base the calculation of costs and benefits associated with local livelihoods such as fisheries destruction or preservation third we conduct analysis at the basin scale for nepal without analyzing the downstream system and trade offs induced in india by including institutional constraints we consider the geopolitical realities of maintaining transboundary rivers but we do not value benefits in india outside of these constraints and energy export markets relatedly we do not consider flood control implications for nepal or downstream india of built infrastructure in the karnali mohana and mahakali river basins while flood control can be a vital benefit of water resources infrastructure existing models of the full ganges basin suggest that storage infrastructure in nepal would not significantly curtail flooding in downstream countries india and bangladesh due to the spatial distribution of rainfall and flooding failures in embankment protection and limited storage capacity relative to the flows in downstream rivers even under high infrastructure scenarios 23 dams in nepal might however reduce the severity of some types of local riverine flooding events especially in the flatter portions of the tarai future analyses of flooding implications though beyond the scope of this research could provide insight on the value of more local flood control and on the institutional agreements needed to realize such benefits finally we have little data on which to base our projections of future energy demand and value both in nepal and in export markets our baseline models and sensitivity analysis provide estimates for different energy demand scenarios however with more precise projections of demand and value the model could expand to consider alternative energy scenarios all in all the analysis suggests that there are considerable benefits in nepal to water resources development but that the value of specific projects should be evaluated carefully our simple benefit cost assessments of three example projects for example indicate that one project bheri babi is highly attractive a second kalanga gad modestly so while a third west seti looks to have costs that exceed benefits this confirms the wide variation associated with infrastructure projects that has been observed in other syntheses and reviews 57 58 water resources in western nepal can play an instrumental role in fostering regional economic development however prioritizing water resources for one sector is not without trade offs the wnewm generates insights into these trade offs at the basin level and demonstrates both the compatibilities and divergences between priorities in energy generation agricultural production environmental conservation and municipal demands it also clarifies the influence of institutional constraints providing a
