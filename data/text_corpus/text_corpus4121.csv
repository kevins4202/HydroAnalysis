20605,scour or the localized loss of soil around the foundation is a dominant factor contributing to failure scour at bridge piers columns of elevated buildings and wind turbines with monopile foundations can cause damage after flooding and natural hazards however due to the lack of sophisticated modeling scour is not fully understood this study utilizes computational fluid dynamic cfd simulations to understand the performance of different flow countermeasures in reducing the scour potential we look at altering the flow around the pier and thereby alleviating the horseshoe vortices and downflow issues cfd models are developed and validated with available experimental data the recommended models with turbulence closures are employed to predict the bed shear stress for different pier configurations streamlined shape tapered sheath delta vane and guide wall with slanting vanes reductions in the maximum bed shear stress are 30 for both the angled plate and the delta vane 20 for the tapered sheath and 15 for the guide wall with slanting vanes by reducing the bed shear stress these countermeasures demonstrate their capability to mitigate scour the proposed solutions have a potential to minimize the accelerated deterioration and protect bridges elevated buildings wind turbines and coastal and offshore infrastructure against scour induced failures keywords scour bridge pier countermeasure flow altering monopile wind turbine computational fluid dynamics coastal infrastructure coastal protection and rehabilitation 1 introduction scour is one of the most significant factors contributing to failure in bridges niedoroda and dalton 1982 the analysis of 500 bridges in the united states between 1989 and 2000 shows that 53 of failures were attributed to floods and scour wardhana and hadipriono 2003 scour may also affect the stability of offshore monopile wind turbines monopile offshore wind turbines often suffer from scour several research studies on the effects of scour on wind turbines in terms of analysis measurements prognosis dynamic modeling of the structure and mitigation countermeasures are available in the literature lin et al 2019 prendergast et al 2015 trojnar 2020 b yang et al 2020 yuan et al 2017 as floodwater passes around an obstruction the flow accelerates losing and transporting the soil structural supports such as bridge piers and wind turbines depend on the foundation to transfer the loads to the ground when the sediment supporting a foundation is lost the structure may become unstable and collapse fig 1 a one countermeasure may decrease scour by minimizing the downflow at the face of a pier whereas another method may weaken the horseshoe vortices fig 1 b these flow physics are often difficult to measure experimentally however scour modeling and prognosis are indispensable for the safe and economical design of bridges wind turbines elevated buildings and other inland and offshore infrastructures in addition scour modeling is crucial for the design and analysis of potential mitigation devices research on local scour has been enjoying a renewed interest over the past 50 years empirical formulas deriven from field and laboratory measurements may prognosticate the maximum scour depth chortis et al 2020 najafzadeh et al 2015 because of the complex interaction among several parameters in the sediment transport process these formulas often serve as a rough estimate of scour depth and may not be used for accurate prognosis with advances in computational fluid dynamics cfd modeling scour can now be adequately simulated in three dimensions most cfd models rely on solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations although large eddy simulations are emerging to assess the scour prevention potential of various flow altering countermeasures cfd provides many benefits over laboratory experiments cfd requires less physical space and can provide instantaneous flow characteristics anywhere within the computational domain however numerical errors are always present and validating the cfd model with experimental data will ensure meaningful and accurate results cfd simulations can assist in the understanding of how the countermeasures may reduce scour cfd analysis of piers with different geometries may indicate which geometry has the best performance in reducing scour mitigation devices can alter the flow velocities bed shear stress and hence the ability to transport sediment due to the potentially disastrous consequences of local scour at bridge piers and other elevated structures researchers have been attempting to reduce scour effects via different methods pandey et al 2020a yang et al 2019 yao et al 2020 these methods are known as flow altering active or bed armoring passive countermeasures wang et al 2017 both methods act to alter the primary flow characteristics including the strong downflow when the flow encounters the face of the pier and the horseshoe vortex entailing vortices that shed off the sides of a pier melville and coleman 2000 the primary method often used to reduce local scour is the armoring of the bed around a pier such as with riprap recently however researchers started to assess the combination of flow altering and bed armoring techniques to synergistically reduce scour effects gaudio et al 2012 it is worthy to mention that the first author of the current paper realized the role of certain aerodynamic features in reducing wind pressures on buildings fluid mechanics problem aly et al 2017 aly and bresowar 2016 this increased our interest to understand whether other features can work in water to reduce the bed shear stress fluid mechanics problem and hence decrease the scour potential the literature review shows that a streamlined pier shape may decrease the scour depth by as much as 50 57 under various flow velocities al shukur and obeid 2016 under clear water conditions the delta wing plate experimentally reduced the maximum scour depth by 67 gupta 2002 this design has shown a maximum scour reduction of up to 32 in unsteady flow however this reduction is highly dependent on the flow depth tafarojnoruz et al 2010 in general such devices lack their performance during floods live bed conditions and they may adversely increase scour a guide wall with slanting vanes may decrease the maximum depth by 90 daido and yano 1995 both methods become ineffective once the sediment is cleared out below the desired installation depth by armoring the bed below these flow countermeasure devices scour can be further reduced compared to the case with bed armoring alone due to the lack of sophisticated modeling scour is not fully understood this study aims to employ the cfd capabilities to understand the performance of different flow countermeasures in reducing scour the scope of the study is clear water scour with a non cohesive sand bed and specific ranges of d 50 the complex set of flow equations is reduced by employing the two equation k ε and k ω turbulence closures both turbulence closures in validated cfd models are used to prognosticate the bed shear stress for different pier configurations streamlined shape tapered sheath delta vane and guide wall with slanting vanes reductions in the maximum bed shear stress are in the order of 30 with the angled plate and the delta vane 20 with the tapered sheath and 15 with the guide wall with slanting plates by reducing the bed shear stress these countermeasures demonstrate their potential to mitigate scour the presented solutions can reduce the accelerated deterioration and protect bridges and other coastal and offshore infrastructure against collapse due to scour the paper layout is as follows section 2 provides an overview of scour and its classification section 3 presents recent efforts on scour processes by scaled laboratory models computational modeling with its potential to resolve the scale issues is presented in section 4 scour countermeasures are reviewed in section 5 section 6 presents cfd modeling to prognosticate local scour the cfd validation study is presented in section 7 in section 8 numerical investigations of different flow countermeasures are presented reynolds number effects on the performance of the delta vane countermeasure are addressed in section 9 section 10 summarizes the main findings of the paper 2 an overview of scour scour can be classified as general contraction and local wang et al 2017 general scour occurs when the water flow removes sediment without structure impediment contraction scour arises under the narrowing of the width of a river or a channel local scour occurs at an obstacle obstructing the flow such as a pile or a pier and generally causes ten times the depth due to general scour johnson et al 2013 parker et al 1998 additionally a river bed may experience aggradation and degradation i e long term bed elevation changes due to the deposition or removal of sediment from natural or man made causes arneson et al 2012 aggradation and degradation differ from general scour the general scour may be cyclic or caused by short term events such as flooding the contributions of all of these forms should be accounted for when evaluating the total scour at piers and abutments during the local scour process water flow encounters a structure and accelerates creating a horseshoe vortex which loses sediment in the flow direction wang et al 2017 the horseshoe vortex in fig 1 b provides a visual representation of the flow structure during the local scour process the directed flow pushes and transports sediment at the base the lee wake vortices generated downstream erode the sediment behind the pier breusers and raudkivi 1991 as the depth of the resulting scour hole increases the strength of the horseshoe vortex decreases which subsequently decreases the transport rate of sediment arneson et al 2012 scour is greatly affected by the type of sediment loose and granular soils are more easily eroded by flowing water while more cohesive or cemented soils are more scour resistant arneson et al 2012 however the scour hole can be deep in cohesive sediment as in sand beds if the time is long enough to reach the maximum depth while sand may develop a maximum scour depth within hours limestone may not experience a maximum depth for years wang et al 2017 another factor related to sediment transport which affects local and contraction scour is being clear water or live bed scour clear water scour occurs when the water flow does not transport bed sediment or that the amount of sediment transported is less than the capacity of the flow this type of scour occurs in coarse bed materials armored streams flatbeds with low flow heavily vegetated beds and in the case of riprap around bridge piers where rocks are much larger than the transported sediment arneson et al 2012 live bed scour transports bed sediment from upstream to scour hole live bed scour is cyclic meaning that the developed scour hole for example during a flooding stage fills back during flood falls for instance in a river with coarse bed materials the riverbed may be subjected to a clear water scour before and after floods and live bed scour during flooding or when the discharge rates are the highest clear water scour causes approximately a 10 increase in depth compared to live bed scour and may occur over a longer time the critical velocity of the median particle size d 50 refers to the speed at which the motion of a particle initiates and is used to determine whether clear water or live bed scour will occur if the mean upstream flow velocity ū is less than or equal to the critical velocity of d 50 then the local scour can be classified as clear water melville and coleman 2000 the critical velocity depends on the flow depth and the size of the bed material if the ratio of the shear velocity of the flow to the fall velocity of d 50 exceeds two live bed scour may occur in clear water scour sand beds with dunes tend to increase the equilibrium scour depth by 30 compared to live bed scour but in large rivers the dunes tend to plane out the clear water condition further affects local scour in that scouring continues until the shear stress caused by the horseshoe vortex equals the critical shear stress of the sediment at the bottom of the scour hole under the live bed condition however scouring continues until the inflow sediment equals its outflow arneson et al 2012 local scour can be further classified as occurring due to wave current and a combination of the two in wave induced scour the keulegan carpenter number is the main influential parameter sumer and fredsøe 2001a the keulegan carpenter number k c is defined as the amplitude of the flow velocity oscillation times the period of oscillation divided by a characteristic length scale such as the hydraulic diameter of the pier similar to the reduced velocity in wind tunnel testing aly 2014 a bridge pier may be subjected to forces in multiple directions due to wave and tidal actions although wave and tidal actions can influence local scour at the piles and piers of elevated structures in this paper we will focus on steady flow local scour representing inland waterway bridge systems experiencing flow primarily in one direction 3 laboratory studies for scour modeling experiments carried out on local scour are categorized in three areas hydraulic structural and geotechnical wang et al 2017 hydraulic studies usually focus on the flow mechanisms of local scour however local scour depends on the structure therefore hydraulic studies should account for the structural system geotechnical investigations usually address the variables related to sediment flume tests are often needed to measure the scour depth and rate under steady current flows wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2010 field measurements are usually employed to develop predictive models 3 1 laboratory driven predictive models sediment bed patterns and scour depth are measured to derive relationships between several variables ni et al 2020 yilin yang et al 2020 these variables include the flow depth effective pier width froude number shear stress and critical shear stress jones 1984 the models can be grouped into three categories 1 models for fine bed materials 2 models with a hypothesis that the depth of flow is more important than the velocity for sediment transport and 3 models with the velocity expressed as a function of reynolds or froude number the limitations of these models include accuracy only over the region of the empirical data the primary use of uniform non cohesive soils and the lack of field measurements to correlate equations with laboratory testing to develop better predictive models numerous studies were conducted breusers and raudkivi 1991 melville and coleman 2000 sumer and fredsøe 2001b the normalized scour depth or the scour depth divided by the pile diameter d s d for uniform diameter sediment is closely correlated to the flow intensity normalized velocity water depth normalized by pile diameter and pile diameter normalized by median sediment grain diameter d d 50 two general equations to determine local scour were developed arneson et al 2012 melville and coleman 2000 1 d s k y b k i k d k s k θ k g k t y s y 1 2 0 k 1 k 2 k 3 a y 1 0 65 f r 1 0 43 each k in eqn 1 is a parameter that influences the scour depth d s or y s k yb accounts for the depth of a pier k i accounts for the flow intensity k d depends on the sediment size k s is for the pier shape k θ is for the pier alignment k g is for channel geometry and k t accounts for time the scour depth y s over the flow depth y 1 is a function of several parameters k 1 a factor of pier shape k 2 a factor of the angle of attack of the flow and k 3 a factor of bed condition a is the pier width and fr 1 is the upstream froude number two empirical expressions have been found to better fit the time history data of local scour in clear water sheppard et al 2004 2 d s t a 1 1 1 a b t c 1 1 1 c d t d s t a 1 exp b t c 1 exp dt in eqn 2 the constants a b c and d produce the best least squares fit of the experimental data these equations yield more accurate equilibrium scour depth the duration of the test should be at least the same as that of the experiment conducted in sheppard et al 2004 to produce accurate estimates of the equilibrium depth the time required to reach the equilibrium scour depth is a vital parameter in predictive models scour depth was expressed as a function of time using cylindrical and square bridge pier models in a laboratory under clear water conditions and uniform bed materials yanmaz and altinbilek 1991 a semi empirical time dependent analysis of local scour was conducted using sediment continuity equations the vortex field was calculated in front of the cylinder and at the trailing wake vortex system graf and istiarto 2002 by using acoustic doppler velocimetry adv the horseshoe vortex was studied within a developing scour hole for cylindrical and square piers dey and raikar 2007 it was observed that for the two piers the flow structure and turbulence intensities in the horseshoe vortex in a developing scour hole are reasonably similar experiments on bridge pier scour were carried out under steady and unsteady clear water conditions with uniform and non uniform sediments a scheme was proposed for computing the scour depth evolution chang et al 2004 the temporal evolution of jet driven scour depth in a pothole laying on a cohesionless granular bed was investigated by using diverse approaches ordinary differential equations were developed in bombardelli et al 2018 and the theory was validated using datasets the temporal variation of scour depth around a vertical wall spur dike was assessed and the influencing parameters were identified pandey et al 2020b a modified sheppard melville method and a new corrected time scale equation were recommended to predict clear water scour depth and scour evolution for complex bridge piers yifan yang et al 2020 new data on the temporal evolution of downstream clear water scour depth at a submerged weir were presented wang et al 2020 a dimensionless equilibrium timescale was defined and its dependence on these parameters was studied the temporal evolution of scour depth in cohesive sediments was extensively studied in the literature bombardelli et al 2018 chaudhuri et al 2018 hamidifar and omid 2017 lodhi et al 2017 2018 muzzammil et al 2015 local scour in clay sand mixed cohesive sediment beds was also covered in several studies debnath and chaudhuri 2010 2011 2012 khalid et al 2018 najafzadeh and barani 2014 local scour was measured around a group of piles for different spacings and skew angles it was noted that predictive models do not agree with measurements salim and jones 1996 a method was then developed to predict scour for pile arrangements local scour was measured around three adjacent piles with different arrangements to find the arrangement that creates the smallest scour depth wang et al 2017 a relationship between the aspect ratio of submerged piles and the timescale was developed yao et al 2018 additional experimental studies were conducted to understand the effect of pier shape on the scour depth al shukur and obeid 2016 3 2 scale issues researchers have yet to agree upon a scaling method that takes into account all relevant parameters zhao et al 2010 equilibrium scour depth was measured under large scale turbulence ettema et al 2006 the normalized scour depth was increased when the pier diameter was decreased a scour depth adjustment factor was calculated to scale local scour however difficulties still arise in scaling the flow characteristics as well as the sediment size of critical importance to local scour research is the dependence on the sediment type and the mechanisms behind sediment transport the answer to fundamental questions such as when the erosion initiates where particles are transported to and how the particles interact with each other may vary depending on the type and structure of the soil for instance particle size adhesion composition and the degree of saturation wang et al 2017 the sediment size is the most influential parameter since it is a primary factor in determining the scour shape and the fall velocity melville and coleman 2000 the median particle size or d 50 can adequately describe alluvial sediment in uniform materials the dimensionless sediment size d is another vital parameter julien 2010 3 d d 50 g 1 g v 2 1 3 where g is the specific gravity of the sediment υ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and g is the gravitational acceleration the initiation of the sediment motion relies on the critical value of the shields parameter τ c which depends on the dimensionless sediment size d eq 4 expresses the shields parameter τ as the ratio of the bed shear force to the submerged particle weight 4 τ τ 0 γ s γ d s u 2 g 1 g d s h s f g 1 d s in eq 4 τ 0 ρ u 2 is the bed shear stress u is the shear velocity γ s is the specific weight of sediment particles γ is the specific weight of water h is the flow depth and s f is the friction slope julien 2018 the critical shear velocity u c or the velocity of the incipient motion is defined as u c τ c ρ for sand with a mean sediment size of 0 5 mm for example the critical velocity is approximately 0 016 m s and the critical shear stress is about 0 27 pa estimates in the literature show that a shear stress of 0 1 pa can cause incipient motion in silts but not in sand also a shear stress of 1 pa can cause incipient motion in sand but not in gravel julien 2010 different forms of the above equation are available in literature an earlier formula for the critical shear velocity was proposed melville 1997 a useful expression to calculate the critical mean channel velocity v c was established to understand the sediment motion melville and coleman 2000 5 v c u c 5 75 l n 5 53 y d 50 in eq 5 y is the flow depth in a later study the shields rouse equation was adapted for the calculation of the critical shear stress for a dimensionless sediment diameter guo 2002 the critical shear stress calculated from this equation matched the experimental data for diverse types of sediment with different diameters like the scaling difficulties observed in the structural aspects of local scour as well as aerodynamic modeling aly 2016 aly and bitsuamlak 2013 addressing the scaling issues in sediment modeling is challenging the effects of the sediment size on the scour depth were investigated under three uniform sediment sizes at three different model scales lee and sturm 2009 a distortion was realized between laboratory and field measurements due to improper scaling of the horseshoe vortex scaling scour in laboratory settings to accurately represent field observations still poses a challenge for researchers wang et al 2017 however computational fluid dynamics offer an attractive means for predicting flow velocities and scour at full scale 4 scour prognosis via cfd modeling one of the main factors limiting the accurate prediction of scour by physical modeling is the scaling from laboratory settings to field settings and vice versa scale issues the froude number and reynolds number both can affect scour but usually are not accounted for simultaneously one of the two numbers often sacrifices the other however one of the advantages of numerical simulations of local scour is to partially resolve the scale issues other advantages include the ability to model complex conditions that experiments cannot achieve observe the mechanical behavior of the process in detail and reduce the physical space required to simulate the process wang et al 2017 most numerical simulations use computational fluid dynamics cfd to model the scour process liu et al 2019 yazdanfar et al 2021 yu and zhu 2020 zhao et al 2021 the limitations of this method include the long computational time as per the need for a refined mesh to accurately represent the sediment grains the difficulty in approximating the interaction parameters such as particle porosity and drag coefficients and the many assumptions made to predict the scour depth are discussed in the literature wang et al 2017 most cfd studies combine hydrodynamic and morphologic models to simulate the flow field and sediment transport hydrodynamic models are classified into three categories steady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations unsteady rans urans or large eddy simulation les navier stokes n s equations describe the motion of a fluid which is usually associated with turbulence aghaee and hakimzadeh 2010 direct numerical simulation dns of n s equations can resolve the spatial and temporal range of turbulence although dns would be the most accurate method for scour modeling it is limited to low reynolds numbers due to its inhibitive computational cost compared to dns a simplified model would combine the continuity equation and the rans equations zhou 2017 6 u 0 ρ u t ρ u u t p 2 μ m s ρ r ρ f here ρ is the fluid density u is the fluid velocity vector s is the mean strain rate tensor μ m is the fluid dynamic molecular viscosity r is the reynolds stress tensor which may be calculated for various turbulence models p denotes pressure and f is the external force the left side of eq 6 includes the local time derivative of velocity and convective acceleration the right side of the equation includes the effects of viscosity pressure gradient and external forces under the boussinesq eddy viscosity assumption the eddy viscosity is modeled by momentum transfer due to turbulent eddies this is based on the analogy between molecular motion based laminar momentum and scalar transport and eddy motion based turbulent momentum and scalar transport kundu et al 2012 the molecular viscosity describes how the momentum is transferred by molecular motion in the rans equations r represents the mean viscous stress and is defined as follows 7 r u u t 2 μ t ρ s 2 3 k δ ij s 1 2 u u t where μt is the eddy viscosity k is turbulence kinetic energy u is the fluctuating component of the velocity and δ ij is the kronecker delta reynolds stresses develop from the nonlinear advection term of the conservation of momentum equation and represent the average stresses induced by the flow fluctuations kundu et al 2012 reynolds stresses may be considered as the rate of mean momentum transfer due to flow fluctuations reynolds stresses tend to be much larger than viscous stresses except close to a solid surface where the fluctuations vanish and the mean flow gradients are large to solve the rans equations the two equation eddy viscosity models are utilized one equation for the turbulence kinetic energy and the other equation is related to the turbulent length scale menter 1992 the primary models in rans simulations are the k ε and k ω turbulence closures the k ε model was developed in 1973 and has been improved over time jones and launder 1973 in the standard k ε equation the eddy viscosity μt is expressed as follows 8 μ t c μ ρ k 2 ε where k is the turbulence kinetic energy ε is the dissipation rate and c μ is a constant the rate of production of turbulence p k is given by 9 p k μ t u u t the two equations of the k ε turbulence closure are 10 ρ k t ρ u k μ m μ t σ k k p k ρ ε 11 ρ ε t ρ u ε μ m μ t σ ε ε c 1 ε k p k c 2 ρ ε 2 k in these equations c μ c 1 c 2 σ k and σ ε are constants primarily given as c μ 0 09 c 1 1 44 c 2 1 92 σ k 1 0 and σ ε 1 3 launder and spalding 1974 although being widely used the k ε model has several drawbacks including a lack of sensitivity to adverse pressure gradients the model over predicts the shear stress which is often a challenge in the modeling of flow separation menter 1993 another disadvantage is that the equations in the model may be stiff and convergence may be difficult due to the damping terms several researchers have shown the effectiveness of the k ε turbulence closure under certain conditions the scour hole created by an inundated bridge deck was experimentally measured under steady flow at a high reynolds number tulimilli et al 2010 the hydrodynamic model was coupled with a sediment transport model that simulates the scour of the initially flat bed in iterative increments sediment transport is initiated when the shear stress exceeds its critical value the flow mechanism was studied for three piles with different arrangements under steady flow using rans simulations with the k ε turbulence closure and sediment scour model the k ε turbulence model was used to reduce the computational cost the simulated results fairly agreed with the experimental data zhang et al 2017 an improvement upon the standard k ε model is the realizable k ε model the realizable k ε equations follow the standard k ε equations except for the eddy viscosity μ t which no longer has c μ as a constant in eq 8 for the realizable k ε model the term c μ is calculated as follows 12 c μ 1 a 0 a s k u ε where a 0 and a s are constants and u is the square root of the sum of the square of the mean rate of the state tensor and the mean rate of the rotation tensor the model is called realizable because it satisfies the physics in turbulent flows as well as certain mathematical constraints on the reynolds stresses some advantages include more accurate predictions of the spread rate of both planar and round jets as well as the capability of modeling flows involving rotation flows with boundary layers under strong adverse pressure gradients flows with separation and flows with recirculation spalart 2000 the k ω model improves upon the k ε model in that the damping functions are no longer employed and the dirichlet boundary conditions allow for better numerical stability menter 1993 wilcox 1993 the k ω turbulence closure significantly improves the modeling of flows with adverse pressure gradient although it is sensitive to the value chosen for the free stream variable eq 13 solves for the turbulence kinetic energy k and eq 14 solves for the dissipation of the turbulence energy ω the parameters k ω and ε are defined in eq 15 13 ρ k t ρ u k μ m σ k μ t k r u β ρ k ω 14 ρ ω t ρ u ω μ m σ ω μ t ω γ v t r u ρ β ω 2 2 1 f 1 ρ σ ω 2 ω k ω t 15 k 1 2 u i u i ω ε k β ε v u i x k u i x k the new parameters μ m σ k β σ ω β σ ω 2 and γ are constants defined in the literature except for v t which is the turbulence kinematic viscosity and f 1 which is a blending function the mentor baseline bsl model blended the k ε and the k ω models and helped reduce the ambiguity of the free stream term like the k ε model the k ω model under predicts the flow separation the shear stress transport sst model improves upon the standard k ω model and assumes that the turbulence shear stress is proportional to the turbulence kinetic energy in the logarithmic and wake regions of the boundary layer and the eddy viscosity is limited by taking the maximum term in the denominator of the eddy viscosity equation menter 1993 the numerical simulations underpredicted the scour depth by 15 upstream of the pier and up to 30 downstream similarly a 10 20 underprediction of the scour depth was found for steady flow around submerged cylinders zhao et al 2010 the underprediction may arise from the steady state flow modeling which did not account for the unsteady effects of the fluctuating velocity components of the horseshoe and the lee wake vortices however with the consideration of flow altering countermeasures more reliable designs can be achieved 5 flow altering countermeasures one of the earliest comprehensive studies on scour countermeasures was published by the national cooperative highway research program nchrp in 1998 parker et al 1998 the study provided recommendations on the use of scour countermeasures other than riprap although the preferred method was bed armoring with riprap or cable tied blocks over a geotextile other countermeasures include sacrificial piles upstream sheet piles collars and horizontal plates vanes or plates modified pier shape or texture slots in piers or pier groups and suction applied to the pier since then other flow altering techniques have been developed including internal connecting tubes surface guide panels threading and sleeve and downstream bed sill tafarojnoruz et al 2010 scour countermeasures may be categorized as pier geometry modification or openings pier attachments bed attachments among other techniques 5 1 pier geometry and pier openings research regarding the effects of the geometry of the pier or the shape itself shows that reductions in the scour depth can be realized studies on the pier shape have been conducted with a general understanding that the scour depth can be reduced as the pier becomes more streamlined melville and coleman 2000 the scour depth is reduced or increased by the following factors for the following pier shapes 1 1 for square 1 0 for circular round nose or group of circular piers and 0 9 for piers with a sharp nose arneson et al 2012 in an experimental study a larger variety of pier shapes were considered al shukur and obeid 2016 compared to a circular pier the streamlined pier reduced the scour depth by 50 57 for three different clear water flows the next best scour reducing geometries were the hexagonal shape 28 40 the sharp nose 23 29 and the elliptical shape 7 20 al shukur and obeid 2016 experimental testing and cfd modeling were conducted for circular diamond and square piers and the findings agreed with previous literature that scour increases for the diamond shape and even more for the square shape when compared to the circular pier khosronejad et al 2012 the optimization of the pier geometry relies on the flow angle which may not capture the realistic field conditions tafarojnoruz et al 2010 scour was investigated for complex pier shapes that arise when scouring exposes pile caps and the piles themselves baghbadorani et al 2018 fifty two tests were conducted on four different complex pier models in clear water conditions to help improve the accuracy of the published hec 18 equations richardson and davis 2001 the experiments agreed with the equations which predict reduced scour depth as the pile cap is exposed to sediment that interrupts and minimizes the downflow effects a collar located at the base of a pier or below the level of the bed works under the same mechanism the performance of collars and exposed pile caps rely on a minimum diameter to reduce scour otherwise the scour depth may increase parker et al 1998 although a pile cap is not meant to be a countermeasure it is beneficial for the safety of a bridge as the last expedient in case other countermeasures inspection or maintenance plans fail the performance of a pier with a vertical slot was experimentally investigated to understand its ability to reduce scour by diverting the flow away from the bed or by reducing the downflow effects chiew 1992 a reduction of 20 was realized in the maximum scour depth for a slot length of twice the diameter of the pier and a width of at least one quarter of the diameter a reduction of 45 in the maximum scour depth was achieved after experimentally testing different sizes of openings in different shapes of piers el ghorab 2013 a significant scour depth reduction of 89 was realized by utilizing a sacrificial perforated pile upstream of a perforated main pile each pile has a hole that is 43 of the pile diameter orientated at 45 elnikhely 2017 other studies had shown that sacrificial piles alone may reduce the maximum scour depth by 44 in the field and up to 60 under laboratory conditions parker et al 1998 nevertheless pier openings cause practical problems including potential blockage by debris and a reduction in the pier s strength 5 2 pier attachments experiments with plates and vanes to reduce scour depth began as early as the 1960s gaudio et al 2012 before that time vertical plates installed in the channel were primarily used to prevent lateral channel migration although a reduction in scour had been noticed the effectiveness of vertical plates and vanes was compared showing that vertical plates can separate the flow around a pier and hence reduce the intensity of the horseshoe vortex parker et al 1998 vertical plates with an aspect ratio of 3 1 may reduce scour by 70 80 and they are effective in low and high flow rates tafarojnoruz et al 2010 one of the more successful vane designs includes the delta vane which disrupts the flow at the base of the pier and produces vortices that rotate against the horseshoe vortex gupta 2002 this design has shown scour reduction of up to 32 in unsteady flow and 67 in clear water laboratory settings however this design is highly dependent on the flow depth tafarojnoruz et al 2010 the use of a vertical guide wall and vertically inclined plates at 45 showed up to 90 reduction in clear water scour with similar limitations as the delta vane another pier attachment was developed which consists of a guide wall with vanes daido and yano 1995 the guide wall is intended to decrease the intensity of the horseshoe vortex by disturbing the approaching flow slanting vanes are used to further decrease the intensity of the horseshoe vortex the results showed that at a 90 reduction in the scour depth was realized compared to the unprotected circular pier this design was tested under a few flow velocities in a later study this configuration reduced scour by only 50 compared to the unprotected circular pier parker et al 1998 the effect of submerged vanes on the flow pattern around a pier was numerically studied by testing combinations of 2 4 and 6 vanes angled at 20 and 30 azizi et al 2016 three plates angled at 30 significantly reduced the velocity near the bed this decrease in velocity is associated with a decrease in the ability of the flow to transport sediment most experiment discussed thus far focused on scour in steady flow the effectiveness of splitter plates and threaded piles under waves and current was investigated dey et al 2006 the main scour mechanism under waves is vortex shedding attaching a splitter and threading the pile or wrapping cables in a helical pattern around the pile can disrupt vortex shedding this approach is known in wind engineering applications as well for example the older antenna of the car had a spiral shape to disrupt vortex shedding and hence reduce the vortex shedding effects with a cable to pile diameter ratio of 0 75 a maximum reduction of scour under waves of 51 was realized under steady current a maximum scour depth reduction of 46 was realized for a cable to pile diameter ratio of 0 1 however the splitter plate reduced scour by 62 a combination of flow altering countermeasures may prove to be even more effective the following combinations were experimentally investigated in clear water submerged vanes and a bed sill slot and sacrificial piles collar and sacrificial piles slot and collar and bed sill and collar gaudio et al 2012 most combinations did not reduce scour more than the individual countermeasures however the slot and collar combination reduced scour by 82 but its efficiency was reduced when the collar rim was exposed for example during degradation or when the slot is blocked by debris when a sill was positioned upstream of a pier with a collar scour was reduced by 63 76 but degradation is a potential concern in summary there are many countermeasures including active countermeasures that attempt to alter the flow pattern around the pier with a potential to reduce scour each method such as altering pier geometry sacrificial piles pier attachments or openings has potential benefits but may have some concerns there is no single solution for the local scour problem so different countermeasures and solutions may be considered in the design process especially for unique projects in the following section we will create and test computational models that will be used to study different scour countermeasures 6 case study of cfd application to predict local scour here we model and predict the bed shear stress and velocity around a pier we evaluate different turbulence closures and validate the model with available experimental data later the model with the proper turbulence closures will be employed to investigate the performance of proposed scour countermeasures 6 1 computational domain a computational domain was created using the same dimensions as those in roulund et al 2005 a schematic representation of the computational domain is shown in fig 2 the dimensions of the domain are given in terms of the diameter of the pier d a symmetry boundary condition was considered at the side boundaries this condition assumes a zero flux of all quantities across a symmetry plane the shear stress is also set to zero so a surface with symmetry boundary conditions may be a slip surface the flow along the sidewalls of the flume in the experiment was a no slip surface but because of the distance of the side walls to the cylinder the effect of the side walls was not anticipated to impact the results significantly the blockage ratio is 1d 20d or 5 the experiment was performed with a width of 5 6d which has a blockage ratio of approximately 18 the blockage effect did not pose any significant problems because the flow velocity was increased by less than 3 close to the sidewalls roulund et al 2005 symmetry condition was applied at the top surface of the domain this will place a lid on the fluid surface since the free surface is not modeled since a lower froude number will decrease the amount of elevation of the free surface of an object in a flow such as a wake at the bow of a boat lower froude numbers may be modeled with a lid condition two experiments with froude numbers of 0 2 and 0 5 were performed for a depth of flow of 26 cm and a 31 cm pier diameter roulund et al 2005 a height difference of 22 compared with the water depth was found for a froude number equal to 0 5 the height difference was only 3 8 for a froude number of 0 2 the velocity profiles in both cases were also compared and the froude number of 0 2 matched closely with the free surface velocity distributions the rigid lid approximation is therefore applicable when the froude number is of the order of 0 2 the boundary layer thickness to pier diameter δ d was kept constant the value of δ d is about 1 the cfd analysis was carried out for a δ d value that is similar to the reference experimental data roulund et al 2005 it is worth mentioning that the separation of the bed boundary layer forming the horseshoe vortex will be delayed if the boundary layer thickness to pier diameter ratio δ d is small δ d 0 5 this may lead to a more uniform velocity distribution in the upstream boundary layer flow which can lead to a smaller size horseshoe vortex for small values of δ d the boundary layer may not separate no horseshoe vortex the boundary condition for the inlet was a velocity inlet a velocity profile based on the average velocity was applied to the inlet as well as a constant absolute velocity equal to the main flow velocity the turbulence was set to 5 with a length scale of 0 54 roulund et al 2005 the bottom surface and pier surface are wall conditions with no slip wall functions dependent on the turbulence closure were employed as will be discussed in the next subsection the outlet was set as a pressure outlet zero gradient and neumann conditions were applied 6 2 mesh generation a structured o grid mesh was created fig 3 the mesh cell height in the vertical direction is smaller towards the bed so that the height of the first cell from the bed surface is 1 0 10 4 m the cell height also becomes smaller towards the pier surface the height of the first cell on the pier wall is 6 3 10 5 m this size was determined from the y value to resolve the viscous sublayer white 2002 the k ω sst model was the initial turbulence closure which requires a y value of less than 1 ansys inc 2021 16 y ρ y u τ μ u τ τ w ρ τ w 1 2 c f ρ u 2 c f 0 058 r e l 0 2 c f is the skin friction and all other quantities including the reynolds number viscosity density and flow velocity are known table 1 for the standard and realizable k ε models enhanced wall treatments were employed these treatments bring improvements over the standard wall functions that are not recommended for use under boundary layer separation khaled et al 2021 the enhanced wall treatment is a y insensitive approach and will act as a wall function if the first grid point is in the log layer to predict the physics in the near wall region this method formulates the law of the wall as a single wall law for the entire wall region by combining the linear laminar and logarithmic turbulent laws of the wall ansys inc 2021 the wall shear stress like the normal velocity gradient at the wall is dependent on the formulation of the near wall region using the enhanced wall treatment the generated mesh is shown in fig 3 notice how the mesh elements decrease towards the cylinder and bottom surface the number of elements was then optimized following a grid independence study and the results were compared with available experimental data the mesh characteristics for each trial are listed in table 2 the element count refers to the number of elements in each direction over height z direction width y direction and length x direction the o grid around the cylinder for extra grid refinement was not altered from test to test since the y value depends on ensuring the first cell height remains the same 6 3 discretization the flow governing equations were solved using a pressure based finite volume discretization process a control volume based technique was employed which converts a general scalar transport equation to an algebraic equation that can be solved numerically ansys inc 2021 this control volume technique consists of integrating the transport equation to yield a discrete equation that expresses the conservation law a second order upwind scheme was applied the momentum equations were also discretized the simple algorithm is used to couple velocity and pressure for mass conservation to obtain the pressure field a predictor corrector method is then used to predict and correct the pressure and flux fields the models were run for a varying number of iteration steps until the scaled residuals were decreased and the solution was converged the drag coefficient of the pier leveled out to constant and the mean value of the lift coefficient was zero for steady state rans simulations blevins 1984 7 cfd validation a velocity profile was applied at the inlet with the mean flow velocity as the main scaling parameter and run in an empty domain with the k ω sst turbulence closure the resulting velocity profile at the location of the cylinder in the middle of the computational domain was then compared to the undisturbed experimental velocity profile the velocity profiles for different values of d at a constant inlet velocity were also compared the model was simulated using the rans equations with the k ω sst turbulence closure for each mesh in table 3 the experimental data include the x component of the velocity at a distance 2d upstream and downstream of the cylinder in the plane of symmetry or at y 10d roulund et al 2005 we investigated the ability of structured and unstructured grids to replicate the flow characteristics from the experiment a structured mesh may be more spatially efficient but the fluid domain should be subdivided to control the mesh intensity for accurate cfd simulations an unstructured mesh may use differently shaped elements such as tetrahedral shapes to generate the volume mesh with inputs such as the maximum global size and surface size with fewer inputs the unstructured mesh is easier to apply to complex geometries however creating an unstructured mesh is an iterative process and the grid is usually refined by trial and error we used the same pier and domain size to create the unstructured mesh as shown in fig 2 the maximum global element size and the maximum element size on any surface can be set ansys suggests adding prismatic layers at solid surfaces to capture the shear stress and other essential flow physics in the boundary layer ansys inc 2021 in one of the first iterations with the unstructured mesh we used a maximum global element size of 0 2 m we added three prism layers to the bottom surface and the pier surface with a maximum element size of 0 1 m a maximum near wall height of 0 01 m and a growth rate of 1 2 the unstructured mesh was computed with 350k tetrahedral shaped elements when this unstructured mesh was used to simulate the flow with the k ε realizable turbulence closure the solution converged the drag coefficient leveled at a constant value but the lift coefficient was irregular before nearing zero to improve upon the coarseness of the mesh without significantly increasing the number of elements we placed a mesh density around the cylinder pier the unstructured mesh requires more elements compared to the structured mesh to produce consistent results to increase the number of elements without significantly increasing the computation time the size of the domain was optimized the original size was chosen as 20d x 20d x 2d to safely assume the effects of the walls did not impact the results of flow around the cylinder and close to the bottom surface the domain size was decreased to a width of 11d a height of 1 5d and the width was further decreased to 9d to check if the results would change each simulation was run using the k ε realizable turbulence closure since this model performed well for the structured mesh case the results of the mesh optimization are shown in fig 4 for the x component of velocity in fig 4 it is shown that the change in the domain size has a minimum effect the ability to predict the x component of the upstream velocity flow because the physical experiment was conducted in a flume of 5 6d width there were likely effects from the flume walls that are now incorporated into the numerical model by decreasing the domain width this effect is further exaggerated in the downstream region of the pier where the 9d width yields result close to those of the experiment the simulation results for the reduced domain width other than 9d were relatively close to each other in the downstream zone in general only the 9d width domain seems to affect the simulation of the x component of velocity for the regions considered considering the benefits of predicting the x velocity component for a reduced domain size of 11d which also predicted the z velocity components downstream of the pier well when combined with a 1 5d height this combination seems to be the best optimum domain size to be used for the investigation of different flow countermeasures in the coming section once an optimum domain size was determined the mesh parameters were optimized to resolve the viscous sublayer if the unstructured mesh could adequately resolve the viscous sublayer the standard k ω and k ω sst may prove to predict the flow velocities better than the k ε models since they are better at modeling adverse pressure gradients the wall and cylinder s first cell height should be small so a mesh was made with smaller elements on the surface around the cylinder to reduce the total number of elements and computational time another mesh was made with a mesh density with a maximum size of 0 1 m at the same location as the inner bottom surface the parameters of the two different meshes are listed in table 3 each mesh has five prism layers each mesh was used with the k ω sst model since both k ω models performed relatively similar compared to experimental data and the k ω sst is regarded as an improvement upon the k ω model the density mesh was then used with the standard and realizable k ε turbulence models with enhanced wall treatment the x and z velocity components from each simulation were compared with experimental results in figs 5 6 all models yield the x velocity component upstream of the pier closely although the results vary more when z 1 9 d this is likely due to the mesh near the bottom surface not adequately capturing the flow at this height for the downstream region of the pier the k ω realizable and the standard models predict the flow better than the case of using the structured mesh this could be a feature of the tetrahedral element shape which may provide better vertical coverage of the boundary layer since the elements do not form distinct layers in the vertical direction compared to the structured mesh the standard k ε and realizable k ε closures more closely match the experimental data downstream of the pier for the x velocity components the realizable k ε tends to predict the downstream velocity slightly better than the standard k ε as shown in figs 5 6 another finding of the mesh simulations using the parameters in table 3 include the difference in the wall y values between structured and unstructured grids fig 7 a shows the wall y values are between 0 1 and 1 0 for the structured mesh the unstructured mesh would require many more elements than the structured mesh to achieve a similar wall y value the unstructured y values are shown in fig 7 b where they vary between 1 0 and 17 the two k ω models tended to approximate the experimental data better with the unstructured mesh for a greater y value this may be due to the improvement of the tetrahedral shape over the rectangular prisms of the structured mesh or achieving a y value close to 1 0 may not be that critical the parameters of each mesh are listed in table 4 and they are labeled mesh 1 2 and 3 each mesh has a mesh density to refine elements around the pier the unstructured mesh was optimized for the realizable k ε model so that the mesh parameters that most closely match the experimental data could be applied to other pier shapes to investigate the performance of different flow countermeasures in a comparative study 8 numerical investigations of different countermeasures to reduce local scour we investigated four different countermeasures to reduce local scour fig 8 the proposed countermeasures are 1 tapered streamlined sheath 2 delta vane 3 guide wall with slanting vanes and 4 angled plate footing 8 1 tapered streamline sheath the tapered streamlined sheath was modeled in autocad fig 8 a the pier has the same dimensions as those in roulund et al 2005 in terms of the diameter the width of the sheath is 1d and the total length is equal to 3d the sheath extends 0 5d vertically where it meets the pier the countermeasure was then meshed using tetrahedral shaped elements with the same parameters as those of the unstructured mesh three prism layers with a growth rate of 1 2 are applied at the wall the total elements are 1 36 million the generated mesh is shown in fig 9 the streamlined tapered pier was simulated using the model that best represented the experimental data the rans equations with the realizable k ε turbulence closure the boundary conditions remained the same from the previous structured and unstructured simulations so that the resulting flow structures may be compared contours of bed shear stress and velocity were obtained after the simulations were completed each generated figure was compared against the pier that most closely approximated the experimental data the bed shear stress is a critical parameter in determining an incipient motion of sediment fig 10 shows that the cylindrical pier experiences shear stress of about 1 pa whereas the streamlined tapered sheath has maximum shear stress of 0 8 pa 20 reduction there is a larger region of higher shear stress for the cylindrical pier compared to the streamlined pier sand could be transported in the red regions for the cylindrical pier whereas only finer sands could be expected to be transported along the sides of the streamlined tapered sheath both piers could cause sediment with a critical shear stress of 0 5 pa to be transported about the same amount based on the green portion of the contour transport occurring most along the sides of the piers is consistent with the previous figures the earlier figures indicated transport might also occur downstream of the streamlined tapered pier from this figure sediment with a critical shear stress of 0 3 coarse sand could be transported just aft of the tapered pier but only silts could be transported aft of the cylindrical pier this confirms the ability of the streamlined sheath to reduce scour at the face of the pier compared to the cylindrical pier fig 11 shows that the velocity at z 1 9 is closely correlated with the bed shear stress in fig 10 the streamlined sheath reduced the magnitude of the velocity by approximately 10 from 0 5 to 0 45 m s which reduces the ability of the flow to initiate sediment movement the streamlined shape allows the velocity field in this plane to be more constant compared to the cylindrical pier since this plane is approximately one cm above the bed the velocity will decrease logarithmically to zero at this height sand with a critical velocity ranging between 0 01 m s and 0 1 m s can be transported except for the dark blue regions fig 11 the velocity is 0 35 m s around the aft half of the tapered sheath where it is sharply decreased to 0 002 m s for the aft half of the cylindrical pier accordingly more sediment can be transported in this region for the streamlined pier based on the reduction of bed shear stress by 20 and the decrease in the velocity magnitude by 10 the streamlined tapered sheath would be a good flow altering scour countermeasure especially upstream of the pier furthermore the sheath at the face of the pier acts as a bed armoring device as the downflow deflects from it instead of the sediment for this mean flow velocity one would expect sand to be transported along the sides of the pier just forward of center for the cylindrical pier and only finer sands along the sides for the streamlined tapered pier the streamlined tapered pier does not have a decrease in flow velocity directly downstream of the pier to the extent of the cylindrical pier immediately after the aft of the cylindrical pier silt could be transported based on the value of the critical shear stress whereas sand with a critical shear stress of 0 3 pa could be transported aft of the streamlined tapered sheath at this flow rate however the tapered streamlined sheath can effectively reduce the transport of coarser sand and finer sediments in front of the pier 8 2 delta vane the delta vane was modeled in autocad fig 8 b the dimensions for the delta vane are 2d from the apex to the opposite side and 1 5d for the length of the side opposite to the apex the apex is attached to the bed upstream of the pier and the opposite side is raised and attached to the pier so that the vane forms a 15 angle with the bed a spinal rib is also attached under the vane for support the countermeasure was then meshed using tetrahedral shaped elements with the same parameters as those of the unstructured mesh three prism layers with a growth rate of 1 2 are applied at the wall the total elements are 1 5 million the generated mesh is shown in fig 12 the delta vane attached pier was simulated using the rans equations with the realizable k ε turbulence closure the boundary conditions remained the same from the previous structured and unstructured simulations so that the resulting flow structures may be compared contours of velocity pressure coefficient bed shear stress and turbulence intensity were obtained after the simulation was complete each generated figure was compared against the cylindrical pier fig 13 shows promising results in the delta vane s ability to minimize shear stress on the bed the highest shear stress for the delta vane attached plate is 0 7 pa at the tip of the apex this is approximately 30 less than the maximum shear stress for the cylindrical pier furthermore this is a small region at 0 7 pa which indicates sediment with critical shear stress less than about 0 5 pa sand will be transported both piers have about the same area with 0 5 pa shear stress and so would transport a similar amount of sediment for this shear stress the delta vane experiences a larger zone bed shear stress of 0 3 pa compared to the cylindrical pier which indicates that more sediment could be transported however unlike the tapered streamline pier the delta vane decreases the bed shear stress in the wake zone to about zero pa similar to the cylindrical pier this means that both the cylindrical pier and the delta vane countermeasure may not transport significant sediment in the wake zone the delta vane countermeasure may direct the approaching flow upward away from the bed fig 14 shows the effectiveness of the delta vane to reduce the velocity the velocity magnitude is the largest at the apex of the vane where the flow is directed upward away from the bed the maximum magnitude of the velocity is about 0 45 m s which is 10 lower than the corresponding maximum velocity experienced with the cylinder 0 5 m s the velocity along the side of the pier is greatly reduced compared to the delta vane 0 33 m s versus 0 5 m s for the cylindrical pier based on fig 14 the delta vane cause sediment transport with similar critical velocities as the cylindrical pier in the wake 0 0 16 m s but will lead to more sediment transport with a critical velocity equal to 0 35 m s than the cylindrical pier these numbers will decrease exponentially towards the bed larger sediment requiring a higher critical velocity such as coarse sane may be transported in the case of the cylindrical pier but not for the delta vane pier it should be noted that altering the orientation of the delta vane to the bed or the pier will affect the resulting flow characteristics and bed shear stress if implemented on an actual bridge pier the design orientation would need to be maintained this could be accomplished by armoring the bed beneath the vane to ensure the apex of the vane remains in contact with the bottom surface the combination of a flow altering method with a bed armoring method could extend the operating life or inspection intervals of the bed armoring technique by reducing the velocities and shear stress the bed armoring device is exposed to further studies would need to assess whether the cost of construction of a delta vane on a pier could outweigh the potential savings in maintenance costs for the bed armoring method the delta vane seems to be successful at directing the flow up and away from the bed there is a 30 reduction in maximum bed shear stress for the delta vane compared to the cylindrical vane which means larger sediment may be transported such as coarser sand in this case the maximum velocity just above the bed is reduced 10 for the delta vane however the delta vane has a larger region of 0 35 m s which could mean transporting more medium sized sand at the bed both will transport approximately the same amount of finer sediment such as silt based on the bed shear stress contours the delta vane is an improvement over the streamlined taper sheath pier because it provides bed armoring in the case of a strong downflow like the streamlined pier but it also reduces the velocity and bed shear stress in the wake like the cylindrical pier 8 3 guide wall with slanting vanes the guide wall with slanting vanes was modeled in autocad fig 8 c the length of the guide wall is 0 2d and the slanting vanes are placed every 0 2d the slanting vanes taper to the sides of the pier so that the effective width of the pier is not increased additionally the guide wall and slanting vanes are all 3 mm thick 0 5 d the pier was meshed using tetrahedral shaped elements with the same parameters found in the unstructured mesh results the global mesh was set at 0 4 m the surface mesh for the pier was 0 02 m and 0 1 m for the bottom surface prism layers were not added to the pier since they produced a poorer quality mesh three prism layers of growth rate 1 2 were applied to the bottom surface with a maximum height of 0 005 the total elements were approximately 460k the guide wall with slanting vanes was simulated using the rans equations with the realizable k ε turbulence closure the boundary conditions remained the same from the previous structured and unstructured simulations so that the resulting flow structures may be compared contours of bed shear stress and velocity were obtained after the simulation was complete each generated figure was compared against the cylindrical pier in fig 15 the maximum bed shear stress is reduced from about 1 0 pa to 0 85 pa or a 15 reduction the area that has a bed shear stress equal to 0 85 is small compared to the area equal to this value or higher for the cylindrical pier this means the guide wall with slanting vanes pier could cause little transport of sediment with a critical shear stress of 0 85 whereas the cylindrical pier could cause transport of sediment equal to and up to 1 0 pa or coarse sand versus coarse sand the amount of sediment with a critical shear velocity equal to 0 5 would be transported less for the guide wall with slanting vanes as well as this region is a little smaller in the guide wall pier contour the guide wall with slanting vanes seems to reduce the magnitude of shear stress along the sides of the pier this may be from the guide wall separating the flow similar to the streamlined tapered sheath pier both piers would transport similar amounts of sediment such as silt in the wake the guide wall with slanting vanes reduces the maximum velocity at z 1 9 from 0 5 m s to 0 45 m s or about 10 fig 16 this indicates the cylindrical pier could allow transport of sediment with a critical shear velocity 10 higher than the sediment allowed by the guide wall with slanting vanes pier the wake looks similar for both indicating sediment would likely be transported similarly between the two piers in this region the guide wall with slanting vanes reduced the maximum bed shear stress by 15 and the maximum velocity at z 1 9 by 10 indicating that this pier reduces the maximum size particle that could be transported in this case coarse sand to coarse sand even though the reduction in magnitude was not as high as in some of the other pier designs there is a reduction in the area of shear stress equal to 0 5 pa there will be less sediment transported at or below this critical velocity for the guide wall with slanting vanes the wake region remained similar between the guide wall and slanting vanes pier and the cylindrical pier it is worth mentioning that one experimental study on the guide wall with slanting vanes was considered the mentioned efficiencies may not be reliable as this device loses its efficiency during high flow intensities since the horseshoe vortex develops a few centimeters upstream of the pier to show how effective is this countermeasure during high flow intensities by numerical simulations large eddy simulations les should be considered tafarojnoruz and lauria 2020 8 4 angled plate footings the angled plate countermeasure was modeled in autocad there are four plates with two angled at 30 facing the inlet and the other two are angled at 30 facing the outlet of the domain each plate extends 0 5d from the outside surface of the pier the height is also 0 5d the countermeasure was then meshed using tetrahedral shaped elements with the same parameters as those of the unstructured mesh three prism layers with a growth rate of 1 2 are applied at the wall the total elements are approximately 450k the generated mesh is shown in fig 17 the angled plate footing pier was simulated using the rans equations with the realizable k ε turbulence closure the boundary conditions remained the same from the previous structured and unstructured simulations so that the resulting flow structures may be compared contours of bed shear stress and velocity were obtained after the simulation was complete each generated figure was compared against the cylindrical pier in fig 18 the magnitude of shear stress is reduced by about 30 for the pier with plate footings since there is a small region of shear stress equal to approximately 0 7 pa along the sides of the pier with plate footings versus 1 0 pa along the upstream sides of the cylindrical pier since this region is so small one would expect sediment of critical shear stress of 0 5 pa or lowered to be transported this region of 0 5 pa is a little larger than the corresponding region for the cylindrical pier indicating more sediment with this critical shear velocity sand will be transported for the pier with plate footings both piers perform well in the wake with 0 0 1 pa which is conducive for silt transport the velocity magnitude above the bed corresponds well with the shear stress contour in fig 18 the maximum velocity at the front sides of the cylindrical pier is reduced from 0 5 m s to 0 35 m s 30 reduction there is a larger region of slower velocity at the front of the pier with plate footings which showed the velocity magnitudes of the piers at the plane of symmetry the lower velocity in the wake extends farther downstream than the cylindrical pier indicating this pier will minimize sediment transport downstream more than the cylindrical pier the angle of the plate footings may act to capture sediment colliding with the base of this pier this region at the upstream base of the pier also has a low velocity so as seen in fig 19 extending about 0 5d farther upstream than the cylindrical pier so sediment may build up in this region this may act counter or prevent future scour but the sediment transport is still likely along the sides of this pier the angled plate footings pier reduced the maximum bed shear stress by 30 but most of the shear stress for this pier was about 0 5 pa indicating that sediment with a critical shear stress of this value or lower such as sand will be transported there is a 30 reduction in maximum velocity above the bed for the pier with plate footings but this pier extends the region of lower velocity both upstream by about 0 5d and downstream compared to the cylindrical pier the angled plates may act to capture sediment as an active scour control measure so this might be a useful test to perform with sediment in a laboratory study 9 delta vane countermeasure at higher reynolds number in section 7 the delta vane pier attachment demonstrated a significant decrease in bed shear stress indicating a strong potential to reduce scour all investigated piers were analyzed under a reynolds number of 1 7 105 this was based on the reynolds number used to validate the cfd model with experimental results even though the delta vane was effective at this reynolds number it is crucial to ascertain that the shear stress will be reduced at a higher reynolds number full scale to determine a realistic yet high reynolds number to reanalyze the delta vane pier attachment the estimated depth averaged flow velocity was determined using measured data from the united states geological survey usgs usgs 2019 flood data from the mississippi river in baton rouge are used to calculate a high reynolds number that can be experienced in this location historical maximum flow discharges for the mississippi river in baton rouge were considered to be about 41 626 m3 s usgs 2019 the depth averaged velocity for the highest discharge was calculated by dividing the discharge by the estimated cross sectional area located at mississippi river mile marker 232 the area is approximately 13 470 m2 and the average velocity is about 3 m s little and biedenharn 2014 if the diameter of a bridge pier or support structure is 1 6 m then the corresponding reynolds number for a velocity of 3 m s is 5 1 106 the modeled pier is 0 536 m in diameter so a velocity of 9 5 m s was applied at the inlet to obtain the same reynolds number because of this high reynolds number the mesh was refined so that the delta vane configuration has 2 6 million elements and the cylindrical pier has 2 1 million elements fig 20 shows the bed shear stress for the cylindrical pier versus the delta vane for a reynolds number of 5 1 106 the calculated maximum bed shear stress for the cylinder is approximately 450 pa and approximately 350 pa for the delta vane which indicates a 22 reduction this is less than the 30 reduction seen at the lower reynolds number it may be that at higher reynolds numbers the delta vane reduces the scour potential less but it still causes a significant reduction in maximum bed shear stress compared to the cylindrical pier fig 21 shows the velocity magnitude for the plane at 1 cm above the bed the simulated maximum velocity for the cylinder was approximately 15 m s the maximum velocity for the delta vane is approximately 14 m s this indicates a 7 reduction which is less than the 10 reduction seen at the lower reynolds number like the bed shear stress the delta vane seems to be less effective at reducing scour potential at a high reynolds number but there is still a noticeable reduction the delta vane configuration reduced maximum bed shear stress by 22 compared to the cylindrical pier and the velocity above the bed by 7 for a reynolds number equal to 5 1 106 although both values are less than the reductions at the lower reynolds number the delta vane configuration still decreases the maximum bed shear stress and velocity above the bed by a significant amount which correlates to a reduction in scour potential this higher reynolds number was estimated using the maximum parameters for a bridge pier in the mississippi river near baton rouge louisiana it is likely that in most cases for a given bridge pier the reynolds number would be much smaller than this value the reduction of scour potential for the delta vane could be likely larger it is worth to mention that the study of different sediment is beyond the scope of the current paper the cfd investigation is conceptual to compare different scour countermeasures under the same flow conditions however by reducing the bed shear stress the proposed countermeasures demonstrate their potential to mitigate scour these solutions have a strong potential to reduce the accelerated deterioration and can protect bridges and other coastal and offshore infrastructure against collapse due to scour 10 conclusions scour around bridge piers and monopile foundations such as offshore wind turbines is a significant issue that contributes to the failure and instability of structures we investigated different turbulence closures including the standard k ε k ε realizable standard k ω and k ω sst to understand their capability to predict the bed shear stress we then assessed the performance of different flow countermeasures in a comparative study the k ω equations can simulate adverse pressure gradients however the k ε equations consistently performed better in approximating the experimental data in particular the k ε realizable model predicted the components of velocity well the use of unstructured mesh allowed the consideration of more complex geometry four scour countermeasures are investigated at a reynolds number of 1 7 105 streamlined tapered sheath delta vane guide wall with slanting plates and angled plate footings the findings are as follows the optimized unstructured mesh may have y values varying between 1 and 17 the k ω models approximate the experimental data more with the unstructured mesh compared to the structured mesh for greater y values this improved performance may be due to the tetrahedral shapes compared to the rectangular prisms or that achieving a y value close to 1 is not that critical for the flow physics considered in the current study the delta vane and the angled plate footings reduced the maximum bed shear stress by 30 the two countermeasures reduced the maximum velocity around the pier by about 10 and 30 respectively in the wake of the pier both countermeasures yield a bed shear stress close to zero the delta vane represents an upstream physical barrier which may armor the bed in the case of a strong downflow the streamlined tapered sheath reduced the maximum bed shear stress and the maximum velocity by 20 and 10 respectively the sheath armors the bed and deflects the downflows the reductions in the shear stress and the flow velocity at the front of the pier suggest that the streamlined tapered sheath may reduce scour at this location however the streamlined tapered sheath does not yield a decrease in the flow velocity directly downstream sediment such as sand with a critical shear stress of 0 3 pa can be transported aft of the streamlined tapered sheath the guide wall with slanting vanes was the least effective countermeasure this countermeasure reduced the maximum bed shear stress and the maximum velocity above the bed by 15 and 10 respectively the performance of the delta vane countermeasure was further investigated at a reynolds number of 5 1 106 at such a high reynolds number the delta vane reduced the maximum bed shear stress and maximum velocity by 22 and 7 respectively overall the findings reveal that the delta vane countermeasure can reduce the scour potential at low and high reynolds numbers to conclude hydrodynamic models are crucial for the assessment and performance comparison of scour countermeasures the delta vane and the angled plate footings performed well in reducing the bed shear stress followed by the streamlined tapered sheath the angled plate footing may capture sediment and hence actively act as a scour countermeasure

20605,scour or the localized loss of soil around the foundation is a dominant factor contributing to failure scour at bridge piers columns of elevated buildings and wind turbines with monopile foundations can cause damage after flooding and natural hazards however due to the lack of sophisticated modeling scour is not fully understood this study utilizes computational fluid dynamic cfd simulations to understand the performance of different flow countermeasures in reducing the scour potential we look at altering the flow around the pier and thereby alleviating the horseshoe vortices and downflow issues cfd models are developed and validated with available experimental data the recommended models with turbulence closures are employed to predict the bed shear stress for different

potential to minimize the accelerated deterioration and protect bridges elevated buildings wind turbines and coastal and offshore infrastructure against scour induced failures keywords scour bridge pier countermeasure flow altering monopile wind turbine computational fluid dynamics coastal infrastructure coastal protection and rehabilitation 1 introduction scour is one of the most significant factors contributing to failure in bridges niedoroda and dalton 1982 the analysis of 500 bridges in the united states between 1989 and 2000 shows that 53 of failures were attributed to floods and scour wardhana and hadipriono 2003 scour may also affect the stability of offshore monopile wind turbines monopile offshore wind turbines often suffer from scour several research studies on the effects of scour on wind turbines in terms of analysis measurements prognosis dynamic modeling of the structure and mitigation countermeasures are available in the literature lin et al 2019 prendergast et al 2015 trojnar 2020 b yang et al 2020 yuan et al 2017 as floodwater passes around an obstruction the flow accelerates losing and transporting the soil structural supports such as bridge piers and wind turbines depend on the foundation to transfer the loads to the ground when the sediment supporting a foundation is lost the structure may become unstable and collapse fig 1 a one countermeasure may decrease scour by minimizing the downflow at the face of a pier whereas another method may weaken the horseshoe vortices fig 1 b these flow physics are often difficult to measure experimentally however scour modeling and prognosis are indispensable for the safe and economical design of bridges wind turbines elevated buildings and other inland and offshore infrastructures in addition scour modeling is crucial for the design and analysis of potential mitigation devices research on local scour has been enjoying a renewed interest over the past 50 years empirical formulas deriven from field and laboratory measurements may prognosticate the maximum scour depth chortis et al 2020 najafzadeh et al 2015 because of the complex interaction among several parameters in the sediment transport process these formulas often serve as a rough estimate of scour depth and may not be used for accurate prognosis with advances in computational fluid dynamics cfd modeling scour can now be adequately simulated in three dimensions most cfd models rely on solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations although large eddy simulations are emerging to assess the scour prevention potential of various flow altering countermeasures cfd provides many benefits over laboratory experiments cfd requires less physical space and can provide instantaneous flow characteristics anywhere within the computational domain however numerical errors are always present and validating the cfd model with experimental data will ensure meaningful and accurate results cfd simulations can assist in the understanding of how the countermeasures may reduce scour cfd analysis of piers with different geometries may indicate which geometry has the best performance in reducing scour mitigation devices can alter the flow velocities bed shear stress and hence the ability to transport sediment due to the potentially disastrous consequences of local scour at bridge piers and other elevated structures researchers have been attempting to reduce scour effects via different methods pandey et al 2020a yang et al 2019 yao et al 2020 these methods are known as flow altering active or bed armoring passive countermeasures wang et al 2017 both methods act to alter the primary flow characteristics including the strong downflow when the flow encounters the face of the pier and the horseshoe vortex entailing vortices that shed off the sides of a pier melville and coleman 2000 the primary method often used to reduce local scour is the armoring of the bed around a pier such as with riprap recently however researchers started to assess the combination of flow altering and bed armoring techniques to synergistically reduce scour effects gaudio et al 2012 it is worthy to mention that the first author of the current paper realized the role of certain aerodynamic features in reducing wind pressures on buildings fluid mechanics problem aly et al 2017 aly and bresowar 2016 this increased our interest to understand whether other features can work in water to reduce the bed shear stress fluid mechanics problem and hence decrease the scour potential the literature review shows that a streamlined pier shape may decrease the scour depth by as much as 50 57 under various flow velocities al shukur and obeid 2016 under clear water conditions the delta wing plate experimentally reduced the maximum scour depth by 67 gupta 2002 this design has shown a maximum scour reduction of up to 32 in unsteady flow however this reduction is highly dependent on the flow depth tafarojnoruz et al 2010 in general such devices lack their performance during floods live bed conditions and they may adversely increase scour a guide wall with slanting vanes may decrease the maximum depth by 90 daido and yano 1995 both methods become ineffective once the sediment is cleared out below the desired installation depth by armoring the bed below these flow countermeasure devices scour can be further reduced compared to the case with bed armoring alone due to the lack of sophisticated modeling scour is not fully understood this study aims to employ the cfd capabilities to understand the performance of different flow countermeasures in reducing scour the scope of the study is clear water scour with a non cohesive sand bed and specific ranges of d 50 the complex set of flow equations is reduced by employing the two equation k ε and k ω turbulence closures both turbulence closures in validated cfd models are used to prognosticate the bed shear stress for different pier configurations streamlined shape tapered sheath delta vane and guide wall with slanting vanes reductions in the maximum bed shear stress are in the order of 30 with the angled plate and the delta vane 20 with the tapered sheath and 15 with the guide wall with slanting plates by reducing the bed shear stress these countermeasures demonstrate their potential to mitigate scour the presented solutions can reduce the accelerated deterioration and protect bridges and other coastal and offshore infrastructure against collapse due to scour the paper layout is as follows section 2 provides an overview of scour and its classification section 3 presents recent efforts on scour processes by scaled laboratory models computational modeling with its potential to resolve the scale issues is presented in section 4 scour countermeasures are reviewed in section 5 section 6 presents cfd modeling to prognosticate local scour the cfd validation study is presented in section 7 in section 8 numerical investigations of different flow countermeasures are presented reynolds number effects on the performance of the delta vane countermeasure are addressed in section 9 section 10 summarizes the main findings of the paper 2 an overview of scour scour can be classified as general contraction and local wang et al 2017 general scour occurs when the water flow removes sediment without structure impediment contraction scour arises under the narrowing of the width of a river or a channel local scour occurs at an obstacle obstructing the flow such as a pile or a pier and generally causes ten times the depth due to general scour johnson et al 2013 parker et al 1998 additionally a river bed may experience aggradation and degradation i e long term bed elevation changes due to the deposition or removal of sediment from natural or man made causes arneson et al 2012 aggradation and degradation differ from general scour the general scour may be cyclic or caused by short term events such as flooding the contributions of all of these forms should be accounted for when evaluating the total scour at piers and abutments during the local scour process water flow encounters a structure and accelerates creating a horseshoe vortex which loses sediment in the flow direction wang et al 2017 the horseshoe vortex in fig 1 b provides a visual representation of the flow structure during the local scour process the directed flow pushes and transports sediment at the base the lee wake vortices generated downstream erode the sediment behind the pier breusers and raudkivi 1991 as the depth of the resulting scour hole increases the strength of the horseshoe vortex decreases which subsequently decreases the transport rate of sediment arneson et al 2012 scour is greatly affected by the type of sediment loose and granular soils are more easily eroded by flowing water while more cohesive or cemented soils are more scour resistant arneson et al 2012 however the scour hole can be deep in cohesive sediment as in sand beds if the time is long enough to reach the maximum depth while sand may develop a maximum scour depth within hours limestone may not experience a maximum depth for years wang et al 2017 another factor related to sediment transport which affects local and contraction scour is being clear water or live bed scour clear water scour occurs when the water flow does not transport bed sediment or that the amount of sediment transported is less than the capacity of the flow this type of scour occurs in coarse bed materials armored streams flatbeds with low flow heavily vegetated beds and in the case of riprap around bridge piers where rocks are much larger than the transported sediment arneson et al 2012 live bed scour transports bed sediment from upstream to scour hole live bed scour is cyclic meaning that the developed scour hole for example during a flooding stage fills back during flood falls for instance in a river with coarse bed materials the riverbed may be subjected to a clear water scour before and after floods and live bed scour during flooding or when the discharge rates are the highest clear water scour causes approximately a 10 increase in depth compared to live bed scour and may occur over a longer time the critical velocity of the median particle size d 50 refers to the speed at which the motion of a particle initiates and is used to determine whether clear water or live bed scour will occur if the mean upstream flow velocity ū is less than or equal to the critical velocity of d 50 then the local scour can be classified as clear water melville and coleman 2000 the critical velocity depends on the flow depth and the size of the bed material if the ratio of the shear velocity of the flow to the fall velocity of d 50 exceeds two live bed scour may occur in clear water scour sand beds with dunes tend to increase the equilibrium scour depth by 30 compared to live bed scour but in large rivers the dunes tend to plane out the clear water condition further affects local scour in that scouring continues until the shear stress caused by the horseshoe vortex equals the critical shear stress of the sediment at the bottom of the scour hole under the live bed condition however scouring continues until the inflow sediment equals its outflow arneson et al 2012 local scour can be further classified as occurring due to wave current and a combination of the two in wave induced scour the keulegan carpenter number is the main influential parameter sumer and fredsøe 2001a the keulegan carpenter number k c is defined as the amplitude of the flow velocity oscillation times the period of oscillation divided by a characteristic length scale such as the hydraulic diameter of the pier similar to the reduced velocity in wind tunnel testing aly 2014 a bridge pier may be subjected to forces in multiple directions due to wave and tidal actions although wave and tidal actions can influence local scour at the piles and piers of elevated structures in this paper we will focus on steady flow local scour representing inland waterway bridge systems experiencing flow primarily in one direction 3 laboratory studies for scour modeling experiments carried out on local scour are categorized in three areas hydraulic structural and geotechnical wang et al 2017 hydraulic studies usually focus on the flow mechanisms of local scour however local scour depends on the structure therefore hydraulic studies should account for the structural system geotechnical investigations usually address the variables related to sediment flume tests are often needed to measure the scour depth and rate under steady current flows wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2010 field measurements are usually employed to develop predictive models 3 1 laboratory driven predictive models sediment bed patterns and scour depth are measured to derive relationships between several variables ni et al 2020 yilin yang et al 2020 these variables include the flow depth effective pier width froude number shear stress and critical shear stress jones 1984 the models can be grouped into three categories 1 models for fine bed materials 2 models with a hypothesis that the depth of flow is more important than the velocity for sediment transport and 3 models with the velocity expressed as a function of reynolds or froude number the limitations of these models include accuracy only over the region of the empirical data the primary use of uniform non cohesive soils and the lack of field measurements to correlate equations with laboratory testing to develop better predictive models numerous studies were conducted breusers and raudkivi 1991 melville and coleman 2000 sumer and fredsøe 2001b the normalized scour depth or the scour depth divided by the pile diameter d s d for uniform diameter sediment is closely correlated to the flow intensity normalized velocity water depth normalized by pile diameter and pile diameter normalized by median sediment grain diameter d d 50 two general equations to determine local scour were developed arneson et al 2012 melville and coleman 2000 1 d s k y b k i k d k s k θ k g k t y s y 1 2 0 k 1 k 2 k 3 a y 1 0 65 f r 1 0 43 each k in eqn 1 is a parameter that influences the scour depth d s or y s k yb accounts for the depth of a pier k i accounts for the flow intensity k d depends on the sediment size k s is for the pier shape k θ is for the pier alignment k g is for channel geometry and k t accounts for time the scour depth y s over the flow depth y 1 is a function of several parameters k 1 a factor of pier shape k 2 a factor of the angle of attack of the flow and k 3 a factor of bed condition a is the pier width and fr 1 is the upstream froude number two empirical expressions have been found to better fit the time history data of local scour in clear water sheppard et al 2004 2 d s t a 1 1 1 a b t c 1 1 1 c d t d s t a 1 exp b t c 1 exp dt in eqn 2 the constants a b c and d produce the best least squares fit of the experimental data these equations yield more accurate equilibrium scour depth the duration of the test should be at least the same as that of the experiment conducted in sheppard et al 2004 to produce accurate estimates of the equilibrium depth the time required to reach the equilibrium scour depth is a vital parameter in predictive models scour depth was expressed as a function of time using cylindrical and square bridge pier models in a laboratory under clear water conditions and uniform bed materials yanmaz and altinbilek 1991 a semi empirical time dependent analysis of local scour was conducted using sediment continuity equations the vortex field was calculated in front of the cylinder and at the trailing wake vortex system graf and istiarto 2002 by using acoustic doppler velocimetry adv the horseshoe vortex was studied within a developing scour hole for cylindrical and square piers dey and raikar 2007 it was observed that for the two piers the flow structure and turbulence intensities in the horseshoe vortex in a developing scour hole are reasonably similar experiments on bridge pier scour were carried out under steady and unsteady clear water conditions with uniform and non uniform sediments a scheme was proposed for computing the scour depth evolution chang et al 2004 the temporal evolution of jet driven scour depth in a pothole laying on a cohesionless granular bed was investigated by using diverse approaches ordinary differential equations were developed in bombardelli et al 2018 and the theory was validated using datasets the temporal variation of scour depth around a vertical wall spur dike was assessed and the influencing parameters were identified pandey et al 2020b a modified sheppard melville method and a new corrected time scale equation were recommended to predict clear water scour depth and scour evolution for complex bridge piers yifan yang et al 2020 new data on the temporal evolution of downstream clear water scour depth at a submerged weir were presented wang et al 2020 a dimensionless equilibrium timescale was defined and its dependence on these parameters was studied the temporal evolution of scour depth in cohesive sediments was extensively studied in the literature bombardelli et al 2018 chaudhuri et al 2018 hamidifar and omid 2017 lodhi et al 2017 2018 muzzammil et al 2015 local scour in clay sand mixed cohesive sediment beds was also covered in several studies debnath and chaudhuri 2010 2011 2012 khalid et al 2018 najafzadeh and barani 2014 local scour was measured around a group of piles for different spacings and skew angles it was noted that predictive models do not agree with measurements salim and jones 1996 a method was then developed to predict scour for pile arrangements local scour was measured around three adjacent piles with different arrangements to find the arrangement that creates the smallest scour depth wang et al 2017 a relationship between the aspect ratio of submerged piles and the timescale was developed yao et al 2018 additional experimental studies were conducted to understand the effect of pier shape on the scour depth al shukur and obeid 2016 3 2 scale issues researchers have yet to agree upon a scaling method that takes into account all relevant parameters zhao et al 2010 equilibrium scour depth was measured under large scale turbulence ettema et al 2006 the normalized scour depth was increased when the pier diameter was decreased a scour depth adjustment factor was calculated to scale local scour however difficulties still arise in scaling the flow characteristics as well as the sediment size of critical importance to local scour research is the dependence on the sediment type and the mechanisms behind sediment transport the answer to fundamental questions such as when the erosion initiates where particles are transported to and how the particles interact with each other may vary depending on the type and structure of the soil for instance particle size adhesion composition and the degree of saturation wang et al 2017 the sediment size is the most influential parameter since it is a primary factor in determining the scour shape and the fall velocity melville and coleman 2000 the median particle size or d 50 can adequately describe alluvial sediment in uniform materials the dimensionless sediment size d is another vital parameter julien 2010 3 d d 50 g 1 g v 2 1 3 where g is the specific gravity of the sediment υ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and g is the gravitational acceleration the initiation of the sediment motion relies on the critical value of the shields parameter τ c which depends on the dimensionless sediment size d eq 4 expresses the shields parameter τ as the ratio of the bed shear force to the submerged particle weight 4 τ τ 0 γ s γ d s u 2 g 1 g d s h s f g 1 d s in eq 4 τ 0 ρ u 2 is the bed shear stress u is the shear velocity γ s is the specific weight of sediment particles γ is the specific weight of water h is the flow depth and s f is the friction slope julien 2018 the critical shear velocity u c or the velocity of the incipient motion is defined as u c τ c ρ for sand with a mean sediment size of 0 5 mm for example the critical velocity is approximately 0 016 m s and the critical shear stress is about 0 27 pa estimates in the literature show that a shear stress of 0 1 pa can cause incipient motion in silts but not in sand also a shear stress of 1 pa can cause incipient motion in sand but not in gravel julien 2010 different forms of the above equation are available in literature an earlier formula for the critical shear velocity was proposed melville 1997 a useful expression to calculate the critical mean channel velocity v c was established to understand the sediment motion melville and coleman 2000 5 v c u c 5 75 l n 5 53 y d 50 in eq 5 y is the flow depth in a later study the shields rouse equation was adapted for the calculation of the critical shear stress for a dimensionless sediment diameter guo 2002 the critical shear stress calculated from this equation matched the experimental data for diverse types of sediment with different diameters like the scaling difficulties observed in the structural aspects of local scour as well as aerodynamic modeling aly 2016 aly and bitsuamlak 2013 addressing the scaling issues in sediment modeling is challenging the effects of the sediment size on the scour depth were investigated under three uniform sediment sizes at three different model scales lee and sturm 2009 a distortion was realized between laboratory and field measurements due to improper scaling of the horseshoe vortex scaling scour in laboratory settings to accurately represent field observations still poses a challenge for researchers wang et al 2017 however computational fluid dynamics offer an attractive means for predicting flow velocities and scour at full scale 4 scour prognosis via cfd modeling one of the main factors limiting the accurate prediction of scour by physical modeling is the scaling from laboratory settings to field settings and vice versa scale issues the froude number and reynolds number both can affect scour but usually are not accounted for simultaneously one of the two numbers often sacrifices the other however one of the advantages of numerical simulations of local scour is to partially resolve the scale issues other advantages include the ability to model complex conditions that experiments cannot achieve observe the mechanical behavior of the process in detail and reduce the physical space required to simulate the process wang et al 2017 most numerical simulations use computational fluid dynamics cfd to model the scour process liu et al 2019 yazdanfar et al 2021 yu and zhu 2020 zhao et al 2021 the limitations of this method include the long computational time as per the need for a refined mesh to accurately represent the sediment grains the difficulty in approximating the interaction parameters such as particle porosity and drag coefficients and the many assumptions made to predict the scour depth are discussed in the literature wang et al 2017 most cfd studies combine hydrodynamic and morphologic models to simulate the flow field and sediment transport hydrodynamic models are classified into three categories steady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations unsteady rans urans or large eddy simulation les navier stokes n s equations describe the motion of a fluid which is usually associated with turbulence aghaee and hakimzadeh 2010 direct numerical simulation dns of n s equations can resolve the spatial and temporal range of turbulence although dns would be the most accurate method for scour modeling it is limited to low reynolds numbers due to its inhibitive computational cost compared to dns a simplified model would combine the continuity equation and the rans equations zhou 2017 6 u 0 ρ u t ρ u u t p 2 μ m s ρ r ρ f here ρ is the fluid density u is the fluid velocity vector s is the mean strain rate tensor μ m is the fluid dynamic molecular viscosity r is the reynolds stress tensor which may be calculated for various turbulence models p denotes pressure and f is the external force the left side of eq 6 includes the local time derivative of velocity and convective acceleration the right side of the equation includes the effects of viscosity pressure gradient and external forces under the boussinesq eddy viscosity assumption the eddy viscosity is modeled by momentum transfer due to turbulent eddies this is based on the analogy between molecular motion based laminar momentum and scalar transport and eddy motion based turbulent momentum and scalar transport kundu et al 2012 the molecular viscosity describes how the momentum is transferred by molecular motion in the rans equations r represents the mean viscous stress and is defined as follows 7 r u u t 2 μ t ρ s 2 3 k δ ij s 1 2 u u t where μt is the eddy viscosity k is turbulence kinetic energy u is the fluctuating component of the velocity and δ ij is the kronecker delta reynolds stresses develop from the nonlinear advection term of the conservation of momentum equation and represent the average stresses induced by the flow fluctuations kundu et al 2012 reynolds stresses may be considered as the rate of mean momentum transfer due to flow fluctuations reynolds stresses tend to be much larger than viscous stresses except close to a solid surface where the fluctuations vanish and the mean flow gradients are large to solve the rans equations the two equation eddy viscosity models are utilized one equation for the turbulence kinetic energy and the other equation is related to the turbulent length scale menter 1992 the primary models in rans simulations are the k ε and k ω turbulence closures the k ε model was developed in 1973 and has been improved over time jones and launder 1973 in the standard k ε equation the eddy viscosity μt is expressed as follows 8 μ t c μ ρ k 2 ε where k is the turbulence kinetic energy ε is the dissipation rate and c μ is a constant the rate of production of turbulence p k is given by 9 p k μ t u u t the two equations of the k ε turbulence closure are 10 ρ k t ρ u k μ m μ t σ k k p k ρ ε 11 ρ ε t ρ u ε μ m μ t σ ε ε c 1 ε k p k c 2 ρ ε 2 k in these equations c μ c 1 c 2 σ k and σ ε are constants primarily given as c μ 0 09 c 1 1 44 c 2 1 92 σ k 1 0 and σ ε 1 3 launder and spalding 1974 although being widely used the k ε model has several drawbacks including a lack of sensitivity to adverse pressure gradients the model over predicts the shear stress which is often a challenge in the modeling of flow separation menter 1993 another disadvantage is that the equations in the model may be stiff and convergence may be difficult due to the damping terms several researchers have shown the effectiveness of the k ε turbulence closure under certain conditions the scour hole created by an inundated bridge deck was experimentally measured under steady flow at a high reynolds number tulimilli et al 2010 the hydrodynamic model was coupled with a sediment transport model that simulates the scour of the initially flat bed in iterative increments sediment transport is initiated when the shear stress exceeds its critical value the flow mechanism was studied for three piles with different arrangements under steady flow using rans simulations with the k ε turbulence closure and sediment scour model the k ε turbulence model was used to reduce the computational cost the simulated results fairly agreed with the experimental data zhang et al 2017 an improvement upon the standard k ε model is the realizable k ε model the realizable k ε equations follow the standard k ε equations except for the eddy viscosity μ t which no longer has c μ as a constant in eq 8 for the realizable k ε model the term c μ is calculated as follows 12 c μ 1 a 0 a s k u ε where a 0 and a s are constants and u is the square root of the sum of the square of the mean rate of the state tensor and the mean rate of the rotation tensor the model is called realizable because it satisfies the physics in turbulent flows as well as certain mathematical constraints on the reynolds stresses some advantages include more accurate predictions of the spread rate of both planar and round jets as well as the capability of modeling flows involving rotation flows with boundary layers under strong adverse pressure gradients flows with separation and flows with recirculation spalart 2000 the k ω model improves upon the k ε model in that the damping functions are no longer employed and the dirichlet boundary conditions allow for better numerical stability menter 1993 wilcox 1993 the k ω turbulence closure significantly improves the modeling of flows with adverse pressure gradient although it is sensitive to the value chosen for the free stream variable eq 13 solves for the turbulence kinetic energy k and eq 14 solves for the dissipation of the turbulence energy ω the parameters k ω and ε are defined in eq 15 13 ρ k t ρ u k μ m σ k μ t k r u β ρ k ω 14 ρ ω t ρ u ω μ m σ ω μ t ω γ v t r u ρ β ω 2 2 1 f 1 ρ σ ω 2 ω k ω t 15 k 1 2 u i u i ω ε k β ε v u i x k u i x k the new parameters μ m σ k β σ ω β σ ω 2 and γ are constants defined in the literature except for v t which is the turbulence kinematic viscosity and f 1 which is a blending function the mentor baseline bsl model blended the k ε and the k ω models and helped reduce the ambiguity of the free stream term like the k ε model the k ω model under predicts the flow separation the shear stress transport sst model improves upon the standard k ω model and assumes that the turbulence shear stress is proportional to the turbulence kinetic energy in the logarithmic and wake regions of the boundary layer and the eddy viscosity is limited by taking the maximum term in the denominator of the eddy viscosity equation menter 1993 the numerical simulations underpredicted the scour depth by 15 upstream of the pier and up to 30 downstream similarly a 10 20 underprediction of the scour depth was found for steady flow around submerged cylinders zhao et al 2010 the underprediction may arise from the steady state flow modeling which did not account for the unsteady effects of the fluctuating velocity components of the horseshoe and the lee wake vortices however with the consideration of flow altering countermeasures more reliable designs can be achieved 5 flow altering countermeasures one of the earliest comprehensive studies on scour countermeasures was published by the national cooperative highway research program nchrp in 1998 parker et al 1998 the study provided recommendations on the use of scour countermeasures other than riprap although the preferred method was bed armoring with riprap or cable tied blocks over a geotextile other countermeasures include sacrificial piles upstream sheet piles collars and horizontal plates vanes or plates modified pier shape or texture slots in piers or pier groups and suction applied to the pier since then other flow altering techniques have been developed including internal connecting tubes surface guide panels threading and sleeve and downstream bed sill tafarojnoruz et al 2010 scour countermeasures may be categorized as pier geometry modification or openings pier attachments bed attachments among other techniques 5 1 pier geometry and pier openings research regarding the effects of the geometry of the pier or the shape itself shows that reductions in the scour depth can be realized studies on the pier shape have been conducted with a general understanding that the scour depth can be reduced as the pier becomes more streamlined melville and coleman 2000 the scour depth is reduced or increased by the following factors for the following pier shapes 1 1 for square 1 0 for circular round nose or group of circular piers and 0 9 for piers with a sharp nose arneson et al 2012 in an experimental study a larger variety of pier shapes were considered al shukur and obeid 2016 compared to a circular pier the streamlined pier reduced the scour depth by 50 57 for three different clear water flows the next best scour reducing geometries were the hexagonal shape 28 40 the sharp nose 23 29 and the elliptical shape 7 20 al shukur and obeid 2016 experimental testing and cfd modeling were conducted for circular diamond and square piers and the findings agreed with previous literature that scour increases for the diamond shape and even more for the square shape when compared to the circular pier khosronejad et al 2012 the optimization of the pier geometry relies on the flow angle which may not capture the realistic field conditions tafarojnoruz et al 2010 scour was investigated for complex pier shapes that arise when scouring exposes pile caps and the piles themselves baghbadorani et al 2018 fifty two tests were conducted on four different complex pier models in clear water conditions to help improve the accuracy of the published hec 18 equations richardson and davis 2001 the experiments agreed with the equations which predict reduced scour depth as the pile cap is exposed to sediment that interrupts and minimizes the downflow effects a collar located at the base of a pier or below the level of the bed works under the same mechanism the performance of collars and exposed pile caps rely on a minimum diameter to reduce scour otherwise the scour depth may increase parker et al 1998 although a pile cap is not meant to be a countermeasure it is beneficial for the safety of a bridge as the last expedient in case other countermeasures inspection or maintenance plans fail the performance of a pier with a vertical slot was experimentally investigated to understand its ability to reduce scour by diverting the flow away from the bed or by reducing the downflow effects chiew 1992 a reduction of 20 was realized in the maximum scour depth for a slot length of twice the diameter of the pier and a width of at least one quarter of the diameter a reduction of 45 in the maximum scour depth was achieved after experimentally testing different sizes of openings in different shapes of piers el ghorab 2013 a significant scour depth reduction of 89 was realized by utilizing a sacrificial perforated pile upstream of a perforated main pile each pile has a hole that is 43 of the pile diameter orientated at 45 elnikhely 2017 other studies had shown that sacrificial piles alone may reduce the maximum scour depth by 44 in the field and up to 60 under laboratory conditions parker et al 1998 nevertheless pier openings cause practical problems including potential blockage by debris and a reduction in the pier s strength 5 2 pier attachments experiments with plates and vanes to reduce scour depth began as early as the 1960s gaudio et al 2012 before that time vertical plates installed in the channel were primarily used to prevent lateral channel migration although a reduction in scour had been noticed the effectiveness of vertical plates and vanes was compared showing that vertical plates can separate the flow around a pier and hence reduce the intensity of the horseshoe vortex parker et al 1998 vertical plates with an aspect ratio of 3 1 may reduce scour by 70 80 and they are effective in low and high flow rates tafarojnoruz et al 2010 one of the more successful vane designs includes the delta vane which disrupts the flow at the base of the pier and produces vortices that rotate against the horseshoe vortex gupta 2002 this design has shown scour reduction of up to 32 in unsteady flow and 67 in clear water laboratory settings however this design is highly dependent on the flow depth tafarojnoruz et al 2010 the use of a vertical guide wall and vertically inclined plates at 45 showed up to 90 reduction in clear water scour with similar limitations as the delta vane another pier attachment was developed which consists of a guide wall with vanes daido and yano 1995 the guide wall is intended to decrease the intensity of the horseshoe vortex by disturbing the approaching flow slanting vanes are used to further decrease the intensity of the horseshoe vortex the results showed that at a 90 reduction in the scour depth was realized compared to the unprotected circular pier this design was tested under a few flow velocities in a later study this configuration reduced scour by only 50 compared to the unprotected circular pier parker et al 1998 the effect of submerged vanes on the flow pattern around a pier was numerically studied by testing combinations of 2 4 and 6 vanes angled at 20 and 30 azizi et al 2016 three plates angled at 30 significantly reduced the velocity near the bed this decrease in velocity is associated with a decrease in the ability of the flow to transport sediment most experiment discussed thus far focused on scour in steady flow the effectiveness of splitter plates and threaded piles under waves and current was investigated dey et al 2006 the main scour mechanism under waves is vortex shedding attaching a splitter and threading the pile or wrapping cables in a helical pattern around the pile can disrupt vortex shedding this approach is known in wind engineering applications as well for example the older antenna of the car had a spiral shape to disrupt vortex shedding and hence reduce the vortex shedding effects with a cable to pile diameter ratio of 0 75 a maximum reduction of scour under waves of 51 was realized under steady current a maximum scour depth reduction of 46 was realized for a cable to pile diameter ratio of 0 1 however the splitter plate reduced scour by 62 a combination of flow altering countermeasures may prove to be even more effective the following combinations were experimentally investigated in clear water submerged vanes and a bed sill slot and sacrificial piles collar and sacrificial piles slot and collar and bed sill and collar gaudio et al 2012 most combinations did not reduce scour more than the individual countermeasures however the slot and collar combination reduced scour by 82 but its efficiency was reduced when the collar rim was exposed for example during degradation or when the slot is blocked by debris when a sill was positioned upstream of a pier with a collar scour was reduced by 63 76 but degradation is a potential concern in summary there are many countermeasures including active countermeasures that attempt to alter the flow pattern around the pier with a potential to reduce scour each method such as altering pier geometry sacrificial piles pier attachments or openings has potential benefits but may have some concerns there is no single solution for the local scour problem so different countermeasures and solutions may be considered in the design process especially for unique projects in the following section we will create and test computational models that will be used to study different scour countermeasures 6 case study of cfd application to predict local scour here we model and predict the bed shear stress and velocity around a pier we evaluate different turbulence closures and validate the model with available experimental data later the model with the proper turbulence closures will be employed to investigate the performance of proposed scour countermeasures 6 1 computational domain a computational domain was created using the same dimensions as those in roulund et al 2005 a schematic representation of the computational domain is shown in fig 2 the dimensions of the domain are given in terms of the diameter of the pier d a symmetry boundary condition was considered at the side boundaries this condition assumes a zero flux of all quantities across a symmetry plane the shear stress is also set to zero so a surface with symmetry boundary conditions may be a slip surface the flow along the sidewalls of the flume in the experiment was a no slip surface but because of the distance of the side walls to the cylinder the effect of the side walls was not anticipated to impact the results significantly the blockage ratio is 1d 20d or 5 the experiment was performed with a width of 5 6d which has a blockage ratio of approximately 18 the blockage effect did not pose any significant problems because the flow velocity was increased by less than 3 close to the sidewalls roulund et al 2005 symmetry condition was applied at the top surface of the domain this will place a lid on the fluid surface since the free surface is not modeled since a lower froude number will decrease the amount of elevation of the free surface of an object in a flow such as a wake at the bow of a boat lower froude numbers may be modeled with a lid condition two experiments with froude numbers of 0 2 and 0 5 were performed for a depth of flow of 26 cm and a 31 cm pier diameter roulund et al 2005 a height difference of 22 compared with the water depth was found for a froude number equal to 0 5 the height difference was only 3 8 for a froude number of 0 2 the velocity profiles in both cases were also compared and the froude number of 0 2 matched closely with the free surface velocity distributions the rigid lid approximation is therefore applicable when the froude number is of the order of 0 2 the boundary layer thickness to pier diameter δ d was kept constant the value of δ d is about 1 the cfd analysis was carried out for a δ d value that is similar to the reference experimental data roulund et al 2005 it is worth mentioning that the separation of the bed boundary layer forming the horseshoe vortex will be delayed if the boundary layer thickness to pier diameter ratio δ d is small δ d 0 5 this may lead to a more uniform velocity distribution in the upstream boundary layer flow which can lead to a smaller size horseshoe vortex for small values of δ d the boundary layer may not separate no horseshoe vortex the boundary condition for the inlet was a velocity inlet a velocity profile based on the average velocity was applied to the inlet as well as a constant absolute velocity equal to the main flow velocity the turbulence was set to 5 with a length scale of 0 54 roulund et al 2005 the bottom surface and pier surface are wall conditions with no slip wall functions dependent on the turbulence closure were employed as will be discussed in the next subsection the outlet was set as a pressure outlet zero gradient and neumann conditions were applied 6 2 mesh generation a structured o grid mesh was created fig 3 the mesh cell height in the vertical direction is smaller towards the bed so that the height of the first cell from the bed surface is 1 0 10 4 m the cell height also becomes smaller towards the pier surface the height of the first cell on the pier wall is 6 3 10 5 m this size was determined from the y value to resolve the viscous sublayer white 2002 the k ω sst model was the initial turbulence closure which requires a y value of less than 1 ansys inc 2021 16 y ρ y u τ μ u τ τ w ρ τ w 1 2 c f ρ u 2 c f 0 058 r e l 0 2 c f is the skin friction and all other quantities including the reynolds number viscosity density and flow velocity are known table 1 for the standard and realizable k ε models enhanced wall treatments were employed these treatments bring improvements over the standard wall functions that are not recommended for use under boundary layer separation khaled et al 2021 the enhanced wall treatment is a y insensitive approach and will act as a wall function if the first grid point is in the log layer to predict the physics in the near wall region this method formulates the law of the wall as a single wall law for the entire wall region by combining the linear laminar and logarithmic turbulent laws of the wall ansys inc 2021 the wall shear stress like the normal velocity gradient at the wall is dependent on the formulation of the near wall region using the enhanced wall treatment the generated mesh is shown in fig 3 notice how the mesh elements decrease towards the cylinder and bottom surface the number of elements was then optimized following a grid independence study and the results were compared with available experimental data the mesh characteristics for each trial are listed in table 2 the element count refers to the number of elements in each direction over height z direction width y direction and length x direction the o grid around the cylinder for extra grid refinement was not altered from test to test since the y value depends on ensuring the first cell height remains the same 6 3 discretization the flow governing equations were solved using a pressure based finite volume discretization process a control volume based technique was employed which converts a general scalar transport equation to an algebraic equation that can be solved numerically ansys inc 2021 this control volume technique consists of integrating the transport equation to yield a discrete equation that expresses the conservation law a second order upwind scheme was applied the momentum equations were also discretized the simple algorithm is used to couple velocity and pressure for mass conservation to obtain the pressure field a predictor corrector method is then used to predict and correct the pressure and flux fields the models were run for a varying number of iteration steps until the scaled residuals were decreased and the solution was converged the drag coefficient of the pier leveled out to constant and the mean value of the lift coefficient was zero for steady state rans simulations blevins 1984 7 cfd validation a velocity profile was applied at the inlet with the mean flow velocity as the main scaling parameter and run in an empty domain with the k ω sst turbulence closure the resulting velocity profile at the location of the cylinder in the middle of the computational domain was then compared to the undisturbed experimental velocity profile the velocity profiles for different values of d at a constant inlet velocity were also compared the model was simulated using the rans equations with the k ω sst turbulence closure for each mesh in table 3 the experimental data include the x component of the velocity at a distance 2d upstream and downstream of the cylinder in the plane of symmetry or at y 10d roulund et al 2005 we investigated the ability of structured and unstructured grids to replicate the flow characteristics from the experiment a structured mesh may be more spatially efficient but the fluid domain should be subdivided to control the mesh intensity for accurate cfd simulations an unstructured mesh may use differently shaped elements such as tetrahedral shapes to generate the volume mesh with inputs such as the maximum global size and surface size with fewer inputs the unstructured mesh is easier to apply to complex geometries however creating an unstructured mesh is an iterative process and the grid is usually refined by trial and error we used the same pier and domain size to create the unstructured mesh as shown in fig 2 the maximum global element size and the maximum element size on any surface can be set ansys suggests adding prismatic layers at solid surfaces to capture the shear stress and other essential flow physics in the boundary layer ansys inc 2021 in one of the first iterations with the unstructured mesh we used a maximum global element size of 0 2 m we added three prism layers to the bottom surface and the pier surface with a maximum element size of 0 1 m a maximum near wall height of 0 01 m and a growth rate of 1 2 the unstructured mesh was computed with 350k tetrahedral shaped elements when this unstructured mesh was used to simulate the flow with the k ε realizable turbulence closure the solution converged the drag coefficient leveled at a constant value but the lift coefficient was irregular before nearing zero to improve upon the coarseness of the mesh without significantly increasing the number of elements we placed a mesh density around the cylinder pier the unstructured mesh requires more elements compared to the structured mesh to produce consistent results to increase the number of elements without significantly increasing the computation time the size of the domain was optimized the original size was chosen as 20d x 20d x 2d to safely assume the effects of the walls did not impact the results of flow around the cylinder and close to the bottom surface the domain size was decreased to a width of 11d a height of 1 5d and the width was further decreased to 9d to check if the results would change each simulation was run using the k ε realizable turbulence closure since this model performed well for the structured mesh case the results of the mesh optimization are shown in fig 4 for the x component of velocity in fig 4 it is shown that the change in the domain size has a minimum effect the ability to predict the x component of the upstream velocity flow because the physical experiment was conducted in a flume of 5 6d width there were likely effects from the flume walls that are now incorporated into the numerical model by decreasing the domain width this effect is further exaggerated in the downstream region of the pier where the 9d width yields result close to those of the experiment the simulation results for the reduced domain width other than 9d were relatively close to each other in the downstream zone in general only the 9d width domain seems to affect the simulation of the x component of velocity for the regions considered considering the benefits of predicting the x velocity component for a reduced domain size of 11d which also predicted the z velocity components downstream of the pier well when combined with a 1 5d height this combination seems to be the best optimum domain size to be used for the investigation of different flow countermeasures in the coming section once an optimum domain size was determined the mesh parameters were optimized to resolve the viscous sublayer if the unstructured mesh could adequately resolve the viscous sublayer the standard k ω and k ω sst may prove to predict the flow velocities better than the k ε models since they are better at modeling adverse pressure gradients the wall and cylinder s first cell height should be small so a mesh was made with smaller elements on the surface around the cylinder to reduce the total number of elements and computational time another mesh was made with a mesh density with a maximum size of 0 1 m at the same location as the inner bottom surface the parameters of the two different meshes are listed in table 3 each mesh has five prism layers each mesh was used with the k ω sst model since both k ω models performed relatively similar compared to experimental data and the k ω sst is regarded as an improvement upon the k ω model the density mesh was then used with the standard and realizable k ε turbulence models with enhanced wall treatment the x and z velocity components from each simulation were compared with experimental results in figs 5 6 all models yield the x velocity component upstream of the pier closely although the results vary more when z 1 9 d this is likely due to the mesh near the bottom surface not adequately capturing the flow at this height for the downstream region of the pier the k ω realizable and the standard models predict the flow better than the case of using the structured mesh this could be a feature of the tetrahedral element shape which may provide better vertical coverage of the boundary layer since the elements do not form distinct layers in the vertical direction compared to the structured mesh the standard k ε and realizable k ε closures more closely match the experimental data downstream of the pier for the x velocity components the realizable k ε tends to predict the downstream velocity slightly better than the standard k ε as shown in figs 5 6 another finding of the mesh simulations using the parameters in table 3 include the difference in the wall y values between structured and unstructured grids fig 7 a shows the wall y values are between 0 1 and 1 0 for the structured mesh the unstructured mesh would require many more elements than the structured mesh to achieve a similar wall y value the unstructured y values are shown in fig 7 b where they vary between 1 0 and 17 the two k ω models tended to approximate the experimental data better with the unstructured mesh for a greater y value this may be due to the improvement of the tetrahedral shape over the rectangular prisms of the structured mesh or achieving a y value close to 1 0 may not be that critical the parameters of each mesh are listed in table 4 and they are labeled mesh 1 2 and 3 each mesh has a mesh density to refine elements around the pier the unstructured mesh was optimized for the realizable k ε model so that the mesh parameters that most closely match the experimental data could be applied to other pier shapes to investigate the performance of different flow countermeasures in a comparative study 8 numerical investigations of different countermeasures to reduce local scour we investigated four different countermeasures to reduce local scour fig 8 the proposed countermeasures are 1 tapered streamlined sheath 2 delta vane 3 guide wall with slanting vanes and 4 angled plate footing 8 1 tapered streamline sheath the tapered streamlined sheath was modeled in autocad fig 8 a the pier has the same dimensions as those in roulund et al 2005 in terms of the diameter the width of the sheath is 1d and the total length is equal to 3d the sheath extends 0 5d vertically where it meets the pier the countermeasure was then meshed using tetrahedral shaped elements with the same parameters as those of the unstructured mesh three prism layers with a growth rate of 1 2 are applied at the wall the total elements are 1 36 million the generated mesh is shown in fig 9 the streamlined tapered pier was simulated using the model that best represented the experimental data the rans equations with the realizable k ε turbulence closure the boundary conditions remained the same from the previous structured and unstructured simulations so that the resulting flow structures may be compared contours of bed shear stress and velocity were obtained after the simulations were completed each generated figure was compared against the pier that most closely approximated the experimental data the bed shear stress is a critical parameter in determining an incipient motion of sediment fig 10 shows that the cylindrical pier experiences shear stress of about 1 pa whereas the streamlined tapered sheath has maximum shear stress of 0 8 pa 20 reduction there is a larger region of higher shear stress for the cylindrical pier compared to the streamlined pier sand could be transported in the red regions for the cylindrical pier whereas only finer sands could be expected to be transported along the sides of the streamlined tapered sheath both piers could cause sediment with a critical shear stress of 0 5 pa to be transported about the same amount based on the green portion of the contour transport occurring most along the sides of the piers is consistent with the previous figures the earlier figures indicated transport might also occur downstream of the streamlined tapered pier from this figure sediment with a critical shear stress of 0 3 coarse sand could be transported just aft of the tapered pier but only silts could be transported aft of the cylindrical pier this confirms the ability of the streamlined sheath to reduce scour at the face of the pier compared to the cylindrical pier fig 11 shows that the velocity at z 1 9 is closely correlated with the bed shear stress in fig 10 the streamlined sheath reduced the magnitude of the velocity by approximately 10 from 0 5 to 0 45 m s which reduces the ability of the flow to initiate sediment movement the streamlined shape allows the velocity field in this plane to be more constant compared to the cylindrical pier since this plane is approximately one cm above the bed the velocity will decrease logarithmically to zero at this height sand with a critical velocity ranging between 0 01 m s and 0 1 m s can be transported except for the dark blue regions fig 11 the velocity is 0 35 m s around the aft half of the tapered sheath where it is sharply decreased to 0 002 m s for the aft half of the cylindrical pier accordingly more sediment can be transported in this region for the streamlined pier based on the reduction of bed shear stress by 20 and the decrease in the velocity magnitude by 10 the streamlined tapered sheath would be a good flow altering scour countermeasure especially upstream of the pier furthermore the sheath at the face of the pier acts as a bed armoring device as the downflow deflects from it instead of the sediment for this mean flow velocity one would expect sand to be transported along the sides of the pier just forward of center for the cylindrical pier and only finer sands along the sides for the streamlined tapered pier the streamlined tapered pier does not have a decrease in flow velocity directly downstream of the pier to the extent of the cylindrical pier immediately after the aft of the cylindrical pier silt could be transported based on the value of the critical shear stress whereas sand with a critical shear stress of 0 3 pa could be transported aft of the streamlined tapered sheath at this flow rate however the tapered streamlined sheath can effectively reduce the transport of coarser sand and finer sediments in front of the pier 8 2 delta vane the delta vane was modeled in autocad fig 8 b the dimensions for the delta vane are 2d from the apex to the opposite side and 1 5d for the length of the side opposite to the apex the apex is attached to the bed upstream of the pier and the opposite side is raised and attached to the pier so that the vane forms a 15 angle with the bed a spinal rib is also attached under the vane for support the countermeasure was then meshed using tetrahedral shaped elements with the same parameters as those of the unstructured mesh three prism layers with a growth rate of 1 2 are applied at the wall the total elements are 1 5 million the generated mesh is shown in fig 12 the delta vane attached pier was simulated using the rans equations with the realizable k ε turbulence closure the boundary conditions remained the same from the previous structured and unstructured simulations so that the resulting flow structures may be compared contours of velocity pressure coefficient bed shear stress and turbulence intensity were obtained after the simulation was complete each generated figure was compared against the cylindrical pier fig 13 shows promising results in the delta vane s ability to minimize shear stress on the bed the highest shear stress for the delta vane attached plate is 0 7 pa at the tip of the apex this is approximately 30 less than the maximum shear stress for the cylindrical pier furthermore this is a small region at 0 7 pa which indicates sediment with critical shear stress less than about 0 5 pa sand will be transported both piers have about the same area with 0 5 pa shear stress and so would transport a similar amount of sediment for this shear stress the delta vane experiences a larger zone bed shear stress of 0 3 pa compared to the cylindrical pier which indicates that more sediment could be transported however unlike the tapered streamline pier the delta vane decreases the bed shear stress in the wake zone to about zero pa similar to the cylindrical pier this means that both the cylindrical pier and the delta vane countermeasure may not transport significant sediment in the wake zone the delta vane countermeasure may direct the approaching flow upward away from the bed fig 14 shows the effectiveness of the delta vane to reduce the velocity the velocity magnitude is the largest at the apex of the vane where the flow is directed upward away from the bed the maximum magnitude of the velocity is about 0 45 m s which is 10 lower than the corresponding maximum velocity experienced with the cylinder 0 5 m s the velocity along the side of the pier is greatly reduced compared to the delta vane 0 33 m s versus 0 5 m s for the cylindrical pier based on fig 14 the delta vane cause sediment transport with similar critical velocities as the cylindrical pier in the wake 0 0 16 m s but will lead to more sediment transport with a critical velocity equal to 0 35 m s than the cylindrical pier these numbers will decrease exponentially towards the bed larger sediment requiring a higher critical velocity such as coarse sane may be transported in the case of the cylindrical pier but not for the delta vane pier it should be noted that altering the orientation of the delta vane to the bed or the pier will affect the resulting flow characteristics and bed shear stress if implemented on an actual bridge pier the design orientation would need to be maintained this could be accomplished by armoring the bed beneath the vane to ensure the apex of the vane remains in contact with the bottom surface the combination of a flow altering method with a bed armoring method could extend the operating life or inspection intervals of the bed armoring technique by reducing the velocities and shear stress the bed armoring device is exposed to further studies would need to assess whether the cost of construction of a delta vane on a pier could outweigh the potential savings in maintenance costs for the bed armoring method the delta vane seems to be successful at directing the flow up and away from the bed there is a 30 reduction in maximum bed shear stress for the delta vane compared to the cylindrical vane which means larger sediment may be transported such as coarser sand in this case the maximum velocity just above the bed is reduced 10 for the delta vane however the delta vane has a larger region of 0 35 m s which could mean transporting more medium sized sand at the bed both will transport approximately the same amount of finer sediment such as silt based on the bed shear stress contours the delta vane is an improvement over the streamlined taper sheath pier because it provides bed armoring in the case of a strong downflow like the streamlined pier but it also reduces the velocity and bed shear stress in the wake like the cylindrical pier 8 3 guide wall with slanting vanes the guide wall with slanting vanes was modeled in autocad fig 8 c the length of the guide wall is 0 2d and the slanting vanes are placed every 0 2d the slanting vanes taper to the sides of the pier so that the effective width of the pier is not increased additionally the guide wall and slanting vanes are all 3 mm thick 0 5 d the pier was meshed using tetrahedral shaped elements with the same parameters found in the unstructured mesh results the global mesh was set at 0 4 m the surface mesh for the pier was 0 02 m and 0 1 m for the bottom surface prism layers were not added to the pier since they produced a poorer quality mesh three prism layers of growth rate 1 2 were applied to the bottom surface with a maximum height of 0 005 the total elements were approximately 460k the guide wall with slanting vanes was simulated using the rans equations with the realizable k ε turbulence closure the boundary conditions remained the same from the previous structured and unstructured simulations so that the resulting flow structures may be compared contours of bed shear stress and velocity were obtained after the simulation was complete each generated figure was compared against the cylindrical pier in fig 15 the maximum bed shear stress is reduced from about 1 0 pa to 0 85 pa or a 15 reduction the area that has a bed shear stress equal to 0 85 is small compared to the area equal to this value or higher for the cylindrical pier this means the guide wall with slanting vanes pier could cause little transport of sediment with a critical shear stress of 0 85 whereas the cylindrical pier could cause transport of sediment equal to and up to 1 0 pa or coarse sand versus coarse sand the amount of sediment with a critical shear velocity equal to 0 5 would be transported less for the guide wall with slanting vanes as well as this region is a little smaller in the guide wall pier contour the guide wall with slanting vanes seems to reduce the magnitude of shear stress along the sides of the pier this may be from the guide wall separating the flow similar to the streamlined tapered sheath pier both piers would transport similar amounts of sediment such as silt in the wake the guide wall with slanting vanes reduces the maximum velocity at z 1 9 from 0 5 m s to 0 45 m s or about 10 fig 16 this indicates the cylindrical pier could allow transport of sediment with a critical shear velocity 10 higher than the sediment allowed by the guide wall with slanting vanes pier the wake looks similar for both indicating sediment would likely be transported similarly between the two piers in this region the guide wall with slanting vanes reduced the maximum bed shear stress by 15 and the maximum velocity at z 1 9 by 10 indicating that this pier reduces the maximum size particle that could be transported in this case coarse sand to coarse sand even though the reduction in magnitude was not as high as in some of the other pier designs there is a reduction in the area of shear stress equal to 0 5 pa there will be less sediment transported at or below this critical velocity for the guide wall with slanting vanes the wake region remained similar between the guide wall and slanting vanes pier and the cylindrical pier it is worth mentioning that one experimental study on the guide wall with slanting vanes was considered the mentioned efficiencies may not be reliable as this device loses its efficiency during high flow intensities since the horseshoe vortex develops a few centimeters upstream of the pier to show how effective is this countermeasure during high flow intensities by numerical simulations large eddy simulations les should be considered tafarojnoruz and lauria 2020 8 4 angled plate footings the angled plate countermeasure was modeled in autocad there are four plates with two angled at 30 facing the inlet and the other two are angled at 30 facing the outlet of the domain each plate extends 0 5d from the outside surface of the pier the height is also 0 5d the countermeasure was then meshed using tetrahedral shaped elements with the same parameters as those of the unstructured mesh three prism layers with a growth rate of 1 2 are applied at the wall the total elements are approximately 450k the generated mesh is shown in fig 17 the angled plate footing pier was simulated using the rans equations with the realizable k ε turbulence closure the boundary conditions remained the same from the previous structured and unstructured simulations so that the resulting flow structures may be compared contours of bed shear stress and velocity were obtained after the simulation was complete each generated figure was compared against the cylindrical pier in fig 18 the magnitude of shear stress is reduced by about 30 for the pier with plate footings since there is a small region of shear stress equal to approximately 0 7 pa along the sides of the pier with plate footings versus 1 0 pa along the upstream sides of the cylindrical pier since this region is so small one would expect sediment of critical shear stress of 0 5 pa or lowered to be transported this region of 0 5 pa is a little larger than the corresponding region for the cylindrical pier indicating more sediment with this critical shear velocity sand will be transported for the pier with plate footings both piers perform well in the wake with 0 0 1 pa which is conducive for silt transport the velocity magnitude above the bed corresponds well with the shear stress contour in fig 18 the maximum velocity at the front sides of the cylindrical pier is reduced from 0 5 m s to 0 35 m s 30 reduction there is a larger region of slower velocity at the front of the pier with plate footings which showed the velocity magnitudes of the piers at the plane of symmetry the lower velocity in the wake extends farther downstream than the cylindrical pier indicating this pier will minimize sediment transport downstream more than the cylindrical pier the angle of the plate footings may act to capture sediment colliding with the base of this pier this region at the upstream base of the pier also has a low velocity so as seen in fig 19 extending about 0 5d farther upstream than the cylindrical pier so sediment may build up in this region this may act counter or prevent future scour but the sediment transport is still likely along the sides of this pier the angled plate footings pier reduced the maximum bed shear stress by 30 but most of the shear stress for this pier was about 0 5 pa indicating that sediment with a critical shear stress of this value or lower such as sand will be transported there is a 30 reduction in maximum velocity above the bed for the pier with plate footings but this pier extends the region of lower velocity both upstream by about 0 5d and downstream compared to the cylindrical pier the angled plates may act to capture sediment as an active scour control measure so this might be a useful test to perform with sediment in a laboratory study 9 delta vane countermeasure at higher reynolds number in section 7 the delta vane pier attachment demonstrated a significant decrease in bed shear stress indicating a strong potential to reduce scour all investigated piers were analyzed under a reynolds number of 1 7 105 this was based on the reynolds number used to validate the cfd model with experimental results even though the delta vane was effective at this reynolds number it is crucial to ascertain that the shear stress will be reduced at a higher reynolds number full scale to determine a realistic yet high reynolds number to reanalyze the delta vane pier attachment the estimated depth averaged flow velocity was determined using measured data from the united states geological survey usgs usgs 2019 flood data from the mississippi river in baton rouge are used to calculate a high reynolds number that can be experienced in this location historical maximum flow discharges for the mississippi river in baton rouge were considered to be about 41 626 m3 s usgs 2019 the depth averaged velocity for the highest discharge was calculated by dividing the discharge by the estimated cross sectional area located at mississippi river mile marker 232 the area is approximately 13 470 m2 and the average velocity is about 3 m s little and biedenharn 2014 if the diameter of a bridge pier or support structure is 1 6 m then the corresponding reynolds number for a velocity of 3 m s is 5 1 106 the modeled pier is 0 536 m in diameter so a velocity of 9 5 m s was applied at the inlet to obtain the same reynolds number because of this high reynolds number the mesh was refined so that the delta vane configuration has 2 6 million elements and the cylindrical pier has 2 1 million elements fig 20 shows the bed shear stress for the cylindrical pier versus the delta vane for a reynolds number of 5 1 106 the calculated maximum bed shear stress for the cylinder is approximately 450 pa and approximately 350 pa for the delta vane which indicates a 22 reduction this is less than the 30 reduction seen at the lower reynolds number it may be that at higher reynolds numbers the delta vane reduces the scour potential less but it still causes a significant reduction in maximum bed shear stress compared to the cylindrical pier fig 21 shows the velocity magnitude for the plane at 1 cm above the bed the simulated maximum velocity for the cylinder was approximately 15 m s the maximum velocity for the delta vane is approximately 14 m s this indicates a 7 reduction which is less than the 10 reduction seen at the lower reynolds number like the bed shear stress the delta vane seems to be less effective at reducing scour potential at a high reynolds number but there is still a noticeable reduction the delta vane configuration reduced maximum bed shear stress by 22 compared to the cylindrical pier and the velocity above the bed by 7 for a reynolds number equal to 5 1 106 although both values are less than the reductions at the lower reynolds number the delta vane configuration still decreases the maximum bed shear stress and velocity above the bed by a significant amount which correlates to a reduction in scour potential this higher reynolds number was estimated using the maximum parameters for a bridge pier in the mississippi river near baton rouge louisiana it is likely that in most cases for a given bridge pier the reynolds number would be much smaller than this value the reduction of scour potential for the delta vane could be likely larger it is worth to mention that the study of different sediment is beyond the scope of the current paper the cfd investigation is conceptual to compare different scour countermeasures under the same flow conditions however by reducing the bed shear stress the proposed countermeasures demonstrate their potential to mitigate scour these solutions have a strong potential to reduce the accelerated deterioration and can protect bridges and other coastal and offshore infrastructure against collapse due to scour 10 conclusions scour around bridge piers and monopile foundations such as offshore wind turbines is a significant issue that contributes to the failure and instability of structures we investigated different turbulence closures including the standard k ε k ε realizable standard k ω and k ω sst to understand their capability to predict the bed shear stress we then assessed the performance of different flow countermeasures in a comparative study the k ω equations can simulate adverse pressure gradients however the k ε equations consistently performed better in approximating the experimental data in particular the k ε realizable model predicted the components of velocity well the use of unstructured mesh allowed the consideration of more complex geometry four scour countermeasures are investigated at a reynolds number of 1 7 105 streamlined tapered sheath delta vane guide wall with slanting plates and angled plate footings the findings are as follows the optimized unstructured mesh may have y values varying between 1 and 17 the k ω models approximate the experimental data more with the unstructured mesh compared to the structured mesh for greater y values this improved performance may be due to the tetrahedral shapes compared to the rectangular prisms or that achieving a y value close to 1 is not that critical for the flow physics considered in the current study the delta vane and the angled plate footings reduced the maximum bed shear stress by 30 the two countermeasures reduced the maximum velocity around the pier by about 10 and 30 respectively in the wake of the pier both countermeasures yield a bed shear stress close to zero the delta vane represents an upstream physical barrier which may armor the bed in the case of a strong downflow the streamlined tapered sheath reduced the maximum bed shear stress and the maximum velocity by 20 and 10 respectively the sheath armors the bed and deflects the downflows the reductions in the shear stress and the flow velocity at the front of the pier suggest that the streamlined tapered sheath may reduce scour at this location however the streamlined tapered sheath does not yield a decrease in the flow velocity directly downstream sediment such as sand with a critical shear stress of 0 3 pa can be transported aft of the streamlined tapered sheath the guide wall with slanting vanes was the least effective countermeasure this countermeasure reduced the maximum bed shear stress and the maximum velocity above the bed by 15 and 10 respectively the performance of the delta vane countermeasure was further investigated at a reynolds number of 5 1 106 at such a high reynolds number the delta vane reduced the maximum bed shear stress and maximum velocity by 22 and 7 respectively overall the findings reveal that the delta vane countermeasure can reduce the scour potential at low and high reynolds numbers to conclude hydrodynamic models are crucial for the assessment and performance comparison of scour countermeasures the delta vane and the angled plate footings performed well in reducing the bed shear stress followed by the streamlined tapered sheath the angled plate footing may capture sediment and hence actively act as a scour countermeasure

20606,safe installation of suction caissons requires a reliable preliminary study where soil resistance and other soil conditions are predicted with good accuracy past studies did not address the full problem when modelling the installation procedure of suction caissons in sand suction was prescribed at the mudline and soil resistance was predicted based on soil properties and the resulting seepage profile around the caisson wall suction magnitude was assumed to overcome soil resistance limiting its magnitude to avoid critical conditions such as piping most of these studies did not address other important parameters such as pumping rate and water depth this paper addresses the following points feasibility of the installation depends on the water depth and hence this must be specified as part of the installation design suction magnitude in excess to the initial hydrostatic pressure corresponds to a certain pumping rate which is the parameter to control for a safe installation a full numerical model is proposed in this paper to consider a prescribed pumping rate at the center of the caisson lid and the resulting flow inside the caisson cavity the model was implemented in comsol

studies that have been devoted to the installation and performance of suction caissons over the past few decades a recent regain of interest to this type of foundation has emerged bienen et al 2018 wang et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 whilst offshore suction caissons owe their initial popularity to the rapid development that took place within the oil and gas industry they now represent a potential attractive solution as a foundation for offshore wind turbines among their main advantages over piled foundations suction caissons are more economical easy to install and can be easily removed at the end of a project life byrne et al 2002 2003 houlsby et al 2005 kim et al 2017 bienen et al 2017 le et al 2018 caisson installation requires a safe design procedure and must be planned carefully suction assisted installation relies on accurate prediction of soil resistance and critical soil conditions that may develop during the installation phase installation design must consider the seabed profile and the type of soil that makes the seabed formation houlsby et al 2005 andersen et al 2008 guo et al 2012 harireche et al 2013 2014 2014 wu et al 2017 mehravar et al 2018 alluqmani et al 2019 he et al 2020 while suction generates a downward force by creating a pressure differential on the caisson lid seepage induces a reduction in soil resistance to caisson penetration this is achieved as a result of reducing the effective stress which in turn reduces the mobilized frictional resistance that develops on the embedded part of the caisson wall senpere et al 1982 tjelta et al 1986 erbrich et al 1999 tran et al 2004 2005 2005 chen et al 2016 mehravar et al 2017 cpt tests conducted inside the caisson cavity before and after caisson installation in a sand deposit revealed significant soil loosening senders et al 2009 whilst seepage is beneficial to caisson installation in sand and granular deposits suction magnitude must be controlled to ensure a safe installation and avoid critical soil conditions such as piping bye et al 1995 tjelta 1994 1995 ibsen et al 2010 2011 the effects of suction induced seepage on soil skirt interaction and penetration resistance have also been investigated in centrifuge model testing allersma et al 1999 allersma 2003 tran et al 2007 2008 lab experiments bang et al 1999 villalobos 2006 lian et al 2014 and finite element simulations vasquez et al 2000 zhang et al 2004 more recently as a response to the need to move towards deep waters novel caisson designs have been developed and more studies on their suction assisted installation have been published zhang et al 2017 2018 the present paper focuses on caisson installation in sand where suction induced seepage is pivotal to a successful installation process past studies focused on suction as the main parameter to control throughout the installation procedure houlsby et al 2005 harireche et al 2013 2014 suction was prescribed at mudline level inside the caisson cavity and its magnitude was set to overcome soil resistance no reference was made to the water depth pumping rate and the actual driving pressure although these parameters are always checked before considering the feasibility of a suction assisted installation the present paper proposes a full numerical framework where feasibility and safety of suction caisson installation are considered in a more effective way modelling the full caisson problem enables a more realistic simulation of the installation process by considering more realistic boundary conditions the present approach prioritizes pumping rate as the main parameter to control during the whole installation process the method of analysis presented in this paper is based on a numerical model that has been implemented in comsol multiphysics in this model water pumping out of the caisson cavity and caisson downward movement are described using brinkman equations with appropriate boundary conditions free deformed geometry combined to a remeshing procedure are used within a time stepping algorithm throughout a simulation of the whole installation process as caisson penetrates the seabed boundary conditions on the embedded caisson wall are propagated according to the penetration rate the present model does not consider any soil deformation around the caisson cavity however the proposed full numerical simulation of the suction assisted installation of the caisson foundation has not been addressed in the past the numerical study is validated based on the simulation of a field test reported in the literature houlsby and byrne 2005 model prediction of soil resistance to caisson penetration and critical piping are highlighted in conjunction with field data the validation procedure also addresses the feasibility of suction installation in sand by considering water depth and different pumping rates unlike numerous past studies critical soil conditions are directly linked to the pumping rate which is specified as the main design parameter for a safe installation and a reasonable installation time 2 caisson installation in homogeneous sand 2 1 caisson geometry the caisson shape under consideration in this study consists of a cylinder of wall thickness th inner radius r i and outer radius r o the caisson lid of thickness th is assumed to have enough stiffness to transmit the pressure differential to the caisson wall during the installation process once lowered to the seabed under self weight the caisson reaches a penetration depth h 0 this initial penetration depth is very important to the installation process as it provides a seal which is necessary for the suction to mobilize the required driving force as water is pumped out of the caisson cavity suction differential pushes the caisson into the seabed the initial seal is also important to enable the development of seepage around the caisson wall which reduces the resisting force and facilitates the downward caisson movement at a time t during the installation process caisson penetration is denoted as h fig 1 depicts caisson geometrical properties and shows the coordinate system used in the analysis for simplicity the installation is supposed to take place in homogeneous sand in this case soil permeability affects only the pumping rate in reality permeability may vary with depth harireche et al 2013 soil loosening inside caisson cavity may also cause a local increase in soil permeability making it deviate from its initial homogeneity whilst the present study assumes a homogeneous permeability it is not difficult to extend the present work to cases where the soil profile presents some kind of heterogeneity either natural or induced by the installation process 2 2 expression of the force f r resisting caisson penetration caisson penetration is resisted by friction which develops over the inner and outer surfaces of the caisson wall and by tip resistance produced by the seabed reaction at the caisson tip fig 2 the total resisting force f r can be resolved as 1 f r f s f t where f s and f t are the resultant forces of frictional and tip resistance respectively given by the following expressions 2 f s π k tan δ f r i r o γ h 2 2 f r i 0 h p i s d z 2 r o 0 h p o d z f t π r n q t h 2 γ h p i h p o h s π r n γ t h 2 γ more details on the derivation of these expressions are given in appendix a parameter k denotes the coefficient of soil lateral pressure f is a coefficient of soil loosening under upward seepage inside the caisson cavity f 1 and δ is the angle of friction at the contact interface between soil and caisson wall excess pore water pressure induced by suction on the inner and outer caisson walls is denoted as p i and p o respectively γ denotes the soil submerged weight parameters n q and nγ are bearing capacity factors at the caisson tip related to surcharge and soil self weight houlsby et al 2005 and p ih p oh denote excess pore pressure at caisson tip on the inner and outer wall respectively suction produced at mudline level inside the caisson cavity has a magnitude s note that soil loosening is introduced in the problem formulation through coefficient f in equation 2 such effect has been studied in detail by harireche et al 2014 in the present work this effect will not be considered in the numerical simulations for simplicity however the completeness of the theoretical framework presented here should facilitate potential extensions including soil loosening induced by suction 2 3 a validation field test houlsby and byrne reported experimental data obtained from field trials that took place at tenby field trial 1 and sandy haven field trial 2 on the south coast of wales houlsby and byrne 2005 in the present study we will use their field data from field trial 1 to validate the various aspects considered in the numerical simulations the seabed formation consists of dense sand with a saturated unit weight of 18 3 kn m3 an angle of shearing resistance of 40 and a factor k tan δ estimated at 0 48 houlsby and byrne 2005 the caisson prototype has a diameter of 2 m a height of 2 m and a wall thickness of 8 mm fig 3 shows the recorded installation suction as a function of depth it can be observed that once the installation depth reaches 1 4 m in this field trial there is a loss of suction and the installation fails to proceed further this is clearly an indication of critical development of piping channels this aspect will be investigated in sections 3 2 and 4 3 where critical piping is assessed using a criterion that can be visualized within the soil region in the inner side of the caisson wall 3 feasibility of suction assisted installation 3 1 available driving force at a given water depth the available driving force is the potential force that will be transmitted to the caisson lid as water is pumped out of the caisson cavity pumping develops a pressure differential which results into a downward force pushing the caisson into the seabed in the extreme case where soil resistance prevents a continuous movement the maximum downward force becomes available when a gap is created under the caisson lid and such a force governs the minimum water depth below which a suction assisted installation is not feasible at time t0 0 which corresponds to the self weight penetration h 0 the magnitude of such a force is denoted f d0 and is given by the expression 3 f d 0 π r 2 γ w d w h h 0 where d w is the water depth as shown in fig 1 and r the mean caisson radius this force must overcome the resisting force f r0 when pumping starts as f r0 balances the buoyant self weight v this results into the condition 4 f d 0 v which leads to the inequality 5 d w v π r 2 γ w h h 0 this inequality provides a condition on the minimum water depth below which suction assisted installation will not be possible the initial penetration depth h 0 can be obtained by writing the balance between the initial resisting force f r0 and the buoyant weight v which leads to the expression 6 h 0 n q t h n q t h 2 2 k tan δ n γ t h 2 v π r γ 2 k tan δ a detailed derivation of expression 6 is provided in appendix b the caisson submerged weight is given by see appendix b 7 v π r 2 t h 1 2 h r γ s t g s t 1 g s t v where g st denotes the specific gravity of steel defined by 8 g s t ρ s t ρ w and ρ s t denotes the mass density of steel note that the self weight v includes both caisson wall and caisson lid inequality 5 can be rewritten under the form 9 d w g s t 1 1 2 h r t h h h 0 as the installation proceeds the condition f d f r must be satisfied continuously at a generic penetration depth h such a condition reads 10 π r 2 γ w d w h h f r the quantity 11 s d γ w d w h h represents the available driving pressure at penetration depth h suction magnitude must be controlled throughout the installation process to prevent the development of critical a piping condition as will be examined in more details later this is achieved by setting an appropriate safety factor against critical piping the installation driving pressure s d must overcome the soil resistance at penetration depth h defined by 12 σ r f r π r 2 note that σ r includes both frictional resistance and tip resistance condition 10 can simply be rewritten as 13 s d σ r when installation takes place in homogeneous sand it is sufficient to ensure that the above condition is met at h h0 and h h which can be written as 14 γ w d w h h 0 σ r 0 15 γ w d w σ r h 3 2 critical suction for piping condition when caisson installation takes place in sand upward seepage inside the caisson cavity may cause a critical soil condition that might compromise soil stability known as piping the formation of piping channels may lead to a gradual damage of the seal around the caisson wall which may eventually cause a subsequent loss of suction and lead to installation failure piping condition first develops at the caisson tip and propagates upwards on the inner side of the caisson wall ibsen et al 2010 2011 alluqmani et al 2020 such a condition can be expressed by 16 p z γ as the pressure gradient has the highest positive value at the caisson tip on the inner side of the caisson wall this location is the most critical for piping to initiate piping is likely to occur only at the inner side of the caisson wall where the upward seepage develops a seepage force acting against gravity the region subject to piping inside the caisson cavity is defined by the condition 17 ξ 1 where 18 ξ r z 1 γ p z function ξ represents a useful criterion to investigate soil region within the inner side of the caisson wall that is prone to piping development 4 a full numerical model for caisson installation 4 1 modelling seepage coupled soil resistance to caisson penetration a full numerical model is adopted in the present study to analyze the installation procedure for a prescribed pumping rate as pointed out previously such a numerical approach has the advantage of controlling pumping rate instead of suction as the main design parameter for a safe installation in previous studies houlsby et al 2005 harireche et al 2013 2014 caisson installation has been analyzed in terms of a prescribed suction which was estimated based on the force required to overcome soil resistance in the present approach suction is estimated based on a safe pumping rate and not with respect to soil resistance pumping at a certain flow rate for a given water depth can only be possible if the magnitude of developed suction exceeds the minimum value defined by 11 hence as long as condition 10 is satisfied soil resistance should not affect the installation success suction magnitude in excess of the minimum value set by 11 determines the intensity of pumping rate and affects the installation time only however pumping rate must be applied within safe limits with respect to critical piping therefore pumping rate appears as the main parameter that should govern the installation design a proper design procedure must predict the appropriate pumping rate under safety constraints and the resulting installation time unlike previous numerical studies where suction was prescribed at the mudline within caisson cavity the current numerical model considers the full caisson geometry and hence the full installation problem this is necessary in order to control the prescribed pumping rate in a simulation where the caisson is pushed into the seabed starting from the penetration depth achieved under self weight the present model requires a numerical description of water flow out of caisson cavity and pore water seepage within the soil volume surrounding the embedded part of the caisson wall such a model is used to estimate soil resistance given the importance of seepage in the mitigation of lateral soil pressure and hence the reduction of mobilized friction on caisson wall the numerical procedure used to model water pumping out of caisson cavity is based on brinkman equations water seepage within the seabed region is governed by darcy s law a moving mesh is used to simulate caisson movement and this is achieved using comsol free deformation a condition assigned to the water volume inside the caisson cavity above the mudline fig 4 illustrates the numerical modelling adopted within each region of the problem geometry and the appropriate boundary conditions 4 2 governing equations in the initial configuration after caisson penetration under self weight pressure distribution within the soil mass and caisson cavity results from the initial hydrostatic condition upon development of pumping induced suction a negative excess pore pressure is generated within the caisson cavity and seabed region surrounding the caisson wall such a pressure is associated with the pore water seepage taking place throughout the installation process pressure distribution can only be determined by addressing the full numerical problem of pore water seepage within the soil mass coupled to free flow out of the caisson cavity under a prescribed pumping rate fig 4 within the soil mass pore water seepage is governed by darcy s law and obeys the following equations continuity equation 19 t ρ w φ ρ w u 0 where ρ w is the mass density of water φ denotes porosity and u is the darcy velocity field defined by u φ u ˆ where u ˆ denotes the intrinsic velocity in the axisymmetric condition of the present problem model the operator in equation 19 is defined by 20 f 1 r r f r r f z z where f is a vector valued function and f r f z its components in the cylindrical system of coordinates note that due to axisymmetric conditions the component fθ of function f is not involved in the definition 20 of the divergence operator 4 2 1 darcy s law according to darcy s law the velocity field within the soil mass is determined by the gradient of excess pore water pressure p water dynamic viscosity μ pa s and soil intrinsic permeability κ m2 as follows 21 u κ μ p ρ w g where g denotes the gravity vector 4 2 2 water flow within the caisson cavity brinkman equations brinkman equations are used to describe the water movement within caisson cavity under a prescribed pumping rate these equations can be viewed as an extension of darcy s law for describing fast moving fluids in porous media with a kinetic potential from fluid velocity pressure and gravity dissipation of kinetic energy takes place under viscous shear as with navier stokes equations porosity in brinkman s model can vary from small finite values for nearly impervious solids to unity for domains of free flow flow velocity is defined in a way that is consistent with the porous medium and is also referred to as darcy s velocity this definition enables the velocity field to be continuous at the interface between the soil below the mudline and the caisson cavity above the mudline in addition to the continuity equation 2 brinkman equations governing water flow within the caisson cavity above the mudline are presented under the form 22 ρ w φ u t u u φ p 1 φ μ u t u 2 3 μ u δ ρ w g in this equation u is darcy s velocity as defined in darcy s equation 21 and μ denotes the dynamic water viscosity pressure in excess of the hydrostatic value is denoted as p 4 2 3 boundary conditions in addition to the equations governing darcy s velocity field u and excess water pressure p appropriate boundary conditions must be specified fig 4 illustrates the prescribed boundary conditions on the mudline at the outer side of the caisson wall and on the lateral far boundaries excess pore pressure is zero p 0 on the bottom far boundary normal flow to the boundary is zero u n 0 where n is the outward unit normal vector to the boundary normal flow to the embedded part of the caisson wall is zero u n 0 far from the pumping area flow inside the caisson cavity is assumed to be laminar hence slip is allowed on the inner side of the caisson lid and on the inner wall this condition implicitly assumes that there are no viscous effects at the slip wall and hence no boundary layer develops the main effect of the wall is to prevent water from leaving and the condition reads u n 0 at the boundary m which coincides with the caisson lid the mesh is subjected to the prescribed downward velocity d h q o a p a i where q o is the net flow out of the pumping area a p π a 2 and a i π r i 2 is the inner area of the caisson lid this condition can be prescribed in comsol multiphysics within the free deformation option which must be assigned to the water volume inside the caisson cavity above the mudline remeshing is often necessary whenever the mesh reaches a certain degree of distortion and this option is also available within comsol capabilities the geometric surface σ moves with the same downward velocity dh as the mesh boundary m the surface σ is used to propagate the boundary condition preventing normal flow through the caisson wall as caisson moves downward 4 2 4 free and porous medium flow interface at the interface between caisson cavity above the mudline free flow domain and soil on the inner side of the caisson wall below the mudline porous domain the same velocity and pressure fields u and p are solved for using darcy and brinkman equations this imposes upon velocity u and pressure p to remain continuous across the interface between the free flow domain and the porous medium 4 3 preliminary numerical results the numerical procedure described in this section is now applied to the simulation of the suction assisted installation of the caisson prototype used in tenby field trials houlsby and byrne 2005 and described in section 2 3 equation 6 predicts an initial caisson penetration depth h 0 0 25 m the caisson is then pushed under a combination of the available pressure on the caisson lid and the pumping rate the simulation has been performed for three pumping rates namely a reference pumping rate of magnitude q 0 1 0 10 3 m 3 s and two pumping rates of magnitudes q 1 2 0 10 3 m 3 s and q 2 3 0 10 3 m 3 s water is pumped out at the center of the caisson lid through a pumping area a p of radius a 0 05 m fig 5 shows the magnitude of excess pore pressure distribution within soil and caisson cavity and the streamlines of water seepage for installation depths h 0 6 m 1 0 m 1 4 m and 1 8 m under flow rate q 0 1 0 10 3 m 3 s as expected pressure magnitude increases with an increasing penetration depth at a constant water pumping rate fig 6 shows the mesh configuration at different stages of the caisson installation propagation of the boundary condition on the embedded caisson wall is evident from pressure contours and streamlines in figs 5 and 6 both figures show that the extent of caisson movement that can be simulated covers the full installation depth fig 6 shows the remeshing capability available in comsol which enables the transient nature of the actual installation problem to be simulated the resulting full numerical model provides a realistic numerical tool for the investigation of the real installation problem excess pore pressure on each side of the caisson wall is shown in fig 7 for each prescribed pumping rate note that excess pore pressure induced by suction is always negative for each pumping rate the magnitude of excess pore pressure on the outer side of the caisson wall increases from zero at the mudline to a maximum value at the caisson tip on the inner side the magnitude of excess pore pressure keeps increasing to a maximum value at the mudline which corresponds to the usually prescribed suction however in the present model suction is not imposed but obtained as a result of the prescribed pumping rate 4 4 model validation suction assisted installation of the caisson prototype used in the field trial at tenby has been presented in section 4 1 the preliminary numerical results presented in that section show the capability of the proposed numerical model to enable a simulation of the actual installation process data recorded during the field trial consist of suction magnitude as a function of installation depth section 2 3 these data are also shown in fig 8 for comparison with the simulation results results have been produced for three pumping rates namely q 0 1 0 10 3 m3 s q 1 2 0 10 3 m3 s and q 2 3 0 10 3 m3 s for each of these pumping rates soil resistance and suction have been calculated and are presented in fig 8 as functions of installation depth given the importance of water depth for the feasibility of suction assisted installation the available driving pressure for a depth d w 3 m is also shown for reference purpose communication with the second author houlsby and byrne 2005 revealed that at that particular location the caisson was installed off the side of the quay wall but the water was extremely tidal at high tide when the caisson was installed a water depth about 2 m 3 m is plausible a water depth of 3 m is used for reference the field trials show that the applied suction is slightly lower than the soil resistance that develops under a piping rate of q 0 1 0 10 3 m 3 s but exceeds soil resistance for the pumping rates q 1 2 0 10 3 m3 s and q 2 3 0 10 3 m3 s hence it can be assumed that the actual pumping rate applied in the field trial exceeds the value q 0 1 0 10 3 m 3 s suctions that are associated with the three pumping rates used in the simulation are shown in fig 8 it is important to emphasize once more that increasing the pumping rate and hence suction magnitude will only affect installation time a higher pumping rate will obviously correspond to a reduced installation time however a limit to the pumping rate is set by the piping condition and a safe installation design should consider such a criterion feasibility of the installation is dictated by the water depth which determines the potential driving pressure as expressed in equation 11 for instance in the results shown in fig 8 a water depth of 3 m seems to enable an installation depth that in theory cannot exceed 1 2 m beyond that depth condition 13 cannot be satisfied however as the actual installation could proceed to a depth of 1 4 m it can be assumed that water depth was slightly larger than 3 m the fact that the installation stopped at depth 1 4 m with a loss of suction as shown in fig 8 has most probably been caused by the development of piping channels a similar problem has been reported in ibsen et al 2010 2011 indeed simulation results that are presented in section 4 3 show clearly that at depth 1 4 m a piping channel forms under flow rate q 3 0 10 3 m 3 s extending over the full installation depth in addition to the previous observations simulation results presented in fig 8 show that while suction increases with an increasing pumping rate soil resistance decreases as a result of an increasing pore pressure it is important to note that fig 8 shows suction magnitude in excess of the initial hydrostatic pressure which is simply referred to as suction 4 5 model prediction of critical suction for piping development as pointed out in section 3 2 piping develops at the inner side of the caisson wall initiating at the caisson tip and propagating upwards within the soil mass soil region where piping develops and evolves as installation proceeds can be tracked during the numerical simulation using a visualization of function ξ defined in section 3 2 contours of function ξ with a magnitude exceeding unity indicate the soil region on the inner side of the caisson wall where piping instability developed to some extent this procedure provides useful information on how to select a safe pumping rate for caisson installation figs 9 11 show the contours of function ξ for the field trial at tenby the single contour line corresponds to ξ 1 which materializes the limiting boundary to the safe region the simulation has been performed for three pumping rates namely a reference rate q 0 1 0 10 3 m 3 s and two pumping rates q 1 2 0 10 3 m 3 s and q 2 3 0 10 3 m 3 s results for a higher pumping rate q 3 5 0 10 3 m 3 s are presented at last to show how piping may reach critical extents that may compromise the installation process due to piping channels eventually developing on the inner side of the caisson wall breaking the soil impervious seal and leading to a loss of suction as can be seen from figs 9 11 under pumping rates q 0 1 0 10 3 m 3 s and q 1 2 0 10 3 m 3 s piping condition is localized at the caisson tip such a condition does not affect the installation safety as it does not cause any damage to the established seal at the soil wall interface however piping instability extends over a significant depth under pumping rate q 2 3 0 10 3 m 3 s and may cause a formation of piping channels as can be seen from fig 10 where installation depth reaches 1 4 m a depth that marked a loss of suction in the field trial at tenby houlsby and byrne 2005 a pumping rate q 3 5 0 10 3 m 3 s shows a large piping zone developing from the early installation stage 5 conclusion a full numerical model for suction assisted installation of caisson foundations has been proposed in the present paper the study has been motivated by the need for an installation procedure that integrates both feasibility and safety of the installation process whilst feasibility must consider water depth and the available driving pressure safety is related to piping condition that develops when installation takes place in sand the proposed numerical procedure enables a realistic simulation of caisson installation in sand under a prescribed pumping rate a full numerical model has been implemented in comsol multiphysics combining comsol capabilities such as free deformation and remeshing the model is based on the simulation of free water flow under pumping from the caisson cavity using brinkman equations coupled to porewater seepage around caisson wall described by darcy s model darcy s velocity field and excess pore pressure are subjected to continuity conditions at the interface between the two media where seepage and free flow take place and appropriate boundary conditions including a prescribed flow rate in the pumping area the numerical model has been validated using a simulation of real field data numerical predictions of developed suction and soil resistance have been presented for different prescribed pumping rates the role of water depth and the available driving pressure has been highlighted within the frame of the modeled field trial critical condition for piping was analyzed and its interpretation was consistent with the installation difficulties encountered during the field trial it is beyond the scope of the present work to account for soil deformation however it is believed that the current model paves the way for such future investigation finally although the simulations presented in this paper show clearly how piping evolves within the soil region subjected to upward seepage it is necessary to develop a criterion based on the extent of soil volume affected by piping in order to set a clear limit to the safe pumping rate credit authorship

penetration let us consider the caisson at a generic penetration depth h total pore pressure p i z produced at depth z on the inner side of caisson wall is given by a1 p i z γ w d w z 0 z g i ζ d ζ the excess pore pressure p i z can be expressed in terms of the z component g i p i z of the hydraulic gradient as follows a2 p i z s 0 z g i ζ d ζ at mudline level p i 0 is written as s where s is the suction magnitude note that as p i z 0 s 0 z g i ζ d ζ a3 at the same depth z the soil total vertical stress is given by a4 σ v i z γ w d w γ s a t z soil vertical effective stress is then obtained as the difference σ v i z p i z and is given by a5 σ v i z γ z 0 z g i ζ d ζ γ z p i z s on the inner side of the caisson wall the hydraulic gradient is positive and the effective stress drops by the quantity 0 z g i ζ d ζ compared to its magnitude γ z that prevails in hydrostatic condition this reduction in effective stress is produced by the counter gravity upward seepage induced by suction such a phenomenon may reach a critical condition under sufficiently strong suction leading to zero effective stress which is referred to as piping and which must be controlled during the whole installation process in order to achieve a thorough safe installation on the outer side of the caisson wall where excess pressure at mudline level is zero i e p o 0 0 the excess pore pressure at a generic depth z p o z is given by a6 p o z 0 z g o ζ d ζ the effective stress at generic depth z is obtained through the same procedure as above and can be written as a7 σ v o z γ z 0 z g o ζ d ζ where g o ζ denotes the hydraulic gradient on the outer side of caisson wall note that g o ζ is negative through the penetration depth so that the effective stress increases on the outer side of caisson wall by the quantity 0 z g o ζ d ζ compared to its magnitude in hydrostatic condition such an increase in the magnitude of the effective vertical stress on the outer side of caisson wall is produced by the downward suction induced seepage obviously effective stress at the same generic depth z in hydrostatic condition on either side of the caisson wall has same magnitude so that the net reduction in such a stress produced by suction induced seepage is a8 δ σ v 0 z g i ζ d ζ 0 z g o ζ d ζ this last expression highlights the benefits of suction induced seepage on caisson installation in sand as otherwise a higher vertical effective stress reflects into a higher frictional resistance to caisson penetration due to a larger lateral soil pressure on the caisson wall and hence a larger mobilized friction mobilized friction stresses τ i z and τ o z that develop on the inner and outer sides of the caisson wall respectively are given by a9 τ i z k tan δ σ v i z and τ o z k tan δ σ v o

expression of the initial self weight penetration h 0 the initial penetration depth h 0 results from a balance between the initial resisting force f r0 and the caisson buoyant weight v the resisting force f r0 is given by b1 f r 0 f s 0 f t 0 and the initial force balance reads b2 f r 0 f s 0 f t 0 v where f s 0 and f t 0 are the contributions from frictional and tip resistances mobilized at self weight penetration these two forces are given by eq a11 and a14 where both suction magnitude s and pore pressures p i and p o are set to zero parameter f of soil loosening is set to one as no such effect occurs at this stage of the installation the resulting expressions are b3 f s 0 2 π k tan δ r γ h 0 2 b4 f t 0 2 π r n q t h γ h 0 π r n γ t h 2 γ after substitution of eqs b3 and b4 into eq b2 we obtain the following expression of self weight penetration depth h 0 b5 h 0 n q t h n q t h 2 2 k tan δ n γ t h 2 v π r γ 2 k tan δ the caisson buoyant weight v is given by b6 v γ s t v c where γ s

20606,safe installation of suction caissons requires a reliable preliminary study where soil resistance and other soil conditions are predicted with good accuracy past studies did not address the full problem when modelling the installation procedure of suction caissons in sand suction was prescribed at the mudline and soil resistance was predicted based on soil properties and the resulting seepage profile around the caisson wall suction magnitude was assumed to overcome soil resistance limiting its magnitude to avoid critical conditions such as piping most of these studies did not address other important parameters such as pumping rate and water depth this paper addresses the following points feasibility of the installation depends on the water depth and hence this must be specified as part of the installation design suction magnitude in excess to the initial hydrostatic pressure corresponds to a certain pumping rate which is the parameter to control for a safe installation a full numerical model is proposed in this paper to consider a prescribed pumping rate at the center of the caisson lid and the resulting flow inside the caisson cavity the model was implemented in comsol

studies that have been devoted to the installation and performance of suction caissons over the past few decades a recent regain of interest to this type of foundation has emerged bienen et al 2018 wang et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 whilst offshore suction caissons owe their initial popularity to the rapid development that took place within the oil and gas industry they now represent a potential attractive solution as a foundation for offshore wind turbines among their main advantages over piled foundations suction caissons are more economical easy to install and can be easily removed at the end of a project life byrne et al 2002 2003 houlsby et al 2005 kim et al 2017 bienen et al 2017 le et al 2018 caisson installation requires a safe design procedure and must be planned carefully suction assisted installation relies on accurate prediction of soil resistance and critical soil conditions that may develop during the installation phase installation design must consider the seabed profile and the type of soil that makes the seabed formation houlsby et al 2005 andersen et al 2008 guo et al 2012 harireche et al 2013 2014 2014 wu et al 2017 mehravar et al 2018 alluqmani et al 2019 he et al 2020 while suction generates a downward force by creating a pressure differential on the caisson lid seepage induces a reduction in soil resistance to caisson penetration this is achieved as a result of reducing the effective stress which in turn reduces the mobilized frictional resistance that develops on the embedded part of the caisson wall senpere et al 1982 tjelta et al 1986 erbrich et al 1999 tran et al 2004 2005 2005 chen et al 2016 mehravar et al 2017 cpt tests conducted inside the caisson cavity before and after caisson installation in a sand deposit revealed significant soil loosening senders et al 2009 whilst seepage is beneficial to caisson installation in sand and granular deposits suction magnitude must be controlled to ensure a safe installation and avoid critical soil conditions such as piping bye et al 1995 tjelta 1994 1995 ibsen et al 2010 2011 the effects of suction induced seepage on soil skirt interaction and penetration resistance have also been investigated in centrifuge model testing allersma et al 1999 allersma 2003 tran et al 2007 2008 lab experiments bang et al 1999 villalobos 2006 lian et al 2014 and finite element simulations vasquez et al 2000 zhang et al 2004 more recently as a response to the need to move towards deep waters novel caisson designs have been developed and more studies on their suction assisted installation have been published zhang et al 2017 2018 the present paper focuses on caisson installation in sand where suction induced seepage is pivotal to a successful installation process past studies focused on suction as the main parameter to control throughout the installation procedure houlsby et al 2005 harireche et al 2013 2014 suction was prescribed at mudline level inside the caisson cavity and its magnitude was set to overcome soil resistance no reference was made to the water depth pumping rate and the actual driving pressure although these parameters are always checked before considering the feasibility of a suction assisted installation the present paper proposes a full numerical framework where feasibility and safety of suction caisson installation are considered in a more effective way modelling the full caisson problem enables a more realistic simulation of the installation process by considering more realistic boundary conditions the present approach prioritizes pumping rate as the main parameter to control during the whole installation process the method of analysis presented in this paper is based on a numerical model that has been implemented in comsol multiphysics in this model water pumping out of the caisson cavity and caisson downward movement are described using brinkman equations with appropriate boundary conditions free deformed geometry combined to a remeshing procedure are used within a time stepping algorithm throughout a simulation of the whole installation process as caisson penetrates the seabed boundary conditions on the embedded caisson wall are propagated according to the penetration rate the present model does not consider any soil deformation around the caisson cavity however the proposed full numerical simulation of the suction assisted installation of the caisson foundation has not been addressed in the past the numerical study is validated based on the simulation of a field test reported in the literature houlsby and byrne 2005 model prediction of soil resistance to caisson penetration and critical piping are highlighted in conjunction with field data the validation procedure also addresses the feasibility of suction installation in sand by considering water depth and different pumping rates unlike numerous past studies critical soil conditions are directly linked to the pumping rate which is specified as the main design parameter for a safe installation and a reasonable installation time 2 caisson installation in homogeneous sand 2 1 caisson geometry the caisson shape under consideration in this study consists of a cylinder of wall thickness th inner radius r i and outer radius r o the caisson lid of thickness th is assumed to have enough stiffness to transmit the pressure differential to the caisson wall during the installation process once lowered to the seabed under self weight the caisson reaches a penetration depth h 0 this initial penetration depth is very important to the installation process as it provides a seal which is necessary for the suction to mobilize the required driving force as water is pumped out of the caisson cavity suction differential pushes the caisson into the seabed the initial seal is also important to enable the development of seepage around the caisson wall which reduces the resisting force and facilitates the downward caisson movement at a time t during the installation process caisson penetration is denoted as h fig 1 depicts caisson geometrical properties and shows the coordinate system used in the analysis for simplicity the installation is supposed to take place in homogeneous sand in this case soil permeability affects only the pumping rate in reality permeability may vary with depth harireche et al 2013 soil loosening inside caisson cavity may also cause a local increase in soil permeability making it deviate from its initial homogeneity whilst the present study assumes a homogeneous permeability it is not difficult to extend the present work to cases where the soil profile presents some kind of heterogeneity either natural or induced by the installation process 2 2 expression of the force f r resisting caisson penetration caisson penetration is resisted by friction which develops over the inner and outer surfaces of the caisson wall and by tip resistance produced by the seabed reaction at the caisson tip fig 2 the total resisting force f r can be resolved as 1 f r f s f t where f s and f t are the resultant forces of frictional and tip resistance respectively given by the following expressions 2 f s π k tan δ f r i r o γ h 2 2 f r i 0 h p i s d z 2 r o 0 h p o d z f t π r n q t h 2 γ h p i h p o h s π r n γ t h 2 γ more details on the derivation of these expressions are given in appendix a parameter k denotes the coefficient of soil lateral pressure f is a coefficient of soil loosening under upward seepage inside the caisson cavity f 1 and δ is the angle of friction at the contact interface between soil and caisson wall excess pore water pressure induced by suction on the inner and outer caisson walls is denoted as p i and p o respectively γ denotes the soil submerged weight parameters n q and nγ are bearing capacity factors at the caisson tip related to surcharge and soil self weight houlsby et al 2005 and p ih p oh denote excess pore pressure at caisson tip on the inner and outer wall respectively suction produced at mudline level inside the caisson cavity has a magnitude s note that soil loosening is introduced in the problem formulation through coefficient f in equation 2 such effect has been studied in detail by harireche et al 2014 in the present work this effect will not be considered in the numerical simulations for simplicity however the completeness of the theoretical framework presented here should facilitate potential extensions including soil loosening induced by suction 2 3 a validation field test houlsby and byrne reported experimental data obtained from field trials that took place at tenby field trial 1 and sandy haven field trial 2 on the south coast of wales houlsby and byrne 2005 in the present study we will use their field data from field trial 1 to validate the various aspects considered in the numerical simulations the seabed formation consists of dense sand with a saturated unit weight of 18 3 kn m3 an angle of shearing resistance of 40 and a factor k tan δ estimated at 0 48 houlsby and byrne 2005 the caisson prototype has a diameter of 2 m a height of 2 m and a wall thickness of 8 mm fig 3 shows the recorded installation suction as a function of depth it can be observed that once the installation depth reaches 1 4 m in this field trial there is a loss of suction and the installation fails to proceed further this is clearly an indication of critical development of piping channels this aspect will be investigated in sections 3 2 and 4 3 where critical piping is assessed using a criterion that can be visualized within the soil region in the inner side of the caisson wall 3 feasibility of suction assisted installation 3 1 available driving force at a given water depth the available driving force is the potential force that will be transmitted to the caisson lid as water is pumped out of the caisson cavity pumping develops a pressure differential which results into a downward force pushing the caisson into the seabed in the extreme case where soil resistance prevents a continuous movement the maximum downward force becomes available when a gap is created under the caisson lid and such a force governs the minimum water depth below which a suction assisted installation is not feasible at time t0 0 which corresponds to the self weight penetration h 0 the magnitude of such a force is denoted f d0 and is given by the expression 3 f d 0 π r 2 γ w d w h h 0 where d w is the water depth as shown in fig 1 and r the mean caisson radius this force must overcome the resisting force f r0 when pumping starts as f r0 balances the buoyant self weight v this results into the condition 4 f d 0 v which leads to the inequality 5 d w v π r 2 γ w h h 0 this inequality provides a condition on the minimum water depth below which suction assisted installation will not be possible the initial penetration depth h 0 can be obtained by writing the balance between the initial resisting force f r0 and the buoyant weight v which leads to the expression 6 h 0 n q t h n q t h 2 2 k tan δ n γ t h 2 v π r γ 2 k tan δ a detailed derivation of expression 6 is provided in appendix b the caisson submerged weight is given by see appendix b 7 v π r 2 t h 1 2 h r γ s t g s t 1 g s t v where g st denotes the specific gravity of steel defined by 8 g s t ρ s t ρ w and ρ s t denotes the mass density of steel note that the self weight v includes both caisson wall and caisson lid inequality 5 can be rewritten under the form 9 d w g s t 1 1 2 h r t h h h 0 as the installation proceeds the condition f d f r must be satisfied continuously at a generic penetration depth h such a condition reads 10 π r 2 γ w d w h h f r the quantity 11 s d γ w d w h h represents the available driving pressure at penetration depth h suction magnitude must be controlled throughout the installation process to prevent the development of critical a piping condition as will be examined in more details later this is achieved by setting an appropriate safety factor against critical piping the installation driving pressure s d must overcome the soil resistance at penetration depth h defined by 12 σ r f r π r 2 note that σ r includes both frictional resistance and tip resistance condition 10 can simply be rewritten as 13 s d σ r when installation takes place in homogeneous sand it is sufficient to ensure that the above condition is met at h h0 and h h which can be written as 14 γ w d w h h 0 σ r 0 15 γ w d w σ r h 3 2 critical suction for piping condition when caisson installation takes place in sand upward seepage inside the caisson cavity may cause a critical soil condition that might compromise soil stability known as piping the formation of piping channels may lead to a gradual damage of the seal around the caisson wall which may eventually cause a subsequent loss of suction and lead to installation failure piping condition first develops at the caisson tip and propagates upwards on the inner side of the caisson wall ibsen et al 2010 2011 alluqmani et al 2020 such a condition can be expressed by 16 p z γ as the pressure gradient has the highest positive value at the caisson tip on the inner side of the caisson wall this location is the most critical for piping to initiate piping is likely to occur only at the inner side of the caisson wall where the upward seepage develops a seepage force acting against gravity the region subject to piping inside the caisson cavity is defined by the condition 17 ξ 1 where 18 ξ r z 1 γ p z function ξ represents a useful criterion to investigate soil region within the inner side of the caisson wall that is prone to piping development 4 a full numerical model for caisson installation 4 1 modelling seepage coupled soil resistance to caisson penetration a full numerical model is adopted in the present study to analyze the installation procedure for a prescribed pumping rate as pointed out previously such a numerical approach has the advantage of controlling pumping rate instead of suction as the main design parameter for a safe installation in previous studies houlsby et al 2005 harireche et al 2013 2014 caisson installation has been analyzed in terms of a prescribed suction which was estimated based on the force required to overcome soil resistance in the present approach suction is estimated based on a safe pumping rate and not with respect to soil resistance pumping at a certain flow rate for a given water depth can only be possible if the magnitude of developed suction exceeds the minimum value defined by 11 hence as long as condition 10 is satisfied soil resistance should not affect the installation success suction magnitude in excess of the minimum value set by 11 determines the intensity of pumping rate and affects the installation time only however pumping rate must be applied within safe limits with respect to critical piping therefore pumping rate appears as the main parameter that should govern the installation design a proper design procedure must predict the appropriate pumping rate under safety constraints and the resulting installation time unlike previous numerical studies where suction was prescribed at the mudline within caisson cavity the current numerical model considers the full caisson geometry and hence the full installation problem this is necessary in order to control the prescribed pumping rate in a simulation where the caisson is pushed into the seabed starting from the penetration depth achieved under self weight the present model requires a numerical description of water flow out of caisson cavity and pore water seepage within the soil volume surrounding the embedded part of the caisson wall such a model is used to estimate soil resistance given the importance of seepage in the mitigation of lateral soil pressure and hence the reduction of mobilized friction on caisson wall the numerical procedure used to model water pumping out of caisson cavity is based on brinkman equations water seepage within the seabed region is governed by darcy s law a moving mesh is used to simulate caisson movement and this is achieved using comsol free deformation a condition assigned to the water volume inside the caisson cavity above the mudline fig 4 illustrates the numerical modelling adopted within each region of the problem geometry and the appropriate boundary conditions 4 2 governing equations in the initial configuration after caisson penetration under self weight pressure distribution within the soil mass and caisson cavity results from the initial hydrostatic condition upon development of pumping induced suction a negative excess pore pressure is generated within the caisson cavity and seabed region surrounding the caisson wall such a pressure is associated with the pore water seepage taking place throughout the installation process pressure distribution can only be determined by addressing the full numerical problem of pore water seepage within the soil mass coupled to free flow out of the caisson cavity under a prescribed pumping rate fig 4 within the soil mass pore water seepage is governed by darcy s law and obeys the following equations continuity equation 19 t ρ w φ ρ w u 0 where ρ w is the mass density of water φ denotes porosity and u is the darcy velocity field defined by u φ u ˆ where u ˆ denotes the intrinsic velocity in the axisymmetric condition of the present problem model the operator in equation 19 is defined by 20 f 1 r r f r r f z z where f is a vector valued function and f r f z its components in the cylindrical system of coordinates note that due to axisymmetric conditions the component fθ of function f is not involved in the definition 20 of the divergence operator 4 2 1 darcy s law according to darcy s law the velocity field within the soil mass is determined by the gradient of excess pore water pressure p water dynamic viscosity μ pa s and soil intrinsic permeability κ m2 as follows 21 u κ μ p ρ w g where g denotes the gravity vector 4 2 2 water flow within the caisson cavity brinkman equations brinkman equations are used to describe the water movement within caisson cavity under a prescribed pumping rate these equations can be viewed as an extension of darcy s law for describing fast moving fluids in porous media with a kinetic potential from fluid velocity pressure and gravity dissipation of kinetic energy takes place under viscous shear as with navier stokes equations porosity in brinkman s model can vary from small finite values for nearly impervious solids to unity for domains of free flow flow velocity is defined in a way that is consistent with the porous medium and is also referred to as darcy s velocity this definition enables the velocity field to be continuous at the interface between the soil below the mudline and the caisson cavity above the mudline in addition to the continuity equation 2 brinkman equations governing water flow within the caisson cavity above the mudline are presented under the form 22 ρ w φ u t u u φ p 1 φ μ u t u 2 3 μ u δ ρ w g in this equation u is darcy s velocity as defined in darcy s equation 21 and μ denotes the dynamic water viscosity pressure in excess of the hydrostatic value is denoted as p 4 2 3 boundary conditions in addition to the equations governing darcy s velocity field u and excess water pressure p appropriate boundary conditions must be specified fig 4 illustrates the prescribed boundary conditions on the mudline at the outer side of the caisson wall and on the lateral far boundaries excess pore pressure is zero p 0 on the bottom far boundary normal flow to the boundary is zero u n 0 where n is the outward unit normal vector to the boundary normal flow to the embedded part of the caisson wall is zero u n 0 far from the pumping area flow inside the caisson cavity is assumed to be laminar hence slip is allowed on the inner side of the caisson lid and on the inner wall this condition implicitly assumes that there are no viscous effects at the slip wall and hence no boundary layer develops the main effect of the wall is to prevent water from leaving and the condition reads u n 0 at the boundary m which coincides with the caisson lid the mesh is subjected to the prescribed downward velocity d h q o a p a i where q o is the net flow out of the pumping area a p π a 2 and a i π r i 2 is the inner area of the caisson lid this condition can be prescribed in comsol multiphysics within the free deformation option which must be assigned to the water volume inside the caisson cavity above the mudline remeshing is often necessary whenever the mesh reaches a certain degree of distortion and this option is also available within comsol capabilities the geometric surface σ moves with the same downward velocity dh as the mesh boundary m the surface σ is used to propagate the boundary condition preventing normal flow through the caisson wall as caisson moves downward 4 2 4 free and porous medium flow interface at the interface between caisson cavity above the mudline free flow domain and soil on the inner side of the caisson wall below the mudline porous domain the same velocity and pressure fields u and p are solved for using darcy and brinkman equations this imposes upon velocity u and pressure p to remain continuous across the interface between the free flow domain and the porous medium 4 3 preliminary numerical results the numerical procedure described in this section is now applied to the simulation of the suction assisted installation of the caisson prototype used in tenby field trials houlsby and byrne 2005 and described in section 2 3 equation 6 predicts an initial caisson penetration depth h 0 0 25 m the caisson is then pushed under a combination of the available pressure on the caisson lid and the pumping rate the simulation has been performed for three pumping rates namely a reference pumping rate of magnitude q 0 1 0 10 3 m 3 s and two pumping rates of magnitudes q 1 2 0 10 3 m 3 s and q 2 3 0 10 3 m 3 s water is pumped out at the center of the caisson lid through a pumping area a p of radius a 0 05 m fig 5 shows the magnitude of excess pore pressure distribution within soil and caisson cavity and the streamlines of water seepage for installation depths h 0 6 m 1 0 m 1 4 m and 1 8 m under flow rate q 0 1 0 10 3 m 3 s as expected pressure magnitude increases with an increasing penetration depth at a constant water pumping rate fig 6 shows the mesh configuration at different stages of the caisson installation propagation of the boundary condition on the embedded caisson wall is evident from pressure contours and streamlines in figs 5 and 6 both figures show that the extent of caisson movement that can be simulated covers the full installation depth fig 6 shows the remeshing capability available in comsol which enables the transient nature of the actual installation problem to be simulated the resulting full numerical model provides a realistic numerical tool for the investigation of the real installation problem excess pore pressure on each side of the caisson wall is shown in fig 7 for each prescribed pumping rate note that excess pore pressure induced by suction is always negative for each pumping rate the magnitude of excess pore pressure on the outer side of the caisson wall increases from zero at the mudline to a maximum value at the caisson tip on the inner side the magnitude of excess pore pressure keeps increasing to a maximum value at the mudline which corresponds to the usually prescribed suction however in the present model suction is not imposed but obtained as a result of the prescribed pumping rate 4 4 model validation suction assisted installation of the caisson prototype used in the field trial at tenby has been presented in section 4 1 the preliminary numerical results presented in that section show the capability of the proposed numerical model to enable a simulation of the actual installation process data recorded during the field trial consist of suction magnitude as a function of installation depth section 2 3 these data are also shown in fig 8 for comparison with the simulation results results have been produced for three pumping rates namely q 0 1 0 10 3 m3 s q 1 2 0 10 3 m3 s and q 2 3 0 10 3 m3 s for each of these pumping rates soil resistance and suction have been calculated and are presented in fig 8 as functions of installation depth given the importance of water depth for the feasibility of suction assisted installation the available driving pressure for a depth d w 3 m is also shown for reference purpose communication with the second author houlsby and byrne 2005 revealed that at that particular location the caisson was installed off the side of the quay wall but the water was extremely tidal at high tide when the caisson was installed a water depth about 2 m 3 m is plausible a water depth of 3 m is used for reference the field trials show that the applied suction is slightly lower than the soil resistance that develops under a piping rate of q 0 1 0 10 3 m 3 s but exceeds soil resistance for the pumping rates q 1 2 0 10 3 m3 s and q 2 3 0 10 3 m3 s hence it can be assumed that the actual pumping rate applied in the field trial exceeds the value q 0 1 0 10 3 m 3 s suctions that are associated with the three pumping rates used in the simulation are shown in fig 8 it is important to emphasize once more that increasing the pumping rate and hence suction magnitude will only affect installation time a higher pumping rate will obviously correspond to a reduced installation time however a limit to the pumping rate is set by the piping condition and a safe installation design should consider such a criterion feasibility of the installation is dictated by the water depth which determines the potential driving pressure as expressed in equation 11 for instance in the results shown in fig 8 a water depth of 3 m seems to enable an installation depth that in theory cannot exceed 1 2 m beyond that depth condition 13 cannot be satisfied however as the actual installation could proceed to a depth of 1 4 m it can be assumed that water depth was slightly larger than 3 m the fact that the installation stopped at depth 1 4 m with a loss of suction as shown in fig 8 has most probably been caused by the development of piping channels a similar problem has been reported in ibsen et al 2010 2011 indeed simulation results that are presented in section 4 3 show clearly that at depth 1 4 m a piping channel forms under flow rate q 3 0 10 3 m 3 s extending over the full installation depth in addition to the previous observations simulation results presented in fig 8 show that while suction increases with an increasing pumping rate soil resistance decreases as a result of an increasing pore pressure it is important to note that fig 8 shows suction magnitude in excess of the initial hydrostatic pressure which is simply referred to as suction 4 5 model prediction of critical suction for piping development as pointed out in section 3 2 piping develops at the inner side of the caisson wall initiating at the caisson tip and propagating upwards within the soil mass soil region where piping develops and evolves as installation proceeds can be tracked during the numerical simulation using a visualization of function ξ defined in section 3 2 contours of function ξ with a magnitude exceeding unity indicate the soil region on the inner side of the caisson wall where piping instability developed to some extent this procedure provides useful information on how to select a safe pumping rate for caisson installation figs 9 11 show the contours of function ξ for the field trial at tenby the single contour line corresponds to ξ 1 which materializes the limiting boundary to the safe region the simulation has been performed for three pumping rates namely a reference rate q 0 1 0 10 3 m 3 s and two pumping rates q 1 2 0 10 3 m 3 s and q 2 3 0 10 3 m 3 s results for a higher pumping rate q 3 5 0 10 3 m 3 s are presented at last to show how piping may reach critical extents that may compromise the installation process due to piping channels eventually developing on the inner side of the caisson wall breaking the soil impervious seal and leading to a loss of suction as can be seen from figs 9 11 under pumping rates q 0 1 0 10 3 m 3 s and q 1 2 0 10 3 m 3 s piping condition is localized at the caisson tip such a condition does not affect the installation safety as it does not cause any damage to the established seal at the soil wall interface however piping instability extends over a significant depth under pumping rate q 2 3 0 10 3 m 3 s and may cause a formation of piping channels as can be seen from fig 10 where installation depth reaches 1 4 m a depth that marked a loss of suction in the field trial at tenby houlsby and byrne 2005 a pumping rate q 3 5 0 10 3 m 3 s shows a large piping zone developing from the early installation stage 5 conclusion a full numerical model for suction assisted installation of caisson foundations has been proposed in the present paper the study has been motivated by the need for an installation procedure that integrates both feasibility and safety of the installation process whilst feasibility must consider water depth and the available driving pressure safety is related to piping condition that develops when installation takes place in sand the proposed numerical procedure enables a realistic simulation of caisson installation in sand under a prescribed pumping rate a full numerical model has been implemented in comsol multiphysics combining comsol capabilities such as free deformation and remeshing the model is based on the simulation of free water flow under pumping from the caisson cavity using brinkman equations coupled to porewater seepage around caisson wall described by darcy s model darcy s velocity field and excess pore pressure are subjected to continuity conditions at the interface between the two media where seepage and free flow take place and appropriate boundary conditions including a prescribed flow rate in the pumping area the numerical model has been validated using a simulation of real field data numerical predictions of developed suction and soil resistance have been presented for different prescribed pumping rates the role of water depth and the available driving pressure has been highlighted within the frame of the modeled field trial critical condition for piping was analyzed and its interpretation was consistent with the installation difficulties encountered during the field trial it is beyond the scope of the present work to account for soil deformation however it is believed that the current model paves the way for such future investigation finally although the simulations presented in this paper show clearly how piping evolves within the soil region subjected to upward seepage it is necessary to develop a criterion based on the extent of soil volume affected by piping in order to set a clear limit to the safe pumping rate credit authorship

penetration let us consider the caisson at a generic penetration depth h total pore pressure p i z produced at depth z on the inner side of caisson wall is given by a1 p i z γ w d w z 0 z g i ζ d ζ the excess pore pressure p i z can be expressed in terms of the z component g i p i z of the hydraulic gradient as follows a2 p i z s 0 z g i ζ d ζ at mudline level p i 0 is written as s where s is the suction magnitude note that as p i z 0 s 0 z g i ζ d ζ a3 at the same depth z the soil total vertical stress is given by a4 σ v i z γ w d w γ s a t z soil vertical effective stress is then obtained as the difference σ v i z p i z and is given by a5 σ v i z γ z 0 z g i ζ d ζ γ z p i z s on the inner side of the caisson wall the hydraulic gradient is positive and the effective stress drops by the quantity 0 z g i ζ d ζ compared to its magnitude γ z that prevails in hydrostatic condition this reduction in effective stress is produced by the counter gravity upward seepage induced by suction such a phenomenon may reach a critical condition under sufficiently strong suction leading to zero effective stress which is referred to as piping and which must be controlled during the whole installation process in order to achieve a thorough safe installation on the outer side of the caisson wall where excess pressure at mudline level is zero i e p o 0 0 the excess pore pressure at a generic depth z p o z is given by a6 p o z 0 z g o ζ d ζ the effective stress at generic depth z is obtained through the same procedure as above and can be written as a7 σ v o z γ z 0 z g o ζ d ζ where g o ζ denotes the hydraulic gradient on the outer side of caisson wall note that g o ζ is negative through the penetration depth so that the effective stress increases on the outer side of caisson wall by the quantity 0 z g o ζ d ζ compared to its magnitude in hydrostatic condition such an increase in the magnitude of the effective vertical stress on the outer side of caisson wall is produced by the downward suction induced seepage obviously effective stress at the same generic depth z in hydrostatic condition on either side of the caisson wall has same magnitude so that the net reduction in such a stress produced by suction induced seepage is a8 δ σ v 0 z g i ζ d ζ 0 z g o ζ d ζ this last expression highlights the benefits of suction induced seepage on caisson installation in sand as otherwise a higher vertical effective stress reflects into a higher frictional resistance to caisson penetration due to a larger lateral soil pressure on the caisson wall and hence a larger mobilized friction mobilized friction stresses τ i z and τ o z that develop on the inner and outer sides of the caisson wall respectively are given by a9 τ i z k tan δ σ v i z and τ o z k tan δ σ v o z in order to account for soil loosening on the inner side of the caisson wall coefficient k is replaced by f k where f 1 the resulting lateral frictional force f s is given by a10 f s 0 h 2 π r τ i z τ o z d z taking into account eq a5 a10 we obtain a11 f s π k tan δ f r i r o γ h 2 2 f r i 0 h p i s d z 2 r o 0 h p o d z at the caisson tip soil resistance has been suggested in a form inspired from bearing capacity theory houlsby et al 2005 and proposed under the expression a12 f t 2 π r n q r i r o σ t d r 2 π r t h 1 2 γ t h n γ where n q and nγ are bearing capacity factors and σ t denotes the vertical effective stress at the caisson tip defined as a13 σ t 1 2 σ v i h σ v o h γ h 1 2 s p i h p o h where p ih and p oh are pressure values at caisson tip on the inner and outer sides of the caisson wall respectively using equation a12 and a13 the expression of the resisting force at the caisson tip reads a14 f t π r n q t h 2 γ h p i h p o h s π r n γ t h 2 γ appendix b expression of the initial self weight penetration h 0 the initial penetration depth h 0 results from a balance between the initial resisting force f r0 and the caisson buoyant weight v the resisting force f r0 is given by b1 f r 0 f s 0 f t 0 and the initial force balance reads b2 f r 0 f s 0 f t 0 v where f s 0 and f t 0 are the contributions from frictional and tip resistances mobilized at self weight penetration these two forces are given by eq a11 and a14 where both suction magnitude s and pore pressures p i and p o are set to zero parameter f of soil loosening is set to one as no such effect occurs at this stage of the installation the resulting expressions are b3 f s 0 2 π k tan δ r γ h 0 2 b4 f t 0 2 π r n q t h γ h 0 π r n γ t h 2 γ after substitution of eqs b3 and b4 into eq b2 we obtain the following expression of self weight penetration depth h 0 b5 h 0 n q t h n q t h 2 2 k tan δ n γ t h 2 v π r γ 2 k tan δ the caisson buoyant weight v is given by b6 v γ s t v c where γ s t is the steel submerged weight and v c is the solid caisson volume given by b7 v c π r 0 2 h π r i 2 h t h this last expression can be rewritten under the form b8 v c 2 π r h t h π r 2 t h 1 t h 2 r 2 neglecting the term t h 2 r compared to unity in b8 we can write b9 v c π r 2 t h 1 2 h r an expression for caisson submerged weight now reads b10 v π r 2 t h 1 2 h r γ s t g s t 1 g s t v where g st denotes the specific gravity of steel defined by b11 g s t ρ s t ρ w and ρ s t denotes the mass density of steel note that the self weight v includes both caisson wall and caisson lid

hierarchy process criteria weighting technique main components critical systems failure modes and failure causes are analysed fifteen failure scenarios are identified and corresponding preventive and corrective actions are suggested to cut off paths of failure propagations and to reduce the failure impacts this method allows to minimize the catastrophic failures on floating offshore wind turbines moreover a comparison study is conducted to remove the uncertainty when implementing the presented method which validates the proposed methodology s creativeness and feasibility keywords analytical hierarchy process failure analysis floating offshore wind turbine failure mode and effect analysis risk analysis 1 introduction floating offshore wind technology has experienced extensive and worldwide growth during the past several years due to the surge of renewable energy demand turner 1999 dincer 2000 díaz and guedes soares 2020b the floating wind represents the next step of the offshore wind market this new concept permits accessing depths of seas up to 1000 meters where the wind resource is typically higher colmenar santos et al 2016 musial et al 2016 salvacao and guedes soares 2018 alongside the wind potential access to infeasible locations so far may provide increased opportunity for spatial diversification moore et al 2018 díaz and guedes soares 2020a floating wind turbines could lead to lower wind energy costs due to the benefits already mentioned but are currently slightly more expensive than fixed structures athanasia and genachte 2013 castro santos et al 2016 uzunoglu and guedes soares 2020 due to these new concepts immaturity energy planners and stakeholders decisions are highly dependents on costs and vulnerabilities leimeister and kolios 2018 castro santos et al 2020 the floating technology requires frequent maintenance and such a procedure s difficulty involves a considerable amount of associated costs sinha and steel 2015 li et al 2020b due to the distance to shore and high repair consuming time all capital and operating costs are assumed to escalate kang et al 2017 bento and fontes 2019 li and guedes soares 2019 li et al 2020b through risk assessment effective maintenance can be guaranteed which are predictions of weak links in the system in the early design stage sinha and steel 2015 kang et al 2019a scheu et al 2019 wu et al 2019 li et al 2020b 2021 floating offshore wind power generation has apparent advantages over fixed bottom foundation structures nevertheless there exists the possibility to appear a large volume of damages of blades gearboxes mooring systems and other parts of floating wind turbines as their operation time increases due to the severe working conditions at sea santos et al 2015 kang et al 2019b gwec 2020 the failure rate and economic losses can be effectively reduced through fault detection and risk or failure analysis of floating wind turbine systems therefore to analyse the failure modes and their effects the method of failure mode and effect analysis fmea is taken to conduct failure assessment in this paper the main objective of fmea is to identify the deficiencies at the product design stage and based on that analyse failures of each element and their impact on each system or even at a holistic level spreafico et al 2017 liu et al 2019 li et al 2020a fmea incorporates subjective assets like severity occurrence and detection to assess a subjective and dimensionless index namely risk priority number rpn which is a representation of each potential failure stamatis 2003 however limitations of fmea have been criticized stamatis 2003 xiao et al 2011 dinmohammadi and shafiee 2013 shafiee and dinmohammadi 2015 sinha and steel 2015 du et al 2017 tazi et al 2017 cevasco et al 2018 scheu et al 2019 li et al 2020b 2021 i three risk factors severity occurrence and detection are not differentiated in the rpn due to the relative importance of them considered equal ii various combinations of risk factors may result in the same rpn value hindering risk level determination iii discrete and fixed risk factor levels generate rpns most likely at the bottom of the scale and several specific values resulting in uneven rpn distributions therefore conventional fmea may not be adequate to determine the risk level of failures by improving the traditional method of fmea so that it can be free from the practical restrictions already mentioned above and adequate to failure analysis of floating offshore wind turbines a weighted fmea technique is proposed in this paper the novel contributions of this study as follows 1 to apply the analytic hierarchy process ahp methodology to extract weights of risk factors of fmea 2 to present a normalization algorithm to convert the risk factors values into a comparable scale as their weights to avoid results bias 3 to propose an ahp fmea technique to complete a convincing and close to practice failure analysis of floating offshore wind turbines which are relatively new and very few be investigated this paper is organized as follows the state of the art is provided in section 2 the methodologies presented are illustrated in section 3 modules classification of the floating offshore wind turbine and data collection is demonstrated in section 4 the results and recommendations are in section 5 comparisons and discussions are conducted in section 6 conclusions are drawn at the end in section 7 2 state of the art the efforts on conducting failure analysis of wind turbines onshore and offshore fixed bottom and floating structures using fmea or its upgraded version failure mode effects and criticality analysis fmeca are implemented into two aspects analyse actual wind turbines by using conventional methods and develop new models to release practical limitations as for analysing actual wind turbines by using conventional fmeas fmecas analyses aim to drive more comprehensive and instructive results by an elaborate system grading and exhaustive failure collection in operating wind turbines and then to suggest recommendations to optimal design and update preventive activities of daily operations for instance arabian hoseynabadi et al 2010 decomposed a 2 mw indirect drive and variable speed wind turbine into 11 components they collected 16 failure modes with 27 root causes to drive a failure analysis by applying the fmea method the study identified the wind turbine s decisive failure modes materials failure fracture rupture and electrical device failures bharatbha 2015 analysed 16 components of a 5 mw wind turbine with 33 failure modes by the fmea method the analysis applied probability ranking and consequence ranking to generate the criticality index of each failure mode identified that gear teeth slip blades and distorting the shape of the shaft main shaft are the most critical failures sinha and steel 2015 analysed 36 failure modes of a gearbox of offshore wind turbines by fmea technique accordingly ascertained the dangerous failures by the developed fmea software the study was proved to be more close to practice and tends to improve the accuracy of rpn numbers dinmohammadi and shafiee 2013 broke offshore wind turbines down to 16 assemblies for conducting the fmea schedule the analysis identified that the tower has the highest priority for failure prevention of offshore wind turbines to reach more comprehensive and constructive results of failure analysis for offshore wind turbines scheu et al 2019 collected 337 failure modes and employed more than 40 specialists to drive the fmea process the analysis outcomes provide fundamental guidance for condition based maintenance implementation and benefit optimal operating and maintenance o m strategy planning on the other hand new fmea models have been created to release practical limitations especially neglecting risk factors weights when applied to the offshore wind energy sector xiao et al 2011 put forward that severity occurrence and detection should be graded by weights according to maintenance features accordingly li et al 2021 considered the relative importance of severity occurrence and detection of fmea to identify risky failures of floating offshore wind turbines as a result of this a weighted fmea was developed and implemented to identify critical failure items of floating offshore wind turbine support structures rather than implementing the weighted fmea method at the system level dinmohammadi and shafiee 2013 finalized a risk analysis of a holistic wind turbine using the method mentioned above however the mentioned studies assign directly subjective weights of risk factors of fmeas and such a rough modelling manner makes the failure analysis results discussable recently ascertaining mentioned weights by analytic hierarchy process ahp method tends to be a hot topic for today s research in the risk analysis sector the ahp structure contains multiple layers and weights designed to connect a specific layer and the upper one on this basis the information propagation among the ahp structure includes information transformation in the same layer and between layers computationally say comparison calculation in layer and weighting calculation between layers stamatis 2003 huang et al 2020 the ahp method extracts information from the given data by computing relative differences of factors and then transfers the comparison results to the upper layers by using a weighting algorithm the ahp is structurally flexible and conforms to the weight acquire demand of fmeas accordingly hu et al 2009 evaluated green components failures by the weighted fmea in which ahp methodology has been applied to infer the weights of risk factors the results recommended a more feasible quality checking procedure wang et al 2020 assigned weights of severity occurrence and detection by the ahp methodology and prioritized 21 failure modes of structure propulsion electrical and auxiliary systems of an ocean fishing vessel the study suggested that the hydraulic failure of the auxiliary system is the most severe failure of the ocean fishing vessel to overcome the situation that various combinations of risk factors could obtain the same rpn hiding failure properties of systems fattahi and khalilzadeh 2018 put forward a hybrid method based on fmea and ahp methods to prioritize eight accidents as substitutions of failure modes of the kerman steel industries factory in iran two dangerous accidents plates and rollers falling on the feet were found to be critical than others carpitella et al 2018 proposed a developed fmeca model to prioritize 42 failure modes of a cleaning vehicle and the ahp technique had been implemented to infer weights of risk factors this study ascertained 12 critical failure modes and accordingly optimized the maintenance activities of the vehicle however the mentioned studies neglected the individuality of failures knowing that they assign the same weights of risk factors to all failures for floating offshore wind turbines failure mechanisms are different from failures to failures for instance failures of support structures are significantly different from gearboxes as the former mainly resulted from harsh sea conditions still gearboxes failures are mostly the consequences of degradations of gears and bearings to design weights of risk factors to each component or failure mode or failure cause considering related failure properties is still an open problem of the risk analysis domain and the floating offshore wind turbine sector 3 methodology the ahp fmea technique is constructed in this section aiming at addressing shortcomings of the conventional fmea method that is already mentioned in section 1 the presented ahp fmea technique is a combination of a proposed normalization algorithm and the ahp methodology which allows one to generate risk index rpn of a failure by two data sets relative importance of severity occurrence and detection by the proposed normalization algorithm as well as their weights by the ahp methodology the procedure of driving the proposed ahp fmea methodology is demonstrated as follows also as shown in fig 1 1 system identification determine the floating offshore wind turbine that to be analysed 2 system decomposition break the floating offshore wind turbine down to components and record the hierarchical structure 3 failures collection identify failure modes of each component and analyse their root causes record the hierarchical relationship between components and failure modes until to root causes obtain values of risk factors severity occurrence and detection of failure causes from specialists 4 relative importance computation calculate the relative importance of each failure cause by the proposed normalized algorithm see section 3 1 5 weights calculation collect pairwise indices severity over occurrence severity over detection and occurrence over detection from specialists and infer weights of risk factors of each failure item by ahp technique see section 3 2 6 rpns computation calculate rpns of failure causes use eq 10 failure modes use eq 11 and components use eq 12 of the floating offshore wind turbine 7 recommendations identify weak links of the floating offshore wind turbine and suggest corrective actions and preventive o m measures to avoid their occurrence overall several concerns should be highlighted for a better understanding of the proposed ahp fmea methodology the method employs both risk factors and weights indicating that it requires more extensive data collection than conventional methods the scales of risk factors values are normalized to be the same as that of weights to avoid that either indices or their weights affect significantly the rpn generation than another the weights of risk factors are changeable for different failure items as a consequence of extensive data collection detailed modelling and much more complicated computations the ahp fmea methodology is applicable for other risk failure analysis cases if the pairwise evidence between risk factors are available 3 1 normalization algorithm denote β s i β o i and β d i the average values of severity occurrence and detection of failure cause i which can be arranged by 1 β s 1 β o 1 β d 1 β s 2 β o 2 β d 2 β s i β s n β o i β o n β d i β d n denote 2 ξ k i j β k i β k j where k reflects risk factors including severity occurrence and detection accordingly the comparison matrix ξ k i j of risk factors is represented as 3 ξ k i j ξ s 11 ξ s 12 ξ s 1 n ξ o 11 ξ o 12 ξ o 1 n ξ d 11 ξ d 22 ξ d 1 n the normalized vector φ k i j is defined as 4 φ k ϕ s ϕ o ϕ k where 5 ϕ k j ξ k i j i j ξ k i j it is obvious that ϕ k i j 0 1 and k s o d ϕ k 1 3 2 ahp based weights computation the importance matrix of risk factors of failure mode i is constructed as 6 a i α s s i α s o i α s d i α o s i α o o i α o d i α d s i α d o i α d d i 1 α s o i α s d i 1 α s o i 1 α o d i 1 α s d i 1 α o d i 1 α s 1 α s 2 α s 3 α o 1 α o 2 α o 3 α d 1 α d 2 α d 3 where α s o i α s d i and α o d i are pairwise weights of severity over occurrence severity over detection and occurrence over detection of failure mode i respectively define a matrix δ as 7 δ k j δ s 1 δ s 2 δ s 3 δ o 1 δ o 2 δ o 3 δ d 1 δ d 2 δ d 3 where 8 δ k j α k j k s o d α k j accordingly the weights of indices are calculated by 9 ω j j 1 3 δ s j 3 j 1 3 δ o j 3 j 1 3 δ d j 3 t hence the rpn of failure cause i r p n f c i j w is computed as 10 r p n f c i j w f φ k i j ω j φ k i j ω j where φ k i j denotes the relative importance of failure cause i of jth failure mode ω j reflects weights of failure mode j hence the rpn of failure mode j which contains m failure causes can be calculated as 11 r p n f m i w i 1 m r p n f c i j w subsequently the rpn of component h r p n c o m p h w can be computed as 12 r p n c o m p h w j 1 p r p n f m i j w 4 modules classification of the floating offshore wind turbine and data collection 4 1 modules classification the offshore floating wind turbine comprises various modules independent or auxiliary to each other the floating offshore wind turbine system is functionally divided into four parts wind turbine tower and transition piece floating foundation and mooring system see fig 2 the main components of floating offshore wind turbines are listed in table 1 wind turbine the wind turbine is mainly composed of a rotor system nacelle and yaw system among which the internal components of nacelle are crucial and complicated the blades pitching control system nacelle and gear s failure rates are the three highest other wind turbine failures can be described as rotor system failure bearing or shaft failure gearbox failure braking system failure generator failure sensor failure yawing failure drivetrain control system failure hydraulics failure structural failure and electrical failure tower and transition piece the tower is used to support the wind turbine components the transition piece performs the function of maintaining an accurate position of the tower the supporting role tower and transition piece are also expected to resist force and moment produced by the variable wind wave and current loads lee et al 2016 the failures of support structures occur mainly at the flange bolt and weld area caused by fatigue loads meanwhile failure modes like hit by blades strong wind or wave lightning strike ice storm storm and material fatigue also exist under the effect of extreme loads severe consequences such as tower collapses will result in the wind turbine s sinking and severe losses chou and tu 2011 floating foundation the main types of floating offshore wind turbines under development are the semi submersible spar and tension leg platform tlp uzunoglu et al 2016 the main floating foundation failures are pillar damage corrosion of pipe joint weld effect of the pipe joint fatigue joints insufficient detection typhoon not exist for all seas a crash of planes biological collision and capsize mooring system the mooring systems for floating offshore wind turbines have benefited from the offshore oil and gas experience arapogianni et al 2013 the main mooring configurations are the catenary system and the taut leg system xu et al 2019 the mooring system failures result in the unbalance of upper structures the possible failures are the sea s limited state corrosion off air lead fatigue off air lead mooring lines brake unsatisfied sea state for operation insufficient emergency measures for abrupt scenes and analysis and calculation fault when the mooring module fails the system will be at risk 4 2 data collection five specialists with diverse backgrounds and with an overall 28 years experience in floating offshore wind turbines or offshore wind farms were employed see table 2 overall 42 failure modes with 104 failure causes were identified by the specialists it should be noted that the failure modes and causes identified partly reviewed from publications and the remains either have been observed in the operating offshore wind farms or ascertained by specialists under the assumption of those failures are potentially occurred according to their experience and knowledge failure items of the floating offshore wind turbine are listed in appendix a the standardization and consistency of specialists evaluations are guaranteed by unified rating guidance see table 3 moreover the normalized values of risk factors and computed weights are listed in appendix b besides pairwise comparisons of risk factors representing the relative importance among risk factors are performed using saaty s method that is designed to evaluate the degree to which a factor is important than comparing one see table 4 5 results and recommendations 5 1 systems and components finding out critical systems and components of floating offshore wind turbines initiates the understanding of failure natures and benefit for arranging o m activities e g failure warning and diagnosis elements backup and transportation inspections and preventive maintenance scheduling the criticality rank of the floating offshore wind turbine systems is demonstrated in fig 3 a the wind turbine is recognized to be the most critical system of the floating offshore wind turbine with an rpn of 0 44 followed by the mooring system 0 18 the floating foundation 0 17 as well as the tower and transition piece system 0 16 fig 3 also concluded that the wind turbine is critical as they are structurally complicated and contains more failure items mooring systems tend to be more vulnerable in dealing with complex and harsh sea conditions than floating foundations the tower and transition piece system is the most reliable system that likely free from the failures due mainly to its simple structure and limited functions overall 18 components of the floating offshore wind turbine were analysed mooring lines jointed with fairleads and anchors to locate floating platforms at a selected sea space are recognized as weak links of the floating offshore wind turbine as which hold the highest rpns see fig 3 c according to fig 3 b and c the impacts of fairlead and anchor malfunctions on the holistic floating offshore wind turbine are minor the tower is riskier than transition pieces in general the tower s failures are unlikely to be detected giving rise to disasters to floating offshore wind turbines failures of towers will directly result in upper wind turbines shaking reduce energy generation efficiency or sink into the water fortunately the likelihoods of tower failures are relatively low as displayed in appendix b such an idea is also supported by specialists who distributed the highest weight of severity to the tower 73 still the weights of occurrence 18 and detection 9 are the lowest see fig 3 b for the components within the nacelle the generator rpn 0 099 and gearbox rpn 0 098 are remarkably critical than other devices rpns 0 04 the results are also obtained from du et al 2017 bhardwaj et al 2019 scheu et al 2019 and li et al 2020b the gearbox and generator are structurally complex with a selection of elements and accomplishing pivotal and primary functions the failure consequences of both components are severe and impact the electricity generation of floating offshore wind turbines immediately the aforementioned results are in line with the practice that engineers had followed in gearboxes and generators by implementing sensors to monitoring their health conditions as a basis of that warning and predict their malfunctions ahead of unwanted events happen as typical electromechanical equipment generators fail more frequently than mechanical devices installed within nacelles such as gearboxes these results can explain that specialists assigned a higher weight to generators occurrence as in fig 3 b 5 2 failure modes failure modes are representations of floating offshore wind turbines working in unexpected states in this study 42 failure modes are analysed see fig 4 a total of 15 failure modes are recognized to be critical as their rpns exceed the average value 0 024 that is bearing deformation generator overheat winding failure of the generator gearbox overheat open circuit of converter and transformer tower collapse tower crack transition piece crack floating foundation hitting watertight and additional structures failure of floating foundations abnormal and broken mooring lines as well as abnormal functions of mooring lines the generator and gearbox are the weak links of the floating offshore wind turbine see section 5 1 to be specific bearing deformation with the rpn of 0 0362 and rpn share of 3 6 overheat 0 03 3 and winding failure 0 0335 3 4 are risky failure modes of the generator overheat 0 0268 2 87 is the most critical failure mode of the gearbox differently relatively high failure frequency and remarkable weight of detection are distinguished properties of the gearbox failures indicating the gearbox failures are frequent while hard to be detected and predicted the transformer failures are severe as they directly affect the electricity yield of the floating offshore wind turbine failures of tower and transition pieces are few but risky tower collapse is critical as such a failure is unlikely to be detected in advance of its occurrence moreover the transition piece is an essential component and the primary failure of which is crack devices failures such as watertight vent pump sensor and manhole are important among other components of floating foundations these failures are common but hard to be detected note that high failure frequencies are the unique nature of the floating foundations mooring lines failures including abnormal and broken mooring lines call for engineers particular attention especially designers broken mooring lines occupying the top place of all failure modes by contributing 10 rpn to the total abnormal mooring lines initiate broken mooring lines make 5 rpn of the holistic equipment which can be an indicator to predict and avoid disasters mooring lines failures 5 3 failure causes failure causes are the root reasons for failures which randomly give rise to failure modes of floating offshore wind turbines and cannot be eliminated and mostly cannot be observed visually such as material deterioration and human errors aggregately 104 failure causes were identified and rpns of which were computed by the ahp fmea see fig 5 and appendix b the mean and median of failure causes rpn are 0 0097 and 0 0096 respectively the critical failure causes wear fatigue lubrication fails corrosion environmental factors and human errors see fig 6 from the single failure cause point of view destructive environmental conditions are top failure factors e g lightning strikes and ice storms that introduce fragility to towers and strong wind wave bring about the additional risk of failures to both towers and floating foundations the results are supported by kang et al 2017 and kang et al 2019b in which harsh sea conditions were ascertained to be risk factors to floating offshore wind turbines from risk assessment and reliability analysis failure probability perspectives the results also explain the leading differential of failure features between floating offshore wind turbines and fixed bottom structures or between onshore wind turbines and offshore ones according to results floating foundations and towers are influenced significantly by harsh environmental situations as such components are huge and exposed to adverse weather conditions in contrast smaller size components installed within nacelles are likely free from sea conditions decisive impacts besides material related factors like fatigue wear and corrosion are also critical failure causes the aforementioned results are confirmed by arabian hoseynabadi et al 2010 kahrobaee and asgarpoor 2011 bharatbhai 2015 sinha and steel 2015 kang et al 2017 li and guedes soares 2019 scheu et al 2019 and li et al 2020b which determined that materials and structural degradation are dangerous factors to failures of floating offshore wind turbines unlike harsh sea conditions that make failures of floating offshore wind turbines different from onshore and fixed bottom structures the results also display that material related factors may promote failures of several types of wind turbines in a similar way 5 4 recommendations failure behaviour is a path of the initiation propagation and occurrence of a failure to be specific failure behaviour is the series form that a failure cause gives rise to a failure mode s of a component s and subsequently results in failure of a system s until the malfunction of floating offshore wind turbines it accomplishes the following failure chain failure cause failure mode of component system failure malfunction of floating offshore wind turbines failure analysis is to recommend preventive and corrective actions to cut off the failure propagation chain already mentioned or avoid at least release or decrease probabilities the occurrence of critical failure causes according to sections 5 1 to 5 3 15 essential behaviours of failure were identified as displayed in fig 7 to this end 15 recommendations both preventive and corrective are suggested as follows wind turbines i strengthen surfaces of bearing tracks inner ring outer ring and rolling elements of bearings and improve electric corrosion preventions of generators ii upgrade or backup cooling systems to enhance the heat dissipation of generators and converters iii anti corrosion treatments of windings iv introduce wear and fatigue preventive actions to gears in gearboxes v guarantee high quality lubrications by better design of the hydraulic systems and implement additional leak proof measures vi monitor performance of transforms backup additional devices and open circuit function design to avoid overvoltage tower and transition pieces i design and implement reliable and less vulnerable lightning prevention systems ii reinforce tower and transition piece welding quality iii consider the impacts of strong wind waves in the full life cycle of floating offshore wind turbines floating foundations i additional design to release the impacts of strong wind waves ii enhance pipe joints design and welding quality of floating foundations to avoid watertight fault iii periodical inspections to bilge piping and pumps mooring systems i enhance the strength of mooring lines buoys friction chain and transitional chain to eliminate abnormal stress and release unexpected wear ii pay attention to the quality and states of the anchor pickup device and mooring winch iii improve the training to operators and maintenance members to avoid human failures note that common cause failures are identified according to the failure behaviours ascertained which makes failures of those components correlated and will introduce additional failure probability to the correlated components and ultimately decrease the reliability of floating offshore wind turbines however correlated failures will not be discussed in this paper as they are under reliability estimation not the topic of this paper that is failure analysis 6 discussion on expert opinions 6 1 comparison between experts about risk priority number table 5 gives the rpn values obtained from the proposed ahp fmea module section 3 for the fifteen sub assemblies of floating wind turbine systems considered in this study transition piece main bearing tower and mooring system account for almost two fifths of all critical failure modes identified during this paper this value is unprecedented in the context of the literature available in this subject area moreover these categories contribute more than 10 of the critical failure modes whereas the contribution is rather significant from the expert s background of floating offshore wind turbines experts 1 and 2 deal with systems design they considered higher risk of the transition piece blades hub main bearing main shaft and generator experts 3 and 4 focus on quality and research deal with offshore identified tower pitch system main bearing main shaft and hub as risky components in this study nevertheless expert 5 focus on floating structures identified with higher rpn the transition piece mooring system and floating foundation therefore it can be concluded that the background and work experience in an area is key for an fmea analysis the different experts backgrounds cover the systems involved in a floating wind turbine guarantee equity in the results 6 2 experts consensus the proposed ahp fmea methodology implemented and the diversity of experts involved generated a general result from the different opinions aggregation it is necessary to measure the severity occurrence and detection consensus for the aggregated group result table 6 shannon entropy and the three independent components alpha beta and gamma to derive the consensus indicator were used the priority distribution of indices of severity occurrence and detection among different experts was analysed using refs relations goepel 2013 and grošelj et al 2015 the consensus is calculated as the weighted arithmetic mean of all hierarchy nodes categories the consensus indicator of the consolidated alternative evaluation matrix weighted with the global priorities for alternatives was used the consensus indicator ranges from 0 no consensus to 100 full consensus the results are shown in table 7 a particular observation is made for the consensus of results with less than 36 the percentage of agreement between the different experts is low this low consensus is expected due to the various stakeholders different expertise regarding the 15 components analysed the conclusions also indicate the background and knowledge of the employed specialists are diverse which helps prevent bias results and validated that specialists selection is reasonably feasible 6 3 comparison between experts about components criticality the criticality number is one of the most important outcomes of an fmea application criticality number is very similar to rpn a traditional fmea metric the difference is that criticality only includes severity and occurrence the criticality value for the floating wind turbine components is estimated in table 8 table 8 shows that the transition piece s criticality index main bearing main shaft and hub is significantly higher in floating wind turbine components moreover other components as the tower and mooring system carry a high criticality factor the main bearing main shaft and hub are the most critical components in floating wind turbines for experts 2 3 and 4 while components as transition pieces and mooring systems are the critical ones for experts 1 and 5 on the other hand converter controller and electrical facilities show the lowest criticality values the dominant failure cause for floating turbine design are the tower main shaft main bearing and hub 6 4 comparison of the ahp fmea and the conventional method in this section a quantitative comparison is made between the ranking orders of the traditional fmea and the proposed ahp fmea in table 9 the results obtained for floating offshore wind turbines from the traditional fmea using the rpn method are compared with the results obtained from the proposed ahp fmea using the normalization method section 3 and rpn method as can be seen the main problem in the traditional fmea methodology is that it puts two critical assemblies the yaw system and the converter as having the same priority in shafiee and dinmohammadi 2015 a useful outcome of the proposed methodology could compare the ranking orders obtained from both methods from table 9 it is observed that both approaches lead to different ranking orders for seven individual assemblies i e generator gearbox and tower nevertheless there is a noticeable similitude between the results obtained using two approaches for some major components the hub controller and electrical facilities main shaft pitch system transition piece mooring system and the floating foundation occupy the same position in both rankings besides as the assemblies failure rates in both ranks are almost equal they are prioritized from the rpn perspective for a better understanding of the proposed ahp fmea methodology the following aspects should be highlighted to remove the confusing situation that has long been existing in the failure analysis of the floating offshore wind energy sector which are 1 this study makes it clear to practitioners how to distribute weights to indices of fmeas one conviction of practitioners of failure analysis is that weights of indices of fmeas have to be considered for a convincing failure analysis result however such parameters were distributed personally without clear evidence for instance dinmohammadi and shafiee 2013 consider the weights of severity occurrence and detection to be 0 21 0 26 and 0 53 respectively considering if failure can be detected in advance the frequency and consequence of which would be no longer important it can be compared with the idea of li et al 2021 that give the weights mentioned above by 0 4 0 35 and 0 25 respectively assuming that potential failure of a system is an intrinsic and natural characteristic detection measures cannot reduce physical risks it is evident that the two assumptions have inherent differences and reveal no substantial evidence to support consensus in the field luckily this study unprecedentedly provides such evidence by comprehensively collect judgments from field engineers 2 instead of applying absolute values of severity occurrence and detection as been done by other published studies this paper converts such parameters into a comparable scale of their weight to avoid biased outcomes derived from the situation that a group of parameters would impact more on the results than others 3 this study contributes to the failure analysis of engineering cases in practice and the development of fmea methodology as well as its extended versions in academia accordingly the method applies to all failure analysis scenarios and is not limited to floating offshore wind turbines or the wind energy sector 7 conclusions this paper proposes an ahp fmea methodology to complete a comprehensive failure analysis of floating offshore wind turbines the presented method infers the importance of severity occurrence and detection of the floating offshore wind turbine s failures by the ahp technique and accordingly weights of such risk factors can be extracted to drive the implementation of the proposed ahp fmea methodology the wind turbine with an rpn of 0 44 is the most critical system of the floating offshore wind turbine followed by the mooring system 0 18 floating foundation 0 17 as well as tower and transition pieces 0 16 subsequently broken mooring lines and the other 14 failure modes are identified to be risky failures this study subsequently distinguished the critical failure causes including wear fatigue lubrication fails corrosion environmental factors human errors and so on and accordingly 15 preventive and corrective activities such as enhance the strength of mooring lines are suggested to prevent the floating offshore wind turbine from catastrophic failures moreover a comparison study is conducted to clear some aspects when implementing the presented method the comparison results indicate that the rpn derived by different specialists is discrepant meaning that fmeas are subjective methods and personal judgments impact results the selection of specialists is plausible as their backgrounds are diverse the correctness of the ahp fmea results is confirmed by the results of

20607,an ahp fmea methodology is proposed to analyse the floating offshore wind turbines failure causes the method introduces the expert opinions to generate a risk index through the analytical hierarchy process criteria weighting technique main components critical systems failure modes and failure causes are analysed fifteen failure scenarios are identified and corresponding preventive and corrective actions are suggested to cut off paths of failure propagations and to reduce the failure impacts this method allows to minimize the catastrophic failures on floating offshore wind turbines moreover a comparison study is conducted to remove the uncertainty when implementing the presented method which validates the proposed methodology s creativeness and feasibility keywords analytical hierarchy process failure analysis floating offshore wind turbine failure mode and effect analysis risk analysis 1 introduction floating offshore wind technology has experienced extensive and worldwide growth during the past several years due to the surge of renewable energy demand turner 1999 dincer 2000 díaz and guedes soares 2020b the floating wind represents the next step of the offshore wind market this new concept permits accessing depths of seas up to 1000 meters where the wind resource is typically higher colmenar santos et al 2016 musial et al 2016 salvacao and guedes soares 2018 alongside the wind potential access to infeasible locations so far may provide increased opportunity for spatial diversification moore et al 2018 díaz and guedes soares 2020a floating wind turbines could lead to lower wind energy costs due to the benefits already mentioned but are currently slightly more expensive than fixed structures athanasia and genachte 2013 castro santos et al 2016 uzunoglu and guedes soares 2020 due to these new concepts immaturity energy planners and stakeholders decisions are highly dependents on costs and vulnerabilities leimeister and kolios 2018 castro santos et al 2020 the floating technology requires frequent maintenance and such a procedure s difficulty involves a considerable amount of associated costs sinha and steel 2015 li et al 2020b due to the distance to shore and high repair consuming time all capital and operating costs are assumed to escalate kang et al 2017 bento and fontes 2019 li and guedes soares 2019 li et al 2020b through risk assessment effective maintenance can be guaranteed which are predictions of weak links in the system in the early design stage sinha and steel 2015 kang et al 2019a scheu et al 2019 wu et al 2019 li et al 2020b 2021 floating offshore wind power generation has apparent advantages over fixed bottom foundation structures nevertheless there exists the possibility to appear a large volume of damages of blades gearboxes mooring systems and other parts of floating wind turbines as their operation time increases due to the severe working conditions at sea santos et al 2015 kang et al 2019b gwec 2020 the failure rate and economic losses can be effectively reduced through fault detection and risk or failure analysis of floating wind turbine systems therefore to analyse the failure modes and their effects the method of failure mode and effect analysis fmea is taken to conduct failure assessment in this paper the main objective of fmea is to identify the deficiencies at the product design stage and based on that analyse failures of each element and their impact on each system or even at a holistic level spreafico et al 2017 liu et al 2019 li et al 2020a fmea incorporates subjective assets like severity occurrence and detection to assess a subjective and dimensionless index namely risk priority number rpn which is a representation of each potential failure stamatis 2003 however limitations of fmea have been criticized stamatis 2003 xiao et al 2011 dinmohammadi and shafiee 2013 shafiee and dinmohammadi 2015 sinha and steel 2015 du et al 2017 tazi et al 2017 cevasco et al 2018 scheu et al 2019 li et al 2020b 2021 i three risk factors severity occurrence and detection are not differentiated in the rpn due to the relative importance of them considered equal ii various combinations of risk factors may result in the same rpn value hindering risk level determination iii discrete and fixed risk factor levels generate rpns most likely at the bottom of the scale and several specific values resulting in uneven rpn distributions therefore conventional fmea may not be adequate to determine the risk level of failures by improving the traditional method of fmea so that it can be free from the practical restrictions already mentioned above and adequate to failure analysis of floating offshore wind turbines a weighted fmea technique is proposed in this paper the novel contributions of this study as follows 1 to apply the analytic hierarchy process ahp methodology to extract weights of risk factors of fmea 2 to present a normalization algorithm to convert the risk factors values into a comparable scale as their weights to avoid results bias 3 to propose an ahp fmea technique to complete a convincing and close to practice failure analysis of floating offshore wind turbines which are relatively new and very few be investigated this paper is organized as follows the state of the art is provided in section 2 the methodologies presented are illustrated in section 3 modules classification of the floating offshore wind turbine and data collection is demonstrated in section 4 the results and recommendations are in section 5 comparisons and discussions are conducted in section 6 conclusions are drawn at the end in section 7 2 state of the art the efforts on conducting failure analysis of wind turbines onshore and offshore fixed bottom and floating structures using fmea or its upgraded version failure mode effects and criticality analysis fmeca are implemented into two aspects analyse actual wind turbines by using conventional methods and develop new models to release practical limitations as for analysing actual wind turbines by using conventional fmeas fmecas analyses aim to drive more comprehensive and instructive results by an elaborate system grading and exhaustive failure collection in operating wind turbines and then to suggest recommendations to optimal design and update preventive activities of daily operations for instance arabian hoseynabadi et al 2010 decomposed a 2 mw indirect drive and variable speed wind turbine into 11 components they collected 16 failure modes with 27 root causes to drive a failure analysis by applying the fmea method the study identified the wind turbine s decisive failure modes materials failure fracture rupture and electrical device failures bharatbha 2015 analysed 16 components of a 5 mw wind turbine with 33 failure modes by the fmea method the analysis applied probability ranking and consequence ranking to generate the criticality index of each failure mode identified that gear teeth slip blades and distorting the shape of the shaft main shaft are the most critical failures sinha and steel 2015 analysed 36 failure modes of a gearbox of offshore wind turbines by fmea technique accordingly ascertained the dangerous failures by the developed fmea software the study was proved to be more close to practice and tends to improve the accuracy of rpn numbers dinmohammadi and shafiee 2013 broke offshore wind turbines down to 16 assemblies for conducting the fmea schedule the analysis identified that the tower has the highest priority for failure prevention of offshore wind turbines to reach more comprehensive and constructive results of failure analysis for offshore wind turbines scheu et al 2019 collected 337 failure modes and employed more than 40 specialists to drive the fmea process the analysis outcomes provide fundamental guidance for condition based maintenance implementation and benefit optimal operating and maintenance o m strategy planning on the other hand new fmea models have been created to release practical limitations especially neglecting risk factors weights when applied to the offshore wind energy sector xiao et al 2011 put forward that severity occurrence and detection should be graded by weights according to maintenance features accordingly li et al 2021 considered the relative importance of severity occurrence and detection of fmea to identify risky failures of floating offshore wind turbines as a result of this a weighted fmea was developed and implemented to identify critical failure items of floating offshore wind turbine support structures rather than implementing the weighted fmea method at the system level dinmohammadi and shafiee 2013 finalized a risk analysis of a holistic wind turbine using the method mentioned above however the mentioned studies assign directly subjective weights of risk factors of fmeas and such a rough modelling manner makes the failure analysis results discussable recently ascertaining mentioned weights by analytic hierarchy process ahp method tends to be a hot topic for today s research in the risk analysis sector the ahp structure contains multiple layers and weights designed to connect a specific layer and the upper one on this basis the information propagation among the ahp structure includes information transformation in the same layer and between layers computationally say comparison calculation in layer and weighting calculation between layers stamatis 2003 huang et al 2020 the ahp method extracts information from the given data by computing relative differences of factors and then transfers the comparison results to the upper layers by using a weighting algorithm the ahp is structurally flexible and conforms to the weight acquire demand of fmeas accordingly hu et al 2009 evaluated green components failures by the weighted fmea in which ahp methodology has been applied to infer the weights of risk factors the results recommended a more feasible quality checking procedure wang et al 2020 assigned weights of severity occurrence and detection by the ahp methodology and prioritized 21 failure modes of structure propulsion electrical and auxiliary systems of an ocean fishing vessel the study suggested that the hydraulic failure of the auxiliary system is the most severe failure of the ocean fishing vessel to overcome the situation that various combinations of risk factors could obtain the same rpn hiding failure properties of systems fattahi and khalilzadeh 2018 put forward a hybrid method based on fmea and ahp methods to prioritize eight accidents as substitutions of failure modes of the kerman steel industries factory in iran two dangerous accidents plates and rollers falling on the feet were found to be critical than others carpitella et al 2018 proposed a developed fmeca model to prioritize 42 failure modes of a cleaning vehicle and the ahp technique had been implemented to infer weights of risk factors this study ascertained 12 critical failure modes and accordingly optimized the maintenance activities of the vehicle however the mentioned studies neglected the individuality of failures knowing that they assign the same weights of risk factors to all failures for floating offshore wind turbines failure mechanisms are different from failures to failures for instance failures of support structures are significantly different from gearboxes as the former mainly resulted from harsh sea conditions still gearboxes failures are mostly the consequences of degradations of gears and bearings to design weights of risk factors to each component or failure mode or failure cause considering related failure properties is still an open problem of the risk analysis domain and the floating offshore wind turbine sector 3 methodology the ahp fmea technique is constructed in this section aiming at addressing shortcomings of the conventional fmea method that is already mentioned in section 1 the presented ahp fmea technique is a combination of a proposed normalization algorithm and the ahp methodology which allows one to generate risk index rpn of a failure by two data sets relative importance of severity occurrence and detection by the proposed normalization algorithm as well as their weights by the ahp methodology the procedure of driving the proposed ahp fmea methodology is demonstrated as follows also as shown in fig 1 1 system identification determine the floating offshore wind turbine that to be analysed 2 system decomposition break the floating offshore wind turbine down to components and record the hierarchical structure 3 failures collection identify failure modes of each component and analyse their root causes record the hierarchical relationship between components and failure modes until to root causes obtain values of risk factors severity occurrence and detection of failure causes from specialists 4 relative importance computation calculate the relative importance of each failure cause by the proposed normalized algorithm see section 3 1 5 weights calculation collect pairwise indices severity over occurrence severity over detection and occurrence over detection from specialists and infer weights of risk factors of each failure item by ahp technique see section 3 2 6 rpns computation calculate rpns of failure causes use eq 10 failure modes use eq 11 and components use eq 12 of the floating offshore wind turbine 7 recommendations identify weak links of the floating offshore wind turbine and suggest corrective actions and preventive o m measures to avoid their occurrence overall several concerns should be highlighted for a better understanding of the proposed ahp fmea methodology the method employs both risk factors and weights indicating that it requires more extensive data collection than conventional methods the scales of risk factors values are normalized to be the same as that of weights to avoid that either indices or their weights affect significantly the rpn generation than another the weights of risk factors are changeable for different failure items as a consequence of extensive data collection detailed modelling and much more complicated computations the ahp fmea methodology is applicable for other risk failure analysis cases if the pairwise evidence between risk factors are available 3 1 normalization algorithm denote β s i β o i and β d i the average values of severity occurrence and detection of failure cause i which can be arranged by 1 β s 1 β o 1 β d 1 β s 2 β o 2 β d 2 β s i β s n β o i β o n β d i β d n denote 2 ξ k i j β k i β k j where k reflects risk factors including severity occurrence and detection accordingly the comparison matrix ξ k i j of risk factors is represented as 3 ξ k i j ξ s 11 ξ s 12 ξ s 1 n ξ o 11 ξ o 12 ξ o 1 n ξ d 11 ξ d 22 ξ d 1 n the normalized vector φ k i j is defined as 4 φ k ϕ s ϕ o ϕ k where 5 ϕ k j ξ k i j i j ξ k i j it is obvious that ϕ k i j 0 1 and k s o d ϕ k 1 3 2 ahp based weights computation the importance matrix of risk factors of failure mode i is constructed as 6 a i α s s i α s o i α s d i α o s i α o o i α o d i α d s i α d o i α d d i 1 α s o i α s d i 1 α s o i 1 α o d i 1 α s d i 1 α o d i 1 α s 1 α s 2 α s 3 α o 1 α o 2 α o 3 α d 1 α d 2 α d 3 where α s o i α s d i and α o d i are pairwise weights of severity over occurrence severity over detection and occurrence over detection of failure mode i respectively define a matrix δ as 7 δ k j δ s 1 δ s 2 δ s 3 δ o 1 δ o 2 δ o 3 δ d 1 δ d 2 δ d 3 where 8 δ k j α k j k s o d α k j accordingly the weights of indices are calculated by 9 ω j j 1 3 δ s j 3 j 1 3 δ o j 3 j 1 3 δ d j 3 t hence the rpn of failure cause i r p n f c i j w is computed as 10 r p n f c i j w f φ k i j ω j φ k i j ω j where φ k i j denotes the relative importance of failure cause i of jth failure mode ω j reflects weights of failure mode j hence the rpn of failure mode j which contains m failure causes can be calculated as 11 r p n f m i w i 1 m r p n f c i j w subsequently the rpn of component h r p n c o m p h w can be computed as 12 r p n c o m p h w j 1 p r p n f m i j w 4 modules classification of the floating offshore wind turbine and data collection 4 1 modules classification the offshore floating wind turbine comprises various modules independent or auxiliary to each other the floating offshore wind turbine system is functionally divided into four parts wind turbine tower and transition piece floating foundation and mooring system see fig 2 the main components of floating offshore wind turbines are listed in table 1 wind turbine the wind turbine is mainly composed of a rotor system nacelle and yaw system among which the internal components of nacelle are crucial and complicated the blades pitching control system nacelle and gear s failure rates are the three highest other wind turbine failures can be described as rotor system failure bearing or shaft failure gearbox failure braking system failure generator failure sensor failure yawing failure drivetrain control system failure hydraulics failure structural failure and electrical failure tower and transition piece the tower is used to support the wind turbine components the transition piece performs the function of maintaining an accurate position of the tower the supporting role tower and transition piece are also expected to resist force and moment produced by the variable wind wave and current loads lee et al 2016 the failures of support structures occur mainly at the flange bolt and weld area caused by fatigue loads meanwhile failure modes like hit by blades strong wind or wave lightning strike ice storm storm and material fatigue also exist under the effect of extreme loads severe consequences such as tower collapses will result in the wind turbine s sinking and severe losses chou and tu 2011 floating foundation the main types of floating offshore wind turbines under development are the semi submersible spar and tension leg platform tlp uzunoglu et al 2016 the main floating foundation failures are pillar damage corrosion of pipe joint weld effect of the pipe joint fatigue joints insufficient detection typhoon not exist for all seas a crash of planes biological collision and capsize mooring system the mooring systems for floating offshore wind turbines have benefited from the offshore oil and gas experience arapogianni et al 2013 the main mooring configurations are the catenary system and the taut leg system xu et al 2019 the mooring system failures result in the unbalance of upper structures the possible failures are the sea s limited state corrosion off air lead fatigue off air lead mooring lines brake unsatisfied sea state for operation insufficient emergency measures for abrupt scenes and analysis and calculation fault when the mooring module fails the system will be at risk 4 2 data collection five specialists with diverse backgrounds and with an overall 28 years experience in floating offshore wind turbines or offshore wind farms were employed see table 2 overall 42 failure modes with 104 failure causes were identified by the specialists it should be noted that the failure modes and causes identified partly reviewed from publications and the remains either have been observed in the operating offshore wind farms or ascertained by specialists under the assumption of those failures are potentially occurred according to their experience and knowledge failure items of the floating offshore wind turbine are listed in appendix a the standardization and consistency of specialists evaluations are guaranteed by unified rating guidance see table 3 moreover the normalized values of risk factors and computed weights are listed in appendix b besides pairwise comparisons of risk factors representing the relative importance among risk factors are performed using saaty s method that is designed to evaluate the degree to which a factor is important than comparing one see table 4 5 results and recommendations 5 1 systems and components finding out critical systems and components of floating offshore wind turbines initiates the understanding of failure natures and benefit for arranging o m activities e g failure warning and diagnosis elements backup and transportation inspections and preventive maintenance scheduling the criticality rank of the floating offshore wind turbine systems is demonstrated in fig 3 a the wind turbine is recognized to be the most critical system of the floating offshore wind turbine with an rpn of 0 44 followed by the mooring system 0 18 the floating foundation 0 17 as well as the tower and transition piece system 0 16 fig 3 also concluded that the wind turbine is critical as they are structurally complicated and contains more failure items mooring systems tend to be more vulnerable in dealing with complex and harsh sea conditions than floating foundations the tower and transition piece system is the most reliable system that likely free from the failures due mainly to its simple structure and limited functions overall 18 components of the floating offshore wind turbine were analysed mooring lines jointed with fairleads and anchors to locate floating platforms at a selected sea space are recognized as weak links of the floating offshore wind turbine as which hold the highest rpns see fig 3 c according to fig 3 b and c the impacts of fairlead and anchor malfunctions on the holistic floating offshore wind turbine are minor the tower is riskier than transition pieces in general the tower s failures are unlikely to be detected giving rise to disasters to floating offshore wind turbines failures of towers will directly result in upper wind turbines shaking reduce energy generation efficiency or sink into the water fortunately the likelihoods of tower failures are relatively low as displayed in appendix b such an idea is also supported by specialists who distributed the highest weight of severity to the tower 73 still the weights of occurrence 18 and detection 9 are the lowest see fig 3 b for the components within the nacelle the generator rpn 0 099 and gearbox rpn 0 098 are remarkably critical than other devices rpns 0 04 the results are also obtained from du et al 2017 bhardwaj et al 2019 scheu et al 2019 and li et al 2020b the gearbox and generator are structurally complex with a selection of elements and accomplishing pivotal and primary functions the failure consequences of both components are severe and impact the electricity generation of floating offshore wind turbines immediately the aforementioned results are in line with the practice that engineers had followed in gearboxes and generators by implementing sensors to monitoring their health conditions as a basis of that warning and predict their malfunctions ahead of unwanted events happen as typical electromechanical equipment generators fail more frequently than mechanical devices installed within nacelles such as gearboxes these results can explain that specialists assigned a higher weight to generators occurrence as in fig 3 b 5 2 failure modes failure modes are representations of floating offshore wind turbines working in unexpected states in this study 42 failure modes are analysed see fig 4 a total of 15 failure modes are recognized to be critical as their rpns exceed the average value 0 024 that is bearing deformation generator overheat winding failure of the generator gearbox overheat open circuit of converter and transformer tower collapse tower crack transition piece crack floating foundation hitting watertight and additional structures failure of floating foundations abnormal and broken mooring lines as well as abnormal functions of mooring lines the generator and gearbox are the weak links of the floating offshore wind turbine see section 5 1 to be specific bearing deformation with the rpn of 0 0362 and rpn share of 3 6 overheat 0 03 3 and winding failure 0 0335 3 4 are risky failure modes of the generator overheat 0 0268 2 87 is the most critical failure mode of the gearbox differently relatively high failure frequency and remarkable weight of detection are distinguished properties of the gearbox failures indicating the gearbox failures are frequent while hard to be detected and predicted the transformer failures are severe as they directly affect the electricity yield of the floating offshore wind turbine failures of tower and transition pieces are few but risky tower collapse is critical as such a failure is unlikely to be detected in advance of its occurrence moreover the transition piece is an essential component and the primary failure of which is crack devices failures such as watertight vent pump sensor and manhole are important among other components of floating foundations these failures are common but hard to be detected note that high failure frequencies are the unique nature of the floating foundations mooring lines failures including abnormal and broken mooring lines call for engineers particular attention especially designers broken mooring lines occupying the top place of all failure modes by contributing 10 rpn to the total abnormal mooring lines initiate broken mooring lines make 5 rpn of the holistic equipment which can be an indicator to predict and avoid disasters mooring lines failures 5 3 failure causes failure causes are the root reasons for failures which randomly give rise to failure modes of floating offshore wind turbines and cannot be eliminated and mostly cannot be observed visually such as material deterioration and human errors aggregately 104 failure causes were identified and rpns of which were computed by the ahp fmea see fig 5 and appendix b the mean and median of failure causes rpn are 0 0097 and 0 0096 respectively the critical failure causes wear fatigue lubrication fails corrosion environmental factors and human errors see fig 6 from the single failure cause point of view destructive environmental conditions are top failure factors e g lightning strikes and ice storms that introduce fragility to towers and strong wind wave bring about the additional risk of failures to both towers and floating foundations the results are supported by kang et al 2017 and kang et al 2019b in which harsh sea conditions were ascertained to be risk factors to floating offshore wind turbines from risk assessment and reliability analysis failure probability perspectives the results also explain the leading differential of failure features between floating offshore wind turbines and fixed bottom structures or between onshore wind turbines and offshore ones according to results floating foundations and towers are influenced significantly by harsh environmental situations as such components are huge and exposed to adverse weather conditions in contrast smaller size components installed within nacelles are likely free from sea conditions decisive impacts besides material related factors like fatigue wear and corrosion are also critical failure causes the aforementioned results are confirmed by arabian hoseynabadi et al 2010 kahrobaee and asgarpoor 2011 bharatbhai 2015 sinha and steel 2015 kang et al 2017 li and guedes soares 2019 scheu et al 2019 and li et al 2020b which determined that materials and structural degradation are dangerous factors to failures of floating offshore wind turbines unlike harsh sea conditions that make failures of floating offshore wind turbines different from onshore and fixed bottom structures the results also display that material related factors may promote failures of several types of wind turbines in a similar way 5 4 recommendations failure behaviour is a path of the initiation propagation and occurrence of a failure to be specific failure behaviour is the series form that a failure cause gives rise to a failure mode s of a component s and subsequently results in failure of a system s until the malfunction of floating offshore wind turbines it accomplishes the following failure chain failure cause failure mode of component system failure malfunction of floating offshore wind turbines failure analysis is to recommend preventive and corrective actions to cut off the failure propagation chain already mentioned or avoid at least release or decrease probabilities the occurrence of critical failure causes according to sections 5 1 to 5 3 15 essential behaviours of failure were identified as displayed in fig 7 to this end 15 recommendations both preventive and corrective are suggested as follows wind turbines i strengthen surfaces of bearing tracks inner ring outer ring and rolling elements of bearings and improve electric corrosion preventions of generators ii upgrade or backup cooling systems to enhance the heat dissipation of generators and converters iii anti corrosion treatments of windings iv introduce wear and fatigue preventive actions to gears in gearboxes v guarantee high quality lubrications by better design of the hydraulic systems and implement additional leak proof measures vi monitor performance of transforms backup additional devices and open circuit function design to avoid overvoltage tower and transition pieces i design and implement reliable and less vulnerable lightning prevention systems ii reinforce tower and transition piece welding quality iii consider the impacts of strong wind waves in the full life cycle of floating offshore wind turbines floating foundations i additional design to release the impacts of strong wind waves ii enhance pipe joints design and welding quality of floating foundations to avoid watertight fault iii periodical inspections to bilge piping and pumps mooring systems i enhance the strength of mooring lines buoys friction chain and transitional chain to eliminate abnormal stress and release unexpected wear ii pay attention to the quality and states of the anchor pickup device and mooring winch iii improve the training to operators and maintenance members to avoid human failures note that common cause failures are identified according to the failure behaviours ascertained which makes failures of those components correlated and will introduce additional failure probability to the correlated components and ultimately decrease the reliability of floating offshore wind turbines however correlated failures will not be discussed in this paper as they are under reliability estimation not the topic of this paper that is failure analysis 6 discussion on expert opinions 6 1 comparison between experts about risk priority number table 5 gives the rpn values obtained from the proposed ahp fmea module section 3 for the fifteen sub assemblies of floating wind turbine systems considered in this study transition piece main bearing tower and mooring system account for almost two fifths of all critical failure modes identified during this paper this value is unprecedented in the context of the literature available in this subject area moreover these categories contribute more than 10 of the critical failure modes whereas the contribution is rather significant from the expert s background of floating offshore wind turbines experts 1 and 2 deal with systems design they considered higher risk of the transition piece blades hub main bearing main shaft and generator experts 3 and 4 focus on quality and research deal with offshore identified tower pitch system main bearing main shaft and hub as risky components in this study nevertheless expert 5 focus on floating structures identified with higher rpn the transition piece mooring system and floating foundation therefore it can be concluded that the background and work experience in an area is key for an fmea analysis the different experts backgrounds cover the systems involved in a floating wind turbine guarantee equity in the results 6 2 experts consensus the proposed ahp fmea methodology implemented and the diversity of experts involved generated a general result from the different opinions aggregation it is necessary to measure the severity occurrence and detection consensus for the aggregated group result table 6 shannon entropy and the three independent components alpha beta and gamma to derive the consensus indicator were used the priority distribution of indices of severity occurrence and detection among different experts was analysed using refs relations goepel 2013 and grošelj et al 2015 the consensus is calculated as the weighted arithmetic mean of all hierarchy nodes categories the consensus indicator of the consolidated alternative evaluation matrix weighted with the global priorities for alternatives was used the consensus indicator ranges from 0 no consensus to 100 full consensus the results are shown in table 7 a particular observation is made for the consensus of results with less than 36 the percentage of agreement between the different experts is low this low consensus is expected due to the various stakeholders different expertise regarding the 15 components analysed the conclusions also indicate the background and knowledge of the employed specialists are diverse which helps prevent bias results and validated that specialists selection is reasonably feasible 6 3 comparison between experts about components criticality the criticality number is one of the most important outcomes of an fmea application criticality number is very similar to rpn a traditional fmea metric the difference is that criticality only includes severity and occurrence the criticality value for the floating wind turbine components is estimated in table 8 table 8 shows that the transition piece s criticality index main bearing main shaft and hub is significantly higher in floating wind turbine components moreover other components as the tower and mooring system carry a high criticality factor the main bearing main shaft and hub are the most critical components in floating wind turbines for experts 2 3 and 4 while components as transition pieces and mooring systems are the critical ones for experts 1 and 5 on the other hand converter controller and electrical facilities show the lowest criticality values the dominant failure cause for floating turbine design are the tower main shaft main bearing and hub 6 4 comparison of the ahp fmea and the conventional method in this section a quantitative comparison is made between the ranking orders of the traditional fmea and the proposed ahp fmea in table 9 the results obtained for floating offshore wind turbines from the traditional fmea using the rpn method are compared with the results obtained from the proposed ahp fmea using the normalization method section 3 and rpn method as can be seen the main problem in the traditional fmea methodology is that it puts two critical assemblies the yaw system and the converter as having the same priority in shafiee and dinmohammadi 2015 a useful outcome of the proposed methodology could compare the ranking orders obtained from both methods from table 9 it is observed that both approaches lead to different ranking orders for seven individual assemblies i e generator gearbox and tower nevertheless there is a noticeable similitude between the results obtained using two approaches for some major components the hub controller and electrical facilities main shaft pitch system transition piece mooring system and the floating foundation occupy the same position in both rankings besides as the assemblies failure rates in both ranks are almost equal they are prioritized from the rpn perspective for a better understanding of the proposed ahp fmea methodology the following aspects should be highlighted to remove the confusing situation that has long been existing in the failure analysis of the floating offshore wind energy sector which are 1 this study makes it clear to practitioners how to distribute weights to indices of fmeas one conviction of practitioners of failure analysis is that weights of indices of fmeas have to be considered for a convincing failure analysis result however such parameters were distributed personally without clear evidence for instance dinmohammadi and shafiee 2013 consider the weights of severity occurrence and detection to be 0 21 0 26 and 0 53 respectively considering if failure can be detected in advance the frequency and consequence of which would be no longer important it can be compared with the idea of li et al 2021 that give the weights mentioned above by 0 4 0 35 and 0 25 respectively assuming that potential failure of a system is an intrinsic and natural characteristic detection measures cannot reduce physical risks it is evident that the two assumptions have inherent differences and reveal no substantial evidence to support consensus in the field luckily this study unprecedentedly provides such evidence by comprehensively collect judgments from field engineers 2 instead of applying absolute values of severity occurrence and detection as been done by other published studies this paper converts such parameters into a comparable scale of their weight to avoid biased outcomes derived from the situation that a group of parameters would impact more on the results than others 3 this study contributes to the failure analysis of engineering cases in practice and the development of fmea methodology as well as its extended versions in academia accordingly the method applies to all failure analysis scenarios and is not limited to floating offshore wind turbines or the wind energy sector 7 conclusions this paper proposes an ahp fmea methodology to complete a comprehensive failure analysis of floating offshore wind turbines the presented method infers the importance of severity occurrence and detection of the floating offshore wind turbine s failures by the ahp technique and accordingly weights of such risk factors can be extracted to drive the implementation of the proposed ahp fmea methodology the wind turbine with an rpn of 0 44 is the most critical system of the floating offshore wind turbine followed by the mooring system 0 18 floating foundation 0 17 as well as tower and transition pieces 0 16 subsequently broken mooring lines and the other 14 failure modes are identified to be risky failures this study subsequently distinguished the critical failure causes including wear fatigue lubrication fails corrosion environmental factors human errors and so on and accordingly 15 preventive and corrective activities such as enhance the strength of mooring lines are suggested to prevent the floating offshore wind turbine from catastrophic failures moreover a comparison study is conducted to clear some aspects when implementing the presented method the comparison results indicate that the rpn derived by different specialists is discrepant meaning that fmeas are subjective methods and personal judgments impact results the selection of specialists is plausible as their backgrounds are diverse the correctness of the ahp fmea results is confirmed by the results of

20608,we investigate the potential of a novel hybrid excitation of the tail for a robotic fish the tail consists of an ionic polymer metal composite ipmc beam excited at its base a model of the beam dynamics under base excitation ipmc actuation mechanism and hydrodynamic forces is derived lighthill s theory of elongated bodies is used to estimate the forward speed from the tail s oscillations and associated power for different tail dimensions and actuation configurations the model of the robotic fish propelled by only an ipmc actuator is validated using previously reported experimental frequency responses our results show that incorporating a small amplitude base excitation has the potential to significantly improve the forward speed of the robotic fish over a broader range of frequency excitations while consuming minimal additional power the results also show that this improvement is very significant at specific aspect ratios keywords robotic fish propulsion mechanism ipmc beam base excitation swimming performance 1 introduction advances in bio robotics research and smart materials present new opportunities for developing bio inspired autonomous underwater vehicles auvs salazar et al 2018 2019 these vehicles can serve in marine environment exploration search and rescue military surveillance and border patrol enabling desired locomotion performance in terms of speed endurance and maneuverability could only be achieved through optimized performance of available propulsion actuation mechanisms such mechanisms rely mostly on assemblies of multiple rigid segments linked in series and driven by motors to mimic undulatory and oscillatory motions of aquatic animals the complexity and power requirements associated with the use of such mechanisms could limit the capability of the auv to achieve performance goals for specific underwater missions for instance a robotic fish with a pair of pectoral fins actuated by servomotors via two pairs of wires was presented by zhong and li zhong et al 2013 revealed significant swimming capabilities still servo motors are not attractive for small sized robots due to their noise and relatively high power consumption in contrast and especially for small scale sized robots smart materials actuators such as piezoelectric cen and erturk 2013 shape memory alloy actuators wang et al 2010 and electroactive polymer actuators eap shahinpoor 1992 present attractive options for the actuation of the robotic fish smart material actuators have higher energy conversion efficiency simpler mechanisms to maneuver at low speeds or in tight quarters ye et al 2007a quieter operation and convenient miniaturization guo et al 2003 and requires much less power which makes them suitable for building miniature robots cen and erturk 2013 developed a piezoelectric robotic fish using macro fiber composite mfc bimorphs the piezoelectric material actuators were stimulated by low voltage inputs and were attached to a cantilever beam that was connected to a rigid body that housed all batteries and electrical components the robotic fish showed high swimming performance for underwater robots ionic polymer metal composites ipmc a class of the eap have shown promise for use in actuation shahinpoor and kim 2001 2004 kim et al 2005a due to their hydrophilic nature biocompatibility and ability to produce large bending motions under low voltage guo et al 2003 bar cohen 2004 ipmc have been studied extensively in the last two decades oguro et al 1992 kim and shahinpoor 2001 kim and tadokoro 2010 they are also referred to as artificial muscles due to their similarity to human muscles their main advantages include low density and flexibility silent operation lower power consumption and outstanding dynamic response at low voltages at the microscale the ipmc sample typically consists of a thin ion exchange membrane such as nafion and a noble metal as the electrodes chemically plated on both surfaces the bending motions of the ipmc occur due to this transport of molecules within the membrane and associated electrostatic interactions and hence the actuation effect chen and tan 2008 a deforming ipmc generates an electric current inversely the ipmc would deform when a voltage is applied across its thickness when supplied with the same amount of power ipmc actuated robotic fish have been found to swim a much greater distance than a motor actuated counterpart ye et al 2007b owing to the aforementioned distinctive features and given the absence of vibration causing components such as gears motors shafts etc ipmc are considered as attractive actuators for biomimetic robots one of the pioneering designs of an ipmc based underwater swimmer propeller is presented by shahinpoor 1992 another example is presented by mojarrad and shahinpoor 1996 the system propelled by a single ipmc was designed and tested on a ship like swimmer the results revealed that the speed of propulsion is proportional to the frequency and amplitude of undulation consequently a single vibrating ipmc was designed and experimentally tested in kim et al 2005b as an actuation mechanism for an undulatory tadpole swimmer the experimental results showed that wireless undulatory robots actuated by ipmc can accurately control the steering and swimming speed of the proposed microrobot for further investigation a pair of ipmc strips were used for actuating an underwater swimmer in guo et al 2000 apart from experimentation kim et al 2006 proposed a theoretical model of the ipmc actuator dynamic characteristics which can be used for single or multi segment ipmc actuator that operates in water this model conveniently accommodates the relaxation behavior of ipmcs and finite element approaches with a similar goal a modeling framework for motion of the ipmc based biomimetic underwater vehicles was developed by aureli et al 2010 by combining force and vibration measurements with reduced order modeling based on modal analysis the model simulated the aerodynamic loads generated by the vibrating ipmc including thrust lift and moment guo et al 2003 designed a robotic fish with ipmcs that produced undulatory motion they presented experimental results on the effect of the beating frequency on the propulsion efficiency and speed the swimming speed of the robot was controlled by the amplitude and frequency of the input voltage ray fish were investigated by tagaki et al takagi et al 2006 and anton et al 2004 the rajiform swimming which is the propulsion mode of a ray fish was developed using an ipmc propulsor in takagi et al 2006 the robot consisted of a plastic body 16 ipmcs amplifier a battery and a microcontroller to emulate rajiform mode of swimming and utilize ipmc as a rib actuator likewise anton et al 2004 proposed a ray like underwater robot with a buoyant body and two pectoral fins each actuated by two ipmc samples and reported up to 9 mm s propulsion speed however due to low propulsion efficiency and high power consumption their robot did not achieve free swimming capabilities another bioinspired species namely a snake like swimming robot with ipmcs as actuators was designed and experimentally analyzed in yamakita et al 2005 the study demonstrated a smooth swimming motion and exploited the doping effect using the ipmc actuator along the line of different bioinspired robots lauder et al 2011 experimentally derived flexural rigidities for bluegill fin rays moreover they designed and studied the active muscular control of flexibility and curvature of the fish body in propulsion they discussed the significance of incorporating ipmcs as actuators to generate undulatory patterns along the body tan et al tan et al 2006 presented an autonomous and sensor equipped untethered water robot for the control of water quality in lakes and ponds they demonstrated the usefulness of ipmc to operate underwater vehicles in different aqueous environments chen et al chen and tan 2008 chen et al 2010 developed a mathematical model for the control of the robotic fish estimates of the forward speed generated by the oscillating ipmc were obtained by combining the physics based ipmc governing equations and the classical lighthill s slender body theory lighthill 1971 moreover lighthill s theory was extended to predict the power consumption of the robotic fish shen et al 2013 given the operation underwater the hydrodynamics of an ipmc beam was investigated using digital particle image velocimetry dpiv and computational fluid dynamics abdelnour et al 2009 the thrust measurements showed high correlation to the vortex shedding mechanism their analysis revealed that the produced thrust can be approximated by a quadratic function of the reynolds number increasing the oscillation frequency of the actuating ipmc beam was observed to improve the thrust production on the other hand this resulted in a simultaneous increase in the lateral force and reaction moment that produced undesirable pitching and yawing motions that degraded the propulsion performance several studies focused on the development of reliable models that capture the intrinsic actuation physics of ipmc and validate the speed model experimentally along with finding geometrical ways to improve the performance speed of the robotic fish chen et al 2010 proposed a physics based model of a biomimetic robotic fish propelled by an ipmc actuator to increase the speed of the robotic fish and operate at lower frequencies a plastic caudal passive fin was designed and attached to the ipmc beam by combining theory and experiments they provided a method to optimize the design of the physical properties and geometric dimensions of the robotic fish considering the merits and shortcomings of aforementioned actuation methods to enhance the performance of robotic fish we propose a hybrid mechanism to excite the tail that combines ipmc actuation and base excitation recognizing the advantages of using ipmc in developing robot fish we investigate the performance of a bio inspired propulsion mechanism based on using a miniature ipmc beam subject to base excitation to realistically imitate biological features and abilities of the flexible tails of a fish the goal is to exploit the induced bending of the beam to generate hydrodynamic loads as per desired swimming performance in terms of thrust generation and forward motion to gain physical insights into the proposed propulsion mechanism we develop and validate a mathematical model that accounts for the ipmc physics underwater beam dynamics and base excitation we show the potential of the hybrid excitation of the tail to significantly increase the forward speed while spending minimal additional power the numerical study reveals that the robotic fish gains an 82 5 increase in its forward speed with a mere 9 3 increase in its power consumption furthermore the proposed mechanism is expected to have less noise and space requirements in comparison to bulky articulated segments actuated via servomotors the paper is organized as follows we first describe the design and the mathematical model of the hybrid tail then we proceed with the numerical implementation of the governing equations and model validation in section 3 we present simulation results and quantify the advantages of the proposed propulsion mechanism the last section summarizes the main findings 2 mathematical model of hybrid excitation of tail 2 1 hybrid excitation mechanism the robotic fish under consideration is composed of two main parts a rigid body and a flexible ipmc tail that can also be forced at its base the base excitation is produced and controlled using piezoelectric layers with an applied voltage erturk and inman 2008 erturk and inman for specific excitation amplitudes and frequencies the resulting motion of the flexible tail supports generating thrust resulting in forward motion of the robotic fish the excitation activates the bending mode only to avoid degradation in propulsion performance by torsional deflections 2 2 underwater dynamics of an ipmc beam under base

loading is presented in fig 1 a the ipmc based actuation mechanism is illustrated in fig 1 b an ipmc strip includes anode and cathode layers when applying a voltage between these layers the cations are shifted to the cathode side while the anions are fixed on the carbon polymer chain this causes a stretching on the cathode side and a subsequent compression on the anode side and results in a bending motion following the euler bernoulli beam assumptions clough and penzien 1993 and accounting for the hydrodynamic interactions and actuation mechanisms we formulate the model and derive the

hydrodynamic function γ 1 for a harmonic base excitation the inertial force in the time domain is expressed as 10 f b a s e t μ v ω 2 z 0 sin ω t where z 0 and ω are the amplitude and frequency of the base excitation substituting the laplace transform of equation 10 into equation 5 yields 11 e i w x s x x x x c v s w x s μ v s 2 w x s f i p m c x s μ v z 0 ω 3 s 2 ω 2 equation 11 is solved next by implementing modal analysis and expressing the transverse deflection w x s as the sum 12 w x s i 1 m q i s φ i x of m modes where q i s is the generalized coordinate and φ i x is the i th mode shape

sample typically consists of a thin ion exchange membrane chemically plated on both surfaces with noble metals as electrodes positive hydrogen ions in the membrane are replaced by other cations such as n a and l i 2 during an ion exchange process these cations can move freely in the membrane when the ipmc is hydrated when a voltage is applied across the ipmc strip from the anode to the cathode cations are shifted to the cathode side along with the water molecules which creates differential swelling across the polymer thickness as a result the ipmc will bend to the anode side chen and tan 2008 the actuation induced bending moment m i p m c z s at a point x resulting from the actuation voltage v s is given by chen and tan 2008 chen et al 2010 23 m i p m c x s α 0 w k k e γ s tanh γ s s

given by sader 1998 25 f i p m c i s 1 μ v l 0 l f d x s φ i x d x m l s φ i l therefore the generalized force is written in terms of the transfer function h f 1 i s as 26 f i p m c i s h f 1 i s v s

forward speed of the robotic fish generated by the flexible base actuated tail is estimated using lighthill s theory lighthill 1971 which is applicable when the cross sectional area of the fish body changes slowly across its length i e the fish has an elongated body for specific oscillating periodic bending of the tail the robotic fish is expected to achieve a steady state forward speed balancing the mean thrust and drag forces the steady state forward speed is related to the lateral velocity and slope of the trailing edge and is given by chen et al 2010 34 u m d w x t t 2 c d ρ w s m d w x t x 2 x l where the overbar denotes the mean value defined as the average over one period of oscillation m d ρ w π 4 b 2 is the added mass density c d is the drag coefficient and s is the wetted surface area the steady state speed u of the robotic fish under sinusoidal actuation voltage and sinusoidal base excitation is then given by 35 u m ω a h 1 j ω ω 3 h 2 j ω 2 2 c d s c ρ w m a h 1 d j ω ω 2 h

model of the tail under hybrid excitation using a combination of ipmc actuation and base excitation will be first validated using previously published experimental data then the model will be used to investigate the potential of different configurations of the proposed hybrid excitation tail mechanism for enhancing the capability of the robotic fish in terms of forward speed and power consumption 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation to validate the model we compare predicted frequency responses of an ipmc beam in air and water with previous experimental results as reported by brunetto et al 2008 the experimental frequency response in brunetto et al 2008 was obtained by applying a swept voltage stimulus on the ipmc actuator immersed in fluid air and water and recording the produced deformation the experimental set up comprised a function generator that controls the input signal actuating voltage on the ipmc actuator and a distance laser sensor interfaced to a computer via a daq system for measuring the tip deflection the dimensions and material properties of the beam are presented in table 1 the applied voltage to actuate the ipmc beam is set equal to 3 2 v as shown in fig 3 the agreement level between the numerical and experimental results demonstrates the model s accuracy in predicting the dynamic response of the ipmc beam it is noted also that for the same excitation voltage the response amplitude in water is reduced to 83 75 of its value in air furthermore the natural frequency decreases from 9 hz to 2 89 hz this decrease in amplitude and frequency is due to the increased added mass and damping in water a relatively higher response in water is also noted at the second natural frequency near 19 6 hz as shown in fig 3 b properties of the beam considered for subsequent analysis of generated thrust and power requirements are the same as the ones investigated by chen et al 2010 and shown in table 2 the baseline ipmc tail considered in the present study has an aspect ratio a r l b of 1 53 for the assessment of the relative importance of base and ipmc excitations we first estimate the propulsion without base excitation and validate the results with experimental findings of chen et al 2010 in the analysis the transfer function h 1 l s is expressed using the first three mode shapes to investigate gains from operating at the higher vibration modes i e we let 40 h 1 l s i 1 m 3 φ i l h f i q i s where each element is defined in the mathematical model as discussed above we note that three modes were observed to achieve convergent solutions the higher modes are incorporated to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of the tail when excited at higher frequencies as will be discussed below the bode magnitude plot which shows the variations of the magnitude of h 1 j ω with the excitation frequency ω 2 π f is displayed in fig 4 the simulation results are in good agreement with their experimental counterparts the slight quantitative discrepancy is mostly associated with the estimation of the added mass and added damping obtained from sader s hydrodynamic model sader 1998 which is derived for an infinitely long beam the cut off frequency was determined experimentally to be 8 6 hz chen et al 2010 while the predicted ipmc beam s first natural frequency when operating in water is 8 73 hz the other peaks of the bode magnitude plot are consistent with the second and third natural frequencies estimated to be near 54 8 hz and 153 2 hz respectively fig 5 shows the variations in the forward speed with the excitation frequency of the ipmc actuator without base excitation the frequency range 0200 hz is selected to cover the first three natural modes clearly the forward speed with values near 2 mm s achieved by excitation at frequencies near those of the higher modes are significantly lower than the speed of 16 25 mm s attained by exciting the beam at the frequency of its primary mode these results reveal that operating at higher vibration modes is not beneficial in terms of enhancing the cruising speed of the robotic fish that is the main reason for proposing a hybrid excitation mechanism of the tail that combines the ipmc actuation with base excitation while operating in the vicinity of the first natural frequency to enhance the cruising speed the effects of incorporating the base excitation on the performance of the robotic fish is investigated next our objective is to enhance the performance of the robotic fish without altering the geometrical configuration of the tail the implementation of the robotic fish requires the integration of electrical components for actuation and control purposes this motivated us to investigate the effectiveness of exciting the base of the ipmc with a piezoelectric transducer that can be housed in the main body of the robotic fish without increasing the size of the robotic fish we consider the hybrid excitation of tail mechanism for the case of a base excitation amplitude of 0 25 mm and the same frequency as that of the ipmc actuator the actuation voltage at the base is set equal to 3 3 v fig 6 displays the variations of the forward speed with the excitation frequency for the ipmc and hybrid tail hereafter we refer to the case of the tail subjected to both ipmc actuation and base excitation as the hybrid excitation of tail the plots in fig 6 show that the base excitation significantly increases the forward speed from 16 25 mm s to 29 2 mm s when setting the excitation frequency equal to the first natural frequency furthermore the curve of the tail under hybrid excitation shows a wider frequency bandwidth that is the forward speed remains high over a broader frequency range for instance at 20 hz the tail under hybrid excitation produces a forward speed of 12 14 mm s which is one order of magnitude larger than the achieved speed of 1 12 mm s by only using the ipmc excitation the simulated results show that significant enhancement in terms of forward speed can be attained with a small amplitude base excitation z 0 0 25 mm to put this enhancement in perspective we compare it with the enhancement level in the forward speed attained by attaching a passive fin to the ipmc beam chen et al 2010 chen et al 2010 conducted free swimming tests of a robotic fish equipped with an ipmc actuated tail attached to a passive fin their results for the ipmc actuated tail with a passive fin presented in the insert in fig 6 show that when adding the passive fin the frequency leading to maximum forward speed generation decreased from 8 6 hz to about 1 hz and increased the forward speed from 16 mm s to 21 mm s i e by about 31 25 our results show that adding a base excitation with an amplitude of 0 25 mm led to an increase of 82 5 in the forward speed this increase in the speed due to base excitation is based fundamentally on the ratio of the maximum response magnitude to the input displacement magnitude of the piezoelectric transducers referred to as the displacement transmissibility the speed attains its highest jump when the excitation frequency is near the first natural frequency operation at resonance which is expected for support motion systems as discussed by inman 2014 moreover another interpretation of the enhancement in the forward speed using base excitation is due to an increase in the power delivered to the entire system the additional required power is compensated by a much higher increase in the forward speed as will be explained next one concern is the additional required power for the base excitation as such we use equations 37 and 40 to compute the power requirements for actuating the hybrid and ipmc tails we show in fig 7 the variations of the power of the hybrid and ipmc tails with the excitation frequency the power required for ipmc actuation shows a sharp increase and experiences saturation when reaching about 4 hz these results are consistent with those reported in shen et al 2013 the power associated with the tail under hybrid excitation shows an increasing trend when shifting the excitation frequency to higher values the contribution of the base excitation to the total power at low frequencies is minimal the plots in fig 7 show that one needs to spend 9 3 extra power due to base excitation to operate the hybrid tail at the first natural frequency which in turn results in a substantial increase in the forward speed of the robotic fish 82 5 increase next we investigate the impact of the tail geometry represented by the aspect ratio on the performance of the ipmc and hybrid tails in the presented results the ratio is changed by varying the length while maintaining a constant surface area length width and same thickness as per the baseline case reported in table 2 this means that the mass of the beam remains unchanged fig 8 a shows the variations in the forward speed of the robotic fish with the excitation frequency for different aspect ratios of the ipmc dashed line and hybrid tails solid line the plots show that the performance of the ipmc tail without base excitation in terms of maximum attained speed when excited near its natural frequency is not much impacted by changing the aspect ratio between 2 6 and 1 16 in contrast reducing the aspect ratio of the tail from 2 6 to 1 16 and subjecting it to hybrid excitation results in a significant increase in the maximum forward speed from 15 mm s to 51 6 mm s particularly the improvement in the performance of the robotic fish when incorporating the base excitation is more pronounced for smaller aspect ratios we note that a similar analysis was conducted on the ipmc beam having an aspect ratio of 7 5 as tested by brunotto et al brunetto et al 2008 the beam specifications are given in table 1 the improvement due to base excitation is observed to be minimal for this high aspect ratio beam especially near resonance however decreasing the aspect ratio of the beam is found to significantly amplify the impact of base excitation on the performance of the tail in terms of forward speed generation for instance setting the aspect ratio to 1 875 is found to produce an 81 5 increase in the forward speed as such one needs a proper selection of the tail s aspect ratio to maximize the hydrodynamic performance enhancement from the base excitation fig 8 b shows the variations in the power consumption with the aspect ratio when related to the variations in the forward speed it is noted that the significant increase in forward speed is attained with a small increase in power consumption while the tail with aspect ratio 2 6 under hybrid excitation at 4 2 hz consumes 0 92 w to attain a speed of 15 mm s the tail having a lower aspect ratio of 1 16 consumes slightly larger level of 0 99 w at 51 5 hz to achieve a much higher speed of 51 6 mm s to gain further insight on the performance of the hybrid excitation of tail mechanism we generate the surface plots of fig 9 which show the variations of the maximum forward speed and consumed power with the aspect ratio of the tail ranging between 1 16 and 4 63 and the amplitude of the base excitation the results are obtained for both ipmc and hybrid tails reducing the aspect ratio and increasing the amplitude of the base excitation both result in higher forward speed of particular interest is that higher speeds are attained with less power consumption in the case of the hybrid excitation of tail fig 9 c shows that the power associated with the ipmc actuation reaches a maximum of 0 89 w for a tail aspect ratio of 2 6 this power decreases to 0 84 w when the aspect ratio is decreased to 1 16 and to 0 84 w when the aspect ratio is increased to 4 63 for the ipmc tail slightly less power is required to achieve higher forward speed from 12 m s to 18 m s in the range of considered aspect ratios as for the hybrid excitation of tail the total power displayed in fig 9 d shows that a forward speed of 150 m s which is one order of magnitude larger than the highest speed achieved by the ipmc tail requires a total power of 1 4 w for a base excitation amplitude of 1 mm a broader evaluation of the required power maximize the forward speed for different aspect ratios is obtained from the percentage variations in the maximum forward speed and consumed power as respectively shown in fig 10 a and 10 b the plots show that increasing the forward speed and levels of consumed power can be controlled through the selection of the geometry of the propelled tail and the base excitation for instance selecting an ipmc beam with an aspect ratio ar 1 53 l 23 mm while applying a voltage of 3 3 v similar to the one studied by chen et al 2010 and adding a synchronized excitation at the natural frequency of the beam in water with an amplitude of 0 5 mm produces 158 gain in the forward speed with just 15 6 extra power consumption the plots show clearly that the desired increase in higher speeds by increasing the amplitude of the base excitation is strongly dependent on the aspect ratio 4 conclusions we evaluated a novel hybrid excitation of tail mechanism for a robotic fish with a flexible tail made of ionic polymer metal composite ipmc and subjected to a base excitation which results in transverse bending we developed a model that accounts for the underwater dynamics of an ipmc beam under base excitation referred to as a hybrid excitation the lighthill s theory of elongated bodies was used to estimate the forward speed and associated power for different tail dimensions and actuation configurations the simulation results were validated against previously published experimental data it was shown that the incorporation of a base excitation enables a noticeable increase the forward speed of the robotic fish while consuming a relatively small additional power furthermore shortening the tail under hybrid excitation while keeping its total area constant over the specific range considered in this study was also found beneficial in terms of generating higher forward speeds deploying a hybrid tail with a length of 23 mm and an aspect ratio of 1 53 under a base excitation amplitude of 0 5 mm resulted in a 158 increase in the forward speed while requiring only 15 6 extra power when compared to an ipmc tail depending on the aspect ratio increasing the amplitude of the base excitation could lead to a significant increase in the forward speed the design of the main body of the robotic fish in terms of shape and material selection mass distribution would certainly affect the propulsive behavior as such the reported percentages may vary with the geometric profile of the ipmc beam and the body of the robotic fish regardless the potential improvement in the hydrodynamic performance of an ipmc actuated tail due to the incorporation of base excitation with mere amount of added power remain valid credit authorship contribution

20608,we investigate the potential of a novel hybrid excitation of the tail for a robotic fish the tail consists of an ionic polymer metal composite ipmc beam excited at its base a model of the beam dynamics under base excitation ipmc actuation mechanism and hydrodynamic forces is derived lighthill s theory of elongated bodies is used to estimate the forward speed from the tail s oscillations and associated power for different tail dimensions and actuation configurations the model of the robotic fish propelled by only an ipmc actuator is validated using previously reported experimental frequency responses our results show that incorporating a small amplitude base excitation has the potential to significantly improve the forward speed of the robotic fish over a broader range of frequency excitations while consuming minimal additional power the results also show that this improvement is very significant at specific aspect ratios keywords robotic fish propulsion mechanism ipmc beam base excitation swimming performance 1 introduction advances in bio robotics research and smart materials present new opportunities for developing bio inspired autonomous underwater vehicles auvs salazar et al 2018 2019 these vehicles can serve in marine environment exploration search and rescue military surveillance and border patrol enabling desired locomotion performance in terms of speed endurance and maneuverability could only be achieved through optimized performance of available propulsion actuation mechanisms such mechanisms rely mostly on assemblies of multiple rigid segments linked in series and driven by motors to mimic undulatory and oscillatory motions of aquatic animals the complexity and power requirements associated with the use of such mechanisms could limit the capability of the auv to achieve performance goals for specific underwater missions for instance a robotic fish with a pair of pectoral fins actuated by servomotors via two pairs of wires was presented by zhong and li zhong et al 2013 revealed significant swimming capabilities still servo motors are not attractive for small sized robots due to their noise and relatively high power consumption in contrast and especially for small scale sized robots smart materials actuators such as piezoelectric cen and erturk 2013 shape memory alloy actuators wang et al 2010 and electroactive polymer actuators eap shahinpoor 1992 present attractive options for the actuation of the robotic fish smart material actuators have higher energy conversion efficiency simpler mechanisms to maneuver at low speeds or in tight quarters ye et al 2007a quieter operation and convenient miniaturization guo et al 2003 and requires much less power which makes them suitable for building miniature robots cen and erturk 2013 developed a piezoelectric robotic fish using macro fiber composite mfc bimorphs the piezoelectric material actuators were stimulated by low voltage inputs and were attached to a cantilever beam that was connected to a rigid body that housed all batteries and electrical components the robotic fish showed high swimming performance for underwater robots ionic polymer metal composites ipmc a class of the eap have shown promise for use in actuation shahinpoor and kim 2001 2004 kim et al 2005a due to their hydrophilic nature biocompatibility and ability to produce large bending motions under low voltage guo et al 2003 bar cohen 2004 ipmc have been studied extensively in the last two decades oguro et al 1992 kim and shahinpoor 2001 kim and tadokoro 2010 they are also referred to as artificial muscles due to their similarity to human muscles their main advantages include low density and flexibility silent operation lower power consumption and outstanding dynamic response at low voltages at the microscale the ipmc sample typically consists of a thin ion exchange membrane such as nafion and a noble metal as the electrodes chemically plated on both surfaces the bending motions of the ipmc occur due to this transport of molecules within the membrane and associated electrostatic interactions and hence the actuation effect chen and tan 2008 a deforming ipmc generates an electric current inversely the ipmc would deform when a voltage is applied across its thickness when supplied with the same amount of power ipmc actuated robotic fish have been found to swim a much greater distance than a motor actuated counterpart ye et al 2007b owing to the aforementioned distinctive features and given the absence of vibration causing components such as gears motors shafts etc ipmc are considered as attractive actuators for biomimetic robots one of the pioneering designs of an ipmc based underwater swimmer propeller is presented by shahinpoor 1992 another example is presented by mojarrad and shahinpoor 1996 the system propelled by a single ipmc was designed and tested on a ship like swimmer the results revealed that the speed of propulsion is proportional to the frequency and amplitude of undulation consequently a single vibrating ipmc was designed and experimentally tested in kim et al 2005b as an actuation mechanism for an undulatory tadpole swimmer the experimental results showed that wireless undulatory robots actuated by ipmc can accurately control the steering and swimming speed of the proposed microrobot for further investigation a pair of ipmc strips were used for actuating an underwater swimmer in guo et al 2000 apart from experimentation kim et al 2006 proposed a theoretical model of the ipmc actuator dynamic characteristics which can be used for single or multi segment ipmc actuator that operates in water this model conveniently accommodates the relaxation behavior of ipmcs and finite element approaches with a similar goal a modeling framework for motion of the ipmc based biomimetic underwater vehicles was developed by aureli et al 2010 by combining force and vibration measurements with reduced order modeling based on modal analysis the model simulated the aerodynamic loads generated by the vibrating ipmc including thrust lift and moment guo et al 2003 designed a robotic fish with ipmcs that produced undulatory motion they presented experimental results on the effect of the beating frequency on the propulsion efficiency and speed the swimming speed of the robot was controlled by the amplitude and frequency of the input voltage ray fish were investigated by tagaki et al takagi et al 2006 and anton et al 2004 the rajiform swimming which is the propulsion mode of a ray fish was developed using an ipmc propulsor in takagi et al 2006 the robot consisted of a plastic body 16 ipmcs amplifier a battery and a microcontroller to emulate rajiform mode of swimming and utilize ipmc as a rib actuator likewise anton et al 2004 proposed a ray like underwater robot with a buoyant body and two pectoral fins each actuated by two ipmc samples and reported up to 9 mm s propulsion speed however due to low propulsion efficiency and high power consumption their robot did not achieve free swimming capabilities another bioinspired species namely a snake like swimming robot with ipmcs as actuators was designed and experimentally analyzed in yamakita et al 2005 the study demonstrated a smooth swimming motion and exploited the doping effect using the ipmc actuator along the line of different bioinspired robots lauder et al 2011 experimentally derived flexural rigidities for bluegill fin rays moreover they designed and studied the active muscular control of flexibility and curvature of the fish body in propulsion they discussed the significance of incorporating ipmcs as actuators to generate undulatory patterns along the body tan et al tan et al 2006 presented an autonomous and sensor equipped untethered water robot for the control of water quality in lakes and ponds they demonstrated the usefulness of ipmc to operate underwater vehicles in different aqueous environments chen et al chen and tan 2008 chen et al 2010 developed a mathematical model for the control of the robotic fish estimates of the forward speed generated by the oscillating ipmc were obtained by combining the physics based ipmc governing equations and the classical lighthill s slender body theory lighthill 1971 moreover lighthill s theory was extended to predict the power consumption of the robotic fish shen et al 2013 given the operation underwater the hydrodynamics of an ipmc beam was investigated using digital particle image velocimetry dpiv and computational fluid dynamics abdelnour et al 2009 the thrust measurements showed high correlation to the vortex shedding mechanism their analysis revealed that the produced thrust can be approximated by a quadratic function of the reynolds number increasing the oscillation frequency of the actuating ipmc beam was observed to improve the thrust production on the other hand this resulted in a simultaneous increase in the lateral force and reaction moment that produced undesirable pitching and yawing motions that degraded the propulsion performance several studies focused on the development of reliable models that capture the intrinsic actuation physics of ipmc and validate the speed model experimentally along with finding geometrical ways to improve the performance speed of the robotic fish chen et al 2010 proposed a physics based model of a biomimetic robotic fish propelled by an ipmc actuator to increase the speed of the robotic fish and operate at lower frequencies a plastic caudal passive fin was designed and attached to the ipmc beam by combining theory and experiments they provided a method to optimize the design of the physical properties and geometric dimensions of the robotic fish considering the merits and shortcomings of aforementioned actuation methods to enhance the performance of robotic fish we propose a hybrid mechanism to excite the tail that combines ipmc actuation and base excitation recognizing the advantages of using ipmc in developing robot fish we investigate the performance of a bio inspired propulsion mechanism based on using a miniature ipmc beam subject to base excitation to realistically imitate biological features and abilities of the flexible tails of a fish the goal is to exploit the induced bending of the beam to generate hydrodynamic loads as per desired swimming performance in terms of thrust generation and forward motion to gain physical insights into the proposed propulsion mechanism we develop and validate a mathematical model that accounts for the ipmc physics underwater beam dynamics and base excitation we show the potential of the hybrid excitation of the tail to significantly increase the forward speed while spending minimal additional power the numerical study reveals that the robotic fish gains an 82 5 increase in its forward speed with a mere 9 3 increase in its power consumption furthermore the proposed mechanism is expected to have less noise and space requirements in comparison to bulky articulated segments actuated via servomotors the paper is organized as follows we first describe the design and the mathematical model of the hybrid tail then we proceed with the numerical implementation of the governing equations and model validation in section 3 we present simulation results and quantify the advantages of the proposed propulsion mechanism the last section summarizes the main findings 2 mathematical model of hybrid excitation of tail 2 1 hybrid excitation mechanism the robotic fish under consideration is composed of two main parts a rigid body and a flexible ipmc tail that can also be forced at its base the base excitation is produced and controlled using piezoelectric layers with an applied voltage erturk and inman 2008 erturk and inman for specific excitation amplitudes and frequencies the resulting motion of the flexible tail supports generating thrust resulting in forward motion of the robotic fish the excitation activates the bending mode only to avoid degradation in propulsion performance by torsional deflections 2 2 underwater dynamics of an ipmc beam under base excitation a schematic of the hybrid excitation of tail defined by its length l width b and thickness h excitation voltage at the base v b t and expected transverse deflection w x t under hydrodynamic loading is presented in fig 1 a the ipmc based actuation mechanism is illustrated in fig 1 b an ipmc strip includes anode and cathode layers when applying a voltage between these layers the cations are shifted to the cathode side while the anions are fixed on the carbon polymer chain this causes a stretching on the cathode side and a subsequent compression on the anode side and results in a bending motion following the euler bernoulli beam assumptions clough and penzien 1993 and accounting for the hydrodynamic interactions and actuation mechanisms we formulate the model and derive the governing equations of the tail under hybrid excitation the equation of motion governing the transverse deflection of the ipmc beam is given by 1 e i w x x x x c w μ m w f x t subject to the two

hydrodynamic function γ 1 for a harmonic base excitation the inertial force in the time domain is expressed as 10 f b a s e t μ v ω 2 z 0 sin ω t where z 0 and ω are the amplitude and frequency of the base excitation substituting the laplace transform of equation 10 into equation 5 yields 11 e i w x s x x x x c v s w x s μ v s 2 w x s f i p m c x s μ v z 0 ω 3 s 2 ω 2 equation 11 is solved next by implementing modal analysis and expressing the transverse deflection w x s as the sum 12 w x s i 1 m q i s φ i x of m modes where q i s is the generalized coordinate and φ i x is the i th mode shape

sample typically consists of a thin ion exchange membrane chemically plated on both surfaces with noble metals as electrodes positive hydrogen ions in the membrane are replaced by other cations such as n a and l i 2 during an ion exchange process these cations can move freely in the membrane when the ipmc is hydrated when a voltage is applied across the ipmc strip from the anode to the cathode cations are shifted to the cathode side along with the water molecules which creates differential swelling across the polymer thickness as a result the ipmc will bend to the anode side chen and tan 2008 the actuation induced bending moment m i p m c z s at a point x resulting from the actuation voltage v s is given by chen and tan 2008 chen et al 2010 23 m i p m c x s α 0 w k k e γ s tanh γ s s

forward speed of the robotic fish generated by the flexible base actuated tail is estimated using lighthill s theory lighthill 1971 which is applicable when the cross sectional area of the fish body changes slowly across its length i e the fish has an elongated body for specific oscillating periodic bending of the tail the robotic fish is expected to achieve a steady state forward speed balancing the mean thrust and drag forces the steady state forward speed is related to the lateral velocity and slope of the trailing edge and is given by chen et al 2010 34 u m d w x t t 2 c d ρ w s m d w x t x 2 x l where the overbar denotes the mean value defined as the average over one period of oscillation m d ρ w π 4 b 2 is the added mass density c d is the drag coefficient and s is the wetted surface

model of the tail under hybrid excitation using a combination of ipmc actuation and base excitation will be first validated using previously published experimental data then the model will be used to investigate the potential of different configurations of the proposed hybrid excitation tail mechanism for enhancing the capability of the robotic fish in terms of forward speed and power consumption 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation to validate the model we compare predicted frequency responses of an ipmc beam in air and water with previous experimental results as reported by brunetto et al 2008 the experimental frequency response in brunetto et al 2008 was obtained by applying a swept voltage stimulus on the ipmc actuator immersed in fluid air and water and recording the produced deformation the experimental set up comprised a function generator that controls the input signal actuating voltage on the ipmc actuator and a distance laser sensor interfaced to a computer via a daq system for measuring the tip deflection the dimensions and material properties of the beam are presented in table 1 the applied voltage to actuate the ipmc beam is set equal to 3 2 v as shown in fig 3 the agreement level between the numerical and experimental results demonstrates the model s accuracy in predicting the dynamic response of the ipmc beam it is noted also that for the same excitation voltage the response amplitude in water is reduced to 83 75 of its value in air furthermore the natural frequency decreases from 9 hz to 2 89 hz this decrease in amplitude and frequency is due to the increased added mass and damping in water a relatively higher response in water is also noted at the second natural frequency near 19 6 hz as shown in fig 3 b properties of the beam considered for subsequent analysis of generated thrust and power requirements are the same as the ones investigated by chen et al 2010 and shown in table 2 the baseline ipmc tail considered in the present study has an aspect ratio a r l b of 1 53 for the assessment of the relative importance of base and ipmc excitations we first estimate the propulsion without base excitation and validate the results with experimental findings of chen et al 2010 in the analysis the transfer function h 1 l s is expressed using the first three mode shapes to investigate gains from operating at the higher vibration modes i e we let 40 h 1 l s i 1 m 3 φ i l h f i q i s where each element is defined in the mathematical model as discussed above we note that three modes were observed to achieve convergent solutions the higher modes are incorporated to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of the tail when excited at higher frequencies as will be discussed below the bode magnitude plot which shows the variations of the magnitude of h 1 j ω with the excitation frequency ω 2 π f is displayed in fig 4 the simulation results are in good agreement with their experimental counterparts the slight quantitative discrepancy is mostly associated with the estimation of the added mass and added damping obtained from sader s hydrodynamic model sader 1998 which is derived for an infinitely long beam the cut off frequency was determined experimentally to be 8 6 hz chen et al 2010 while the predicted ipmc beam s first natural frequency when operating in water is 8 73 hz the other peaks of the bode magnitude plot are consistent with the second and third natural frequencies estimated to be near 54 8 hz and 153 2 hz respectively fig 5 shows the variations in the forward speed with the excitation frequency of the ipmc actuator without base excitation the frequency range 0200 hz is selected to cover the first three natural modes clearly the forward speed with values near 2 mm s achieved by excitation at frequencies near those of the higher modes are significantly lower than the speed of 16 25 mm s attained by exciting the beam at the frequency of its primary mode these results reveal that operating at higher vibration modes is not beneficial in terms of enhancing the cruising speed of the robotic fish that is the main reason for proposing a hybrid excitation mechanism of the tail that combines the ipmc actuation with base excitation while operating in the vicinity of the first natural frequency to enhance the cruising speed the effects of incorporating the base excitation on the performance of the robotic fish is investigated next our objective is to enhance the performance of the robotic fish without altering the geometrical configuration of the tail the implementation of the robotic fish requires the integration of electrical components for actuation and control purposes this motivated us to investigate the effectiveness of exciting the base of the ipmc with a piezoelectric transducer that can be housed in the main body of the robotic fish without increasing the size of the robotic fish we consider the hybrid excitation of tail mechanism for the case of a base excitation amplitude of 0 25 mm and the same frequency as that of the ipmc actuator the actuation voltage at the base is set equal to 3 3 v fig 6 displays the variations of the forward speed with the excitation frequency for the ipmc and hybrid tail hereafter we refer to the case of the tail subjected to both ipmc actuation and base excitation as the hybrid excitation of tail the plots in fig 6 show that the base excitation significantly increases the forward speed from 16 25 mm s to 29 2 mm s when setting the excitation frequency equal to the first natural frequency furthermore the curve of the tail under hybrid excitation shows a wider frequency bandwidth that is the forward speed remains high over a broader frequency range for instance at 20 hz the tail under hybrid excitation produces a forward speed of 12 14 mm s which is one order of magnitude larger than the achieved speed of 1 12 mm s by only using the ipmc excitation the simulated results show that significant enhancement in terms of forward speed can be attained with a small amplitude base excitation z 0 0 25 mm to put this enhancement in perspective we compare it with the enhancement level in the forward speed attained by attaching a passive fin to the ipmc beam chen et al 2010 chen et al 2010 conducted free swimming tests of a robotic fish equipped with an ipmc actuated tail attached to a passive fin their results for the ipmc actuated tail with a passive fin presented in the insert in fig 6 show that when adding the passive fin the frequency leading to maximum forward speed generation decreased from 8 6 hz to about 1 hz and increased the forward speed from 16 mm s to 21 mm s i e by about 31 25 our results show that adding a base excitation with an amplitude of 0 25 mm led to an increase of 82 5 in the forward speed this increase in the speed due to base excitation is based fundamentally on the ratio of the maximum response magnitude to the input displacement magnitude of the piezoelectric transducers referred to as the displacement transmissibility the speed attains its highest jump when the excitation frequency is near the first natural frequency operation at resonance which is expected for support motion systems as discussed by inman 2014 moreover another interpretation of the enhancement in the forward speed using base excitation is due to an increase in the power delivered to the entire system the additional required power is compensated by a much higher increase in the forward speed as will be explained next one concern is the additional required power for the base excitation as such we use equations 37 and 40 to compute the power requirements for actuating the hybrid and ipmc tails we show in fig 7 the variations of the power of the hybrid and ipmc tails with the excitation frequency the power required for ipmc actuation shows a sharp increase and experiences saturation when reaching about 4 hz these results are consistent with those reported in shen et al 2013 the power associated with the tail under hybrid excitation shows an increasing trend when shifting the excitation frequency to higher values the contribution of the base excitation to the total power at low frequencies is minimal the plots in fig 7 show that one needs to spend 9 3 extra power due to base excitation to operate the hybrid tail at the first natural frequency which in turn results in a substantial increase in the forward speed of the robotic fish 82 5 increase next we investigate the impact of the tail geometry represented by the aspect ratio on the performance of the ipmc and hybrid tails in the presented results the ratio is changed by varying the length while maintaining a constant surface area length width and same thickness as per the baseline case reported in table 2 this means that the mass of the beam remains unchanged fig 8 a shows the variations in the forward speed of the robotic fish with the excitation frequency for different aspect ratios of the ipmc dashed line and hybrid tails solid line the plots show that the performance of the ipmc tail without base excitation in terms of maximum attained speed when excited near its natural frequency is not much impacted by changing the aspect ratio between 2 6 and 1 16 in contrast reducing the aspect ratio of the tail from 2 6 to 1 16 and subjecting it to hybrid excitation results in a significant increase in the maximum forward speed from 15 mm s to 51 6 mm s particularly the improvement in the performance of the robotic fish when incorporating the base excitation is more pronounced for smaller aspect ratios we note that a similar analysis was conducted on the ipmc beam having an aspect ratio of 7 5 as tested by brunotto et al brunetto et al 2008 the beam specifications are given in table 1 the improvement due to base excitation is observed to be minimal for this high aspect ratio beam especially near resonance however decreasing the aspect ratio of the beam is found to significantly amplify the impact of base excitation on the performance of the tail in terms of forward speed generation for instance setting the aspect ratio to 1 875 is found to produce an 81 5 increase in the forward speed as such one needs a proper selection of the tail s aspect ratio to maximize the hydrodynamic performance enhancement from the base excitation fig 8 b shows the variations in the power consumption with the aspect ratio when related to the variations in the forward speed it is noted that the significant increase in forward speed is attained with a small increase in power consumption while the tail with aspect ratio 2 6 under hybrid excitation at 4 2 hz consumes 0 92 w to attain a speed of 15 mm s the tail having a lower aspect ratio of 1 16 consumes slightly larger level of 0 99 w at 51 5 hz to achieve a much higher speed of 51 6 mm s to gain further insight on the performance of the hybrid excitation of tail mechanism we generate the surface plots of fig 9 which show the variations of the maximum forward speed and consumed power with the aspect ratio of the tail ranging between 1 16 and 4 63 and the amplitude of the base excitation the results are obtained for both ipmc and hybrid tails reducing the aspect ratio and increasing the amplitude of the base excitation both result in higher forward speed of particular interest is that higher speeds are attained with less power consumption in the case of the hybrid excitation of tail fig 9 c shows that the power associated with the ipmc actuation reaches a maximum of 0 89 w for a tail aspect ratio of 2 6 this power decreases to 0 84 w when the aspect ratio is decreased to 1 16 and to 0 84 w when the aspect ratio is increased to 4 63 for the ipmc tail slightly less power is required to achieve higher forward speed from 12 m s to 18 m s in the range of considered aspect ratios as for the hybrid excitation of tail the total power displayed in fig 9 d shows that a forward speed of 150 m s which is one order of magnitude larger than the highest speed achieved by the ipmc tail requires a total power of 1 4 w for a base excitation amplitude of 1 mm a broader evaluation of the required power maximize the forward speed for different aspect ratios is obtained from the percentage variations in the maximum forward speed and consumed power as respectively shown in fig 10 a and 10 b the plots show that increasing the forward speed and levels of consumed power can be controlled through the selection of the geometry of the propelled tail and the base excitation for instance selecting an ipmc beam with an aspect ratio ar 1 53 l 23 mm while applying a voltage of 3 3 v similar to the one studied by chen et al 2010 and adding a synchronized excitation at the natural frequency of the beam in water with an amplitude of 0 5 mm produces 158 gain in the forward speed with just 15 6 extra power consumption the plots show clearly that the desired increase in higher speeds by increasing the amplitude of the base excitation is strongly dependent on the aspect ratio 4 conclusions we evaluated a novel hybrid excitation of tail mechanism for a robotic fish with a flexible tail made of ionic polymer metal composite ipmc and subjected to a base excitation which results in transverse bending we developed a model that accounts for the underwater dynamics of an ipmc beam under base excitation referred to as a hybrid excitation the lighthill s theory of elongated bodies was used to estimate the forward speed and associated power for different tail dimensions and actuation configurations the simulation results were validated against previously published experimental data it was shown that the incorporation of a base excitation enables a noticeable increase the forward speed of the robotic fish while consuming a relatively small additional power furthermore shortening the tail under hybrid excitation while keeping its total area constant over the specific range considered in this study was also found beneficial in terms of generating higher forward speeds deploying a hybrid tail with a length of 23 mm and an aspect ratio of 1 53 under a base excitation amplitude of 0 5 mm resulted in a 158 increase in the forward speed while requiring only 15 6 extra power when compared to an ipmc tail depending on the aspect ratio increasing the amplitude of the base excitation could lead to a significant increase in the forward speed the design of the main body of the robotic fish in terms of shape and material selection mass distribution would certainly affect the propulsive behavior as such the reported percentages may vary with the geometric profile of the ipmc beam and the body of the robotic fish regardless the potential improvement in the hydrodynamic performance of an ipmc actuated tail due to the incorporation of base excitation with mere amount of added power remain valid credit authorship contribution

20609,the research came from the project for 400 foot jack up offshore platform s adaptation to environment the empirical value of load coefficient is often selected by each classification society and the influence of other complex factors on hydrodynamic characteristics is ignored which may make the result too conservative therefore this paper took the jack up offshore platform truss pile leg as research object and the model experiments of single pile leg and three pile legs were conducted respectively and the hydrodynamic coefficient under experimental conditions were studied based on the single legged the effects of three legged model under different working conditions were quantitatively analyzed by defining the force component coefficient and the total force coefficients of group piles this research may provide data support for structural optimization design and strength check analysis of jack up offshore platform truss legs which plays an important role in the fatigue detection and life evaluation of offshore platform keywords jack up offshore platform wave load current load truss type leg hydrodynamic experiments hydrodynamic coefficients pile group effect 1 introduction with the increasing demand for resources and the shortage of the petroleum resources the ocean has become the main battlefield for the exploration and development the jack up offshore platforms with its strong locating capability and high operational stability has occupied the main force status in the exploration and development of the ocean petroleum resources however the working environment of the platform is complicated and changeable and it is often affected by the environmental loads such as currents waves and wind in which the wave current loads are the most important environmental loads of the platform the accurate calculation of wave current loads has great impact on the cost safety and life of offshore platform however the empirical value of hydrodynamic coefficient is usually selected in the calculation process of wave and current load of offshore platforms by classification societies and the influence of complex combined factors is ignored the method is simple and easy to use but the design load of the platform is relatively conservative resulting in the increase of consumables material costs and manufacturing costs then the platform becomes large and heavy increasing the risk of seabed deformation and increasing the difficulty of optimizing the structure of the platform therefore it is of great theoretical significance and engineering application value to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of truss pile legs of jack up offshore platform to improve these conditions in order to determine the value of hydrodynamic coefficients under different loading conditions scholars have carried out lots of research the study of hydrodynamic coefficient started from the wave force of single pile keulegan and carpenter 1958 are pioneers in this field through experiments they analyzed the wave forces on cylinders and spheres affected by standing waves zdravkovich et al 1989 investigated the hydrodynamic load of the finite length cylinder under stable flow nakamura et al 1992 studied the influence of three dimensional hydrodynamic force by conducting the forced impact experiment sabuncu and calisal 1981 studied the wave current load issue of a single cylinder and the hydrodynamic coefficient was calculated bhatta and rahman 2003 bhatta 2011 proposed a method for calculating the velocity and wave load of a cylinder in finite depth water and gave corresponding analytical expressions sarpkaya and storm 1985 found that pure wave results and pure flow results were not applicable to the coexistence of wave and flow through experiments generally speaking the drag force coefficient was smaller than the pure wave value while the inertia force coefficient was larger than the pure wave value within the value of 8 12 of kc number dixon et al 1979 conducted several groups of experiments to change the submerged depth wave wavelength and other parameters and obtained the vertical wave force of partially submerged fixed pile haojie ren et al 2019 investigated the hydrodynamic force of partially submerged fixed piles through experiment with reynolds number ranging from 5 104 to 9 105 and found that the horizontal drag coefficient was random distribution chakrabarti et al 1979 measured the wave loads of two three and five piles arranged in parallel the pile core distance from 4 to 10 times of pile diameter and studied the relationship between the hydrodynamic coefficient of pile group and the kc number and the relative pile spacing g mindao et al 1987 studied the wave force of three cylinders arranged in parallel and in series they thought that the spacing between cylinders and pile s size were significant factors to affect wave forces and the spacing were also normalized u sparboom et al 2007 studied the influence of regular wave and irregular wave on cylinder group the configurations of two cylinders were 8 ways and the configurations of three cylinders were 6 ways they proposed a formula to evaluate the effect of neighboring cylinders of the wave load on a single cylinder on the basis of previous studies hildebrandt et al 2009 observed how the vortex shedding in different configurations to influence wave load on piles and studied the relation between cd cm and the pile spacing liu et al 2017 conducted the numerical simulation of two vertical cylinders in waves showing that the positive hydrodynamic force of the upstream cylinder was greater than that of the single cylinder deng et al 2019 used the two dimensional numerical model to simulate free surface waves pass two vertically cylinders the simulation results showed that the distance between the cylinders had a great influence on the wave force of the rear cylinder and it had a significant influence on the former only when the distance was very small haritos 1995 investigated the wave loads on single pile double pile in series parallel inclined and the inside one of four piles bonakdar and oumeraci 2012 of brunswick university of technology have been engaged in the research of pile group effect for many years scale and model effects were examined by comparing the results of small and large scale laboratory tests by bonakdar l and oumeraci h 2014 el safti et al 2014 developed a hybrid 2d 3d cfd model system for the simulation of 3d wave loads on structures in the near field and the developed model system would be helpful to extend the testing conditions of the wave loads on pile groups bonakdar et al 2016 carried out the experiment of small scale pile in different depth of regular wave and gave the formulae for the prediction of wave induced forces on pile groups the relationships between single cylinder and group of cylinders with different parameters including pile position pile distance and number of piles had investigated by bonakdar and oumeraci h 2015a bonakdar et al 2015 thought pile group effect is a multivariate function of both kc number and structural parameters and studied the law between them in his experiment the distance between pile and wave flume s wall was eight times the diameter of pile which could avoid the influence of sidewall and he pointed out that it is necessary to study the influence of wave direction 0 90 on pile group most scholars study the hydrodynamic characteristics of cylindrical piles through model experiments but there is relatively few research on the truss type legs as the stress object therefore this paper took the truss type legs of jack up offshore platforms as the research object took the mutual position of the platform legs as the arrangement mode and then studied the hydrodynamic coefficient of the three legged model under experimental conditions based on the hydrodynamic experiment of single legged model the pile group effect of three legged model under wave and current loads was quantitatively analyzed by defining the coefficient of pile group this study provides data support for the calculation of wave and current loads of jack up offshore platform which has important reference value 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 the calculation of wave current loads the wave and current loads of small scale component are always calculated by morison equation small scale refers to that the ratio of feature length d to wavelength l of components is less than 0 2 and truss structure belongs to small scale components the wave current loads acting on unit length is 1 f 1 2 ρ c d a u x u x ρ c m v u x the wave current loads in the equation contains two parts first one is drag force and the second is inertial force c d is the drag force coefficient c m is the inertial force coefficient ρ is the fluid density μ x represents the relative velocity vector in a direction perpendicular to the axial direction of cylinders μ x represents the acceleration vector of the water particle in the direction perpendicular to the axial direction of cylinders a is the projected area of unit length component perpendicular to v is the drainage volume of a unit length component the wave load of the whole structure can be obtained by integrating the above formula from the bottom to the surface there are two key issues in the application of morrison equation the first one is the value of hydrodynamic coefficient as the hydrodynamic coefficient is affected by many factors the value of hydrodynamic coefficient is different under different loading conditions and the accurate value of hydrodynamic coefficient is usually obtained by model experiment the second one is the selection of wave theory in the process of wave motion the velocity and acceleration of water particles change at every moment which needs to be calculated according to wave theory however no specific wave theory can be suitable for any load condition and the calculation results obtained by selecting different wave theories are also different dimensionless reynolds number and kc number are the two most important factors affecting hydrodynamic coefficient as for truss structures we need to redefine the reynolds number and kc number reynolds number 2 re du max ν kc number 3 kc tu max d in this formula d is the diameter of the main chord in the truss type legs due to the complexity of the main chord section and the existence of rack structure the equivalent diameter of the main chord is taken here the calculation formula of the equivalent diameter is as follows d 4a x a represents the effective cross sectional area of the bar and x represents wetted perimeter the members on both sides of the joint are regarded as continuous variable section cylinders and their sections are respectively taken in the rack structure calculate the equivalent diameter of maximum cross sectional area through tooth point and minimum cross sectional area through tooth root respectively and take the average value of their results d 7 5 10 3 m umax represents the maximum horizontal velocity at the water particle on the still water surface v is the kinetic viscosity coefficient of the fluid and v 1 0067 10 6 m2 s t is the period of the wave 2 2 the explanation of pile group effect under the action of wave and current loads the force of single cylinder in the pile group is different from that when the pile exists alone due to the mutual influence of each cylinder and this pile group effect is affected by the number relative position and loading condition for the pile group composed of cylinders previously studied pile group effect is mainly reflected in jet effect shielding effect and suppression effect jet effect will occur when piles are placed side by side the jet effect occurs when piles are arranged side by side and the distance between piles shrinks to form a laval tube subsequently the flow velocity of the fluid becomes larger in the contraction section to form a jet flow increasing the resistance and inertia force of the pile when the piles are connected in series the front pile will produce shielding effect on the back pile the fluid separates around the front pile and forms a series of vortices in the wake area which makes the velocity of the water particle less than the velocity of the incoming flow and reduces the stress on the rear pile in the wake area at the same time the back pile will have an inhibitory effect on the front pile when the rear pile is in the wake area of the front pile the generation and development of vorticity of the front pile will be suppressed making the pressure difference between the front pile and the rear pile and the force on the front pile smaller each trussed pile leg of the jack up platform produces a group pile effect and a more complex effect is formed between the three pile legs the distance between pile legs has the following influence on the overall load of pile group firstly there are mutual influences between pile legs and other pile legs such as shielding effect and suppression effect the same is true of small components second the wave has a periodic law and there is a distance between the three pile legs so there is a phase difference in the wave load of each component it is difficult to obtain the significant rule of the whole load and the pile spacing in this study the pile group effect of the three legged model under different working conditions is quantitatively analyzed by defining the pile group component force coefficient and the total force coefficient of the pile group the component force coefficient of pile group k g is defined as 4 k g f g f among them the f g is the peak value of the wave and current loads for each truss type leg and the f is the peak value of the wave current loads for the single legged model under the same working condition the total force coefficient of pile group k gt is defined as 5 k g t f g t n f among them f gt is the peak value of the wave current loads for the total three legged model the f is the peak value of the wave current loads for the single legged model under the same working condition n is the number of truss type legs in here n 3 3 hydrodynamics experiment of pile leg model 3 1 experimental model the prototype of the experimental models is a 400 feet jack up offshore platform with an average wavelength of 374 7 m and an average period of 15 5 s in survival condition according to the equipment conditions in the laboratory and the specifications of model materials the scale ratio of the model was determined as λ 70 by taking geometric similarity and dynamic similarity mainly gravity similarity as similarity criteria according to the linear length scale of the model the time scale λ t λ 8 37 and the wavelength scale λ l λ 70 of this experiment were obtained according to the determined scale ratio five pitches of the truss type legs of jack up offshore platform were selected as the experimental object and one pitch was taken as the object the specific sizes of all members of model scale and full scale were shown in table 1 due to the small size of member in the truss structure after scaling the truss structure of the model employed solid rod with 304 stainless steel to ensure the strength of itself in the manufacture of the truss type leg model the section of the main chord was no longer simplified to a cylinder but a real oval shape the section of the main chord with rack structure is shown in fig 1 meanwhile the rack lifting device was also taken into account in this experiment after scaling the rack structure the tooth pitch was 4 35 mm the module was 1 38 mm and the width was 2 35 mm the rack was symmetrically pasted on the two sides of the main chord by waterproof double sided adhesive tape the partial rack structure is shown in fig 2 the height of the truss was 0 625 m the three main chords were extended upwards for 0 20 m to ensure sufficient space of wave impact and the top of chords were connected by a small triangular plates the dynamometric bar ϕ25 mm 2 5 mm fixed on the small triangle plate with special glue was 0 30 m and made of hard pvc two measuring points were located 0 2 m apart on the dynamometric bar for the three leg model the distance between each two legs was 0 786 m and the whole model was connected by an equilateral triangle plate with side length of 0 99 m and thickness of 0 015 m the experimental model of single leg and three legs are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 3 2 experimental testing platform the tests were performed in a wave current experimental flume located at the navigation hydrodynamic laboratory shandong jiaotong university the length of experimental flume is 64 m width is 1 4 m and working depth is 0 4 1 2 m the side of the experimental flume is equipped with low inertia servomotor push plate wave generator and automatic control system of flow generator the experiment was divided into two parts steady flow and regular wave the principle of the flume is to simulate the steady flow of water in the circulation channel of more than 50 m through the high power pump in wave experiments waves are generated by push plate wave generator in addition the effect of the load inflowing angle was also considered experimental parameters of the volume are shown in table 2 the load inflowing angles on the model and the leg number are shown in fig 5 in the experiment when the fluid flows at a constant speed perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder the vortex is released to the rear of the cylinder at a certain frequency in order to avoid the phenomenon of resonance modal analysis was carried out on the experimental model by abaqus software the first 10 modes of the model are extracted and their natural frequencies are obtained as shown in table 3 according to the period of the wave the frequency of the wave can be obtained when the period is 1 s 1 5 s and 2 s the frequency is 1 hz 0 667 hz 0 5 hz correspondingly the release frequency of the vortex can be calculated as follows 6 f s v n d among them s is strouhal number and the value is 0 2 according to reynolds number in the experiment v n is the current velocity perpendicular to the component axis d is the diameter of the member where the equivalent diameter of the main chord is taken the release frequency of vortices are shown in table 4 it can be seen from these frequencies that the wave frequency is less than the natural frequency of the model and the model will not resonate under wave loading under the action of current load when the velocity is 0 2 m s it is very close to the natural frequency of the model so the natural frequency of the model can be changed by adding mass block to avoid resonance in the experiment a multi sensor fusion system including strain gauge wave height sensor six dimensional force sensor data acquisition unit vibration acceleration sensor and velocity sensor was established the experimental instruments and types are shown in table 5 the strain gauge was used to collect strain signal of the force measuring rod the six dimensional force sensor was used to collect signal of load on model the data acquisition unit was connected with strain gauge for collecting transmitting storing displaying and analyzing strain data of force measuring rod the schematic diagram of the single legged and three legged model experiment test platform were shown in fig 6 in order to avoid the contingency of experimental data each group of experiments was repeated three times and then the average value was taken as the experimental value the multi sensor fusion system can collect all experimental data synchronously and ensure the synchronization of experimental data the whole experimental device was connected with a frock frame across the water tank which was 25 m away from the wave generator to ensure sufficient distance for wave generation and development the overall layout of the experimental system is shown in fig 7 the distance between model edge and the flume s wall was 0 25 m and the distance between model ends and tank bottom was 0 2 m which were much larger than the diameter of pile such a spacing had been shown to avoid the influence of sidewall and seabed kiu et al 2011 the experiment of the three legged model in flume are shown in fig 8 3 3 experimental data the wave current and load of the single leg model was all obtained through the strain data transformation of the dynamometric bar except that the wave current load of the whole three legged model was directly acquired by the six dimensional force sensor when the model is subjected to wave and current load the dynamometric bar above the model will be deformed the strain signal of dynamometric bar under the action of wave and current load is shown in fig 9 from fig 9 it can be seen that the strain signals at the two measuring points on the dynamometric bar had the same variation trend regardless of the current load or wave load after further transformation of the strain signal the wave current load received by the model can be obtained according to the calculation principle of beam section bending moment in material mechanics beer et al 2014 the transformation formula between strain data and load data is obtained 7 f δ m δ l e δ ε π b 3 32 1 b b 4 δ l among them e is the elastic modulus mpa of the material for the dynamometric bar and e 3900 mpa δ ε is the strain difference between two measuring points με b is the outside diameter of the dynamometric bar b 0 025 m b is the inside diameter of the dynamometric bar b 0 02 m δl is the distance difference between two measuring points on the dynamometric bar the variation curve of the strain difference between two measuring points on the dynamometric bar with time is shown in fig 10 as can be seen from fig 10 with the increase of the loading time the strain difference between the two measuring points gradually tends to be stable so the strain difference selects the average value of the strain difference after the loading is stable since the strain of the two measuring points under the action of wave load presents the alternating waveform the maximum value of the strain difference is selected 4 results and analysis 4 1 calculation of wave flow loads in the process of solving the hydrodynamic coefficient we need to get the calculated value of wave flow load of the experimental model under experimental conditions at present there is no systematic calculation formula for complex truss structures in this paper finite element software abaqus was used to create dynamic implicit analysis step to calculate the wave and current load of complex truss structures firstly a three dimensional finite element model of the experimental device was created as shown in fig 11 among them three legged model used the total dynamometric bar ϕ50 mm 2 5 mm of 600 mm to obtain the wave and current load of the three legged mode the model was assembled from beam elements with defined circular section the rack structure was to simulate the real rack structure by defining a rectangular beam section with length of 12 2 mm and width of 2 35 mm and establishing binding constraints with the main chord through tie element the rack structure is shown in fig 12 the material properties of each component of the experimental model are shown in table 6 as for the focus area on the force measuring bar the precision of the calculation results could be improved by using local mesh seed refinement set g 9 8 m s2 in the load module and comprehensively consider drag force inertia force and buoyancy the output section of bending moment was created at the location where the strain sensor fixed on the dynamometric bar and the wave load of model was obtained indirectly through the moment difference and distance difference of the two sections the output section of bending moment is shown in fig 13 take one working condition of the whole three legged model as an example and the inflowing angle is 0 v 0 5 m s h 0 2 m and t 2 s the time domain curves of section bending moment and moment difference of section 7 and section 8 are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 from figs 14 and 15 it can be found that the value fluctuates significantly within 20 30 s due to the rigid impact of the flow on the model as the loading time increases the bending moment of the two sections starts to show a stable change trend and the bending moment difference also tends to a stable change rule the experiment and simulation results of the whole three legged model were selected under the inflowing angle of 0 current and the comparison results are shown in fig 16 through the simulation and comparison of current conditions it is found that within the allowable error range the numerical model is in good agreement with the experimental model especially under the condition of small load the difference between the two will be smaller compared with the current load the wave load is smaller so it is reasonable to use this model to simulate the wave condition 4 2 hydrodynamic coefficient 4 2 1 current load in order to visually represent the change of current force with velocity under each inflowing angle a velocity current force curve was drawn the variation law of current force with flow velocity of the three legged model at various inflowing angles is shown in fig 17 it can be seen from fig 17 that with the increase of velocity the current force presents a growth trend of quadratic function when the velocity is small the current forces corresponding to each inflowing angle have little difference with the increase of the velocity the current forces start to have obvious differences whether it is a smooth model or a toothed model in terms of the overall trend the current force at each inflowing angle is from large to small 30 45 0 90 under the action of current the movement speed of water particle changes slowly with time generally current is regarded as stable flow and the force at this time is only drag force ignoring inertia force firstly the empirical value of drag force coefficient cd 1 was taken the current load of the model was calculated according to the synchronizing velocity value in the experiment and the towing force coefficients under various conditions can be obtained by comparing the measured current load with the calculated results during the experiment the relationship between drag force coefficient and reynolds number under all working conditions is shown in fig 18 as can be seen from fig 18 the drag force coefficients of inflowing angle increase with the increase of reynolds number and the increase trend gradually decreases the value range of the towing force coefficient is between 0 85 and 1 15 most of which are within the range of 0 9 1 1 for a smooth cylinder when re 105 it is in a subcritical region the boundary layer from stagnation point to separation point is laminar flow as the separation occurs before the maximum width of the cylinder the wide wake and low foundation pressure lead to a large resistance coefficient with the maximum value up to 1 2 4 2 2 the wave load since the design of model experiment meets the similarity of kc number but not the similarity of reynolds number the current load does not meet the similarity of force but the wave load of prototype and model has a multiple conversion relationship compared with current load wave load is relatively small so the relationship between wave load and inflowing angle is not obvious according to wave height water depth and periodic parameters in the experiment stokes fifth order wave was selected as wave theory to obtain the velocity and acceleration of water particle this research uses the trial and error method to solve the inertia force coefficient the core of which is to constantly change the value of the inertia force coefficient to make the calculated value of wave load equal to the experimental value based on the solution results the change curve of inertia force coefficient with kc number is obtained through data fitting as shown in fig 19 it can be found from the fitting curve in fig 19 that within the range of kc 20 the inertia force coefficient increases with the increase of kc number and the value range is between 1 and 2 5 as the kc number under experimental conditions is relatively large the inertia force coefficient varies in a large range it can be seen that when kc 20 cm 1 when kc 50 cm 1 7 when kc 70 cm 2 0 when kc 127 cm 2 5 which is consistent with the change law of inertia force coefficient with kc number obtained by sarpkaya in 1976 4 3 the pile group effect 4 3 1 force coefficient of pile group the variation curve of pile group force coefficients with reynolds number and kc number of no 1 pile leg under various angles are shown in fig 20 and fig 21 the stable value of the component force coefficient of pile no 1 under various inflowing angles is selected as the component force coefficient under this working condition the component force coefficients of pile group under various inflowing angles of pile no 1 are shown in table 7 as shown in figs 20 and 21 and table 6 the component force coefficient of pile group of no 1 pile leg under 0 is basically equal to 1 which indicates that the presence of no 2 leg and no 3 leg has no obvious influence on the force of no 1 leg and the pile group effect can be ignored under the angle of 30 the force component coefficient is stable at about 0 91 and there are two reasons for this there are two reasons for this locally the distribution of the three main chord in the leg of no 1 leg has changed when the incidence angle is 0 the distribution is parallel when the incidence angle is 30 there are two main chord distributed in series the former chord has a shielding effect on the latter chord and the latter chord has a suppression effect on the former so the overall load is reduced on the whole no 2 leg is located directly behind no 1 leg which affects the formation and development of vortex behind of no 1 pile thus the pressure difference between the front and back of no 1 leg decreases under 45 incident angle the force component coefficient of no 1 finally stabilizes at about 0 98 compared with the 30 incident angle the suppression effect of leg no 2 weakens at an incidence angle of 90 the leg no 1 and the leg no 2 and 3 are arranged side by side the presence of jet effect makes the velocity of clearance increase increasing the force on the no 1 leg the variation curve of pile group force coefficients with reynolds number and kc number of no 2 leg under various angles are shown in fig 22 and fig 23 the force coefficients of pile group under various load incidence angles of no 2 leg are shown in table 8 as seen in figs 22 and 23 and table 8 it can be found that the component force coefficients of no 2 leg under the 0 and 45 are stable around 1 slightly larger than 1 which shows that the influence of pile group effect is small at this time although there is interference of ahead legs no 2 leg is not affected by the wake zone of the former legs because of angle and hence it is not much different from the situation where no 2 leg exists alone for no 2 pile leg the effect of the 30 and 90 are same so the force component coefficients under the two angles almost no difference and the final stable value is about 0 97 because of the shielding of leg no 1 and no 3 the stress on leg no 2 is reduced the component force coefficients of group piles with reynolds number and kc number of no 3 pile leg under various inflowing angles are shown in fig 24 and fig 25 the force coefficients of pile group under various load incidence angles of no 3 leg are shown in table 9 observing figs 24 and 25 and table 8 at 0 incident angle due to the symmetrical distribution of no 2 leg and no 3 leg there is little difference in component forces both of which are stable around 1 under the angle of 30 leg no 3 and leg no 1 under the 90 are arranged in the same way therefore the force components of them are not much different and both are stable around 1 1 and the existence of jet effect makes the force on leg larger than the leg alone the component force coefficients of pile group under 45 is basically equal to 1 indicating that the pile group effect at this time can be ignored under the angle of 90 the no 2 leg is in the wake zone of leg no 3 suppressing the release of vortex therefore the component force coefficient at this time is less than 1 and finally stabilizes to 0 91 by observing experiment 30 and 90 working conditions are almost the same there are corresponding relationships between the legs so the experimental data can be verified by comparing the force coefficient these two conditions are shown in fig 26 take two sets of relationships as examples the conclusion of no 1 leg at 30 should be consistent with that of no 3 leg at 90 the kg of no 1 leg with kc number in fig 21 is basically the same as that of no 3 leg with kc number in fig 25 and no 2 leg should be consistent under two conditions the kg of pile leg no 2 with re at 30 is also close to that at 90 in fig 22 other corresponding relationships are basically the same indicating that the experimental data are reliable 4 3 2 pile group total force coefficient the variation curve of the total force coefficients of pile group with reynolds number of the three legged model under various angles are shown in fig 27 as seen from fig 27 when the reynolds number re 2000 the total force coefficients of pile group is relatively dispersed with the reynolds number increasing the total force coefficient starts to stabilize in addition to 30 the total force coefficient under other three angles will be stable about 0 95 therefore it can be concluded that the existence of pile group effect makes the overall load of the three legs structure smaller the variation curve of the total force coefficients of pile group with kc number at various angles is shown in fig 28 in fig 28 it can be seen from that the total force coefficient of pile group under various angles increases with the increase of kc number and the total force coefficient is between 0 6 and 1 with the reinforcement of wave condition the total force coefficient gradually approaches 1 the relationship between the value of total force coefficients and angles is not obvious so all data are fitted the fitting curve is shown in fig 29 compared with the variation range of the total coefficient with reynolds number the variation range of it with kc number is larger and it is mainly because of the phase difference between the wave load peak of the three piles and the wave load peak of each leg in order to visualize the effect of phase difference the time domain curve of strain difference about the whole structure and each leg under wave action is output as shown in fig 30 by observing a b c and d in fig 30 it can be clearly found that the wave load peak of the whole three legged model is out of sync with each leg in this experiment when using strain gauge to collect the load signal of each leg a six dimensional force sensor is also used to collect the total load signal of three legged model synchronously so as to avoid the phase difference problem of superimposing forces on each leg to calculate the total load therefore the wave load of the three legs is no longer the simple sum of the wave load of each component leg but the sum of the component forces is greater than the total force of three legs taking the 0 as an example the comparison between resultant force and the sum of each component under wave load is shown in fig 31 5 conclusion this paper conducted the experimental study on the hydrodynamic characteristics of three legs under wave flow loadings and some main conclusions were drawn in the followings 1 the model experiment was conducted under the conditions of low reynolds number and high kc number the drag force coefficient obtained by the instantaneous value method increases with increasing reynolds number and the incremental trend gradually slows down the experimental result show that the drag force coefficient is in the range of 0 9 1 1 the inertia force coefficient obtained by trial error method increases with the increase of kc number and the increase trend becomes slow gradually which is between 1 and 2 5 2 as for wave flow loads on three legged structure the influence of reynolds number kc number and the inflowing angle on pile group coefficient cannot be ignored by analyzing the variation rule of the component force coefficients of pile group in the three legs it is found that the pile group effect makes the force of each component leg different from the force of leg alone and the component force coefficients of pile group is between 0 9 and 1 1 the total force coefficient under the action of current is around the value of 0 95 because of the influence of phase difference the total force coefficient under the wave loadings is in a wide range which is from 0 6 to 1 3 for the design of platform leg the most significant issue is to analyze the leg with larger loads due to pile group effect according to the inflowing angle the above experimental conclusions are based on the independent action of regular wave and steady flow and the conclusion under the action of irregular wave and wave current coupling loading needs further experimental analysis in addition the scale ratio of the model in this experiment is relatively large and hence the experimental results are in the condition of low reynolds number and high kc number for the condition of the high reynolds number and low kc number it may need to decrease the scale ratio of the model or change the load conditions to conduct further experimental research the above conclusions are only applicable to the offshore platform project regrettably normalized research has not been conducted however it is of great reference significance for jack up platforms at other distances and the author believes that the total force coefficient and component force coefficient of platforms in this paper will be close to other conditions which is expected to be verified in the future credit authorship contribution statement yingchun xie conceptualization methodology investigation resources writing original draft

20609,the research came from the project for 400 foot jack up offshore platform s adaptation to environment the empirical value of load coefficient is often selected by each classification society and the influence of other complex factors on hydrodynamic characteristics is ignored which may make the result too conservative therefore this paper took the jack up offshore platform truss pile leg as research object and the model experiments of single pile leg and three pile legs were conducted respectively and the hydrodynamic coefficient under experimental conditions were studied based on the single legged the effects of three legged model under different working conditions were quantitatively analyzed by defining the force component coefficient and the total force coefficients of group piles this research may provide data support for structural optimization design and strength check analysis of jack up offshore platform truss legs which plays an important role in the fatigue detection and life evaluation of offshore platform keywords jack up offshore platform wave load current load truss type leg hydrodynamic experiments hydrodynamic coefficients pile group effect 1 introduction with the increasing demand for resources and the shortage of the petroleum resources the ocean has become the main battlefield for the exploration and development the jack up offshore platforms with its strong locating capability and high operational stability has occupied the main force status in the exploration and development of the ocean petroleum resources however the working environment of the platform is complicated and changeable and it is often affected by the environmental loads such as currents waves and wind in which the wave current loads are the most important environmental loads of the platform the accurate calculation of wave current loads has great impact on the cost safety and life of offshore platform however the empirical value of hydrodynamic coefficient is usually selected in the calculation process of wave and current load of offshore platforms by classification societies and the influence of complex combined factors is ignored the method is simple and easy to use but the design load of the platform is relatively conservative resulting in the increase of consumables material costs and manufacturing costs then the platform becomes large and heavy increasing the risk of seabed deformation and increasing the difficulty of optimizing the structure of the platform therefore it is of great theoretical significance and engineering application value to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of truss pile legs of jack up offshore platform to improve these conditions in order to determine the value of hydrodynamic coefficients under different loading conditions scholars have carried out lots of research the study of hydrodynamic coefficient started from the wave force of single pile keulegan and carpenter 1958 are pioneers in this field through experiments they analyzed the wave forces on cylinders and spheres affected by standing waves zdravkovich et al 1989 investigated the hydrodynamic load of the finite length cylinder under stable flow nakamura et al 1992 studied the influence of three dimensional hydrodynamic force by conducting the forced impact experiment sabuncu and calisal 1981 studied the wave current load issue of a single cylinder and the hydrodynamic coefficient was calculated bhatta and rahman 2003 bhatta 2011 proposed a method for calculating the velocity and wave load of a cylinder in finite depth water and gave corresponding analytical expressions sarpkaya and storm 1985 found that pure wave results and pure flow results were not applicable to the coexistence of wave and flow through experiments generally speaking the drag force coefficient was smaller than the pure wave value while the inertia force coefficient was larger than the pure wave value within the value of 8 12 of kc number dixon et al 1979 conducted several groups of experiments to change the submerged depth wave wavelength and other parameters and obtained the vertical wave force of partially submerged fixed pile haojie ren et al 2019 investigated the hydrodynamic force of partially submerged fixed piles through experiment with reynolds number ranging from 5 104 to 9 105 and found that the horizontal drag coefficient was random distribution chakrabarti et al 1979 measured the wave loads of two three and five piles arranged in parallel the pile core distance from 4 to 10 times of pile diameter and studied the relationship between the hydrodynamic coefficient of pile group and the kc number and the relative pile spacing g mindao et al 1987 studied the wave force of three cylinders arranged in parallel and in series they thought that the spacing between cylinders and pile s size were significant factors to affect wave forces and the spacing were also normalized u sparboom et al 2007 studied the influence of regular wave and irregular wave on cylinder group the configurations of two cylinders were 8 ways and the configurations of three cylinders were 6 ways they proposed a formula to evaluate the effect of neighboring cylinders of the wave load on a single cylinder on the basis of previous studies hildebrandt et al 2009 observed how the vortex shedding in different configurations to influence wave load on piles and studied the relation between cd cm and the pile spacing liu et al 2017 conducted the numerical simulation of two vertical cylinders in waves showing that the positive hydrodynamic force of the upstream cylinder was greater than that of the single cylinder deng et al 2019 used the two dimensional numerical model to simulate free surface waves pass two vertically cylinders the simulation results showed that the distance between the cylinders had a great influence on the wave force of the rear cylinder and it had a significant influence on the former only when the distance was very small haritos 1995 investigated the wave loads on single pile double pile in series parallel inclined and the inside one of four piles bonakdar and oumeraci 2012 of brunswick university of technology have been engaged in the research of pile group effect for many years scale and model effects were examined by comparing the results of small and large scale laboratory tests by bonakdar l and oumeraci h 2014 el safti et al 2014 developed a hybrid 2d 3d cfd model system for the simulation of 3d wave loads on structures in the near field and the developed model system would be helpful to extend the testing conditions of the wave loads on pile groups bonakdar et al 2016 carried out the experiment of small scale pile in different depth of regular wave and gave the formulae for the prediction of wave induced forces on pile groups the relationships between single cylinder and group of cylinders with different parameters including pile position pile distance and number of piles had investigated by bonakdar and oumeraci h 2015a bonakdar et al 2015 thought pile group effect is a multivariate function of both kc number and structural parameters and studied the law between them in his experiment the distance between pile and wave flume s wall was eight times the diameter of pile which could avoid the influence of sidewall and he pointed out that it is necessary to study the influence of wave direction 0 90 on pile group most scholars study the hydrodynamic characteristics of cylindrical piles through model experiments but there is relatively few research on the truss type legs as the stress object therefore this paper took the truss type legs of jack up offshore platforms as the research object took the mutual position of the platform legs as the arrangement mode and then studied the hydrodynamic coefficient of the three legged model under experimental conditions based on the hydrodynamic experiment of single legged model the pile group effect of three legged model under wave and current loads was quantitatively analyzed by defining the coefficient of pile group this study provides data support for the calculation of wave and current loads of jack up offshore platform which has important reference value 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 the calculation of wave current loads the wave and current loads of small scale component are always calculated by morison equation small scale refers to that the ratio of feature length d to wavelength l of components is less than 0 2 and truss structure belongs to small scale components the wave current loads acting on unit length is 1 f 1 2 ρ c d a u x u x ρ c m v u x the wave current loads in the equation contains two parts first one is drag force and the second is inertial force c d is the drag force coefficient c m is the inertial force coefficient ρ is the fluid density μ x represents the relative velocity vector in a direction perpendicular to the axial direction of cylinders μ x represents the acceleration vector of the water particle in the direction perpendicular to the axial direction of cylinders a is the projected area of unit length component perpendicular to v is the drainage volume of a unit length component the wave load of the whole structure can be obtained by integrating the above formula from the bottom to the surface there are two key issues in the application of morrison equation the first one is the value of hydrodynamic coefficient as the hydrodynamic coefficient is affected by many factors the value of hydrodynamic coefficient is different under different loading conditions and the accurate value of hydrodynamic coefficient is usually obtained by model experiment the second one is the selection of wave theory in the process of wave motion the velocity and acceleration of water particles change at every moment which needs to be calculated according to wave theory however no specific wave theory can be suitable for any load condition and the calculation results obtained by selecting different wave theories are also different dimensionless reynolds number and kc number are the two most important factors affecting hydrodynamic coefficient as for truss structures we need to redefine the reynolds number and kc number reynolds number 2 re du max ν kc number 3 kc tu max d in this formula d is the diameter of the main chord in the truss type legs due to the complexity of the main chord section and the existence of rack structure the equivalent diameter of the main chord is taken here the calculation formula of the equivalent diameter is as follows d 4a x a represents the effective cross sectional area of the bar and x represents wetted perimeter the members on both sides of the joint are regarded as continuous variable section cylinders and their sections are respectively taken in the rack structure calculate the equivalent diameter of maximum cross sectional area through tooth point and minimum cross sectional area through tooth root respectively and take the average value of their results d 7 5 10 3 m umax represents the maximum horizontal velocity at the water particle on the still water surface v is the kinetic viscosity coefficient of the fluid and v 1 0067 10 6 m2 s t is the period of the wave 2 2 the explanation of pile group effect under the action of wave and current loads the force of single cylinder in the pile group is different from that when the pile exists alone due to the mutual influence of each cylinder and this pile group effect is affected by the number relative position and loading condition for the pile group composed of cylinders previously studied pile group effect is mainly reflected in jet effect shielding effect and suppression effect jet effect will occur when piles are placed side by side the jet effect occurs when piles are arranged side by side and the distance between piles shrinks to form a laval tube subsequently the flow velocity of the fluid becomes larger in the contraction section to form a jet flow increasing the resistance and inertia force of the pile when the piles are connected in series the front pile will produce shielding effect on the back pile the fluid separates around the front pile and forms a series of vortices in the wake area which makes the velocity of the water particle less than the velocity of the incoming flow and reduces the stress on the rear pile in the wake area at the same time the back pile will have an inhibitory effect on the front pile when the rear pile is in the wake area of the front pile the generation and development of vorticity of the front pile will be suppressed making the pressure difference between the front pile and the rear pile and the force on the front pile smaller each trussed pile leg of the jack up platform produces a group pile effect and a more complex effect is formed between the three pile legs the distance between pile legs has the following influence on the overall load of pile group firstly there are mutual influences between pile legs and other pile legs such as shielding effect and suppression effect the same is true of small components second the wave has a periodic law and there is a distance between the three pile legs so there is a phase difference in the wave load of each component it is difficult to obtain the significant rule of the whole load and the pile spacing in this study the pile group effect of the three legged model under different working conditions is quantitatively analyzed by defining the pile group component force coefficient and the total force coefficient of the pile group the component force coefficient of pile group k g is defined as 4 k g f g f among them the f g is the peak value of the wave and current loads for each truss type leg and the f is the peak value of the wave current loads for the single legged model under the same working condition the total force coefficient of pile group k gt is defined as 5 k g t f g t n f among them f gt is the peak value of the wave current loads for the total three legged model the f is the peak value of the wave current loads for the single legged model under the same working condition n is the number of truss type legs in here n 3 3 hydrodynamics experiment of pile leg model 3 1 experimental model the prototype of the experimental models is a 400 feet jack up offshore platform with an average wavelength of 374 7 m and an average period of 15 5 s in survival condition according to the equipment conditions in the laboratory and the specifications of model materials the scale ratio of the model was determined as λ 70 by taking geometric similarity and dynamic similarity mainly gravity similarity as similarity criteria according to the linear length scale of the model the time scale λ t λ 8 37 and the wavelength scale λ l λ 70 of this experiment were obtained according to the determined scale ratio five pitches of the truss type legs of jack up offshore platform were selected as the experimental object and one pitch was taken as the object the specific sizes of all members of model scale and full scale were shown in table 1 due to the small size of member in the truss structure after scaling the truss structure of the model employed solid rod with 304 stainless steel to ensure the strength of itself in the manufacture of the truss type leg model the section of the main chord was no longer simplified to a cylinder but a real oval shape the section of the main chord with rack structure is shown in fig 1 meanwhile the rack lifting device was also taken into account in this experiment after scaling the rack structure the tooth pitch was 4 35 mm the module was 1 38 mm and the width was 2 35 mm the rack was symmetrically pasted on the two sides of the main chord by waterproof double sided adhesive tape the partial rack structure is shown in fig 2 the height of the truss was 0 625 m the three main chords were extended upwards for 0 20 m to ensure sufficient space of wave impact and the top of chords were connected by a small triangular plates the dynamometric bar ϕ25 mm 2 5 mm fixed on the small triangle plate with special glue was 0 30 m and made of hard pvc two measuring points were located 0 2 m apart on the dynamometric bar for the three leg model the distance between each two legs was 0 786 m and the whole model was connected by an equilateral triangle plate with side length of 0 99 m and thickness of 0 015 m the experimental model of single leg and three legs are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 3 2 experimental testing platform the tests were performed in a wave current experimental flume located at the navigation hydrodynamic laboratory shandong jiaotong university the length of experimental flume is 64 m width is 1 4 m and working depth is 0 4 1 2 m the side of the experimental flume is equipped with low inertia servomotor push plate wave generator and automatic control system of flow generator the experiment was divided into two parts steady flow and regular wave the principle of the flume is to simulate the steady flow of water in the circulation channel of more than 50 m through the high power pump in wave experiments waves are generated by push plate wave generator in addition the effect of the load inflowing angle was also considered experimental parameters of the volume are shown in table 2 the load inflowing angles on the model and the leg number are shown in fig 5 in the experiment when the fluid flows at a constant speed perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder the vortex is released to the rear of the cylinder at a certain frequency in order to avoid the phenomenon of resonance modal analysis was carried out on the experimental model by abaqus software the first 10 modes of the model are extracted and their natural frequencies are obtained as shown in table 3 according to the period of the wave the frequency of the wave can be obtained when the period is 1 s 1 5 s and 2 s the frequency is 1 hz 0 667 hz 0 5 hz correspondingly the release frequency of the vortex can be calculated as follows 6 f s v n d among them s is strouhal number and the value is 0 2 according to reynolds number in the experiment v n is the current velocity perpendicular to the component axis d is the diameter of the member where the equivalent diameter of the main chord is taken the release frequency of vortices are shown in table 4 it can be seen from these frequencies that the wave frequency is less than the natural frequency of the model and the model will not resonate under wave loading under the action of current load when the velocity is 0 2 m s it is very close to the natural frequency of the model so the natural frequency of the model can be changed by adding mass block to avoid resonance in the experiment a multi sensor fusion system including strain gauge wave height sensor six dimensional force sensor data acquisition unit vibration acceleration sensor and velocity sensor was established the experimental instruments and types are shown in table 5 the strain gauge was used to collect strain signal of the force measuring rod the six dimensional force sensor was used to collect signal of load on model the data acquisition unit was connected with strain gauge for collecting transmitting storing displaying and analyzing strain data of force measuring rod the schematic diagram of the single legged and three legged model experiment test platform were shown in fig 6 in order to avoid the contingency of experimental data each group of experiments was repeated three times and then the average value was taken as the experimental value the multi sensor fusion system can collect all experimental data synchronously and ensure the synchronization of experimental data the whole experimental device was connected with a frock frame across the water tank which was 25 m away from the wave generator to ensure sufficient distance for wave generation and development the overall layout of the experimental system is shown in fig 7 the distance between model edge and the flume s wall was 0 25 m and the distance between model ends and tank bottom was 0 2 m which were much larger than the diameter of pile such a spacing had been shown to avoid the influence of sidewall and seabed kiu et al 2011 the experiment of the three legged model in flume are shown in fig 8 3 3 experimental data the wave current and load of the single leg model was all obtained through the strain data transformation of the dynamometric bar except that the wave current load of the whole three legged model was directly acquired by the six dimensional force sensor when the model is subjected to wave and current load the dynamometric bar above the model will be deformed the strain signal of dynamometric bar under the action of wave and current load is shown in fig 9 from fig 9 it can be seen that the strain signals at the two measuring points on the dynamometric bar had the same variation trend regardless of the current load or wave load after further transformation of the strain signal the wave current load received by the model can be obtained according to the calculation principle of beam section bending moment in material mechanics beer et al 2014 the transformation formula between strain data and load data is obtained 7 f δ m δ l e δ ε π b 3 32 1 b b 4 δ l among them e is the elastic modulus mpa of the material for the dynamometric bar and e 3900 mpa δ ε is the strain difference between two measuring points με b is the outside diameter of the dynamometric bar b 0 025 m b is the inside diameter of the dynamometric bar b 0 02 m δl is the distance difference between two measuring points on the dynamometric bar the variation curve of the strain difference between two measuring points on the dynamometric bar with time is shown in fig 10 as can be seen from fig 10 with the increase of the loading time the strain difference between the two measuring points gradually tends to be stable so the strain difference selects the average value of the strain difference after the loading is stable since the strain of the two measuring points under the action of wave load presents the alternating waveform the maximum value of the strain difference is selected 4 results and analysis 4 1 calculation of wave flow loads in the process of solving the hydrodynamic coefficient we need to get the calculated value of wave flow load of the experimental model under experimental conditions at present there is no systematic calculation formula for complex truss structures in this paper finite element software abaqus was used to create dynamic implicit analysis step to calculate the wave and current load of complex truss structures firstly a three dimensional finite element model of the experimental device was created as shown in fig 11 among them three legged model used the total dynamometric bar ϕ50 mm 2 5 mm of 600 mm to obtain the wave and current load of the three legged mode the model was assembled from beam elements with defined circular section the rack structure was to simulate the real rack structure by defining a rectangular beam section with length of 12 2 mm and width of 2 35 mm and establishing binding constraints with the main chord through tie element the rack structure is shown in fig 12 the material properties of each component of the experimental model are shown in table 6 as for the focus area on the force measuring bar the precision of the calculation results could be improved by using local mesh seed refinement set g 9 8 m s2 in the load module and comprehensively consider drag force inertia force and buoyancy the output section of bending moment was created at the location where the strain sensor fixed on the dynamometric bar and the wave load of model was obtained indirectly through the moment difference and distance difference of the two sections the output section of bending moment is shown in fig 13 take one working condition of the whole three legged model as an example and the inflowing angle is 0 v 0 5 m s h 0 2 m and t 2 s the time domain curves of section bending moment and moment difference of section 7 and section 8 are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 from figs 14 and 15 it can be found that the value fluctuates significantly within 20 30 s due to the rigid impact of the flow on the model as the loading time increases the bending moment of the two sections starts to show a stable change trend and the bending moment difference also tends to a stable change rule the experiment and simulation results of the whole three legged model were selected under the inflowing angle of 0 current and the comparison results are shown in fig 16 through the simulation and comparison of current conditions it is found that within the allowable error range the numerical model is in good agreement with the experimental model especially under the condition of small load the difference between the two will be smaller compared with the current load the wave load is smaller so it is reasonable to use this model to simulate the wave condition 4 2 hydrodynamic coefficient 4 2 1 current load in order to visually represent the change of current force with velocity under each inflowing angle a velocity current force curve was drawn the variation law of current force with flow velocity of the three legged model at various inflowing angles is shown in fig 17 it can be seen from fig 17 that with the increase of velocity the current force presents a growth trend of quadratic function when the velocity is small the current forces corresponding to each inflowing angle have little difference with the increase of the velocity the current forces start to have obvious differences whether it is a smooth model or a toothed model in terms of the overall trend the current force at each inflowing angle is from large to small 30 45 0 90 under the action of current the movement speed of water particle changes slowly with time generally current is regarded as stable flow and the force at this time is only drag force ignoring inertia force firstly the empirical value of drag force coefficient cd 1 was taken the current load of the model was calculated according to the synchronizing velocity value in the experiment and the towing force coefficients under various conditions can be obtained by comparing the measured current load with the calculated results during the experiment the relationship between drag force coefficient and reynolds number under all working conditions is shown in fig 18 as can be seen from fig 18 the drag force coefficients of inflowing angle increase with the increase of reynolds number and the increase trend gradually decreases the value range of the towing force coefficient is between 0 85 and 1 15 most of which are within the range of 0 9 1 1 for a smooth cylinder when re 105 it is in a subcritical region the boundary layer from stagnation point to separation point is laminar flow as the separation occurs before the maximum width of the cylinder the wide wake and low foundation pressure lead to a large resistance coefficient with the maximum value up to 1 2 4 2 2 the wave load since the design of model experiment meets the similarity of kc number but not the similarity of reynolds number the current load does not meet the similarity of force but the wave load of prototype and model has a multiple conversion relationship compared with current load wave load is relatively small so the relationship between wave load and inflowing angle is not obvious according to wave height water depth and periodic parameters in the experiment stokes fifth order wave was selected as wave theory to obtain the velocity and acceleration of water particle this research uses the trial and error method to solve the inertia force coefficient the core of which is to constantly change the value of the inertia force coefficient to make the calculated value of wave load equal to the experimental value based on the solution results the change curve of inertia force coefficient with kc number is obtained through data fitting as shown in fig 19 it can be found from the fitting curve in fig 19 that within the range of kc 20 the inertia force coefficient increases with the increase of kc number and the value range is between 1 and 2 5 as the kc number under experimental conditions is relatively large the inertia force coefficient varies in a large range it can be seen that when kc 20 cm 1 when kc 50 cm 1 7 when kc 70 cm 2 0 when kc 127 cm 2 5 which is consistent with the change law of inertia force coefficient with kc number obtained by sarpkaya in 1976 4 3 the pile group effect 4 3 1 force coefficient of pile group the variation curve of pile group force coefficients with reynolds number and kc number of no 1 pile leg under various angles are shown in fig 20 and fig 21 the stable value of the component force coefficient of pile no 1 under various inflowing angles is selected as the component force coefficient under this working condition the component force coefficients of pile group under various inflowing angles of pile no 1 are shown in table 7 as shown in figs 20 and 21 and table 6 the component force coefficient of pile group of no 1 pile leg under 0 is basically equal to 1 which indicates that the presence of no 2 leg and no 3 leg has no obvious influence on the force of no 1 leg and the pile group effect can be ignored under the angle of 30 the force component coefficient is stable at about 0 91 and there are two reasons for this there are two reasons for this locally the distribution of the three main chord in the leg of no 1 leg has changed when the incidence angle is 0 the distribution is parallel when the incidence angle is 30 there are two main chord distributed in series the former chord has a shielding effect on the latter chord and the latter chord has a suppression effect on the former so the overall load is reduced on the whole no 2 leg is located directly behind no 1 leg which affects the formation and development of vortex behind of no 1 pile thus the pressure difference between the front and back of no 1 leg decreases under 45 incident angle the force component coefficient of no 1 finally stabilizes at about 0 98 compared with the 30 incident angle the suppression effect of leg no 2 weakens at an incidence angle of 90 the leg no 1 and the leg no 2 and 3 are arranged side by side the presence of jet effect makes the velocity of clearance increase increasing the force on the no 1 leg the variation curve of pile group force coefficients with reynolds number and kc number of no 2 leg under various angles are shown in fig 22 and fig 23 the force coefficients of pile group under various load incidence angles of no 2 leg are shown in table 8 as seen in figs 22 and 23 and table 8 it can be found that the component force coefficients of no 2 leg under the 0 and 45 are stable around 1 slightly larger than 1 which shows that the influence of pile group effect is small at this time although there is interference of ahead legs no 2 leg is not affected by the wake zone of the former legs because of angle and hence it is not much different from the situation where no 2 leg exists alone for no 2 pile leg the effect of the 30 and 90 are same so the force component coefficients under the two angles almost no difference and the final stable value is about 0 97 because of the shielding of leg no 1 and no 3 the stress on leg no 2 is reduced the component force coefficients of group piles with reynolds number and kc number of no 3 pile leg under various inflowing angles are shown in fig 24 and fig 25 the force coefficients of pile group under various load incidence angles of no 3 leg are shown in table 9 observing figs 24 and 25 and table 8 at 0 incident angle due to the symmetrical distribution of no 2 leg and no 3 leg there is little difference in component forces both of which are stable around 1 under the angle of 30 leg no 3 and leg no 1 under the 90 are arranged in the same way therefore the force components of them are not much different and both are stable around 1 1 and the existence of jet effect makes the force on leg larger than the leg alone the component force coefficients of pile group under 45 is basically equal to 1 indicating that the pile group effect at this time can be ignored under the angle of 90 the no 2 leg is in the wake zone of leg no 3 suppressing the release of vortex therefore the component force coefficient at this time is less than 1 and finally stabilizes to 0 91 by observing experiment 30 and 90 working conditions are almost the same there are corresponding relationships between the legs so the experimental data can be verified by comparing the force coefficient these two conditions are shown in fig 26 take two sets of relationships as examples the conclusion of no 1 leg at 30 should be consistent with that of no 3 leg at 90 the kg of no 1 leg with kc number in fig 21 is basically the same as that of no 3 leg with kc number in fig 25 and no 2 leg should be consistent under two conditions the kg of pile leg no 2 with re at 30 is also close to that at 90 in fig 22 other corresponding relationships are basically the same indicating that the experimental data are reliable 4 3 2 pile group total force coefficient the variation curve of the total force coefficients of pile group with reynolds number of the three legged model under various angles are shown in fig 27 as seen from fig 27 when the reynolds number re 2000 the total force coefficients of pile group is relatively dispersed with the reynolds number increasing the total force coefficient starts to stabilize in addition to 30 the total force coefficient under other three angles will be stable about 0 95 therefore it can be concluded that the existence of pile group effect makes the overall load of the three legs structure smaller the variation curve of the total force coefficients of pile group with kc number at various angles is shown in fig 28 in fig 28 it can be seen from that the total force coefficient of pile group under various angles increases with the increase of kc number and the total force coefficient is between 0 6 and 1 with the reinforcement of wave condition the total force coefficient gradually approaches 1 the relationship between the value of total force coefficients and angles is not obvious so all data are fitted the fitting curve is shown in fig 29 compared with the variation range of the total coefficient with reynolds number the variation range of it with kc number is larger and it is mainly because of the phase difference between the wave load peak of the three piles and the wave load peak of each leg in order to visualize the effect of phase difference the time domain curve of strain difference about the whole structure and each leg under wave action is output as shown in fig 30 by observing a b c and d in fig 30 it can be clearly found that the wave load peak of the whole three legged model is out of sync with each leg in this experiment when using strain gauge to collect the load signal of each leg a six dimensional force sensor is also used to collect the total load signal of three legged model synchronously so as to avoid the phase difference problem of superimposing forces on each leg to calculate the total load therefore the wave load of the three legs is no longer the simple sum of the wave load of each component leg but the sum of the component forces is greater than the total force of three legs taking the 0 as an example the comparison between resultant force and the sum of each component under wave load is shown in fig 31 5 conclusion this paper conducted the experimental study on the hydrodynamic characteristics of three legs under wave flow loadings and some main conclusions were drawn in the followings 1 the model experiment was conducted under the conditions of low reynolds number and high kc number the drag force coefficient obtained by the instantaneous value method increases with increasing reynolds number and the incremental trend gradually slows down the experimental result show that the drag force coefficient is in the range of 0 9 1 1 the inertia force coefficient obtained by trial error method increases with the increase of kc number and the increase trend becomes slow gradually which is between 1 and 2 5 2 as for wave flow loads on three legged structure the influence of reynolds number kc number and the inflowing angle on pile group coefficient cannot be ignored by analyzing the variation rule of the component force coefficients of pile group in the three legs it is found that the pile group effect makes the force of each component leg different from the force of leg alone and the component force coefficients of pile group is between 0 9 and 1 1 the total force coefficient under the action of current is around the value of 0 95 because of the influence of phase difference the total force coefficient under the wave loadings is in a wide range which is from 0 6 to 1 3 for the design of platform leg the most significant issue is to analyze the leg with larger loads due to pile group effect according to the inflowing angle the above experimental conclusions are based on the independent action of regular wave and steady flow and the conclusion under the action of irregular wave and wave current coupling loading needs further experimental analysis in addition the scale ratio of the model in this experiment is relatively large and hence the experimental results are in the condition of low reynolds number and high kc number for the condition of the high reynolds number and low kc number it may need to decrease the scale ratio of the model or change the load conditions to conduct further experimental research the above conclusions are only applicable to the offshore platform project regrettably normalized research has not been conducted however it is of great reference significance for jack up platforms at other distances and the author believes that the total force coefficient and component force coefficient of platforms in this paper will be close to other conditions which is expected to be verified in the future credit authorship contribution statement yingchun xie conceptualization methodology investigation resources writing original draft
