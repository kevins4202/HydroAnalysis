21080,a comparison of a tidal turbine s performance and structural loads is conducted using lab scale numerical models and experimental testing under multiple current only and wave current conditions at the ifremer wave current flume experimental testing used to validate cfd models was accomplished using a 0 9 m diameter 3 bladed tidal turbine and had a blockage ratio of 8 while the turbine was submerged initial investigations analysed the performance and loads on the turbine under uniform and profiled current only conditions the presence of a profiled velocity gradient was found to have a negligible effect on the average performance characteristics however transient thrust torque and out of plane bending moment loads experienced much greater variations these load fluctuations were further increased with increasing levels of shear in the velocity profile while peaks in the turbine loads coincided with its rotational frequency the addition of regular stokes 2nd order theory waves added to the complexity of the flow conditions experienced by the turbine the effect on the average performance characteristics were negligible while the total turbine thrust and torque fluctuations increased by 35 times that of the current only cases peaks in the loads aligned with the wave surface elevation indicating the importance of transient analyses of dynamic loads keywords tidal stream

s energy information administration 2017 however it is unsustainable and undesirable to generate electricity from fossil fuels particularly due to global concerns about climate change and global warming which are a direct result of increasing concentrations of green house gases ghg from burning fossil fuels the european commission ec has set targets to reduce ghg emissions progressively and commit to net zero by 2050 european commission 2020a the current framework sets out to reduce ghg emissions by 40 improve energy efficiency by 32 5 and to secure 32 of europe s energy from renewable sources by 2030 european commission 2020b the oceans cover around 70 of the earth s surface and is therefore an extensive and highly predictable renewable energy source which is yet to be fully utilised europe is reported to hold 20 30 of the global tidal resource of which 80 is located in and around the coastlines of the uk and france if fully exploited using current technology wave and tidal power could supply at least 10 of the uk s electricity renewable energy association 2019 this could go some way to help achieve ghg emissions targets replace the imminent depletion of energy supply through nuclear outputs uk department for business energy and industrial strategy 2020 and create a diverse energy mix for a sustainable future the advancement of horizontal axis tidal turbines hatts mean that over 75 of companies are developing full scaled hatt devices over other tidal stream turbine tst devices european commission 2017 ocean energy europe 2018 a significant problem for tidal stream energy developers is the spatio temporal complexity in the flow which makes deployment and device survivability a challenge chen and lam 2015 togneri and masters 2016 to enable hatt devices to become commercially viable device components must be able to withstand substantial spatial and temporal sub surface forces generated by tidal currents surface waves and turbulence to minimise device downtime as well as operation and maintenance costs thus help reduce the cost of electricity generation lab scale experiments can be conducted to reproduce realistic ocean conditions and to quantify the magnitude of these sub surface forces prior to the full scale design manufacture and testing of a device tsts have been widely characterised under uniform current conditions allmark et al 2018 bahaj et al 2007 gaurier et al 2015 maganga et al 2010 however it is important to understand the impact of additional loadings induced by profiled current conditions as well as surface waves which create oscillatory motions penetrating the water column by up to half the wavelength sorensen 2006 the ocean environment will never experience a regular wave field yet regular waves of relevant heights and wave periods can be used to quantify the extreme loadings experienced by the tst components holst et al 2015 previous studies barltrop et al 2007 galloway et al 2010 gaurier et al 2020a 2020b henriques et al 2014 lust et al 2013 luznik et al 2013 martinez et al 2020 ordonez sanchez et al 2016 porter et al 2020 sos et al 2017 have investigated the performance of a tst under regular wave conditions and found that the average performance characteristics were very similar to tests conducted under current only conditions however oscillatory motions induced by waves presented significant cyclic variations responsible for fluctuations in the thrust and torque loadings in excess of 35 of the mean rotor load galloway et al 2010 ordonez sanchez et al 2019 this can lead to extreme loadings on the drivetrain and accelerated fatigue of the individual turbine components with advances in computational processing times and the accessibility of software computational fluid dynamics cfd has become a widely adopted tool to develop numerical simulations to characterise the performance and loadings of marine devices in various flow conditions numerical models still require validation however the number of experiments needed is less than required for a full experimental test campaign steady state analyses can be used to model time independent flows however analyses which account for transient flow features provide results of a higher resolution than steady state models ansys cfx modelling guide hafeez et al 2019 transient simulations are necessary to examine cyclic loadings induced by complex flow features although at a much greater computational expense than steady state simulations transient cfd models have been used to characterise tst devices bai et al 2014 li et al 2019 mcsherry et al 2011 o doherty et al 2009 sun et al 2008 yan et al 2017 investigate profiled current flows hafeez et al 2019 mason jones 2010 mason jones et al 2013 o doherty et al 2010 and examine different methods of wave propagation bihs et al 2016 finnegan and goggins 2012 jacobsen et al 2012 lal and elangovan 2008 lambert 2012 liang et al 2010 lloyd et al 2019b marques machado et al 2018 tian et al 2018 however few studies have investigated the combined effects of a profiled velocity gradient waves and turbine interaction a study by tatum et al 2016 analysed the individual turbine component loadings induced by a uniform current velocity and surface waves finding that wave action had a significant effect on the fluctuation of the thrust and power as well as the shaft bending moment interaction with a velocity profile was also investigated and found that the addition of a profiled velocity gradient had a significant effect on the bending moment of the turbine blades investigating the significance of individual blade loadings experimentally requires the use of fully instrumented model tsts which is expensive and difficult to achieve in controlled test scenarios numerical modelling can therefore provide a cheaper and alternative method to quantify these complex loadings which are crucial for developers needing to make informed decisions about the turbine rotor and blade design prior to their manufacture the focus of this study is to examine the impact that complex flow conditions such as profiled velocity gradients or surface waves can have on the individual turbine component loadings and performance of a hatt the research methods used include experimental lab scale testing at the french research institute for exploitation of the sea ifremer wave current flume as well as the use of numerical cfd modelling using ansys cfx software this paper presents the methodology used to develop a free surface multiphase model capable of simulating turbine rotation in uniform and profiled current flows as well as in regular wave fields all numerical models are initially validated using lab scale experimental data allowing further investigation into the transient turbine loadings which were unattainable through the experimental test campaign this study presents the turbine performance under uniform and profiled current only conditions as well as under wave current conditions using stokes 2nd order theory s2ot regular waves which are superimposed upon the profiled current velocities comparisons are made between the numerical cfd models developed and experimental data obtained by cardiff and strathclyde universities at the ifremer wave current flume 2 experimental testing 2 1 model scale turbine a 1 20 scale hatt was designed and manufactured by the cardiff marine energy research group cmerg mason jones 2010 as shown in fig 1 a the blade design was based upon the wortmann fx63 137 aerofoil as shown in fig 1b while the optimum settings for this design are summarised in table 1 a full description of the blade and turbine design and manufacture are detailed by allmark et al 2020 and ellis et al 2018 respectively in order to quantify the dynamic loadings on the turbine under various flow conditions the turbine was fully instrumented the rotor thrust torque transducers and the out of plane bending moment transducers for each turbine blade had a sample rate of 200 hz and were calibrated as detailed in lloyd 2020 a haidenhain optical encoder was used to measure the turbine position with a sample rate of 45 hz and moisture sensors were installed to detect for leakages a full uncertainty analysis of the measured variables used in the experimental testing can be found in allmark et al 2020 lloyd 2020 with a summary presented in table 2 2 2 experimental set up experimental testing of the model scale hatt was carried out at the ifremer wave current flume boulogne sur mer france gaurier et al 2018 the flume dimensions are 4 m wide 2 m deep and 18 m long as shown in fig 2 with a general flow turbulence of 3 gaurier et al 2013 the flume has the capability to produce streamwise flow velocities between 0 1 and 2 2 m s with and without waves regular wave generation between f 0 5 2 hz is achieved using 8 displacement paddles which span the full 4 m width of the flume and when fully submerged sit 0 5 m into the water column a physical beach was located at the opposite end of the flume to the wave maker to dampen the waves and prevent reflection from the end of the tank for all experimental testing the turbine was installed 4 m downstream from the wave maker at a depth of 1 m and centralised in the cross stream direction this gave a clearance of 0 61 27 of the water depth between the turbine positioned at top dead centre tdc and the water surface in still water conditions there was a blockage ratio of 8 while the turbine was submerged in the ifremer wave current flume this ratio was low enough not to interfere with the flow characteristics howell et al 2009 though for direct comparison the cfd models reflected the flume boundary conditions as discussed in section 3 a 0 09 m stanchion supported the turbine and held it stationary within the flume the pitch angle for each turbine blade was set to 6 0 5 experimental tests were carried out with speed control at a number of angular velocities in order to generate performance characteristics over a range of tip speed ratios tsrs λ 0 7 based on the average streamwise water velocity w as shown by equation 1 1 λ ω r w a dantec 2d laser doppler anemometry lda was used to measure the instantaneous flow velocities in the streamwise and vertical directions with a sample rate of 200 hz the measurement volume was initially aligned 1 m upstream of the centre of the turbine nose cone it was then moved to measure the flow velocity at multiple locations through the water column at depths of 0 55 0 68 0 81 0 94 1 1 13 1 26 1 39 and 1 52 m from the swl for the uniform current cases and every 0 2 m between 0 4 m and 1 6 m from the swl for the profiled current cases this covered the full diameter of the turbine which occupied a water depth between 0 55 m and 1 45 m from the swl fig 3 shows the setup of the turbine and the measurement equipment at the ifremer wave current flume a churchill controls capacitance type wave probe was used to track the water surface elevation with a sample rate of 100 hz an uncertainty analysis for the flow measurement devices is detailed in lloyd 2020 2 3 experimental procedure 2 3 1 current only cases current only experiments were carried out with both uniform and profiled flows for all test cases a target streamwise velocity of 1 0 m s was used which equated to a chord based reynolds number of r e 0 7 c h o r d 6 48 x 10 4 allmark et al 2020 as defined by equation 2 where c 0 7 is the chord length at 70 of the turbine radius previous experimental testing confirmed that reynolds effects become negligible with a variation 1 for reynold s numbers above r e 0 7 c h o r d 6 48 x 10 4 allmark et al 2020 2 r e 0 7 c h o r d ρ c 0 7 w μ flow straighteners placed in the upstream area of the flume aided the generation of uniform flow conditions u while the wave maker paddles were fully removed nowm profiled flow conditions could be generated by positioning the wave maker paddles in the upper section of the water column to create a blockage the wave maker could be positioned in two different locations wm00 or wm20 creating two different velocity profiles profile 1 p1 and profile 2 p2 respectively wm00 and wm20 refer to the wave maker being either fully submerged to a depth of 50cm raised by 0 cm or partially submerged to a depth of 30cm raised by 20 cm in the top of the water column respectively for all current only cases the wave maker was not operational even though it was used to induce the differing velocity profiles each of the flow scenarios are depicted in fig 4 and summarised in table 3 2 3 2 wave current cases two different regular waves were used to investigate the effect of combined wave current conditions on the performance and loadings of the model scale tst both waves were intermediate s2ot waves and were superimposed upon the profiled current velocity produced by the wave maker position wave 1 w1 was superimposed upon p1 and wave 2 w2 upon p2 these waves were tested in a water depth h of 2 m but would be representative of tidal sites with a water depth of between 25 and 40 m by scaling the wave characteristics to match the relative depth and wave steepness criteria this would result in a wave height h wave period t r and wavelength l as described by w1s and w2s as shown in table 4 five different types of flow condition were tested three current only u p1 p2 and two wave current cases p1w1 p2w2 as outlined in tables 3 and 4 the turbine was operated at a range of angular velocities to generate a full set of performance curves for the power coefficient c p thrust coefficient c t and torque coefficient c q as defined in the nomenclature the flume and tst were brought up to speed before data capture commenced recording flow and turbine measurements for between 100 and 200 s 3 numerical methodology cfd was used to create numerical models to replicate the testing carried out experimentally at the ifremer flume this enabled a direct comparison between the numerical and experimental results eliminating the need for any blockage correction errors ansys icem 18 0 ansys inc n d was used to create the geometry and mesh while ansys cfx 18 0 ansys inc n d was used for the physics setup of the model and the solver the model development has been split up into the following sections 3 1 domain geometry and mesh characteristics 3 2 model setup and 3 3 current flow and wave generation 3 1 domain geometry and mesh characteristics fig 5 shows an overview of the model geometry which was individually optimised dependent on the flow conditions and experimental facility dimensions lloyd et al 2019b the model domain was split up into a main fluid domain and a rotating subdomain which enclosed the turbine a free surface model was developed to allow 2 phase multiphase flow where both water and air phases are present the free surface interface was located at a water depth of 2 m which is 70 of the overall domain height 2 86 m leaving the remaining upper section of the domain as air lloyd et al 2019b the width of the domain was the same as the ifremer flume 4 m to ensure the blockage ratio of the turbine was the same between experimental and numerical testing the domain length was varied based on requirements for each individual simulation for current only conditions a domain length of 20 m was used allowing for adequate wake development while being suitably long that the domain outlet does not interfere with the turbine characteristics ebdon 2019 ellis et al 2018 mason jones 2010 for wave current simulations the length of the domain was varied depending on the simulated wave characteristic wavelength as shown in fig 6 the domain length was found to be optimal when set to allow the propagation of 8 10 waves lloyd et al 2019b before reaching the end of the domain a numerical beach of twice the wavelength 2 l was incorporated to prevent any reflection of the waves from the end of the domain which corresponded to a main domain length of 80 m and 50 m for simulations using w1 and w2 respectively this was imposed by applying a general momentum source acting in the direction of wave propagation which was used to force the velocity in this region to be the same as the current velocity removing the oscillatory effects of the wave lloyd 2020 a cylindrical rotating subdomain was created to enclose the turbine blades and hub as shown in fig 5 this allowed the multiple frames of reference mfr technique ansys cfx theory guide to be used allowing the turbine subdomain to rotate around the z axis at a set angular velocity simulating the turbine rotation the transient rotor stator interface model was used to account for the transient interaction effects at the sliding interface between these two domains the cylinder was 1 3 m in diameter and 0 4 m wide as recommended by ellis et al 2018 as it was found that a smaller diameter would influence the turbine results yet a bigger diameter had no effect table 5 provides a summary of the dimensions used for each numerical model the mesh for the main fluid domain was generated using a top down blocking strategy to create a structured hexa mesh ansys cfx modelling guide hexa meshing is highly space efficient and is advantageous in comparison to an unstructured tetra mesh as it requires less computational points having a higher spatial resolution and better aspect ratio all of which increase the resolution of the simulation raval 2008 specifically for wave modelling it is important to have a region of increased mesh resolution around the air water interface spanning the entire wave height to maintain the desired surface resolution at all points along the wavelength optimum mesh sizing around the free surface used 10 cells over the wave height and 120 cells per wavelength lloyd et al 2019b as shown in fig 7 table 6 presents the mesh sizing parameters for the main fluid domain in each simulation the mesh around the turbine was achieved using a bottom up meshing method creating a surface mesh which was refined to produce a finer volume mesh establishing a tetra mesh inflation layers were added to the surface of the turbine to increase the boundary layer resolution perpendicular to the surface table 7 shows the turbine subdomain optimum mesh sizing parameters based on a mesh study conducted by lloyd et al 2019a the main fluid domain and turbine subdomain meshes were combined to create an overall mesh suitable for simulating s2ot waves uniform and profiled current flows as well as measuring turbine performance and loading characteristics fig 7 shows an example of the final mesh used to simulate wave current and turbine interaction using the characteristics of p2w2 the maximum aspect ratio for all mesh components is well within the recommendation of 1000 ansys inc n d the number of elements in the final meshes are between 7 4 and 15 5 million depending on the flow characteristics used in the simulation further information about the mesh studies undertaken and types of mesh used can be found in lloyd 2020 3 2 model setup ansys cfx 18 0 ansys inc n d was used to define the physics of the model and to enable the numerical simulation to be solved a homogenous air water multiphase model was used to simulate free surface flows the two phases are separated by a distinct interface using volume fractions to specify the fraction of the control volume that each fluid phase occupies ansys cfx theory guide and used an activated buoyancy scheme the shear stress transport sst statistical turbulence model menter 1996 was used to close the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations due to its improved performance under adverse pressure gradients in comparison to the k omega k ω and k epsilon k ε turbulence models ansys cfx modelling guide as well as being proven to have no detrimental effects on the generation and propagation of regular waves alberello et al 2017 finnegan and goggins 2012 2015 lal and elangovan 2008 a transient analysis was carried out to capture the time dependent nature of the flow and the dynamic loading on the turbine it was necessary to define a physical time step δ t to control the simulation and capture the required level of detail in the simulation as ansys cfx solver uses an implicit solution method ansys cfx theory guide the time step for current only models incorporating a turbine δ t t u r b equated to the turbine rotating by a maximum of θ 5 per time step ansys cfx reference guide mcsherry et al 2011 as shown by equation 3 therefore the time step for each model would be varied according to the selected angular velocity for simulations with waves a time step δ t w a v e of t a 50 was found to be optimum lloyd 2020 as shown by equation 4 for combined wave current and turbine simulations the smaller time step of δ t w a v e and δ t t u r b was utilised to ensure a sufficient level of temporal resolution was achieved further information on setting the time step can be found in lloyd 2020 3 δ t t u r b θ ω 180 π 4 δ t w a v e t a 50 the boundary conditions used for the current only and wave current models are summarised in table 8 while fig 8 shows the locations of these boundaries the main difference between the two types of model was the use of an opening at the inlet and outlet for simulations incorporating wave motion this allowed bidirectional flow into and out of the domain which was necessary to prevent the model from crashing when simulating regular waves each simulation began with a 1 0 m s current only flow using a uniform or profiled velocity gradient depending on the type of simulation if the model required wave generation the wave characteristic was superimposed onto the current flow after 2 s of run time in order to allow the current flow to establish before the wave conditions were incorporated five models were generated with different combinations of current only flow u p1 p2 and wave current flow p1w1 p2w2 the same range of tsrs 0 7 as used in the experimental testing were simulated for the uniform flow cases however due to the computational expense of modelling the profiled current cases and wave cases only a single simulation for each model was executed previous experimental work allmark et al 2020 found that the peak power of the turbine was at a tsr of 4 and therefore these complex model types used an angular velocity equivalent to a tsr of 4 each model was set to run for 100 s with stability in each simulation reached between 40 and 70 s of run time monitor points were placed at a central width in the domain 2 m upstream of the turbine at locations between y 0 1 m and y 1 9 m this enabled a visualisation of the turbine inflow conditions to be achieved over time the torque q thrust t and out of plane bending moment b m x on the turbine blades were monitored every time step to examine the transient loadings and observe the convergence of the simulation all simulations were run using a high performance computing hpc cluster hawk provided through access from cardiff university simulations were run using between 80 and 280 processors per model the simulations took 175 1207 h for the current only models and 2735 4855 h for the wave current models dependent on the complexity of the simulation 3 3 current flow and wave generation for uniform flow models u the flow characteristics were added to the inlet of the model mathematically to reach a streamwise velocity of 1 0 m s input using cartesian coordinates as shown in table 9 for models using a profiled current flow p1 or p2 average steady state data obtained experimentally was input to the model using a profile method boundary condition at the inlet this boundary condition used interpolated values from the flow profiles obtained during experimental testing cfx expression language cel expressions were then used to refer to the imported data using interpolation functions the aim was to directly compare cfd simulations and experimental data therefore it was important to replicate the current profile generated at the experimental facilities into the models this method ensured minimal changes were made when transferring experimental data across to be used in numerical models models incorporating regular waves w1 or w2 had an additional input at the inlet of the domain achieved by defining the surface wave elevation and the s2ot sub surface velocity components the time dependent wave velocity components were superimposed upon the preestablished steady state velocity profile the flow conditions in the flume can be presented as shown in equation 5 where w t is the instantaneous velocity in the streamwise direction w is the time averaged velocity value w is the fluctuating component and w r is the wave orbital component 5 w t w w w r the addition of surface waves introduces an oscillatory component to the flow which increases the complexity of the flow regime and can have a significant impact on marine devices placed in these regions regular waves travelling in the same direction as the current flow will have a wave period t r angular frequency ω r and wave celerity c r in a frame of reference that is moving at the same velocity as the average current w in a stationary frame of reference the waves will have a wave period t a angular frequency ω a and wave celerity c a waves induce oscillatory motions through a horizontal w a and vertical v a velocity component which are calculated in a stationary frame of reference using equations 6 and 7 mani 2012 where k is the wave number fig 9 shows the key variables used to describe wave motion with the coordinate frame set with the z axis in the direction of wave propagation y axis in the gravity direction and x axis perpendicular to the yz plane the positional depth is referred to as y with the still water level swl at y 0 and the seabed at y h the surface elevation η of the wave fluctuates around the swl by a set amount known as the amplitude a of the wave as detailed by equation 8 6 w a w

there is an interaction between the wave and current components which causes the angular frequency ω r of the waves to change due to the doppler shift galloway et al 2010 this change can be observed in equation 9 9 ω r ω a k w the relative depth h l of a wave is important in defining its characteristics and can be classified as deep intermediate or shallow henriques et al 2016 the regular waves used in this study were intermediate depth water waves 0 04 h l 0 5 with w1 having a relative depth of 0 221 and w2 of 0 357 as shown in table 4 intermediate water waves have circular velocity orbitals near the water surface which become elliptical towards the seabed due to interaction between the water and the seabed as the water depth decreases 4 experimental and numerical results comparison 4 1 turbine performance under current only conditions 4 1 1 flow characteristics a comparison of the experimental and cfd current only u p1 and p2 model results for the streamwise and vertical velocities are shown in fig 10 the bars on the experimental results represent 1 standard deviation either side of the mean experimentally the biggest difference in the velocity over the water depth for the uniform current case was 0 01 m s in the streamwise direction and 0 02 m s in the vertical direction the average standard deviation for the streamwise velocities were 0 009 m s while the vertical velocities showed even less variation with a standard deviation of 0 003 m s the small differences in the velocity over the water depth and consistent standard deviation show that the flow conditions through the water depth were steady and uniform validating the assumption that the flume possessed uniform current conditions both p1 and p2 show a considerable reduction in the streamwise velocity towards the surface of the water compared to the input flow velocity of 1 00 m s due to the presence of the wave maker p1 has the greatest reduction in streamwise velocity near the water surface due to the wave maker being fully submerged to a depth of 50 cm in the top of the water column p2 shows a smaller reduction in velocity as the wave maker was raised to a depth of 30 cm leading to less of a shearing effect through the water depth near the base of the flume p1 has an increased streamwise velocity of 1 07 m s to account for the reduction near the surface while p2 maintains a velocity of 1 00 m s the experimental vertical velocity measurements for p1 and p2 show a constant velocity through the water depth with minor differences of 0 03 m s for p1 and 0 01 m s for p2 between the maximum and minimum velocities over the water depth these values show a generally uniform vertical velocity exists for the profiled current cases similar to the u case the profiled current cases have a much greater standard deviation in the experimental results particularly nearest the surface of the water with p1 and p2 showing 0 060 m s and 0 030 m s respectively while a smaller standard deviation was observed towards the base of the flume with p1 and p2 giving 0 012 m s and 0 008 m s respectively the standard deviation shows the unsteadiness in the water most likely due to vortex shedding in the flow from the stationary wave maker paddles the standard deviation decreases towards the base of the flume where the influence of the wave maker is less prominent the volumetrically averaged streamwise velocity over the turbine swept area w v o l was calculated to provide a consistent estimate of the flow conditions upstream of the turbine initially the w at each water depth was used in the calculation of the w v o l however analysis of each velocity time series over the water depth showed that while the uniform flow cases were normally distributed the profiled velocity results showed a negative skew for a normally distributed data set the most frequently occurring value mode and the central value of the data set mean occur at the same value however when a data set is skewed there can be large differences between the values for the mean and mode fig 11 a shows a histogram of the lda time series at a water depth of 0 55 m from the swl for the u flow case where the mean and mode values are almost identical with a 0 1 difference fig 11b and c show the histograms at a water depth of 0 4 m from the swl for p1 and p2 respectively the distributions show a much greater disparity between the mean and mode values with a difference of 24 for p1 and 6 for p2 as shown in table 10 for skewed data sets the mean value is not representative of the predominant flow conditions at a specific water depth as it is the mode which is the most frequently occurring streamwise velocity to account for these differences in the distributions the w v o l was recalculated using the mode instead of the mean values as shown in table 11 this alternative method of calculating the w v o l has a negligible effect on normally distributed data however for skewed data sets p2 gives a 0 3 difference when using the mode to calculate the w v o l while p1 shows a 4 difference the mode is therefore recommended for use in all following flow analyses as this value is more representative of skewed data sets but remains the same as the mean value in normally distributed data sets the cfd model results show good agreement to the flow results obtained experimentally as shown in table 12 the streamwise and vertical velocity results fig 10 show a difference of 2 of the w v o l for all cases apart from the u case vertical velocity which shows differences up to 4 these differences between the experimental and cfd streamwise velocity are small confirming that the velocity profile imposed at the inlet of the cfd model has been maintained downstream and is therefore applying the appropriate flow conditions at the turbine location the differences in the vertical velocity results are also small however the cfd model fails to develop fluctuations in the vertical velocity profile as seen in the experimental results leading to a vertical velocity of 0 00 m s for all flow cases the streamwise velocity dominates the flow field and therefore variations in the vertical velocity input at the inlet have disappeared by the time the flow is measured 1 m upstream of the turbine location the experimental vertical velocity fluctuations could be due to intrinsic flume turbulence gaurier et al 2020b features which were not replicated in the cfd model as use of higher order modelling techniques would be necessary ie detached eddy simulation des or large eddy simulation les ebdon 2019 4 1 2 turbine characteristics due to the squared and cubic relationships of the w v o l used in the calculation of the performance characteristics a small under or over estimation in this value will result in an amplified error in the calculation of c q c t and c p for example the experimental performance characteristics for p1 p2 and u showed 8 12 1 and 0 2 difference respectively when using the w v o l calculated with the mean or mode these results show that the distribution of the velocity data sets can have a significant effect on the calculation of the performance characteristics when using the mean value and emphasises the importance of accurately estimating the inflow velocity to the tst fig 12 shows the performance characteristics c q c t and c p for the experimental results over a range of tsrs the uniform cfd results also over the full range of tsrs and the profiled cfd results at only a tsr of 4 the average values for each of the performance characteristics show good agreement across all three of the flow cases the maximum difference between the average c q c t and c p for each of the flow cases in the peak power region 3 tsr 5 was 0 01 0 06 and 0 04 respectively these differences are all 10 and are considered small especially as the mean values for each data set are within the limits of the standard deviation bars of the other data sets for all flow cases the performance characteristics estimated by the cfd models show good agreement with the experimental results lying within 1 standard deviation of the average table 13 shows the average experimental and cfd results for each performance characteristic at a tsr of 4 as well as the difference between them experimentally there is also significant differences in the standard deviation of the data sets between the uniform and profiled current cases p1 has the biggest average standard deviation around the mean for all performance characteristics giving an average standard deviation of 0 02 0 09 and 0 07 for c q c t and c p while p2 gives 0 01 0 03 and 0 03 and u has 0 01 0 02 and 0 02 respectively the presence of the wave maker when fully submerged causes a high level of disturbance to the current flow raising the wave maker by 20 cm reduces the unsteadiness in the flow while removing it completely as seen in the u flow case results in a significant reduction in the flow disturbances these differences in the wave maker positioning can clearly be seen in the difference of the standard deviation around the mean for each of the performance characteristics to further validate the current only cfd models the bm x on the turbine blades were compared with the experimental data a single turbine blade was analysed as the same trends were present on each of the three individual blades although each offset by 120 an initial comparison analysing the average bm x showed good agreement between the data sets as shown in table 14 the experimental bm x time series possessed unsteady flow features such as turbulence and unwanted noise which interfered with the measurement signal unlike the cfd simulations which were conducted in controlled conditions the unsteadiness in the experimental results made it difficult to directly identify specific patterns and features and therefore time synchronous averaging tsa was used to average the bm x fluctuations over multiple rotational cycles of a turbine blade tsa reduces the effect of noise on the signal and highlights the underlying cyclic bm x fluctuations over a single turbine rotation as shown in fig 13 this method has been proven to be effective in turbine performance characterisation without adversely affecting the frequency domain representations of the loadings developed allmark et al 2017 the experimental bm x results for the u flow case show a relatively steady velocity leading to a low noise content as shown in fig 13ai the average amplitude of fluctuation in the bm x is 0 45 nm for the u flow case due to stanchion interaction with each turbine blade increasing levels of unsteadiness in the flow can be observed in fig 13bi and fig 13ci which reflect changes in the flow characteristics for p1 and p2 induced by the presence of the wave maker this causes the average amplitude of fluctuation in the bm x to increase to 0 76 nm for p2 and 2 25 nm for p1 as the fluctuation is directly related to the shearing gradient in the velocity profile the same trend exists for the cfd bm x results however due to turbulence dissipation there is no noise present in the numerical simulation which leads to repeatable time series producing a much cleaner signal the experimental and cfd results show good agreement between the average bm x for all cases table 14 as well as the average amplitude of fluctuation in the bm x for p1 and p2 as shown in table 15 4 2 turbine performance under wave current conditions 4 2 1 flow characteristics the addition of a wave characteristic to each of the existing profiled current flows has a minor effect on the average velocity over the water depth with a maximum difference between cases of 5 fig 14 shows a comparison of the experimental and cfd model results for the average streamwise and vertical velocities given by each of the wave current cases the greatest difference between the experimental and the cfd results for the streamwise and vertical velocities at each water depth was 2 5 of the w v o l even though the vertical velocity results given by the cfd models do not develop the same profile as the experimental results nevertheless the experimental and cfd w v o l over the turbine swept area for each case were within 4 of one another as shown in table 16 and therefore deemed acceptable fig 15 and fig 16 show how the addition of a wave characteristic induces an oscillatory wave orbital velocity component around the average current flow these figures compare the experimental and cfd model results when operating under the conditions given by p1w1 and p2w2 respectively for both wave cases the amplitude of oscillation around the average current flow is greater towards the water surface decaying as the wave motion penetrates through the water depth for both the streamwise and vertical wave induced velocities as shown experimentally in table 17 the wave induced fluctuations for the streamwise and vertical velocities in the p2w2 case are greater than the p1w1 case in the top half of the water column however the wave induced oscillatory effects decay quicker in the p2w2 case this is because the oscillatory motions of a wave can penetrate the water column by up to half the wavelength sorensen 2006 and p1w1 has a greater wavelength of l 9 07 m in comparison to p2w2 which has l 5 61 m both wave cases are intermediate water waves so still have a significant vertical and horizontal velocity component at the base of the flume the turbine will therefore be subjected to considerable loads and fluctuations in these loads in both the horizontal and vertical directions throughout the 2 m water depth the cfd streamwise velocity results show good agreement with the experimental data however the vertical velocities have a larger discrepancy between the two data sets particularly towards the bottom of the water column whilst the wave induced fluctuations in the vertical velocity are comparable to the experimental values the cfd model does not reproduce the profiled gradient of the average experimental vertical velocities the magnitudes of the wave induced velocity fluctuations are shown in fig 17 a and fig 18 a the experimental and the cfd data sets show very good agreement with the greatest difference being 1 of the w v o l for both wave current cases the wave induced oscillations fluctuate around the current velocity with the same magnitude regardless of whether a uniform or profiled velocity gradient exists lloyd et al 2019b for the conditions given by p1w1 a single turbine blade experiences a maximum difference of 0 32 m s in the streamwise velocity as it passes through the different flow regions over the rotational cycle with a velocity of 0 82 m s at tdc and 1 14 m s at bottom dead centre bdc in comparison p2w2 has a difference of 0 24 m s over the rotational cycle with a velocity of 0 85 m s at tdc and 1 09 m s at bdc the current profile that the wave characteristic is superimposed upon will affect the amount of shear across the water depth and consequently the loadings imposed on the turbine the combination of wave and current interaction together will have a significantly greater effect across the turbine as opposed to current or wave only conditions figs 17b and 18b show the wave orbital components in the vertical direction for p1w1 and p2w2 with their average values subtracted this data shows that for the vertical wave orbital components good agreement is displayed by the experimental and cfd results for both wave current cases it is the differences in the average velocities which offsets the wave orbital components and therefore appears to agree less well all vertical velocity cfd results are within 1 standard deviation of the equivalent experimental values apart from at a distance from the swl of 0 8 and 1 2 m in the p2w2 case however at this water depth the greatest difference between the experimental and cfd results is 2 the surface elevation of the wave was measured at the turbine rotor plane z 3 88 m which gave a clear indication of the wave surface profile and allowed a direct comparison between the wave elevation and the induced turbine loadings fig 19 and fig 20 show the wave surface elevation over a 5 s time period for the experimental and cfd model results of p1w1 and p2w2 respectively experimentally figs 19 and 20 show a 5 s snapshot of the total data set however both the wave frequency and wave height were measured over 7 to 10 different tests and an average was obtained across the multiple runs to get a more representative average of the sample conditions table 18 shows the target and measured wave characteristics for the experimental results as well as the cfd model comparison the measured experimental results show good agreement to the target values input to the wave maker with 1 difference in the wave frequency the measured wave height for both cases are within 9 of the target values showing the variability present in this measurement a dominating current flow along with strong velocity variations induced by the surface waves caused deflection of the wave probes during the experimental testing these flow characteristics contribute to the unsteadiness of the readings but are hard to quantify the cfd results show stability after 40 s of run time and therefore show a repeating pattern after this point has been reached with a wave height of 0 081 m and 0 12 m for the conditions represented by p1w1 and p2w2 respectively these values show good agreement with the experimental results with only 1 3 difference for p1w1 and no difference in the average value for p2w2 the cfd average wave frequency and wave height are both 3 of the experimental values overall the cfd simulations accurately reproduce the wave and current conditions generated at the ifremer flume experimentally the differences between the experimental and cfd average velocity and wave orbital velocities are 3 of the w v o l the wave surface elevation produced by the cfd model is within 2 of the experimental results and the wave frequencies show 3 difference fig 21 shows the instantaneous flow conditions generated by the p2w2 cfd model as well as indicating the position of the wave crests 4 2 2 turbine characteristics fig 22 shows the experimental c q c t and c p for the five test cases calculated using the w v o l to account for the differing velocity profiles over the swept area of the turbine as detailed in table 16 strong agreement was found between the p1w1 and p2w2 flow cases for each of the performance characteristics with a maximum difference of 2 2 and 4 for c q c t and c p respectively over the peak power region 3 tsr 5 good agreement was also found between the average performance characteristics for the wave current and current only cases with the maximum difference for c q c t and c p 10 table 19 shows the performance characteristics for each of the flow cases at peak power tsr 4 showing the repeatability of the performance characteristics over a range of flow characteristics table 20 shows a comparison of the cfd and experimental average performance characteristics for the wave current cases at a tsr of 4 the c q c t and c p estimated by the cfd model at a tsr of 4 show good agreement with the experimental results all lying within 1 standard deviation of the average value and having a maximum difference of 10 the bm x for a single turbine blade was compared experimentally and numerically to further analyse the transient behaviour of the turbine under wave current conditions as described in section 4 1 2 the dominating fluctuation in the bm x for the current only cases was due to stanchion interaction and the impact of the velocity profiles with each turbine blade every rotation the introduction of waves incorporates an additional fluctuating component that affects the turbine loadings as shown by fig 23 under p1w1 conditions each turbine blade completes a full rotation every 0 7 s and interacts with the stanchion once during this time fig 23a the wave period of w1 is 2 0 s and therefore every 14 s the turbine will rotate 20 times while 7 waves propagate past the turbine the rotational frequency and the wave frequency result in a combined fundamental period of 14 s where the transient bm x alters over this 14 s window however each 14 s window will repeat the same pattern this window has been marked on fig 23 to show the repeating envelope while the rotational frequency is marked with a red arrow and each wave period is marked with a green arrow for the p2w2 case the time taken for a blade to do a single rotation is again 0 7 s while the wave period of w2 is 1 43 s fig 23b for this case the wave frequency is almost twice the rotational frequency and therefore both components are essentially in phase with one another this results in the bm x fluctuation being dominated by the wave interaction and only a small drop in the bm x can be seen due to the turbine blade interacting with the stanchion and differing flow velocities each full rotation the tsa method was applied to reduce the noise in the wave current time series and to accentuate the underlying fluctuations in the bm x results table 21 shows the average experimental and cfd bm x values which show good agreement between the cases fig 24 shows the average experimental and cfd bm x on a turbine blade calculated using tsa with the corresponding wave surface elevation positioned underneath for p1w1 and p2w2 the maximum and minimum fluctuation in the bm x coincides with the peak and trough of the wave surface elevation respectively this is shown both experimentally and numerically showing strong similarities between the shape and magnitude of fluctuation in the bm x these transient results however consist of multiple combined frequencies such as interaction with the stanchion and velocity profile at the rotational frequency and interaction with regular waves at the wave frequency a fast fourier transform fft was therefore conducted to decompose the time series into its dominant frequencies and quantify the magnitude of fluctuation in the bm x created by stanchion and wave interactions with the turbine fig 25 shows the fft analysis for the experimental and cfd bm x results for each wave current characteristic at a tsr of 4 the red arrows mark the rotational frequency of the turbine showing the combined interaction of the stanchion and velocity profile with a turbine blade while the green arrows mark the wave frequency for both wave current cases there are two peaks situated at the wave and rotational frequencies the peak at the rotational frequency 1 4 hz for both p1w1 and p2w2 shows good agreement with the amplitude of fluctuation in the bm x seen in the current only cases of p1 and p2 respectively as shown in table 22 this shows that the interaction of each turbine blade with the stanchion and velocity profile is the same regardless of the wave characteristics superimposed on the profiled current velocity the velocity profile in p2w2 is less shearing across the water depth than in p1w1 resulting in a smaller fluctuation in the bm x at the rotational frequency this observation agrees with analysis of the profiled current only conditions as shown in tables 15 and 22 the wave frequency of p2w2 shows a much greater amplitude of fluctuation in the bm x in comparison to the rotational frequency while in p1w1 both the wave and rotational frequency components have a similar amplitude of fluctuation this emphasises the considerable effect that a velocity profile across the water column can have on the loading fluctuations of the turbine table 22 shows that the uniform current only case has the smallest amplitude of fluctuation in the bm x of 0 5 nm there are no waves or profiled velocity gradients therefore the fluctuation in the bm x is solely due to interaction with the stanchion each rotation p2 introduces a small amount of shear to the current velocity through the water depth which increases the amplitude of fluctuation to 0 7 nm a further increase in the amount of shear in the current velocity p1 has a significant effect on the fluctuation in the bm x reaching a magnitude of 2 4 nm both the wave current cases p1w1 and p2w2 induce an amplitude of fluctuation in the bm x at the wave frequency of 2 2 2 7 nm similar to the amplitude of fluctuation caused by p1 therefore a highly shearing velocity profile such as p1 can have just as big an effect as the wave induced loadings of w1 and w2 experienced in this study an equally important factor to consider is the phase of the wave in comparison to the position of a turbine blade in its rotational cycle if these two components are in phase this can substantially increase the magnitude of the loading fluctuations that a single turbine blade experiences as found by ordonez sanchez et al 2016 however when these components are out of phase the impact of the loading fluctuations would be more frequent but with a smaller magnitude it is important to minimise large loading fluctuations and therefore control strategies can be developed and used to monitor incoming waves and adjust the turbine rotational speed to optimise the blades position in comparison to the waves ordonez sanchez et al 2016 the cfd models shown by fig 25ii reproduce the results observed experimentally to within 1 standard deviation showing good agreement between the data sets both sets of results found that w2 has a greater effect on the amplitude of fluctuation in the bm x of a turbine blade in comparison to w1 validation of cfd models using uniform and profiled current only conditions as well as combined wave current characteristics has been successfully achieved for a 1 20th scale tst in the peak power operational region the cfd models reflect the experimental conditions to within 1 standard deviation for multiple flow and turbine parameters such as turbine performance characteristics streamwise and vertical velocity data wave surface elevation and bm x blade loadings further analysis can now be carried out to investigate transient loading features as a result of the different flow conditions 4 3 cfd comparison of transient turbine loadings current only and wave current blade hub and total turbine thrust and torque loadings were investigated using cfd simulations as individual component loadings were not measured during the experimental testing it is therefore assumed that the data presented by the cfd models would be representative of the experimental thrust and torque data as a result of prior validation using alternative parameters the average thrust and torque loadings show good similarity between each of the five types of flow condition tested u p1 p2 p1w1 p2w2 with small variations between cases due to differences in the calculated w v o l table 23 shows how these average thrust and torque loadings are not significantly affected by the different wave and current characteristics fig 26 shows the transient thrust and torque loadings for a single blade the hub and the turbine total for each of the five test cases u p1 p2 p1w1 p2w2 the surface elevation of the two wave cases w1 and w2 are also shown in fig 26iv to demonstrate comparisons between the surface elevation and loadings experienced for the wave current cases fig 26ai shows that for the current only cases the transient cycle of the thrust on each turbine blade is repeated with the peak and trough of the results aligned with the rotational frequency of the turbine 0 7 s the amplitude of fluctuation around the average thrust is 1 03 n 10 02 n and 2 65 n for u p1 and p2 respectively which shows that the fluctuation in the thrust on a single turbine blade for p1 is 3 times that of p2 and 10 times the u flow case for the wave current cases the loading fluctuations experienced by a single turbine blade is a complex combination of interactions between the rotational speed of a blade passing the stanchion the amount of shear in the velocity profile and the propagating surface waves the amplitude of fluctuation around the average thrust is 10 91 n and 12 48 n for p1w1 and p2w2 respectively which is similar to the fluctuation in the thrust for p1 such a finding confirms that shear induced flow structures as well as wave induced conditions will be significant drivers of loading perturbations and must be quantified to correctly design tst structures the transient torque loadings for a single turbine blade in current only conditions show a similar trend to the thrust loadings as shown in fig 26bi the amplitude of fluctuation around the average torque is 0 79 nm 1 39 nm 0 86 nm 1 14 nm and 1 49 nm for u p1 p2 p1w1 and p2w2 respectively the fluctuation in the torque on a single blade is greatest for the highest shearing velocity p1 and the wave cases again the different flow conditions have a negligible effect on the average torque on a single blade but does affect the fluctuation around the average value there are small discrepancies between the phase of the cyclic loadings for each of the flow cases as the angular velocity of the turbine was set to reflect the results obtained experimentally resulting in minor changes between the rotational period of the turbine fig 26aii and fig 26bii show the respective thrust and torque on the hub for each of the flow cases tested the presence of a velocity profile has a negligible effect on the fluctuation of the thrust and torque on the hub as seen for cases u p1 and p2 the hub is static in the water column and at a central depth where the streamwise velocity for all cases is 1 00 m s it would be expected that the loadings imparted on the hub for all flow conditions are similar however the introduction of surface waves increases the fluctuation in the thrust to 1 2 n while the amplitude of fluctuation in the thrust without waves was 0 05 n the surface waves did not affect the fluctuation in the torque however remaining close to 0 nm fig 26aiii shows the significant difference observed for flow cases with and without waves in the total turbine all blades and hub transient thrust results when summing to calculate the total turbine loadings the fluctuation observed in the thrust on a single turbine blade is cancelled out due to each blade being 120 out of phase with one another therefore when the individual loadings are summed the amplitude of fluctuation is significantly reduced it is still critical to account for the stanchion interaction with each turbine blade in terms of blade design fatigue life and manufacture however this fluctuation is not visible in the total turbine loading results these results emphasise the importance of analysing the turbine component loadings individually as well as in a combined total the amplitude of fluctuation around the average total thrust for the current only cases is 0 28 n 0 19 n and 0 74 n for u p1 and p2 respectively as shown in table 24 when surface waves are introduced the amplitude of fluctuation around the average total thrust increases to 33 6 n and 37 8 n for p1w1 and p2w2 respectively which is around 35 times greater than the fluctuation in the current only cases the maximum and minimum peaks in the transient total thrust results directly coincide with when a crest or trough of the wave propagates past the turbine as shown in fig 26aiv a similar trend is observed in the transient total torque results as shown in fig 26biii the amplitude of fluctuation around the average total torque is 0 02 nm 0 02 nm and 0 07 nm for u p1 and p2 respectively as shown in table 24 the amplitude of fluctuation for p1w1 and p2w2 are 3 39 nm and 3 92 nm respectively which is again about 35 times greater than the fluctuation in the current only results the fluctuation in the loadings is significantly greater for the cases incorporating waves than without and peaks in the loadings align with the crests and troughs of the wave surface elevation as also observed in the thrust results these results show the substantial effect that surface waves can have on the loadings of a tst it is the cyclic nature of the wave induced loadings that can critically affect the fatigue life of the turbine components numerical analysis allows researchers and developers to quantify the impact that different flow characteristics can have on marine devices placed in conditions specific to identified tidal test sites 5 conclusions this study presents an experimental test campaign using a 3 bladed 1 20 scale hatt performed at the ifremer wave current flume which is used to validate numerical models under current only and wave current conditions the average and transient turbine thrust torque and out of plane bending moment were measured both experimentally and numerically along with the flow velocity and wave height these measurements allowed the turbine performance characteristics and loads to be calculated the main conclusions from the study are the turbine was fully characterised under uniform flows experimentally and numerically providing a base case of the simplest flow conditions for comparisons against more complex flow investigations the mode of the streamwise velocity was found to accurately represent the predominant flow conditions for all experimental data distributions when using the mean and the mode in the calculation of the volumetrically averaged streamwise velocity over the swept area of the turbine differences of up to 4 were found which consequently amplify differences in the calculation of c q c t and c p of up to 12 average turbine performance characteristics were unaffected by the presence of a profiled velocity gradient and showed similar results to tests under uniform current conditions the amplitude of fluctuation in the out of plane bending moment on a turbine blade increased as the shear in the velocity profile intensified with the highest shearing velocity profile inducing fluctuations 5 times that of the uniform current case similar results were found in the turbine blade thrust and torque results the total thrust and torque loadings showed a reduction in the amplitude of fluctuation due to each turbine blade being 120 out of phase and therefore cancelling out the fluctuation in the loadings the average performance characteristics were unaffected by the inclusion of regular waves waves induce additional fluctuations in the out of plane bending moment on a single turbine blade however the amplitude of these fluctuations is no greater than that caused by the highest shearing velocity profile cyclic blade loadings are induced by velocity profiles and waves when analysing the total turbine loadings only fluctuations induced by wave motion can be observed with the maximum minimum loadings being aligned with the crest trough of the wave respectively with the inclusion of waves the amplitude of fluctuation around the average thrust and torque is 35 times greater that in current only flows optimised cfd models were developed to simulate combined wave and current interaction using ansys cfx uniform and profiled current flows as well as two regular intermediate stokes 2nd order theory wave models were tested and successfully validated using multiple experimental flow and turbine parameters from the ifremer wave current flume a set of guidelines were defined which allow any flume geometry and wave characteristic within the stokes 2nd order theory limits to be simulated in a free surface model a hexa mesh using 120 cells over the length of a wave δz and 10 cells over the wave height δy was found to create a mesh with good numerical accuracy and reasonable computational run time these lab scale results can inform researchers and developers of similar outcomes using full scale tidal devices the importance of numerical modelling is also highlighted as its use in the initial stages of device development can reduce the costs associated with device design as well as avoiding the need for a full experimental test campaign and therefore the operational costs of laboratory testing the wave and current cases used in this study present a controlled set of ocean flow conditions further investigation would look to emulate more realistic ocean flow regimes using realistic high shearing velocity profiles and modelling irregular

21080,a comparison of a tidal turbine s performance and structural loads is conducted using lab scale numerical models and experimental testing under multiple current only and wave current conditions at the ifremer wave current flume experimental testing used to validate cfd models was accomplished using a 0 9 m diameter 3 bladed tidal turbine and had a blockage ratio of 8 while the turbine was submerged initial investigations analysed the performance and loads on the turbine under uniform and profiled current only conditions the presence of a profiled velocity gradient was found to have a negligible effect on the average performance characteristics however transient thrust torque and out of plane bending moment loads experienced much greater variations these load fluctuations were further increased with increasing levels of shear in the velocity profile while peaks in the turbine loads coincided with its rotational frequency the addition of regular stokes 2nd order theory waves added to the complexity of the flow conditions experienced by the turbine the effect on the average performance characteristics were negligible while the total turbine thrust and torque fluctuations increased by 35 times that of the current only cases peaks in the loads aligned with the wave surface elevation indicating the importance of transient analyses of dynamic loads keywords tidal stream

s energy information administration 2017 however it is unsustainable and undesirable to generate electricity from fossil fuels particularly due to global concerns about climate change and global warming which are a direct result of increasing concentrations of green house gases ghg from burning fossil fuels the european commission ec has set targets to reduce ghg emissions progressively and commit to net zero by 2050 european commission 2020a the current framework sets out to reduce ghg emissions by 40 improve energy efficiency by 32 5 and to secure 32 of europe s energy from renewable sources by 2030 european commission 2020b the oceans cover around 70 of the earth s surface and is therefore an extensive and highly predictable renewable energy source which is yet to be fully utilised europe is reported to hold 20 30 of the global tidal resource of which 80 is located in and around the coastlines of the uk and france if fully exploited using current technology wave and

hatts mean that over 75 of companies are developing full scaled hatt devices over other tidal stream turbine tst devices european commission 2017 ocean energy europe 2018 a significant problem for tidal stream energy developers is the spatio temporal complexity in the flow which makes deployment and device survivability a challenge chen and lam 2015 togneri and masters 2016 to enable hatt devices to become commercially viable device components must be able to withstand substantial spatial and temporal sub surface forces generated by tidal currents surface waves and turbulence to minimise device downtime as well as operation and maintenance costs thus help reduce the cost of electricity generation lab scale experiments can be conducted to reproduce realistic ocean conditions and to quantify the magnitude of these sub surface forces prior to the full scale design manufacture and testing of a device tsts have been widely characterised under uniform current conditions allmark et al 2018 bahaj et al 2007 gaurier et al 2015 maganga et al 2010 however it is important to understand the impact of additional loadings induced by profiled current conditions as well as surface waves which create oscillatory motions penetrating the water column by up to half the wavelength sorensen 2006 the ocean environment will never experience a regular wave field yet regular waves of relevant heights and wave periods can be used to quantify the extreme loadings experienced by the tst components holst et al 2015 previous studies barltrop et al 2007 galloway et al 2010 gaurier et al 2020a 2020b henriques et al 2014 lust et al 2013 luznik et al 2013 martinez et al 2020 ordonez sanchez et al 2016 porter et al 2020 sos et al 2017 have investigated the performance of a tst under regular wave conditions and found that the average performance characteristics were very similar to tests conducted under current only conditions however oscillatory motions induced by waves presented significant cyclic variations responsible for fluctuations in the thrust and torque loadings in excess of 35 of the mean rotor load galloway et al 2010 ordonez sanchez et al 2019 this can lead to extreme loadings on the drivetrain and accelerated fatigue of the individual turbine components with advances in computational processing times and the accessibility of software computational fluid dynamics cfd has become a widely adopted tool to develop numerical simulations to characterise the performance and loadings of marine devices in various flow conditions numerical models still require validation however the number of experiments needed is less than required for a full experimental test campaign steady state analyses can be used to model time independent flows however analyses which account for transient flow features provide results of a higher resolution than steady state models ansys cfx modelling guide hafeez et al 2019 transient simulations are necessary to examine cyclic loadings induced by complex flow features although at a much greater computational expense than steady state simulations transient cfd models have been used to characterise tst devices

2019b marques machado et al 2018 tian et al 2018 however few studies have investigated the combined effects of a profiled velocity gradient waves and turbine interaction a study by tatum et al 2016 analysed the individual turbine component loadings induced by a uniform current velocity and surface waves finding that wave action had a significant effect on the fluctuation of the thrust and power as well as the shaft bending moment interaction with a velocity profile was also investigated and found that the addition of a profiled velocity gradient had a significant effect on the bending moment of the turbine blades investigating the significance of individual blade loadings experimentally requires the use of fully instrumented model tsts which is expensive and difficult to achieve in controlled test scenarios numerical modelling can therefore provide a cheaper and alternative method to quantify these complex loadings which are crucial for developers needing to make informed decisions about the turbine rotor and blade design prior to their manufacture the focus of this study is to examine the impact that complex flow conditions such as profiled velocity gradients or surface waves can have on the individual turbine component loadings and performance of a hatt the research methods used include experimental lab scale testing at the french research institute for exploitation of the sea ifremer wave current flume as well as the use of numerical cfd modelling using ansys cfx software this paper presents the methodology used to develop a free surface multiphase model capable of simulating turbine rotation in uniform and profiled current flows as well as in regular wave fields all numerical models are initially validated using lab scale experimental data allowing further investigation into the transient turbine loadings which were unattainable through the experimental test campaign this study presents the turbine performance under uniform and profiled current only conditions as well as under wave current conditions using stokes 2nd order theory s2ot regular waves which are superimposed upon the profiled current velocities comparisons are made between the numerical cfd models developed and experimental data obtained by cardiff and strathclyde universities at the ifremer wave current flume 2 experimental testing 2 1 model scale turbine a 1 20 scale hatt was designed and manufactured by the cardiff marine energy research group cmerg mason jones 2010 as shown in fig 1 a the blade design was based upon the wortmann fx63 137 aerofoil as shown in fig 1b while the optimum settings for this design are summarised in table 1 a full description of the blade and turbine design and manufacture are detailed by allmark et al 2020 and ellis et al 2018 respectively in order to quantify the dynamic loadings on the turbine under various flow conditions the turbine was fully instrumented the rotor thrust torque transducers and the out of plane bending moment transducers for each turbine blade had a sample rate of 200 hz and were calibrated as detailed in lloyd 2020 a haidenhain optical encoder was used to measure the turbine position with a sample rate of 45 hz and moisture sensors were installed to detect for leakages a full uncertainty analysis of the measured variables used in the experimental testing can be found in allmark et al 2020 lloyd 2020 with a summary presented in table 2 2 2 experimental set up experimental testing of the model scale hatt was carried out at the ifremer wave current flume boulogne sur mer france gaurier et al 2018 the flume dimensions are 4 m wide 2 m deep and 18 m long as shown in fig 2 with a general flow turbulence of 3 gaurier et al 2013 the flume has the capability to produce streamwise flow velocities between 0 1 and 2 2 m s with and without waves regular wave generation between f 0 5 2 hz is achieved using 8 displacement paddles which span the full 4 m width of the flume and when fully submerged sit 0 5 m into the water column a physical beach was located at the opposite end of the flume to the wave maker to dampen the waves and prevent reflection from the end of the tank for all experimental testing the turbine was installed 4 m downstream from the wave maker at a depth of 1 m and centralised in the cross stream direction this gave a clearance of 0 61 27 of the water depth between the turbine positioned at top dead centre tdc and the water surface in still water conditions there was a blockage ratio of 8 while the turbine was submerged in the ifremer wave current flume this ratio was low enough not to interfere with the flow characteristics howell et al 2009 though for direct comparison the cfd models reflected the flume boundary conditions as discussed in section 3 a 0 09 m stanchion supported the turbine and held it stationary within the flume the pitch angle for each turbine blade was set to 6 0 5 experimental tests were carried out with speed control at a number of angular velocities in order to generate performance characteristics over a range of tip speed ratios tsrs λ 0 7 based on the average streamwise water velocity w as shown by equation 1 1 λ ω r w a dantec 2d laser doppler anemometry lda was used to measure the instantaneous flow velocities in the streamwise and vertical directions with a sample rate of 200 hz the measurement volume was initially aligned 1 m upstream of the centre of the turbine nose cone it was then moved to measure the flow velocity at multiple locations through the water column at depths of 0 55 0 68 0 81 0 94 1 1 13 1 26 1 39 and 1 52 m from the swl for the uniform current cases and every 0 2 m between 0 4 m and 1 6 m from the swl for the profiled current cases this covered the full diameter of the turbine which occupied a water depth between 0 55 m and 1 45 m from the swl fig 3 shows the setup of the turbine and the measurement equipment at the ifremer wave current flume a churchill controls capacitance type wave probe was used to track the water surface elevation with a sample rate of 100 hz an uncertainty analysis for the flow measurement devices is detailed in lloyd 2020 2 3 experimental procedure 2 3 1 current only cases current only experiments were carried out with both uniform and profiled flows for all test cases a target streamwise velocity of 1 0 m s was used which equated to a chord based reynolds number of r e 0 7 c h o r d 6 48 x 10 4 allmark et al 2020 as defined by equation 2 where c 0 7 is the chord length at 70 of the turbine radius previous experimental testing confirmed that reynolds effects become negligible with a variation 1 for reynold s numbers above r e 0 7 c h o r d 6 48 x 10 4 allmark et al 2020 2 r e 0 7 c h o r d ρ c 0 7 w μ flow straighteners placed in the upstream area of the flume aided the generation of uniform flow conditions u while the wave maker paddles were fully removed nowm profiled flow conditions could be generated by positioning the wave maker paddles in the upper section of the water column to create a blockage the wave maker could be positioned in two different locations wm00 or wm20 creating two different velocity profiles profile 1 p1 and profile 2 p2 respectively wm00 and wm20 refer to the wave maker being either fully submerged to a depth of 50cm raised by 0 cm or partially submerged to a depth of 30cm raised by 20 cm in the top of the water column respectively for all current only cases the wave maker was not operational even though it was used to induce the differing velocity profiles each of the flow scenarios are depicted in fig 4 and summarised in table 3 2 3 2 wave current cases two different regular waves were used to investigate the effect of combined wave current conditions on the performance and loadings of the model scale tst both waves were intermediate s2ot waves and were superimposed upon the profiled current velocity produced by the wave maker position wave 1 w1 was superimposed upon p1 and wave 2 w2 upon p2 these waves were tested in a water depth h of 2 m but would be representative of tidal sites with a water depth of between 25 and 40 m by scaling the wave characteristics to match the relative depth and wave steepness criteria this would result in a wave height h wave period t r and wavelength l as described by w1s and w2s as shown in table 4 five different types of flow condition were tested three current only u p1 p2 and two wave current cases p1w1 p2w2 as outlined in tables 3 and 4 the turbine was operated at a range of angular velocities to generate a full set of performance curves for the power coefficient c p thrust coefficient c t and torque coefficient c q as defined in the nomenclature the flume and tst were brought up to speed before data capture commenced recording flow and turbine measurements for between 100 and 200 s 3 numerical methodology cfd was used to create numerical models to replicate the testing carried out experimentally at the ifremer flume this enabled a direct comparison between the numerical and experimental results eliminating the need for any blockage correction errors ansys icem 18 0 ansys inc n d was used to create the geometry and mesh while ansys cfx 18 0 ansys inc n d was used for the physics setup of the model and the solver the model development has been split up into the following sections 3 1 domain geometry and mesh characteristics 3 2 model setup and 3 3 current flow and wave generation 3 1 domain geometry and mesh characteristics fig 5 shows an overview of the model geometry which was individually optimised dependent on the flow conditions and experimental facility dimensions lloyd et al 2019b the model domain was split up into a main fluid domain and a rotating subdomain which enclosed the turbine a free surface model was developed to allow 2 phase multiphase flow where both water and air phases are present the free surface interface was located at a water depth of 2 m which is 70 of the overall domain height 2 86 m leaving the remaining upper section of the domain as air lloyd et al 2019b the width of the domain was the same as the ifremer flume 4 m to ensure the blockage ratio of the turbine was the same between experimental and numerical testing the domain length was varied based on requirements for each individual simulation for current only conditions a domain length of 20 m was used allowing for adequate wake development while being suitably long that the domain outlet does not interfere with the turbine characteristics ebdon 2019 ellis et al 2018 mason jones 2010 for wave current simulations the length of the domain was varied depending on the simulated wave characteristic wavelength as shown in fig 6 the domain length was found to be optimal when set to allow the propagation of 8 10 waves lloyd et al 2019b before reaching the end of the domain a numerical beach of twice the wavelength 2 l was incorporated to prevent any reflection of the waves from the end of the domain which corresponded to a main domain length of 80 m and 50 m for simulations using w1 and w2 respectively this was imposed by applying a general momentum source acting in the direction of wave propagation which was used to force the velocity in this region to be the same as the current velocity removing the oscillatory effects of the wave lloyd 2020 a cylindrical rotating subdomain was created to enclose the turbine blades and hub as shown in fig 5 this allowed the multiple frames of reference mfr technique ansys cfx theory guide to be used allowing the turbine subdomain to rotate around the z axis at a set angular velocity simulating the turbine rotation the transient rotor stator interface model was used to account for the transient interaction effects at the sliding interface between these two domains the cylinder was 1 3 m in diameter and 0 4 m wide as recommended by ellis et al 2018 as it was found that a smaller diameter would influence the turbine results yet a bigger diameter had no effect table 5 provides a summary of the dimensions used for each numerical model the mesh for the main fluid domain was generated using a top down blocking strategy to create a structured hexa mesh ansys cfx modelling guide hexa meshing is highly space efficient and is advantageous in comparison to an unstructured tetra mesh as it requires less computational points having a higher spatial resolution and better aspect ratio all of which increase the resolution of the simulation raval 2008 specifically for wave modelling it is important to have a region of increased mesh resolution around the air water interface spanning the entire wave height to maintain the desired surface resolution at all points along the wavelength optimum mesh sizing around the free surface used 10 cells over the wave height and 120 cells per wavelength lloyd et al 2019b as shown in fig 7 table 6 presents the mesh sizing parameters for the main fluid domain in each simulation the mesh around the turbine was achieved using a bottom up meshing method creating a surface mesh which was refined to produce a finer volume mesh establishing a tetra mesh inflation layers were added to the surface of the turbine to increase the boundary layer resolution perpendicular to the surface table 7 shows the turbine subdomain optimum mesh sizing parameters based on a mesh study conducted by lloyd et al 2019a the main fluid domain and turbine subdomain meshes were combined to create an overall mesh suitable for simulating s2ot waves uniform and profiled current flows as well as measuring turbine performance and loading characteristics fig 7 shows an example of the final mesh used to simulate wave current and turbine interaction using the characteristics of p2w2 the maximum aspect ratio for all mesh components is well within the recommendation of 1000 ansys inc n d the number of elements in the final meshes are between 7 4 and 15 5 million depending on the flow characteristics used in the simulation further information about the mesh studies undertaken and types of mesh used can be found in lloyd 2020 3 2 model setup ansys cfx 18 0 ansys inc n d was used to define the physics of the model and to enable the numerical simulation to be solved a homogenous air water multiphase model was used to simulate free surface flows the two phases are separated by a distinct interface using volume fractions to specify the fraction of the control volume that each fluid phase occupies ansys cfx theory guide and used an activated buoyancy scheme the shear stress transport sst statistical turbulence model menter 1996 was used to close the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations due to its improved performance under adverse pressure gradients in comparison to the k omega k ω and k epsilon k ε turbulence models ansys cfx modelling guide as well as being proven to have no detrimental effects on the generation and propagation of regular waves alberello et al 2017 finnegan and goggins 2012 2015 lal and elangovan 2008 a transient analysis was carried out to capture the time dependent nature of the flow and the dynamic loading on the turbine it was necessary to define a physical time step δ t to control the simulation and capture the required level of detail in the simulation as ansys cfx solver uses an implicit solution method ansys cfx theory guide the time step for current only models incorporating a turbine δ t t u r b equated to the turbine rotating by a maximum of θ 5 per time step ansys cfx reference guide mcsherry et al 2011 as shown by equation 3 therefore the time step for each model would be varied according to the selected angular velocity for simulations with waves a time step δ t w a v e of t a 50 was found to be optimum lloyd 2020 as shown by equation 4 for combined wave current and turbine simulations the smaller time step of δ t w a v e and δ t t u r b was utilised to ensure a sufficient level of temporal resolution was achieved further information on setting the time step can be found in lloyd 2020 3 δ t t u r b θ ω 180 π 4 δ t w a v e t a 50 the boundary conditions used for the current only and wave current models are summarised in table 8 while fig 8 shows the locations of these boundaries the main difference between the two types of model was the use of an opening at the inlet and outlet for simulations incorporating wave motion this allowed bidirectional flow into and out of the domain which was necessary to prevent the model from crashing when simulating regular waves each simulation began with a 1 0 m s current only flow using a uniform or profiled velocity gradient depending on the type of simulation if the model required wave generation the wave characteristic was superimposed onto the current flow after 2 s of run time in order to allow the current flow to establish before the wave conditions were incorporated five models were generated with different combinations of current only flow u p1 p2 and wave current flow p1w1 p2w2 the same range of tsrs 0 7 as used in the experimental testing were simulated for the uniform flow cases however due to the computational expense of modelling the profiled current cases and wave cases only a single simulation for each model was executed previous experimental work allmark et al 2020 found that the peak power of the turbine was at a tsr of 4 and therefore these complex model types used an angular velocity equivalent to a tsr of 4 each model was set to run for 100 s with stability in each simulation reached between 40 and 70 s of run time monitor points were placed at a central width in the domain 2 m upstream of the turbine at locations between y 0 1 m and y 1 9 m this enabled a visualisation of the turbine inflow conditions to be achieved over time the torque q thrust t and out of plane bending moment b m x on the turbine blades were monitored every time step to examine the transient loadings and observe the convergence of the simulation all simulations were run using a high performance computing hpc cluster hawk provided through access from cardiff university simulations were run using between 80 and 280 processors per model the simulations took 175 1207 h for the current only models and 2735 4855 h for the wave current models dependent on the complexity of the simulation 3 3 current flow and wave generation for uniform flow models u the flow characteristics were added to the inlet of the model mathematically to reach a streamwise velocity of 1 0 m s input using cartesian coordinates as shown in table 9 for models using a profiled current flow p1 or p2 average steady state data obtained experimentally was input to the model using a profile method boundary condition at the inlet this boundary condition used interpolated values from the flow profiles obtained during experimental testing cfx expression language cel expressions were then used to refer to the imported data using interpolation functions the aim was to directly compare cfd simulations and experimental data therefore it was important to replicate the current profile generated at the experimental facilities into the models this method ensured minimal changes were made when transferring experimental data across to be used in numerical models models incorporating regular waves w1 or w2 had an additional input at the inlet of the domain achieved by defining the surface wave elevation and the s2ot sub surface velocity components the time dependent wave velocity components were superimposed upon the preestablished steady state velocity profile the flow conditions in the flume can be presented as shown in equation 5 where w t is the instantaneous velocity in the streamwise direction w is the time averaged velocity value w is the fluctuating component and w r is the wave orbital component 5 w t w w w r the addition of surface waves introduces an oscillatory component to the flow which increases the complexity of the flow regime and can have a significant impact on marine devices placed in these regions regular waves travelling in the same direction as the current flow will have a wave period t r angular frequency ω r and wave celerity c r in a frame of reference that is moving at the same velocity as the average current w in a stationary frame of reference the waves will have a wave period t a angular frequency ω a and wave celerity c a waves induce oscillatory motions through a horizontal w a and vertical v a velocity component which are calculated in a stationary frame of reference using equations 6 and 7 mani 2012 where k is the wave number fig 9 shows the key variables used to describe wave motion with the coordinate frame set with the z axis in the direction of wave propagation y axis in the gravity direction and x axis perpendicular to the yz plane the positional depth is referred to as y with the still water level swl at y 0 and the seabed at y h the surface elevation η of the wave fluctuates around the swl by a set amount known as the amplitude a of the wave as detailed by equation 8 6 w a w

there is an interaction between the wave and current components which causes the angular frequency ω r of the waves to change due to the doppler shift galloway et al 2010 this change can be observed in equation 9 9 ω r ω a k w the relative depth h l of a wave is important in defining its characteristics and can be classified as deep intermediate or shallow henriques et al 2016 the regular waves used in this study were intermediate depth water waves 0 04 h l 0 5 with w1 having a relative depth of 0 221 and w2 of 0 357 as shown in table 4 intermediate water waves have circular velocity orbitals near the water surface which become elliptical towards the seabed due to interaction between the water and the seabed as the water depth decreases 4 experimental and numerical results comparison 4 1 turbine performance under current only conditions 4 1 1 flow characteristics a comparison of the experimental and cfd current only u p1 and p2 model results for the streamwise and vertical velocities are shown in fig 10 the bars on the experimental results represent 1 standard deviation either side of the mean experimentally the biggest difference in the velocity over the water depth for the uniform current case was 0 01 m s in the streamwise direction and 0 02 m s in the vertical direction the average standard deviation for the streamwise velocities were 0 009 m s while the vertical velocities showed even less variation with a standard deviation of 0 003 m s the small differences in the velocity over the water depth and consistent standard deviation show that the flow conditions through the water depth were steady and uniform validating the assumption that the flume possessed uniform current conditions both p1 and p2 show a considerable reduction in the streamwise velocity towards the surface of the water compared to the input flow velocity of 1 00 m s due to the presence of the wave maker p1 has the greatest reduction in streamwise velocity near the water surface due to the wave maker being fully submerged to a depth of 50 cm in the top of the water column p2 shows a smaller reduction in velocity as the wave maker was raised to a depth of 30 cm leading to less of a shearing effect through the water depth near the base of the flume p1 has an increased streamwise velocity of 1 07 m s to account for the reduction near the surface while p2 maintains a velocity of 1 00 m s the experimental vertical velocity measurements for p1 and p2 show a constant velocity through the water depth with minor differences of 0 03 m s for p1 and 0 01 m s for p2 between the maximum and minimum velocities over the water depth these values show a generally uniform vertical velocity exists for the profiled current cases similar to the u case the profiled current cases have a much greater standard deviation in the experimental results particularly nearest the surface of the water with p1 and p2 showing 0 060 m s and 0 030 m s respectively while a smaller standard deviation was observed towards the base of the flume with p1 and p2 giving 0 012 m s and 0 008 m s respectively the standard deviation shows the unsteadiness in the water most likely due to vortex shedding in the flow from the stationary wave maker paddles the standard deviation decreases towards the base of the flume where the influence of the wave maker is less prominent the volumetrically averaged streamwise velocity over the turbine swept area w v o l was calculated to provide a consistent estimate of the flow conditions upstream of the turbine initially the w at each water depth was used in the calculation of the w v o l however analysis of each velocity time series over the water depth showed that while the uniform flow cases were normally distributed the profiled velocity results showed a negative skew for a normally distributed data set the most frequently occurring value mode and the central value of the data set mean occur at the same value however when a data set is skewed there can be large differences between the values for the mean and mode fig 11 a shows a histogram of the lda time series at a water depth of 0 55 m from the swl for the u flow case where the mean and mode values are almost identical with a 0 1 difference fig 11b and c show the histograms at a water depth of 0 4 m from the swl for p1 and p2 respectively the distributions show a much greater disparity between the mean and mode values with a difference of 24 for p1 and 6 for p2 as shown in table 10 for skewed data sets the mean value is not representative of the predominant flow conditions at a specific water depth as it is the mode which is the most frequently occurring streamwise velocity to account for these differences in the distributions the w v o l was recalculated using the mode instead of the mean values as shown in table 11 this alternative method of calculating the w v o l has a negligible effect on normally distributed data however for skewed data sets p2 gives a 0 3 difference when using the mode to calculate the w v o l while p1 shows a 4 difference the mode is therefore recommended for use in all following flow analyses as this value is more representative of skewed data sets but remains the same as the mean value in normally distributed data sets the cfd model results show good agreement to the flow results obtained experimentally as shown in table 12 the streamwise and vertical velocity results fig 10 show a difference of 2 of the w v o l for all cases apart from the u case vertical velocity which shows differences up to 4 these differences between the experimental and cfd streamwise velocity are small confirming that the velocity profile imposed at the inlet of the cfd model has been maintained downstream and is therefore applying the appropriate flow conditions at the turbine location the differences in the vertical velocity results are also small however the cfd model fails to develop fluctuations in the vertical velocity profile as seen in the experimental results leading to a vertical velocity of 0 00 m s for all flow cases the streamwise velocity dominates the flow field and therefore variations in the vertical velocity input at the inlet have disappeared by the time the flow is measured 1 m upstream of the turbine location the experimental vertical velocity fluctuations could be due to intrinsic flume turbulence gaurier et al 2020b features which were not replicated in the cfd model as use of higher order modelling techniques would be necessary ie detached eddy simulation des or large eddy simulation les ebdon 2019 4 1 2 turbine characteristics due to the squared and cubic relationships of the w v o l used in the calculation of the performance characteristics a small under or over estimation in this value will result in an amplified error in the calculation of c q c t and c p for example the experimental performance characteristics for p1 p2 and u showed 8 12 1 and 0 2 difference respectively when using the w v o l calculated with the mean or mode these results show that the distribution of the velocity data sets can have a significant effect on the calculation of the performance characteristics when using the mean value and emphasises the importance of accurately estimating the inflow velocity to the tst fig 12 shows the performance characteristics c q c t and c p for the experimental results over a range of tsrs the uniform cfd results also over the full range of tsrs and the profiled cfd results at only a tsr of 4 the average values for each of the performance characteristics show good agreement across all three of the flow cases the maximum difference between the average c q c t and c p for each of the flow cases in the peak power region 3 tsr 5 was 0 01 0 06 and 0 04 respectively these differences are all 10 and are considered small especially as the mean values for each data set are within the limits of the standard deviation bars of the other data sets for all flow cases the performance characteristics estimated by the cfd models show good agreement with the experimental results lying within 1 standard deviation of the average table 13 shows the average experimental and cfd results for each performance characteristic at a tsr of 4 as well as the difference between them experimentally there is also significant differences in the standard deviation of the data sets between the uniform and profiled current cases p1 has the biggest average standard deviation around the mean for all performance characteristics giving an average standard deviation of 0 02 0 09 and 0 07 for c q c t and c p while p2 gives 0 01 0 03 and 0 03 and u has 0 01 0 02 and 0 02 respectively the presence of the wave maker when fully submerged causes a high level of disturbance to the current flow raising the wave maker by 20 cm reduces the unsteadiness in the flow while removing it completely as seen in the u flow case results in a significant reduction in the flow disturbances these differences in the wave maker positioning can clearly be seen in the difference of the standard deviation around the mean for each of the performance characteristics to further validate the current only cfd models the bm x on the turbine blades were compared with the experimental data a single turbine blade was analysed as the same trends were present on each of the three individual blades although each offset by 120 an initial comparison analysing the average bm x showed good agreement between the data sets as shown in table 14 the experimental bm x time series possessed unsteady flow features such as turbulence and unwanted noise which interfered with the measurement signal unlike the cfd simulations which were conducted in controlled conditions the unsteadiness in the experimental results made it difficult to directly identify specific patterns and features and therefore time synchronous averaging tsa was used to average the bm x fluctuations over multiple rotational cycles of a turbine blade tsa reduces the effect of noise on the signal and highlights the underlying cyclic bm x fluctuations over a single turbine rotation as shown in fig 13 this method has been proven to be effective in turbine performance characterisation without adversely affecting the frequency domain representations of the loadings developed allmark et al 2017 the experimental bm x results for the u flow case show a relatively steady velocity leading to a low noise content as shown in fig 13ai the average amplitude of fluctuation in the bm x is 0 45 nm for the u flow case due to stanchion interaction with each turbine blade increasing levels of unsteadiness in the flow can be observed in fig 13bi and fig 13ci which reflect changes in the flow characteristics for p1 and p2 induced by the presence of the wave maker this causes the average amplitude of fluctuation in the bm x to increase to 0 76 nm for p2 and 2 25 nm for p1 as the fluctuation is directly related to the shearing gradient in the velocity profile the same trend exists for the cfd bm x results however due to turbulence dissipation there is no noise present in the numerical simulation which leads to repeatable time series producing a much cleaner signal the experimental and cfd results show good agreement between the average bm x for all cases table 14 as well as the average amplitude of fluctuation in the bm x for p1 and p2 as shown in table 15 4 2 turbine performance under wave current conditions 4 2 1 flow characteristics the addition of a wave characteristic to each of the existing profiled current flows has a minor effect on the average velocity over the water depth with a maximum difference between cases of 5 fig 14 shows a comparison of the experimental and cfd model results for the average streamwise and vertical velocities given by each of the wave current cases the greatest difference between the experimental and the cfd results for the streamwise and vertical velocities at each water depth was 2 5 of the w v o l even though the vertical velocity results given by the cfd models do not develop the same profile as the experimental results nevertheless the experimental and cfd w v o l over the turbine swept area for each case were within 4 of one another as shown in table 16 and therefore deemed acceptable fig 15 and fig 16 show how the addition of a wave characteristic induces an oscillatory wave orbital velocity component around the average current flow these figures compare the experimental and cfd model results when operating under the conditions given by p1w1 and p2w2 respectively for both wave cases the amplitude of oscillation around the average current flow is greater towards the water surface decaying as the wave motion penetrates through the water depth for both the streamwise and vertical wave induced velocities as shown experimentally in table 17 the wave induced fluctuations for the streamwise and vertical velocities in the p2w2 case are greater than the p1w1 case in the top half of the water column however the wave induced oscillatory effects decay quicker in the p2w2 case this is because the oscillatory motions of a wave can penetrate the water column by up to half the wavelength sorensen 2006 and p1w1 has a greater wavelength of l 9 07 m in comparison to p2w2 which has l 5 61 m both wave cases are intermediate water waves so still have a significant vertical and horizontal velocity component at the base of the flume the turbine will therefore be subjected to considerable loads and fluctuations in these loads in both the horizontal and vertical directions throughout the 2 m water depth the cfd streamwise velocity results show good agreement with the experimental data however the vertical velocities have a larger discrepancy between the two data sets particularly towards the bottom of the water column whilst the wave induced fluctuations in the vertical velocity are comparable to the experimental values the cfd model does not reproduce the profiled gradient of the average experimental vertical velocities the magnitudes of the wave induced velocity fluctuations are shown in fig 17 a and fig 18 a the experimental and the cfd data sets show very good agreement with the greatest difference being 1 of the w v o l for both wave current cases the wave induced oscillations fluctuate around the current velocity with the same magnitude regardless of whether a uniform or profiled velocity gradient exists lloyd et al 2019b for the conditions given by p1w1 a single turbine blade experiences a maximum difference of 0 32 m s in the streamwise velocity as it passes through the different flow regions over the rotational cycle with a velocity of 0 82 m s at tdc and 1 14 m s at bottom dead centre bdc in comparison p2w2 has a difference of 0 24 m s over the rotational cycle with a velocity of 0 85 m s at tdc and 1 09 m s at bdc the current profile that the wave characteristic is superimposed upon will affect the amount of shear across the water depth and consequently the loadings imposed on the turbine the combination of wave and current interaction together will have a significantly greater effect across the turbine as opposed to current or wave only conditions figs 17b and 18b show the wave orbital components in the vertical direction for p1w1 and p2w2 with their average values subtracted this data shows that for the vertical wave orbital components good agreement is displayed by the experimental and cfd results for both wave current cases it is the differences in the average velocities which offsets the wave orbital components and therefore appears to agree less well all vertical velocity cfd results are within 1 standard deviation of the equivalent experimental values apart from at a distance from the swl of 0 8 and 1 2 m in the p2w2 case however at this water depth the greatest difference between the experimental and cfd results is 2 the surface elevation of the wave was measured at the turbine rotor plane z 3 88 m which gave a clear indication of the wave surface profile and allowed a direct comparison between the wave elevation and the induced turbine loadings fig 19 and fig 20 show the wave surface elevation over a 5 s time period for the experimental and cfd model results of p1w1 and p2w2 respectively experimentally figs 19 and 20 show a 5 s snapshot of the total data set however both the wave frequency and wave height were measured over 7 to 10 different tests and an average was obtained across the multiple runs to get a more representative average of the sample conditions table 18 shows the target and measured wave characteristics for the experimental results as well as the cfd model comparison the measured experimental results show good agreement to the target values input to the wave maker with 1 difference in the wave frequency the measured wave height for both cases are within 9 of the target values showing the variability present in this measurement a dominating current flow along with strong velocity variations induced by the surface waves caused deflection of the wave probes during the experimental testing these flow characteristics contribute to the unsteadiness of the readings but are hard to quantify the cfd results show stability after 40 s of run time and therefore show a repeating pattern after this point has been reached with a wave height of 0 081 m and 0 12 m for the conditions represented by p1w1 and p2w2 respectively these values show good agreement with the experimental results with only 1 3 difference for p1w1 and no difference in the average value for p2w2 the cfd average wave frequency and wave height are both 3 of the experimental values overall the cfd simulations accurately reproduce the wave and current conditions generated at the ifremer flume experimentally the differences between the experimental and cfd average velocity and wave orbital velocities are 3 of the w v o l the wave surface elevation produced by the cfd model is within 2 of the experimental results and the wave frequencies show 3 difference fig 21 shows the instantaneous flow conditions generated by the p2w2 cfd model as well as indicating the position of the wave crests 4 2 2 turbine characteristics fig 22 shows the experimental c q c t and c p for the five test cases calculated using the w v o l to account for the differing velocity profiles over the swept area of the turbine as detailed in table 16 strong agreement was found between the p1w1 and p2w2 flow cases for each of the performance characteristics with a maximum difference of 2 2 and 4 for c q c t and c p respectively over the peak power region 3 tsr 5 good agreement was also found between the average performance characteristics for the wave current and current only cases with the maximum difference for c q c t and c p 10 table 19 shows the performance characteristics for each of the flow cases at peak power tsr 4 showing the repeatability of the performance characteristics over a range of flow characteristics table 20 shows a comparison of the cfd and experimental average performance characteristics for the wave current cases at a tsr of 4 the c q c t and c p estimated by the cfd model at a tsr of 4 show good agreement with the experimental results all lying within 1 standard deviation of the average value and having a maximum difference of 10 the bm x for a single turbine blade was compared experimentally and numerically to further analyse the transient behaviour of the turbine under wave current conditions as described in section 4 1 2 the dominating fluctuation in the bm x for the current only cases was due to stanchion interaction and the impact of the velocity profiles with each turbine blade every rotation the introduction of waves incorporates an additional fluctuating component that affects the turbine loadings as shown by fig 23 under p1w1 conditions each turbine blade completes a full rotation every 0 7 s and interacts with the stanchion once during this time fig 23a the wave period of w1 is 2 0 s and therefore every 14 s the turbine will rotate 20 times while 7 waves propagate past the turbine the rotational frequency and the wave frequency result in a combined fundamental period of 14 s where the transient bm x alters over this 14 s window however each 14 s window will repeat the same pattern this window has been marked on fig 23 to show the repeating envelope while the rotational frequency is marked with a red arrow and each wave period is marked with a green arrow for the p2w2 case the time taken for a blade to do a single rotation is again 0 7 s while the wave period of w2 is 1 43 s fig 23b for this case the wave frequency is almost twice the rotational frequency and therefore both components are essentially in phase with one another this results in the bm x fluctuation being dominated by the wave interaction and only a small drop in the bm x can be seen due to the turbine blade interacting with the stanchion and differing flow velocities each full rotation the tsa method was applied to reduce the noise in the wave current time series and to accentuate the underlying fluctuations in the bm x results table 21 shows the average experimental and cfd bm x values which show good agreement between the cases fig 24 shows the average experimental and cfd bm x on a turbine blade calculated using tsa with the corresponding wave surface elevation positioned underneath for p1w1 and p2w2 the maximum and minimum fluctuation in the bm x coincides with the peak and trough of the wave surface elevation respectively this is shown both experimentally and numerically showing strong similarities between the shape and magnitude of fluctuation in the bm x these transient results however consist of multiple combined frequencies such as interaction with the stanchion and velocity profile at the rotational frequency and interaction with regular waves at the wave frequency a fast fourier transform fft was therefore conducted to decompose the time series into its dominant frequencies and quantify the magnitude of fluctuation in the bm x created by stanchion and wave interactions with the turbine fig 25 shows the fft analysis for the experimental and cfd bm x results for each wave current characteristic at a tsr of 4 the red arrows mark the rotational frequency of the turbine showing the combined interaction of the stanchion and velocity profile with a turbine blade while the green arrows mark the wave frequency for both wave current cases there are two peaks situated at the wave and rotational frequencies the peak at the rotational frequency 1 4 hz for both p1w1 and p2w2 shows good agreement with the amplitude of fluctuation in the bm x seen in the current only cases of p1 and p2 respectively as shown in table 22 this shows that the interaction of each turbine blade with the stanchion and velocity profile is the same regardless of the wave characteristics superimposed on the profiled current velocity the velocity profile in p2w2 is less shearing across the water depth than in p1w1 resulting in a smaller fluctuation in the bm x at the rotational frequency this observation agrees with analysis of the profiled current only conditions as shown in tables 15 and 22 the wave frequency of p2w2 shows a much greater amplitude of fluctuation in the bm x in comparison to the rotational frequency while in p1w1 both the wave and rotational frequency components have a similar amplitude of fluctuation this emphasises the considerable effect that a velocity profile across the water column can have on the loading fluctuations of the turbine table 22 shows that the uniform current only case has the smallest amplitude of fluctuation in the bm x of 0 5 nm there are no waves or profiled velocity gradients therefore the fluctuation in the bm x is solely due to interaction with the stanchion each rotation p2 introduces a small amount of shear to the current velocity through the water depth which increases the amplitude of fluctuation to 0 7 nm a further increase in the amount of shear in the current velocity p1 has a significant effect on the fluctuation in the bm x reaching a magnitude of 2 4 nm both the wave current cases p1w1 and p2w2 induce an amplitude of fluctuation in the bm x at the wave frequency of 2 2 2 7 nm similar to the amplitude of fluctuation caused by p1 therefore a highly shearing velocity profile such as p1 can have just as big an effect as the wave induced loadings of w1 and w2 experienced in this study an equally important factor to consider is the phase of the wave in comparison to the position of a turbine blade in its rotational cycle if these two components are in phase this can substantially increase the magnitude of the loading fluctuations that a single turbine blade experiences as found by ordonez sanchez et al 2016 however when these components are out of phase the impact of the loading fluctuations would be more frequent but with a smaller magnitude it is important to minimise large loading fluctuations and therefore control strategies can be developed and used to monitor incoming waves and adjust the turbine rotational speed to optimise the blades position in comparison to the waves ordonez sanchez et al 2016 the cfd models shown by fig 25ii reproduce the results observed experimentally to within 1 standard deviation showing good agreement between the data sets both sets of results found that w2 has a greater effect on the amplitude of fluctuation in the bm x of a turbine blade in comparison to w1 validation of cfd models using uniform and profiled current only conditions as well as combined wave current characteristics has been successfully achieved for a 1 20th scale tst in the peak power operational region the cfd models reflect the experimental conditions to within 1 standard deviation for multiple flow and turbine parameters such as turbine performance characteristics streamwise and vertical velocity data wave surface elevation and bm x blade loadings further analysis can now be carried out to investigate transient loading features as a result of the different flow conditions 4 3 cfd comparison of transient turbine loadings current only and wave current blade hub and total turbine thrust and torque loadings were investigated using cfd simulations as individual component loadings were not measured during the experimental testing it is therefore assumed that the data presented by the cfd models would be representative of the experimental thrust and torque data as a result of prior validation using alternative parameters the average thrust and torque loadings show good similarity between each of the five types of flow condition tested u p1 p2 p1w1 p2w2 with small variations between cases due to differences in the calculated w v o l table 23 shows how these average thrust and torque loadings are not significantly affected by the different wave and current characteristics fig 26 shows the transient thrust and torque loadings for a single blade the hub and the turbine total for each of the five test cases u p1 p2 p1w1 p2w2 the surface elevation of the two wave cases w1 and w2 are also shown in fig 26iv to demonstrate comparisons between the surface elevation and loadings experienced for the wave current cases fig 26ai shows that for the current only cases the transient cycle of the thrust on each turbine blade is repeated with the peak and trough of the results aligned with the rotational frequency of the turbine 0 7 s the amplitude of fluctuation around the average thrust is 1 03 n 10 02 n and 2 65 n for u p1 and p2 respectively which shows that the fluctuation in the thrust on a single turbine blade for p1 is 3 times that of p2 and 10 times the u flow case for the wave current cases the loading fluctuations experienced by a single turbine blade is a complex combination of interactions between the rotational speed of a blade passing the stanchion the amount of shear in the velocity profile and the propagating surface waves the amplitude of fluctuation around the average thrust is 10 91 n and 12 48 n for p1w1 and p2w2 respectively which is similar to the fluctuation in the thrust for p1 such a finding confirms that shear induced flow structures as well as wave induced conditions will be significant drivers of loading perturbations and must be quantified to correctly design tst structures the transient torque loadings for a single turbine blade in current only conditions show a similar trend to the thrust loadings as shown in fig 26bi the amplitude of fluctuation around the average torque is 0 79 nm 1 39 nm 0 86 nm 1 14 nm and 1 49 nm for u p1 p2 p1w1 and p2w2 respectively the fluctuation in the torque on a single blade is greatest for the highest shearing velocity p1 and the wave cases again the different flow conditions have a negligible effect on the average torque on a single blade but does affect the fluctuation around the average value there are small discrepancies between the phase of the cyclic loadings for each of the flow cases as the angular velocity of the turbine was set to reflect the results obtained experimentally resulting in minor changes between the rotational period of the turbine fig 26aii and fig 26bii show the respective thrust and torque on the hub for each of the flow cases tested the presence of a velocity profile has a negligible effect on the fluctuation of the thrust and torque on the hub as seen for cases u p1 and p2 the hub is static in the water column and at a central depth where the streamwise velocity for all cases is 1 00 m s it would be expected that the loadings imparted on the hub for all flow conditions are similar however the introduction of surface waves increases the fluctuation in the thrust to 1 2 n while the amplitude of fluctuation in the thrust without waves was 0 05 n the surface waves did not affect the fluctuation in the torque however remaining close to 0 nm fig 26aiii shows the significant difference observed for flow cases with and without waves in the total turbine all blades and hub transient thrust results when summing to calculate the total turbine loadings the fluctuation observed in the thrust on a single turbine blade is cancelled out due to each blade being 120 out of phase with one another therefore when the individual loadings are summed the amplitude of fluctuation is significantly reduced it is still critical to account for the stanchion interaction with each turbine blade in terms of blade design fatigue life and manufacture however this fluctuation is not visible in the total turbine loading results these results emphasise the importance of analysing the turbine component loadings individually as well as in a combined total the amplitude of fluctuation around the average total thrust for the current only cases is 0 28 n 0 19 n and 0 74 n for u p1 and p2 respectively as shown in table 24 when surface waves are introduced the amplitude of fluctuation around the average total thrust increases to 33 6 n and 37 8 n for p1w1 and p2w2 respectively which is around 35 times greater than the fluctuation in the current only cases the maximum and minimum peaks in the transient total thrust results directly coincide with when a crest or trough of the wave propagates past the turbine as shown in fig 26aiv a similar trend is observed in the transient total torque results as shown in fig 26biii the amplitude of fluctuation around the average total torque is 0 02 nm 0 02 nm and 0 07 nm for u p1 and p2 respectively as shown in table 24 the amplitude of fluctuation for p1w1 and p2w2 are 3 39 nm and 3 92 nm respectively which is again about 35 times greater than the fluctuation in the current only results the fluctuation in the loadings is significantly greater for the cases incorporating waves than without and peaks in the loadings align with the crests and troughs of the wave surface elevation as also observed in the thrust results these results show the substantial effect that surface waves can have on the loadings of a tst it is the cyclic nature of the wave induced loadings that can critically affect the fatigue life of the turbine components numerical analysis allows researchers and developers to quantify the impact that different flow characteristics can have on marine devices placed in conditions specific to identified tidal test sites 5 conclusions this study presents an experimental test campaign using a 3 bladed 1 20 scale hatt performed at the ifremer wave current flume which is used to validate numerical models under current only and wave current conditions the average and transient turbine thrust torque and out of plane bending moment were measured both experimentally and numerically along with the flow velocity and wave height these measurements allowed the turbine performance characteristics and loads to be calculated the main conclusions from the study are the turbine was fully characterised under uniform flows experimentally and numerically providing a base case of the simplest flow conditions for comparisons against more complex flow investigations the mode of the streamwise velocity was found to accurately represent the predominant flow conditions for all experimental data distributions when using the mean and the mode in the calculation of the volumetrically averaged streamwise velocity over the swept area of the turbine differences of up to 4 were found which consequently amplify differences in the calculation of c q c t and c p of up to 12 average turbine performance characteristics were unaffected by the presence of a profiled velocity gradient and showed similar results to tests under uniform current conditions the amplitude of fluctuation in the out of plane bending moment on a turbine blade increased as the shear in the velocity profile intensified with the highest shearing velocity profile inducing fluctuations 5 times that of the uniform current case similar results were found in the turbine blade thrust and torque results the total thrust and torque loadings showed a reduction in the amplitude of fluctuation due to each turbine blade being 120 out of phase and therefore cancelling out the fluctuation in the loadings the average performance characteristics were unaffected by the inclusion of regular waves waves induce additional fluctuations in the out of plane bending moment on a single turbine blade however the amplitude of these fluctuations is no greater than that caused by the highest shearing velocity profile cyclic blade loadings are induced by velocity profiles and waves when analysing the total turbine loadings only fluctuations induced by wave motion can be observed with the maximum minimum loadings being aligned with the crest trough of the wave respectively with the inclusion of waves the amplitude of fluctuation around the average thrust and torque is 35 times greater that in current only flows optimised cfd models were developed to simulate combined wave and current interaction using ansys cfx uniform and profiled current flows as well as two regular intermediate stokes 2nd order theory wave models were tested and successfully validated using multiple experimental flow and turbine parameters from the ifremer wave current flume a set of guidelines were defined which allow any flume geometry and wave characteristic within the stokes 2nd order theory limits to be simulated in a free surface model a hexa mesh using 120 cells over the length of a wave δz and 10 cells over the wave height δy was found to create a mesh with good numerical accuracy and reasonable computational run time these lab scale results can inform researchers and developers of similar outcomes using full scale tidal devices the importance of numerical modelling is also highlighted as its use in the initial stages of device development can reduce the costs associated with device design as well as avoiding the need for a full experimental test campaign and therefore the operational costs of laboratory testing the wave and current cases used in this study present a controlled set of ocean flow conditions further investigation would look to emulate more realistic ocean flow regimes using realistic high shearing velocity profiles and modelling irregular

21081,in this paper by applying the hamiltonian function method we study the observer based adaptive robust stabilization problem for dynamic positioning dp ship with time delay and present several new results on the issue firstly the three degree of freedoms dp ship model with time delay is transformed into a port controlled hamiltonian pch one based on which we design its observer system then by using the augmented technology and the lyapunov stability theory several observer based robust stabilization controllers and observer based adaptive robust stabilization controllers are designed for the dp ship with time delay and some delay independent and delay dependent robust stabilization results are obtained finally the simulation results show the effectiveness of the observer based robust stabilization controller proposed in this paper keywords time delay dynamic positioning ship hamiltonian model observer design adaptive robust control 1 introduction with the scarcity of terrestrial resources people are gradually turning more attentions to the ocean which is a source of abundant as a shipping tool the ship is getting more and more important its control problem has received extensive attention from research and engineering staff du et al 2015 li et al 2020 ding et al 2015 zwierzewicz 2015 jiang and bian 2016 jin et al 2017 fossen 2002 zhang et al 2020a 2020b due to different work tasks some specific requirements are imposed on ships such as exploration tracking and replenishment operations etc among them the mining salvaging and collaborative work of multiple ships are some main tasks for the marine vessels which implies that the dp problem is a key issue the so called dynamic positioning means that the ship uses its own propulsion device to keep a specific location in the past decades the dp problem has attracted the attention of many scholars and some significant results have been obtained in du et al 2015 li et al 2020 donaire and perez 2012 skulstad et al 2018 ding et al 2015 xia et al 2013 zhang et al 2020c however due to the complexity and variability of the marine environment the danger for marine ship may happen at any time to reduce this some robust stabilization control techniques are proposed du et al 2015 li et al 2020 ding et al 2015 the dp ship under the robust stabilization controller can effectively resist the external interference and make it stable at a target position ferial 2000 in addition to robustness another key issue is the observer design problem for the ship in fact the position and heading information of the marine ship under study can be directly measured by the beidou navigation system respectively while compared with the position and heading the measurement of speed is difficult although one can use corresponding sensors more sensors can lead to the system s redundancy and increase the risk of operational errors therefore it is a meaningful work to design an observer for the marine ship under study in recent years many scholars have applied modern control theory to study the observer based control problem for the dp ship and have made some achievements du et al 2015 zwierzewicz 2015 jiang and bian 2016 jin et al 2017 in du et al 2015 the authors designed a high gain observer for the dp ship in zwierzewicz 2015 some control synthesis results was obtained by means of an output feedback linearization method combined a nonlinear observer ref jiang and bian 2016 designed a controller by constructing a linear expansion state observer and applying the proportional and differential control technology for the dp ship in ref jin et al 2017 considering the existence of unknown external disturbances and the uncertainty of ship model parameters in the system the authors designed an inner loop observer and an outer loop controller for the system under study respectively however the paper jiang and bian 2016 used a linear observer so that the design scheme has some limitations moreover the above mentioned papers du et al 2015 zwierzewicz 2015 jiang and bian 2016 jin et al 2017 are all based on linear form or the approximate linearization technique in view of these some scholars have devoted to using sliding mode technology and backstepping method in the ship control system ref du et al 2012 constructed a nonlinear state observer for the dp ship system in ref xia and shao 2014 the authors presented a passive nonlinear robust observer design method for a surface ship with a special structure by using acceleration feedback and sliding mode technique based on the structural principle of luenberger observer and the lyapunov stability theory in kim et al 2012 ihle et al 2006 and lin et al 2018 the nonlinear output feedback controllers were derived on the basis of the developed observer by using the backstepping technique under unknown constant environmental disturbances and uncertain ship dynamics some global robust adaptive output feedback control scheme were developed for dp ships based on lyapunov s direct method and backstepping technique du et al 2015 francesco et al 2003 deng et al 2017 tong et al 2011 even so there are few results on the dp ship system with time delay as well known the time delay is inevitable because there exist measurement transmission and transport lags in the system its existence may lead to instability and poor performance for the systems under study gu et al 2003 such as longer response time and bigger overshoot and so on therefore it is necessary to study the ship control system with time delay to solve this problem the authors in zhao et al 2015 considered a input delay system by designing a state derivative control law the system under study was turned to a neutral time delay system and then by applying the delay decomposition approach and linear matrix inequality lmi some less conservative results were derived for the neutral system with state derivative feedback in xia et al 2017 by using a fuzzy approximation method an inversion controller was proposed to solve the problem of input time delay and disturbance in the dp ship based on the upper bound of time delay ref xia et al 2013 designed a robust sliding mode controller to reduce the time delay influence for the dp ship however the results obtained in zhao et al 2015 xia et al 2013 2017 are not observer based ones mainly because it is a very difficult task to develop some observer based results for a given nonlinear delay system in fact one cannot apply the traditional error method like studying linear systems or linear approximation systems therefore it is an urgent need to develop a new method to study the observer based control problem for nonlinear dp ship system with time delay recently the hamiltonian function method has received a lot of attention from scholars since a hamiltonian function in the system can be chosen as lyapunov candidate and some mature design methods have been given for the system in wang 2007 sun and fu 2016 ortega and borja 2014 particularly in refs wang 2007 wang et al 2003 yang and wang 2012 the authors proposed some realization methods on general nonlinear time delay systems using the realization method one can easily transform some systems under study into their hamiltonian forms by applying the realization methods in view of these refs donaire and perez 2012 muhammad and doria cerezo 2012 zhou et al 2019 extended the hamiltonian function method to investigate control problems of ships in donaire and perez 2012 the authors designed several controllers on the dp ship system with actuator input saturation in ref muhammad and doria cerezo 2012 a family of passivity based controllers for dp ship were presented ref zhou et al 2019 studied simultaneously stability problem on two dp ships based on the hamiltonian method and presented some corresponding results it should be pointed out that the aforementioned papers are not based on the observer results more recently by promoting the hamiltonian function method ref yang et al 2020 investigated the observer based finite time robust control problem for a general class of nonlinear time delay systems in short although the authors in refs du et al 2015 francesco et al 2003 deng et al 2017 tong et al 2011 have considered the observer based adaptive control problem for the dp ship system the systems under study in the papers do not contain time delay term and the methods used are backstepping and the error ones as well known the error method is suitable for the linear or approximate linear model while for a dp ship system with nonlinear term it is very difficult to obtain its error model moreover as shown in subsection 4 2 below of the paper the error method will lead to conservative results to this end by applying hamiltonian method and augmented technique ref yang et al 2020 studied the observer based robust control problem for a class of nonlinear time delay systems however the system under study in ref yang et al 2020 do not contain uncertain term and is a purely theoretical model that is to say it is an ideal one therefore it is still an open issue to investigate the observer based adaptive control problem and present corresponding less conservative results for the real dp ship system which motivated the present paper in this paper we consider the observer based adaptive robust stabilization problem for a class of dp ship with time delay propose several adaptive robust control results give delay independent and delay dependent stabilization results the main contributions of this paper are as follows 1 unlike the existing papers like zhao et al 2015 zheng et al 2017 the present article studies the observer design problem and develops several robust control results based on the observer while refs zhao et al 2015 zheng et al 2017 only proposed some robust stabilization results 2 although the authors in refs du et al 2015 francesco et al 2003 deng et al 2017 tong et al 2011 have considered the adaptive observer design problem for the ship system the systems under study in the mentioned papers do not contain time delay term obviously the studied system in the present paper is more general 3 unlike the traditional observer design method in du et al 2015 zwierzewicz 2015 jiang and bian 2016 jin et al 2017 the present paper applies expansion technology rather than the error method that is to say the method of the present paper can be applied to study a general nonlinear systems not only linear models and or approximate linear models and the results obtained have less conservatism 4 different from recent work on observer based control result for time delay system yang et al 2020 note in yang et al 2020 the authors studied a class of nonlinear time delay system without uncertainties and applied the orthogonal decomposition method to develop the equivalent hamiltonian model of the original system by applying the coordinate transformation method the present paper develops an equivalent ship hamiltonian model and investigates a general class of dp ship systems with time delay external disturbance and uncertainties simultaneously the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 is the problem formulation and preliminaries in section 3 the observer is designed and several main results are presented section 4 gives an illustrative example to support our new result which is followed by the conclusion in section 5 2 problem formulations this section gives preliminaries and some lemmas in the paper we first consider the following model of dp ship fossen 2002 1 η r ϕ υ m υ u d υ w where η e n ϕ t denotes the positions e n and the yaw angle ϕ in the earth fixed frame υ μ ν r t expresses the surge sway velocity and yaw angular velocity in the body fixed frame respectively η ω and υ ω denote the state vector with ω being some bounded convex neighborhood of the space r 3 u r 3 1 is a control quantity m r 3 3 is a positive definite inertia matrix d r 3 3 is a positive definite linear damp matrix the external interference is w r 3 1 and r ϕ r 3 3 is the rotation matrix given by 2 r ϕ c o s ϕ s i n ϕ 0 s i n ϕ c o s ϕ 0 0 0 1 next to develop several observer based results via hamiltonian method we transform system 1 into its hamilton form to do this let x 1 and x 2 as 3 x 1 v α 1 4 x 2 η η d where η d denotes the constant expected position and yaw angle so that x 2 η and α 1 r 3 satisfies 5 α 1 k 1 x 2 with k 1 r 3 3 being a constant positive definite matrix substituting 3 4 and 5 into 1 we have 6 m x 1 u d x 1 d k 1 x 2 m α 1 w x 2 r ϕ x 1 r ϕ k 1 x 2 computing the derivative of α 1 and using 6 we have 7 α 1 k 1 x 2 k 1 r ϕ x 1 k 1 r ϕ k 1 x 2 substitute 7 into 6 it is easy to obtain 8 m x 1 t u a x 1 t b x 2 t w x 2 t r ϕ x 1 t r ϕ k 1 x 2 t where a d m k 1 r ϕ b d k 1 m k 1 r ϕ k 1 obviously the response time of the ship speed is affected by the delay response namely the state x 1 contains time delay therefore similar to fosseen 2002 in the paper we consider a more general ship model with time delay as follows 9 m x 1 t u a x 1 t d 1 x 1 t h b x 2 t w x 2 t r ϕ x 1 t r ϕ k 1 x 2 t x s φ s s h 0 where φ τ is a vector valued initial condition function and d 1 r 3 3 is a weighted matrix remark 2 1 from 1 it is easy to know the equation η does not contain the control quantity u which implies that one cannot design its damping injection controller in applying hamiltonian function method this is a difficulty in studying the ship system 1 via the hamiltonian method therefore to develop a standard hamiltonian form of system 1 motivated by refs du et al 2015 and zhou et al 2019 we have introduced the coordinate transforming relations 3 and 4 and obtain an equivalent form 9 of system 1 thanks for the equivalent form so that we can get some asymptotic stability results without the damping injection in applying hamiltonian function method which is an advantage of the paper further details please see refs du et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 and section 3 below the main goal of the paper is to apply hamiltonian method to study the observer based adaptive robust stabilization problem for dp ship with time delay next we present the definition and methods on hamiltonian realization consider the following general nonlinear system 10 x t f x g x u where x t r n is the state f x is a vector field satisfying f 0 0 u is the control input definition 1 wang et al 2003 yang and wang 2012 if there exists a continuous differentiable function h x and a class k function β such that h x β x h 0 0 h x x 0 0 and h x x 0 0 then h x is called a regular positive definite one on x for example h x x 1 2 x 2 2 is a regular positive definite function with respect to x where represents the partial derivative definition 2 sun and peng 2014 system 10 is said to have a port controlled hamiltonian realization form if there exist a suitable coordinate chart and a regular positive definite function h x such that system 10 can be expressed as the following hamiltonian form 11 x t j x r x h x t g x u where x h x h x x j x j t x r n n r x r n n is a symmetric matrix h x is the hamiltonian function with x 0 as its minimum point and h 0 0 h x is the gradient vector of h x at x noting that in applying hamiltonian method the key problem is that how to express the system under study into its hamiltonian form in the following we present two generalized hamilton realization ghr methods under f x being smooth and non smooth cases respectively further details please see wang et al 2003 in addition for other realization methods also see wang et al 2003 lemma 2 2 wang et al 2003 for a given regular positive definite function h x the system has the following orthogonal decomposition hamiltonian realization 12 x j x r x x h x g x u where j x 1 x h 2 f t d x h t x h f t d t r x f x h x h 2 i n f g d x f x h x h 2 h f t d x f x f g d x when f x in the system 10 is smooth we have the following ghr result lemma 2 3 wang et al 2003 consider the system 10 if f x f 1 x f n x t is a smooth vector field and its jacobi matrix j f is non singular then the system 10 has the following hamiltonian realization x j x r x x h x g x u where h x 1 2 i 1 n f i 2 x x h x i 1 n f i x f i x x 1 i 1 n f i x f i x x n t and j x r x j f t x in addition if f x is a smooth vector field and its jacobi matrix j f is singular with a fixed reversible sub block then there exist a matrix n x and a vector field g x g 1 x g n x t with non singular jacobi matrix j g such that the system 10 has following hamiltonian realization x j x r x x h x g x u with h x 1 2 i 1 n g i 2 x x h x i 1 n g i x g i x x 1 i 1 n g i x g i x x n t and j x r x n x j g t x remark 2 4 different from lemma 2 3 lemma 2 2 presents a general realization method for a given system under study that is to say by applying lemma 2 2 whether f x is smooth or non smooth one can always choose a suitable hamiltonian function to transform the system under study into its hamiltonian form in the paper we only present two hamiltonian realization methods note that the ghr method is not unique for a given system for specific details and other realization methods please see wang 2007 wang et al 2003 yang and wang 2012 now we transform the system 9 into its hamilton form to do this based on the structure of the system 9 we choose a special hamiltonian function as 13 h x 1 2 x 1 t x 1 1 2 x 2 t x 2 then the system 9 can be expressed as 14 x t a 1 x h x t a 2 x h x t h g x u g x w where x t x 1 t t x 2 t t t a 1 x m 1 a m 1 b r ϕ r ϕ k 1 a 2 x m 1 d 1 0 0 0 g x m 1 0 3 3 and it is obvious that g x has the full column rank in addition in the paper we let the output y t g t x h x t remark 2 5 it should be pointed out that the system 14 is not a linear one due to containing r ϕ a and b in a 1 x which implies that one cannot use the traditional error method to develop its observer based results lemma 2 6 liao et al 2003 for real matrices x y and a scalar ι 0 the following inequality is true 15 x t y y t x ι x t x ι 1 y t y lemma 2 7 gu et al 2003 for constant matrix z 0 constant number h 0 and vector function x 0 h r n the following inequality is true 16 h 0 h x t s z x s d s 0 h x s d s t z 0 h x s d s from the above we know that the system 14 is equivalent to the system 9 in section 3 we will investigate the observer based robust stabilization of the system 14 and the observer based adaptive robust stabilization of the system 14 with uncertainty 3 main results in the section we first present several observer based robust stabilization results for the equivalent system 14 in subsection 3 1 below and then further study the observer based adaptive robust stabilization problem of system 14 with uncertainty and disturbance in subsection 3 2 3 1 robust stabilization based on observer in this subsection we will design an observer of the pch model 14 and study its observer based robust stabilization problem in the subsection unlike the traditional error system method we adopt a new approach to develop observer based robust stabilization result for system 14 based on 14 we design an observer system of system 14 as follows 17 x ˆ t a 1 x ˆ h x ˆ t a 2 x ˆ h x ˆ t h g x ˆ u k 2 t m t y t y ˆ t g x ˆ w y ˆ t g t x ˆ h x ˆ t from which and system 14 by applying the augmented technique wang 2007 one can obtain 18 x t b x h x t f x h x t h g x u g x w where k 2 r 3 6 is a weighted matrix x t x t x ˆ t t h x t h x t h x ˆ t h x t h h x t h h x ˆ t h g x g t x g t x ˆ t b x a 1 x 0 k 2 t m t g t x a 1 x ˆ k 2 t m t g t x ˆ f x a 2 x 0 0 a 2 x ˆ remark 3 1 it should be pointed out that for studying the observer based control problem one usually constructs an error system by using the original and observer systems however the method is suitable for the linear model or approximate linear model du et al 2012 zwierzewicz 2015 while for a general system it is very difficult to obtain its error one note system 14 of the paper is not linear model or approximate linear model since there exists r ϕ a and b in a 1 x therefore motivated by wang 2007 we adopt an augmented technique to develop a dimension expansion system 18 which is different from the ones in du et al 2012 zwierzewicz 2015 therefore the method presented in this paper is more general to study the robust control problem of system 18 based on observer method we give the definition and two assumptions the observer based robust control problem of system 18 design an observer based output feedback control law as u a x ˆ y with the observer x ˆ f x ˆ y u such that all the states of system 18 under the control law are asymptotic stabilization when w 0 moreover for any non zero w ξ ξ is a bounded region on the disturbance w which will be defined below and under the zero state response condition 19 φ s 0 w s 0 s h 0 the closed loop system satisfies 20 0 t z s 2 d s γ 2 0 t w s 2 d s t 0 where γ 0 is the disturbance attenuation level and z is the penalty signal which is designed as 21 z t ρ g 1 t x h x t with ρ r 3 3 being a weighted matrix g 1 x g x m i 3 3 0 3 3 and g 1 x has the full column rank to clearly show the process we give the control principle structure diagram in fig 1 below assumption s1 hamiltonian function h x and its gradient h x satisfy 22 1 ε 1 x h x ε 2 x 23 2 l 1 x t h x h x l 2 x where ε 1 ε 2 l 1 l 2 are some functions of k type remark 3 2 the assumption is true for the hamiltonian function 13 assumption s2 coutinho and souza 2008 assume that the disturbance w belongs to the following set 24 ξ w r q c 2 0 w t w d t 1 where c is a positive real number for the observer based robust stabilization problem of system 18 we have the following main results theorem 3 3 under assumptions s1 and s2 consider the system 18 for the given γ 0 assume that there exist a positive definite symmetric matrice p with appropriate dimension a positive number ι

i m m 3 remark 3 4 according to the definition of the robust control problem the proof of theorem 3 3 should be divided into two steps 1 under the controller 27 we prove that for any non zero w ξ and under the zero state response condition 19 the closed loop system 18 satisfies γ dissipative inequality 20 2 when the disturbance w is equal to zero the system is asymptotically stable proof

krasovskii stability theory the closed loop system 29 is asymptotically stable when w 0 therefore the proof is completed in theorem 3 3 we have given a delay independent result on system 29 which implies that the result has conservatism for small delay system gu et al 2003 in the following we present a delay dependent result theorem 3 5 under assumptions s1 and s2 consider the system 18 for

namely 52 holds second we prove that the closed loop system 29 converges to 0 when w 0 to do this computing the derivative of v x t along the trajectory of the closed loop system 41 and similar to the proof of theorem 3 3 one can obtain the result corollary 3 6 under assumption s1 consider the system 18 with w 0 if there exist positive definite symmetric matrices p z with appropriate dimensions such that θ 3 e p h 2 z f x 0 f t x p 0 0 0 z 0 then a stabilization controller of system 18 with w 0 can be designed as 58 u m k 2 h x ˆ t where e d i a g e 11 e 22 e 11 a 1 x a 1 t x e 22 a 1 x ˆ a

disturbance remark 3 8 different from existing results on the dp ship du et al 2012 jin et al 2017 we consider a more general form and present some delay independent and delay dependent results in addition it should be pointed out that the matrices d and d 1 in the ship system 9 may contain the state variable not just constant one which implies that the results obtained of the paper have broader application than existing results on the dp ship system 3 2 adaptive robust stabilization based on observer in this subsection we will study observer based adaptive robust stabilization

generalize the above results to the 6 dof ship model give an adaptive robust stabilization result based on the observer the dp ship model with 6 dof can be described as fossen 2002 87 η r η υ m υ u d

given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme 4 1 performance analysis of proposed dp control law consider the following dp ship model fossen 2002 105 η r ϕ υ m υ u d υ w by applying the method of the paper the ship model 105 is transformed into 106 m x 1 t u d m k 1 r ϕ x 1 t d k 1 m k 1 r ϕ k 1 x 2 t w x 2 t r ϕ x 1 t r ϕ k 1 x 2 t x s φ s s h 0 since the complexity of dp problem one cannot develop its exact model which implies that d should be divided into two part namely d d 0 d δ where d 0 is the normal part and d δ is the unknown part in addition it is obvious that the velocity state exists time delay therefore the general form of the model 106 can be expressed as 107 m x 1 t u d 0 m k 1 r ϕ x 1 t d δ x 1 d 1 x 1 t h d 0 k 1 m k 1 r ϕ k 1 x 2 t d δ k 1 x 2 t w x 2 t r ϕ x 1 t r ϕ k 1 x 2 t x s φ s s h 0 now by using theorem 3 10 we study the adaptive robust control problem based on observer for the model 107 obviously assumptions s1 and s2 are satisfied easily now we show assumption s3 also holds for the ship system let a 1 x q h x q m 1 d δ x 1 m 1 d δ k 1 x 2 0 3 3 then 108 a 1 x q h x q m 1 d δ x 1 m 1 d δ k 1 x 2 0 3 3 m 1 0 3 3 i i d δ x 1 d δ k 1 x 2 g x φ θ thus we obtain φ i i and θ d δ x 1 d δ k 1 x 2 which implies that assumption s3 holds the model data in the simulations are mainly based on the offshore oil 299 dynamic positioning ship and the matrices m d 0 and d 1 are given as follows fossen 2002 m 10 6 6 2632 0 0 0 8 0901 15 721 0 15 721 2512 6 d 1 10 4 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 d 0 10 4 33 306 0 0 0 4 9457 47 649 0 47 649 4709 6 in the example to facilitate the simulation similar to zhou et al 2019 xia et al 2019 let d δ 0 2 d applying theorem 3 10 and solving linear matrix inequalities the parameters p z are in appendix and the others parameters are obtained as follows ι 10 k 1 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 k 2 0 001 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 001 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 001 0 0 0 and the parameters of the adaptive controller are chosen as γ i 6 6 to show the control effectiveness we give several simulation results with the following choices the initial velocity of the ship v 0 1 6 m s 0 8 m s 1 s t the initial velocity of the estimator law v ˆ 0 0 m s 0 m s 0 s t the initial position of the ship η 0 10 m 10 m 45 t and the time delay h 3 to test the robustness of the controller with respect to external disturbances a disturbance of amplitude 1 10 6 m s 1 10 6 m s 1 10 6 s t is added to the system in the time duration 4 s 6 s and assume the disturbance attenuation level γ 0 2 and ρ 0 0001 in addition we set up two different tasks to test whether the ship can reach the desired position at the same initial speed the desired positions are η d 1 0 m 0 m 0 t η d 2 20 m 20 m 0 t under the observer based adaptive robust stabilization controller 68 of the paper the simulation results of the ship speed on the actual value and estimated value are shown in fig 3 a 3c simulation results of two speed differences are shown in fig 4 a 4c in fig 5 a 5b we give the simulation results on the trajectories of ship motion with two different tasks respectively from fig 3a 3c it can be seen that under the observer based adaptive robust stabilization controller 68 of the paper when the ship system is disturbed by the environment in 4 6 s the speed estimate values increase slightly and the states of the original system and observer system tend to be consistent within 15 s when the disturbance w is removed and all converge to equilibrium from fig 4a 4c we can see that the error curves are in a downward trend and tend to zero within 15 s these show that the observer values in this paper can quickly approximate the actual values from fig 5a 5b it is obvious that under the disturbance input the dp ship system with two different tasks can reach the desired positions and the curves are smooth respectively it is well worth pointing out that since our initial angle is 45 while the expected angle is 0 in two tasks the ship will make a circle at 20 20 and stabilize at 20 20 in fig 5b therefore the above simulation results show that the observer based controllers designed of the paper are very effective in the adaptive robust stabilization the ship system 4 2 comparisons with existing dp control law in the following to show the superiority of the method presented in this paper we give several comparison results with du et al 2012 and ngongi and du 2014 respectively under the same initial conditions the initial condition settings are the same as in subsection 4 1 of the paper and same dp model without time delay note in ref du et al 2012 the authors applied the error method and in ref ngongi and du 2014 the authors proposed a high gain observer based pd controller method the simulation results are shown in figs 4 4 a 4 5 c using our method in the paper and figs 4 6 a 4 7 c using the method in du et al 2012 and figs 4 8 a 4 9 c using the method in ngongi and du 2014 from fig 6a 7c it is easy to see that by using our method in the paper the errors between the estimated value of the observer and the actual value are gradually reduced and the actual values can be accurately estimated within 20 s while the stabilization time by using du et al 2012 fig 8a 9c is longer and the observer can not accurately estimate the actual value in a short time in addition we know from fig 10a 11c by using the method in ref ngongi and du 2014 although the errors converge to zero in a short time when the disturbance is added in 4 6 s the motion speed in ngongi and du 2014 increases instantaneously compared with the method in our paper fig 6a 7c the pd controller designed in ngongi and du 2014 has poor robustness moreover the error curves in our paper fig 7a 7c is uniformly decreasing rather than the repeated fluctuations like ngongi and du 2014 fig 11a 11c therefore under the observer system and controller designed in this paper the dp ship system has faster estimation speed smaller overshoot and better robustness than the ones in du et al 2012 ngongi and du 2014 respectively 5 conclusion this paper has investigated the observer based adaptive robust stabilization problem for the dp ship system with time delay and presented several delay independent and delay dependent results unlike traditional methods we have adopted a novel idea to design robust stabilization controller namely by transforming the dp ship system into its hamiltonian model and applying hamiltonian method and augmented technology we have developed an dimension expansion system based on which the paper has presented several robust stabilization and adaptive robust stabilization results based on the observer method the simulation results have shown the effectiveness of the designed controller in the paper it is well worth pointing out that the ship system under study of the paper is more general and the method used of the paper can be applied to study other nonlinear system not just linear and or approximate linear system in the future we will consider some more complex ship models such as dynamic positioning ships with actuator faults refs zhang et al 2020c and under actuated cable laying

21081,in this paper by applying the hamiltonian function method we study the observer based adaptive robust stabilization problem for dynamic positioning dp ship with time delay and present several new results on the issue firstly the three degree of freedoms dp ship model with time delay is transformed into a port controlled hamiltonian pch one based on which we design its observer system then by using the augmented technology and the lyapunov stability theory several observer based robust stabilization controllers and observer based adaptive robust stabilization controllers are designed for the dp ship with time delay and some delay independent and delay dependent robust stabilization results are obtained finally the simulation results show the effectiveness of the observer based robust stabilization controller proposed in this paper keywords time delay dynamic positioning ship hamiltonian model observer design adaptive robust control 1 introduction with the scarcity of terrestrial resources people are gradually turning more attentions to the ocean which is a source of abundant as a shipping tool the ship is getting more and more important its control problem has received extensive attention from research and engineering staff du et al 2015 li et al 2020 ding et al 2015 zwierzewicz 2015 jiang and bian 2016 jin et al 2017 fossen 2002 zhang et al 2020a 2020b due to different work tasks some specific requirements are imposed on ships such as exploration tracking and replenishment operations etc among them the mining salvaging and collaborative work of multiple ships are some main tasks for the marine vessels which implies that the dp problem is a key issue the so called dynamic positioning means that the ship uses its own propulsion device to keep a specific location in the past decades the dp problem has attracted the attention of many scholars and some significant results have been obtained in du et al 2015 li et al 2020 donaire and perez 2012 skulstad et al 2018 ding et al 2015 xia et al 2013 zhang et al 2020c however due to the complexity and variability of the marine environment the danger for marine ship may happen at any time to reduce this some robust stabilization control techniques are proposed du et al 2015 li et al 2020 ding et al 2015 the dp ship under the robust stabilization controller can effectively resist the external interference and make it stable at a target position ferial 2000 in addition to robustness another key issue is the observer design problem for the ship in fact the position and heading information of the marine ship under study can be directly measured by the beidou navigation system respectively while compared with the position and heading the measurement of speed is difficult although one can use corresponding sensors more sensors can lead to the system s redundancy and increase the risk of operational errors therefore it is a meaningful work to design an observer for the marine ship under study in recent years many scholars have applied modern control theory to study the observer based control problem for the dp ship and have made some achievements du et al 2015 zwierzewicz 2015 jiang and bian 2016 jin et al 2017 in du et al 2015 the authors designed a high gain observer for the dp ship in zwierzewicz 2015 some control synthesis results was obtained by means of an output feedback linearization method combined a nonlinear observer ref jiang and bian 2016 designed a controller by constructing a linear expansion state observer and applying the proportional and differential control technology for the dp ship in ref jin et al 2017 considering the existence of unknown external disturbances and the uncertainty of ship model parameters in the system the authors designed an inner loop observer and an outer loop controller for the system under study respectively however the paper jiang and bian 2016 used a linear observer so that the design scheme has some limitations moreover the above mentioned papers du et al 2015 zwierzewicz 2015 jiang and bian 2016 jin et al 2017 are all based on linear form or the approximate linearization technique in view of these some scholars have devoted to using sliding mode technology and backstepping method in the ship control system ref du et al 2012 constructed a nonlinear state observer for the dp ship system in ref xia and shao 2014 the authors presented a passive nonlinear robust observer design method for a surface ship with a special structure by using acceleration feedback and sliding mode technique based on the structural principle of luenberger observer and the lyapunov stability theory in kim et al 2012 ihle et al 2006 and lin et al 2018 the nonlinear output feedback controllers were derived on the basis of the developed observer by using the backstepping technique under unknown constant environmental disturbances and uncertain ship dynamics some global robust adaptive output feedback control scheme were developed for dp ships based on lyapunov s direct method and backstepping technique du et al 2015 francesco et al 2003 deng et al 2017 tong et al 2011 even so there are few results on the dp ship system with time delay as well known the time delay is inevitable because there exist measurement transmission and transport lags in the system its existence may lead to instability and poor performance for the systems under study gu et al 2003 such as longer response time and bigger overshoot and so on therefore it is necessary to study the ship control system with time delay to solve this problem the authors in zhao et al 2015 considered a input delay system by designing a state derivative control law the system under study was turned to a neutral time delay system and then by applying the delay decomposition approach and linear matrix inequality lmi some less conservative results were derived for the neutral system with state derivative feedback in xia et al 2017 by using a fuzzy approximation method an inversion controller was proposed to solve the problem of input time delay and disturbance in the dp ship based on the upper bound of time delay ref xia et al 2013 designed a robust sliding mode controller to reduce the time delay influence for the dp ship however the results obtained in zhao et al 2015 xia et al 2013 2017 are not observer based ones mainly because it is a very difficult task to develop some observer based results for a given nonlinear delay system in fact one cannot apply the traditional error method like studying linear systems or linear approximation systems therefore it is an urgent need to develop a new method to study the observer based control problem for nonlinear dp ship system with time delay recently the hamiltonian function method has received a lot of attention from scholars since a hamiltonian function in the system can be chosen as lyapunov candidate and some mature design methods have been given for the system in wang 2007 sun and fu 2016 ortega and borja 2014 particularly in refs wang 2007 wang et al 2003 yang and wang 2012 the authors proposed some realization methods on general nonlinear time delay systems using the realization method one can easily transform some systems under study into their hamiltonian forms by applying the realization methods in view of these refs donaire and perez 2012 muhammad and doria cerezo 2012 zhou et al 2019 extended the hamiltonian function method to investigate control problems of ships in donaire and perez 2012 the authors designed several controllers on the dp ship system with actuator input saturation in ref muhammad and doria cerezo 2012 a family of passivity based controllers for dp ship were presented ref zhou et al 2019 studied simultaneously stability problem on two dp ships based on the hamiltonian method and presented some corresponding results it should be pointed out that the aforementioned papers are not based on the observer results more recently by promoting the hamiltonian function method ref yang et al 2020 investigated the observer based finite time robust control problem for a general class of nonlinear time delay systems in short although the authors in refs du et al 2015 francesco et al 2003 deng et al 2017 tong et al 2011 have considered the observer based adaptive control problem for the dp ship system the systems under study in the papers do not contain time delay term and the methods used are backstepping and the error ones as well known the error method is suitable for the linear or approximate linear model while for a dp ship system with nonlinear term it is very difficult to obtain its error model moreover as shown in subsection 4 2 below of the paper the error method will lead to conservative results to this end by applying hamiltonian method and augmented technique ref yang et al 2020 studied the observer based robust control problem for a class of nonlinear time delay systems however the system under study in ref yang et al 2020 do not contain uncertain term and is a purely theoretical model that is to say it is an ideal one therefore it is still an open issue to investigate the observer based adaptive control problem and present corresponding less conservative results for the real dp ship system which motivated the present paper in this paper we consider the observer based adaptive robust stabilization problem for a class of dp ship with time delay propose several adaptive robust control results give delay independent and delay dependent stabilization results the main contributions of this paper are as follows 1 unlike the existing papers like zhao et al 2015 zheng et al 2017 the present article studies the observer design problem and develops several robust control results based on the observer while refs zhao et al 2015 zheng et al 2017 only proposed some robust stabilization results 2 although the authors in refs du et al 2015 francesco et al 2003 deng et al 2017 tong et al 2011 have considered the adaptive observer design problem for the ship system the systems under study in the mentioned papers do not contain time delay term obviously the studied system in the present paper is more general 3 unlike the traditional observer design method in du et al 2015 zwierzewicz 2015 jiang and bian 2016 jin et al 2017 the present paper applies expansion technology rather than the error method that is to say the method of the present paper can be applied to study a general nonlinear systems not only linear models and or approximate linear models and the results obtained have less conservatism 4 different from recent work on observer based control result for time delay system yang et al 2020 note in yang et al 2020 the authors studied a class of nonlinear time delay system without uncertainties and applied the orthogonal decomposition method to develop the equivalent hamiltonian model of the original system by applying the coordinate transformation method the present paper develops an equivalent ship hamiltonian model and investigates a general class of dp ship systems with time delay external disturbance and uncertainties simultaneously the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 is the problem formulation and preliminaries in section 3 the observer is designed and several main results are presented section 4 gives an illustrative example to support our new result which is followed by the conclusion in section 5 2 problem formulations this section gives preliminaries and some lemmas in the paper we first consider the following model of dp ship fossen 2002 1 η r ϕ υ m υ u d υ w where η e n ϕ t denotes the positions e n and the yaw angle ϕ in the earth fixed frame υ μ ν r t expresses the surge sway velocity and yaw angular velocity in the body fixed frame respectively η ω and υ ω denote the state vector with ω being some bounded convex neighborhood of the space r 3 u r 3 1 is a control quantity m r 3 3 is a positive definite inertia matrix d r 3 3 is a positive definite linear damp matrix the external interference is w r 3 1 and r ϕ r 3 3 is the rotation matrix given by 2 r ϕ c o s ϕ s i n ϕ 0 s i n ϕ c o s ϕ 0 0 0 1 next to develop several observer based results via hamiltonian method we transform system 1 into its hamilton form to do this let x 1 and x 2 as 3 x 1 v α 1 4 x 2 η η d where η d denotes the constant expected position and yaw angle so that x 2 η and α 1 r 3 satisfies 5 α 1 k 1 x 2 with k 1 r 3 3 being a constant positive definite matrix substituting 3 4 and 5 into 1 we have 6 m x 1 u d x 1 d k 1 x 2 m α 1 w x 2 r ϕ x 1 r ϕ k 1 x 2 computing the derivative of α 1 and using 6 we have 7 α 1 k 1 x 2 k 1 r ϕ x 1 k 1 r ϕ k 1 x 2 substitute 7 into 6 it is easy to obtain 8 m x 1 t u a x 1 t b x 2 t w x 2 t r ϕ x 1 t r ϕ k 1 x 2 t where a d m k 1 r ϕ b d k 1 m k 1 r ϕ k 1 obviously the response time of the ship speed is affected by the delay response namely the state x 1 contains time delay therefore similar to fosseen 2002 in the paper we consider a more general ship model with time delay as follows 9 m x 1 t u a x 1 t d 1 x 1 t h b x 2 t w x 2 t r ϕ x 1 t r ϕ k 1 x 2 t x s φ s s h 0 where φ τ is a vector valued initial condition function and d 1 r 3 3 is a weighted matrix remark 2 1 from 1 it is easy to know the equation η does not contain the control quantity u which implies that one cannot design its damping injection controller in applying hamiltonian function method this is a difficulty in studying the ship system 1 via the hamiltonian method therefore to develop a standard hamiltonian form of system 1 motivated by refs du et al 2015 and zhou et al 2019 we have introduced the coordinate transforming relations 3 and 4 and obtain an equivalent form 9 of system 1 thanks for the equivalent form so that we can get some asymptotic stability results without the damping injection in applying hamiltonian function method which is an advantage of the paper further details please see refs du et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 and section 3 below the main goal of the paper is to apply hamiltonian method to study the observer based adaptive robust stabilization problem for dp ship with time delay next we present the definition and methods on hamiltonian realization consider the following general nonlinear system 10 x t f x g x u where x t r n is the state f x is a vector field satisfying f 0 0 u is the control input definition 1 wang et al 2003 yang and wang 2012 if there exists a continuous differentiable function h x and a class k function β such that h x β x h 0 0 h x x 0 0 and h x x 0 0 then h x is called a regular positive definite one on x for example h x x 1 2 x 2 2 is a regular positive definite function with respect to x where represents the partial derivative definition 2 sun and peng 2014 system 10 is said to have a port controlled hamiltonian realization form if there exist a suitable coordinate chart and a regular positive definite function h x such that system 10 can be expressed as the following hamiltonian form 11 x t j x r x h x t g x u where x h x h x x j x j t x r n n r x r n n is a symmetric matrix h x is the hamiltonian function with x 0 as its minimum point and h 0 0 h x is the gradient vector of h x at x noting that in applying hamiltonian method the key problem is that how to express the system under study into its hamiltonian form in the following we present two generalized hamilton realization ghr methods under f x being smooth and non smooth cases respectively further details please see wang et al 2003 in addition for other realization methods also see wang et al 2003 lemma 2 2 wang et al 2003 for a given regular positive definite function h x the system has the following orthogonal decomposition hamiltonian realization 12 x j x r x x h x g x u where j x 1 x h 2 f t d x h t x h f t d t r x f x h x h 2 i n f g d x f x h x h 2 h f t d x f x f g d x when f x in the system 10 is smooth we have the following ghr result lemma 2 3 wang et al 2003 consider the system 10 if f x f 1 x f n x t is a smooth vector field and its jacobi matrix j f is non singular then the system 10 has the following hamiltonian realization x j x r x x h x g x u where h x 1 2 i 1 n f i 2 x x h x i 1 n f i x f i x x 1 i 1 n f i x f i x x n t and j x r x j f t x in addition if f x is a smooth vector field and its jacobi matrix j f is singular with a fixed reversible sub block then there exist a matrix n x and a vector field g x g 1 x g n x t with non singular jacobi matrix j g such that the system 10 has following hamiltonian realization x j x r x x h x g x u with h x 1 2 i 1 n g i 2 x x h x i 1 n g i x g i x x 1 i 1 n g i x g i x x n t and j x r x n x j g t x remark 2 4 different from lemma 2 3 lemma 2 2 presents a general realization method for a given system under study that is to say by applying lemma 2 2 whether f x is smooth or non smooth one can always choose a suitable hamiltonian function to transform the system under study into its hamiltonian form in the paper we only present two hamiltonian realization methods note that the ghr method is not unique for a given system for specific details and other realization methods please see wang 2007 wang et al 2003 yang and wang 2012 now we transform the system 9 into its hamilton form to do this based on the structure of the system 9 we choose a special hamiltonian function as 13 h x 1 2 x 1 t x 1 1 2 x 2 t x 2 then the system 9 can be expressed as 14 x t a 1 x h x t a 2 x h x t h g x u g x w where x t x 1 t t x 2 t t t a 1 x m 1 a m 1 b r ϕ r ϕ k 1 a 2 x m 1 d 1 0 0 0 g x m 1 0 3 3 and it is obvious that g x has the full column rank in addition in the paper we let the output y t g t x h x t remark 2 5 it should be pointed out that the system 14 is not a linear one due to containing r ϕ a and b in a 1 x which implies that one cannot use the traditional error method to develop its observer based results lemma 2 6 liao et al 2003 for real matrices x y and a scalar ι 0 the following inequality is true 15 x t y y t x ι x t x ι 1 y t y lemma 2 7 gu et al 2003 for constant matrix z 0 constant number h 0 and vector function x 0 h r n the following inequality is true 16 h 0 h x t s z x s d s 0 h x s d s t z 0 h x s d s from the above we know that the system 14 is equivalent to the system 9 in section 3 we will investigate the observer based robust stabilization of the system 14 and the observer based adaptive robust stabilization of the system 14 with uncertainty 3 main results in the section we first present several observer based robust stabilization results for the equivalent system 14 in subsection 3 1 below and then further study the observer based adaptive robust stabilization problem of system 14 with uncertainty and disturbance in subsection 3 2 3 1 robust stabilization based on observer in this subsection we will design an observer of the pch model 14 and study its observer based robust stabilization problem in the subsection unlike the traditional error system method we adopt a new approach to develop observer based robust stabilization result for system 14 based on 14 we design an observer system of system 14 as follows 17 x ˆ t a 1 x ˆ h x ˆ t a 2 x ˆ h x ˆ t h g x ˆ u k 2 t m t y t y ˆ t g x ˆ w y ˆ t g t x ˆ h x ˆ t from which and system 14 by applying the augmented technique wang 2007 one can obtain 18 x t b x h x t f x h x t h g x u g x w where k 2 r 3 6 is a weighted matrix x t x t x ˆ t t h x t h x t h x ˆ t h x t h h x t h h x ˆ t h g x g t x g t x ˆ t b x a 1 x 0 k 2 t m t g t x a 1 x ˆ k 2 t m t g t x ˆ f x a 2 x 0 0 a 2 x ˆ remark 3 1 it should be pointed out that for studying the observer based control problem one usually constructs an error system by using the original and observer systems however the method is suitable for the linear model or approximate linear model du et al 2012 zwierzewicz 2015 while for a general system it is very difficult to obtain its error one note system 14 of the paper is not linear model or approximate linear model since there exists r ϕ a and b in a 1 x therefore motivated by wang 2007 we adopt an augmented technique to develop a dimension expansion system 18 which is different from the ones in du et al 2012 zwierzewicz 2015 therefore the method presented in this paper is more general to study the robust control problem of system 18 based on observer method we give the definition and two assumptions the observer based robust control problem of system 18 design an observer based output feedback control law as u a x ˆ y with the observer x ˆ f x ˆ y u such that all the states of system 18 under the control law are asymptotic stabilization when w 0 moreover for any non zero w ξ ξ is a bounded region on the disturbance w which will be defined below and under the zero state response condition 19 φ s 0 w s 0 s h 0 the closed loop system satisfies 20 0 t z s 2 d s γ 2 0 t w s 2 d s t 0 where γ 0 is the disturbance attenuation level and z is the penalty signal which is designed as 21 z t ρ g 1 t x h x t with ρ r 3 3 being a weighted matrix g 1 x g x m i 3 3 0 3 3 and g 1 x has the full column rank to clearly show the process we give the control principle structure diagram in fig 1 below assumption s1 hamiltonian function h x and its gradient h x satisfy 22 1 ε 1 x h x ε 2 x 23 2 l 1 x t h x h x l 2 x where ε 1 ε 2 l 1 l 2 are some functions of k type remark 3 2 the assumption is true for the hamiltonian function 13 assumption s2 coutinho and souza 2008 assume that the disturbance w belongs to the following set 24 ξ w r q c 2 0 w t w d t 1 where c is a positive real number for the observer based robust stabilization problem of system 18 we have the following main results theorem 3 3 under assumptions s1 and s2 consider the system 18 for the given γ 0 assume that there exist a positive definite symmetric matrice p with appropriate dimension a positive number ι and a constant matrix k 2 such that 25 γ 2 ι 1 0 26 θ 1 e p ι g x g x t f x f t x p 0 where e d i a g e 11 e 22 e 11 a 1 x a 1 t x 1 γ 2 g 1 x g 1 t x e 22 a 1 x ˆ a 1 t x ˆ g 1 x ˆ ρ t ρ g 1 t x ˆ 1 γ 2 g 1 x ˆ g 1 t x ˆ 2 k 2 t g 1 t x ˆ 2 g 1 x ˆ k 2 then an h stabilization controller of the system 18 can be designed as 27 u m k 2 h x ˆ t m β t 28 β t λ m t y t m t y ˆ t where λ ρ t ρ 2 1 2 γ 2 i m m 3 remark 3 4 according to the definition of the robust control problem the proof of theorem 3 3 should be divided into two steps 1 under the controller 27 we prove that for any non zero w ξ and under the zero state response condition 19 the closed loop system 18 satisfies γ dissipative inequality 20 2 when the disturbance w is equal to zero the system is asymptotically stable proof substituting 27 and 28 into 18 one can get 29 x t b x h x t f x h x t h g x w where b x b 11 b 12 b 21 b 22 f x a 2 x 0 0 a 2 x ˆ b 11 a 1 x 1 2 g 1 x ρ t ρ g 1 t x 1 2 γ 2 g 1 x g 1 t x b 12 1 2 g 1

krasovskii stability theory the closed loop system 29 is asymptotically stable when w 0 therefore the proof is completed in theorem 3 3 we have given a delay independent result on system 29 which implies that the result has conservatism for small delay system gu et al 2003 in the following we present a delay dependent result theorem 3 5 under assumptions s1 and s2 consider the system 18 for

disturbance remark 3 8 different from existing results on the dp ship du et al 2012 jin et al 2017 we consider a more general form and present some delay independent and delay dependent results in addition it should be pointed out that the matrices d and d 1 in the ship system 9 may contain the state variable not just constant one which implies that the results obtained of the paper have broader application than existing results on the dp ship system 3 2 adaptive robust stabilization based on observer in this subsection we will study observer based adaptive robust stabilization

similar conditions can be seen in yang and guo 2018 sun and fu 2016 moreover many real systems satisfy the assumption in existing literature wang 2007 zhou et al 2019 yang and guo 2018 sun and fu 2016 particularly for the ship system assumption s3 is also true in studying adaptive control problem further details also see zhou et al 2019 and the simulation example in section 4 below under assumption

controller 68 of the paper the simulation results of the ship speed on the actual value and estimated value are shown in fig 3 a 3c simulation results of two speed differences are shown in fig 4 a 4c in fig 5 a 5b we give the simulation results on the trajectories of ship motion with two different tasks respectively from fig 3a 3c it can be seen that under the observer based adaptive robust

system tend to be consistent within 15 s when the disturbance w is removed and all converge to equilibrium from fig 4a 4c we can see that the error curves are in a downward trend and tend to zero within 15 s these show that the observer values in this paper can quickly approximate the actual values from fig 5a 5b it is obvious that under the disturbance input the dp ship system with two different tasks can reach the desired positions and the curves are smooth respectively it is well worth pointing out that since our initial angle is 45 while the expected angle is 0 in two tasks the ship will make a circle at 20 20 and stabilize at 20 20 in fig 5b therefore the above simulation results show that the observer based controllers designed of the paper are very effective in the adaptive robust stabilization the ship system 4 2 comparisons with existing dp control law in the following to show the superiority of the method presented in this paper we give several comparison results with du et al 2012 and ngongi and du 2014 respectively under the same initial conditions the initial condition settings are the same as in subsection 4 1 of the paper and same dp model without time delay note in ref du et al 2012 the authors applied the error method and in ref ngongi and du 2014 the authors proposed a high gain observer based pd controller method the simulation results are shown in figs 4 4 a 4 5 c using our method in the paper and figs 4 6 a 4 7 c using the method in du et al 2012 and figs 4 8 a 4 9 c using the method in ngongi and du 2014 from fig 6a 7c it is easy to see that by using our method in the paper the errors between the estimated value of the observer and the actual value are gradually reduced and the actual values can be accurately estimated within 20 s while the stabilization time by using du et al 2012 fig 8a 9c is longer and the observer can not accurately estimate the actual value in a short time in addition we know from fig 10a 11c by using the method in ref ngongi and du 2014 although the errors converge to zero in a short time when the disturbance is added in 4 6 s the motion speed in ngongi and du 2014 increases instantaneously compared with the method in our paper fig 6a 7c the pd controller designed in ngongi and du 2014 has poor robustness moreover the error curves in our paper fig 7a 7c is uniformly decreasing rather than the repeated fluctuations like ngongi and du 2014 fig 11a 11c therefore under the observer system and controller designed in this paper the dp ship system has faster estimation speed smaller overshoot and better robustness than the ones in du et al 2012 ngongi and du 2014 respectively 5 conclusion this paper has investigated the observer based adaptive robust stabilization problem for the dp ship system with time delay and presented several delay independent and delay dependent results unlike traditional methods we have adopted a novel idea to design robust stabilization controller namely by transforming the dp ship system into its hamiltonian model and applying hamiltonian method and augmented technology we have developed an dimension expansion system based on which the paper has presented several robust stabilization and adaptive robust stabilization results based on the observer method the simulation results have shown the effectiveness of the designed controller in the paper it is well worth pointing out that the ship system under study of the paper is more general and the method used of the paper can be applied to study other nonlinear system not just linear and or approximate linear system in the future we will consider some more complex ship models such as dynamic positioning ships with actuator faults refs zhang et al 2020c and under actuated cable laying

21082,different modeling methods and potential flow methods have substantial influences on the prediction results of wave loads and hydroelastic responses of ships traveling in waves so it is of great importance to carry out uncertainty analyses for relevant aspects for a very large bulk carrier the 1d euler bernoulli beam and 3d fem are used to build the dry structure model and 3d methods in the frequency domain and time domain are used to predict the wave loads the influences and uncertainties of the structure modeling method on the hydroelastic response and wave load are assessed which indicates that the 1d euler bernoulli beam model overestimates the resonant frequencies furthermore the hydroelastic responses and wave loads are analyzed using three dimensional methods in the frequency domain and time domain for a 205 000 dwt bulk carrier a 500 000 dwt ore carrier and a 156 800 m3 lng carrier furthermore a comparison is conducted between the numerical prediction results and experimental data measured from the see keeping basin meanwhile the error principles of the numerical analysis are investigated which infers that the vertical bending moment and horizontal bending

approximately simulate three dimensional modeling uncertainties will be introduced in terms of the following aspects the ratio of the hull section width and height to the length width determines whether to use a short thick beam or slender beam the distribution of the mass and center of gravity of segments the distribution of the section stiffness vertical bending stiffness horizontal bending stiffness torsional stiffness and shear stiffness the adoption of a variable cross section or constant cross section and the influence of an abrupt section or discontinuous section on the structural stiffness in the initial design stage of a ship or in the absence of detailed structural drawings it is often impossible to obtain a very comprehensive section stiffness even if the vertical vibration of the ship is only simulated the vertical bending stiffness and vertical shear stiffness are needed for the simulation of a short thick beam here this paper uses the variable section slender beam to approximate the vertical vibration and the height of the gravity center of each section is set as the gravity center of the whole ship to study the difference between two dimensional modeling and three dimensional modeling on the one hand according to the analysis report and suggestion of ittc 2008 on uncertainty and the analysis of test uncertainty factors given by storhaug 2007 some uncertainty factors of the scale model test are summarized and analyzed in the manuscript the influence of temperature on instrument sensitivity and calibration the wave making quality the generated wave height and frequency are different from the required value the change in the wavelength along the length of the basin the reflection effect of the tank wall the limited repetition times of the signal tests the deviation of the inertia moment of the measuring beam section the rigid connection between the model measuring beam and the hull the inconsistent weight distribution between the model and the real ship the different damping values of the model and the real ship the limited number of segments etc the 1d beam model and 3d fem model are generally adopted for hydroelastic structure modeling the latter model needs detailed design data and is time consuming the process of 2d and 3d hydroelastic structural modeling in regular waves has been investigated for a bulk carrier hirdaris et al 2003 a simplified beam model for torsional and horizontal bending vibrations has been proposed malenica et al 2006 the wave loads and hydroelasticity in the design of ships and offshore structures have been comprehensively summarized hirdaris and temarel 2009 hirdaris et al 2014 an elastic beam model has been adopted to simultaneously simulate the vertical transversal and torsional stiffness of a container ship and the torsional moment and horizontal and vertical bending moments on the ship hull have been studied zhu et al 2011 a fluid structure interaction fsi model has been adopted to assess nonlinear global wave loads on a 10 000 teu container ship lee et al 2012 structural modeling of the hydroelastic responses and wave loads of an 11 400 teu large container ship has been analyzed senjanović et al 2014 the effects of different structural modeling methods on the global elastic vibration responses of a 16 000 teu ultralarge container ship have been investigated shin et al 2015 the torsional moment and horizontal and vertical bending moments of the beam model are different from those of the 3d fem model however part of the differences may be from the potential methods in which the beam model is combined with the rankine source in the time domain and the 3d fem model is combined with green s function in the frequency domain these studies show that there are some differences in the hydroelastic responses and wave loads of ship hulls when adopting the 1d beam model or 3d fem because the hull deformations induced by the bending shearing and torsional deformations of the beam model are not completely coordinated with the 3d fem to simulate the profile characteristics of large openings in model tests taking container ships as an example the vertical horizontal torsional stiffness and shear center of the backbone are satisfied simultaneously by model design in see keeping basins zhao et al 2017 the experiments on a 13 000 teu container ship were carried out in the wave basin chen et al 2017 a segmented model tank test of a 500 000 dwt ore carrier wang et al 2016 a b and a test on a 550 000 dwt ore carrier li et al 2018 has been carried out to study the hydroelastic responses and springing based on the similarity law of the vertical bending stiffness model tests have been carried out on a naval ship in a basin to study the wave loads and rigid motions of the vessel traveling on irregular waves jiao et al 2019 a model test study on the hydroelastic response of slamming effects has been presented for a 10 000 container ship on oblique waves lin et al 2020 unfortunately there is no statistical analysis of the factors affecting the accuracy of the model tests in terms of the numerical prediction of wave loads and springing the nonlinear effects on the wave loads and hydroelastic responses of a 10 000 teu container ship have been studied by comparing the results of four different numerical methods and model experiments hirdaris et al 2016 a boundary element method in the time domain has been adopted to assess wave loads and ship motions in waves riesner et al 2016 statistical values of linear responses were obtained for the comparison of experimental and computational results kim and kim 2016 several high fidelity procedures have been proposed for numerical analysis of hydroelastic responses and a fully coupled model was introduced including the 3d rankine panel method 2d generalized wagner model and 1d 3d fem kim et al 2015 by considering the nonlinear restoring force and slamming force a kind of 3d nonlinear time domain hydroelastic method has been developed for a 13 000 teu container ship chen et al 2015 2017 the wave loads and ship motions of a bow flare ship have been studied by model tests and numerical predictions of irregular waves jiao et al 2019 the nonlinear hydroelastic responses and horizontal and vertical bending moments of a 13 000 teu container ship have been numerically assessed by the rankine source and numerical damping beach methods in the time domain chen et al 2019 the above calculations and analyses did not fully involve statistical analyses to summarize the uncertainty in wave load assessment at present the uncertainty law of wave loads has not been fully clarified especially in terms of the error of the model tests and numerical methods it is urgent to develop proper methods amount of analyses and comparisons under realistic demands from industry standards in this paper model tests and numerical calculations are utilized to investigate the uncertainties of structural dynamic responses and wave loads for different structural modeling and potential methods and to clarify the uncertainty level the numerical prediction methods include the fscm frequency domain speed correction method yang et al 2020 tdgf time domain green s function yang et al 2019 and iorm inner and outer regions method yang et al 2018 in three dimensional hydroelastic mechanics all the model tests of the three ships were carried out in the basin of the cssrc china ship scientific research center 2 theoretical basis and solving equations 2 1 basic assumption and definition in the theory of seakeeping and hydroelasticity the problems of ship motion the wave load and the dynamic response are generally solved based on a potential hypothesis and assumption of small structural deformation the traveling speed and wave direction of the floating structure are shown in fig 1 in addition 180 deg and 0 deg denote the head sea and following sea

potential by the boundary element method bem the panels need to be distributed on the wetted body surface and free surface the sketch of the iorm method is shown in fig 2 a virtual control surface surrounding the floating body is introduced to satisfy the radiation condition in the far field the inner fluid region is composed of the floating structure control surface and free surface where the rankine sources are distributed on the whole enclosed surface with the unit normal vectors pointing out of the inner fluid field and the tdgf method is used in the outer fluid field the total perturbation velocity potential in the two fields is expressed as 2 φ i x t φ i x t φ 0 x t ω i φ i i x t φ i i x t φ 0 x t ω i i the integral equation in the internal fluid zones is expressed as

full loading is considered to assess the influence of structural modeling and the main parameters are shown in table 1 the hydrodynamic model of the bulk carrier is composed of 1962 elements 1035 elements under the still water plane which is shown in fig 3 a there are 551 elements on free surface and 171 elements on the virtual control surface in fig 3 b respectively 3 2 model test in the basin the 1 50 segmented model test was performed at the towing basin in the cssrc in the model test two circular steel beams with variable cross sections are used to simulate the vertical vibration stiffness of the ship hull structures and the dimensions and vertical inertia of the backbone are shown in table 2 the ship hull is mainly made of fiberglass reinforced plastic and is divided into 10 sections to simulate the elastic vibration and measure the vertical bending moment which is shown in fig 4 in the full load and ballast model tests the same hull model and beam model are used but the mass distribution is different if there is no special explanation all the numerical calculation and model test results presented later in the paper have been converted to full scale the model test scenario is shown in fig 5 the time history and spectrum of the vertical bending moment at the experimental scale are shown in fig 7 the vibration damping of a ship girder is very important to the dynamic response characteristics of wave loads the total viscous damping in the dynamic responses includes the hydrodynamic viscous effect and structural viscous effect the structural damping of a ship hull is formed by the internal hysteresis damping of structural materials and the friction between structures material hysteresis damping accounts for the main part of structural damping and is related to the ship type and structure type however hydrodynamic damping is related to the viscous fluid effect ship scale and hull shape the two viscous effects are difficult to assess theoretically and are always measured by decay experiments for convenience of calculation the logarithmic decay rate δ is usually used to represent the vibration damping of the ship girder the time domain attenuation curves of the hammering test in still water are shown in fig 6 the logarithmic attenuation rate of the ship girder is calculated by eq 9a and n denotes the number of cycles the nondimensional damping ratio μ is solved by formula 9b 9a δ 1 n ln x i x i n 9b δ 2 π μ 1 μ 2 2 π μ and the viscous damping b in eq 7 is obtained by the following formula 9c b 2 μ a a c c c the total nondimensional viscous damping ratio μ of the two vertical vertical bending mode is 0 69 which is obtained from the hammering experiment in the model test as shown in fig 7 then the artificial viscous damping ratio sets all the elastic modes in the numerical prediction to 0 69 the hydrodynamic viscous damping ratio is set to 3 for heave roll and pitch in the numerical prediction based on empirical formulas sheng and liu 2004 and former experience 3 3 dry structural modal analysis 1 3d fem structural model the 3d fem model of the ship hull is composed of 178 157 shell elements and 124 032 beam elements that is 302 189 elements in total the young s modulus and density of the steel are e 2 06 10 5 mpa and ρ 7850 kg m 3 respectively the modal response analysis is performed by patran nastran and the results are recognized as stable after trying different mesh sizes the first four vibration modes of the 3d fem model are the two node vertical bending mode one node torsional mode two node horizontal bending mode and three node vertical bending mode and the corresponding intrinsic frequencies range from 3 8 rad s to 7 6 rad s as shown in fig 8 because the vertical bending moment is the most important in the design of bulk cargo ship loads the variable section circular straight beam is used in the model test to simulate the vertical vibration stiffness of the ship structure the variable section beam which is the same as the model test is adopted in the numerical calculation and its elastic vibration mode is shown in fig 9 there are 100 beam elements in the 2d beam fem model the difference between the dry frequency corresponding to the two node vibration mode and that of the 3d fem is small but the difference in the dry frequency corresponding to the three node vertical bending vibration mode is large the natural frequencies of the three node vertical bending mode are different from those of the actual 3d model and cannot be accurately simulated even if the variable cross section steel beam of six segments is adopted the slender beam theory or euler bernoulli beam theory is no longer suitable for 3d hull vibration simulation in these cases thus the timoshenko beam theory should be used to simulate short and thick beams to consider the shear deformation of the section the theoretical study shows that the additional deformation mechanism of timoshenko beam theory can effectively reduce the stiffness of the beam that is the general euler bernoulli beam theory overestimates the natural frequencies this is confirmed by the numerical calculation results in this paper the results in fig 9 predicted by the general euler bernoulli beam theory are larger than those predicted by the 3d fem in fig 8 the wet resonant frequencies of the bulk carrier under full loads are shown in table 3 the resonant frequency of the two node vertical bending vibration mode of the model test is obtained by a hammering test in still water as well as the other segmented model tests in the paper the calculation results in the table show that the vertical two node and three node vibration frequencies predicted by the 1d beam model are very close to the model test results demonstrating the reliability of the numerical prediction method the predicted results of the 3d fem model are slightly smaller than the model test results and the vertical two node and three node vibration frequencies are 11 and 24 lower respectively this difference is mainly caused by the error of the dry structure frequencies between the 3d fem model and the beam model results in the model test when the beam model is used to simulate 3d structure modeling therefore the wet resonant frequencies of the three node vertical bending mode are different from the actual 3d mode and cannot be accurately simulated even if the variable cross section steel beam of six segments is adopted however the data from the model test also using a slender straight beam are coincident with the numerical results of the 1d beam model which demonstrates that there are no essential errors in the two cases however the slender beam theory is no longer suitable for 3d hull vibration simulation for the simulation of three node bending vibration or higher order vibrations which also leads to a certain error in the two node vertical bending mode 3 4 analysis of the results the numerical results of the amidship vertical bending moment corresponding to the 3d fem modeling method and 1d beam modeling method are shown in fig 10 11 and 12 representing the three numerical calculation methods of the fscm tdgf and iorm wm denotes the wave frequency component of the wave load which does not include a nonlinear high frequency component the numerical results show that regardless of which numerical method is used the difference between the two modeling methods is not obvious among the wave frequency ranges and all of them are slightly larger than the experimental data around the peak value responses the method using the beam model instead of complex 3d fem modeling is very effective which can greatly save modeling and data analysis time there are large differences in the response amplitudes among the fscm tdgf and iorm around the resonant frequency this is because the responses around the resonant frequency are very sensitive to damping however the numerical results of damping from the radiation potential of the three methods are different the radiation damping of the two node vertical bending mode obtained by the fscm is shown in fig 13 which is very small around the resonant frequency the responses of the tdgf and iorm are solved in the time domain so they do not have direct radiation potential damping to compare with that of the fscm however it is impossible to directly generate such short regular waves corresponding to the resonant frequency under laboratory conditions so it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the specific response amplitude of these three methods in the high frequency band and only the resonant frequency can be verified by the hamming test in still water 4 uncertainty analysis of different potential methods and nonlinear springing 4 1 error and uncertainty analysis method each point in the wave load transfer function represents a sample for statistics and then the ratio of the numerical results to the experimental data is defined as follows 10 r v num v exp the mean value r standard deviation σ r and cov coefficient of variation of the ratio are defined as follows 11a r i 1 n r i n 11b σ r i 1 n r i r 2 n 1 11c cov σ r r in the tank test of the cssrc the frp is generally used to make the ship hull and then it is divided into 4 to 10 segments one to two steel beams are used to connect the segments in the interior of ships variable cross section steel beams are used to transfer the wave load and simulate the vibration stiffness of the ship hull the weight of each segment is adjusted to the target state by steel blocks in the past 30 years based on the experience of dozens of ship model tests the cssrc considers that the error of wave load model tests under laboratory conditions is less than 5 wang et al 2010 si et al 2020 if there is 5 uncertainty in the model test the total cov of motion or the wave loads for the numerical prediction is 11d cov total cov 2 0 05 2 4 2 introduction of the experimental facilities the model tests of the bulk carrier and the ore carrier are carried out in a towing tank fig 14 a and those of the lng carrier are performed in a sea keeping basin fig 14 b this is because there are only head seas for bulk carriers and ore carriers but there are also oblique seas for lng carriers the length width and depth of the towing tank are 470 m 14 m and 7 m respectively and those of the sea keeping basin are 69 m 49 m and 4 m respectively 4 3 205 000 dwt bulk carrier 1 the model definition the main parameters of the 205 000 dwt bulk carrier under full loading have been given in the previous section and only the data under ballast conditions are given in table 4 the viscous damping ratio of the two vertical bending modes is 0 55 from the hammering experiment in the model test as shown in fig 15 the previous research in the paper shows that 1d beams are feasible for predicting wave loads beam simulation is used to model the structure of the bulk carrier under ballast conditions the modal shapes and the frequencies of the first four vertical bending vibration modes are shown in fig 16 the predicted wet resonant frequencies of different numerical methods are shown in table 5 the predicted results of the three numerical methods are very consistent and the first two elastic modal resonance frequencies are very consistent with the model test results but the four node vertical bending moment modal resonance frequency is approximately 18 5 larger than the model test data this is because the ten segment model is used to model the elastic hull in the model test which has limitations on the high order vibration simulation of the hull in addition the resonant frequency of the four node vertical bending moment mode predicted by the numerical simulation is approximately 18 compared with that of the model test under full loading conditions the wave height of all regular wave cases is taken as approximately 0 08 m in the model tests which is equivalent to 4 m at full scale the wave load transfer functions of the vbm vertical bending moment are shown in fig 17 and fig 18 and the uncertainty results of the vbm at amidship are shown in table 6 and table 7 the statistical mean values predicted by the three numerical methods are greater than the model test data the prediction results of the fscm method and iorm method show the same accuracy which are the most consistent with the model test data under full loading and the dispersion of the fscm is the smallest during ω e l g between 5 0 and 10 0 the prediction error of the tdgf method is the largest among the three methods under ballast conditions for the other frequency ranges the prediction accuracies of the three methods are almost the same the reason is that the flare of the ship hull at the static water surface is larger than that under full load conditions and the tdgf method easily diverges for ships with large flares 4 4 500 000 dwt ore carrier 1 the model definition the main parameters are shown in table 8 and the transverse ship hull line and hydrodynamic model in the hydroelastic analysis are shown in fig 19 and fig 20 respectively the hydrodynamic model of the ore carrier is composed of 1314 elements which is shown in fig 20 a there are 551 elements on free surface and 171 elements on the virtual control surface in fig 20 b respectively in the 1 73 5 segmented model test two circular steel beams with equal cross sections are used to simulate the vertical vibration stiffness of the hull the hull is mainly made of fiberglass reinforced plastic which is divided into nine sections to simulate the vertical elastic vibration and measure the vertical bending moment as shown in fig 21 the model test of the heading wave is carried out in the towing basin as shown in fig 22 the viscous damping ratios of the two vertical bending modes of the full load and ballast are 0 67 and 0 49 respectively from the hammering experiment in the model test as shown in fig 23 and fig 24 the vertical bending vibration modes and frequencies of the first four orders of the dry structures under full loading and ballast conditions are shown in fig 25 and fig 26 the resonant frequency under ballast conditions is substantially higher than that under full loading conditions the natural period of rigid body motion and the resonant period of the elastic mode are shown in table 9 and 10 the prediction results of the three numerical methods are very close except for the wet resonant period of pitching and the four node vertical bending moment vibration mode being larger than the model test results the other results are very consistent with the model test results the pitch period error is mainly caused by the longitudinal mass distribution error in the model test compared with the model test results under full loading and ballast cases the predicted four node vertical bending moment vibration modes are approximately 26 and 33 respectively however the four node vertical bending moment of the previous bulk carrier is only 18 larger this is because of the equal cross section beam instead of the variable cross section beam used in the model test of the ore carrier which further increases the error the wave load transfer functions of the vbm are shown in fig 27 and fig 28 and the uncertainty results of the vbm at amidship are shown in table 11 and table 12 the statistical mean values predicted by the three numerical methods are greater than the model test results the prediction results of the fscm are the most consistent with the model test data under full loading and the dispersion is the smallest followed by the iorm when ω e l g is between 5 0 and 6 5 or less than 1 0 the prediction error of the tdgf method is very large when ω e l g is between 5 0 and 8 0 the prediction error of the tdgf method is the largest under ballast conditions the standard deviation is 1 05 which is the largest in tables 11 and 12 because the flare of the ship hull at the static water surface is larger than that under full loading conditions the tdgf method easily diverges for ships with large flares 4 5 156 800 m3 lng carrier 1 the model definition the main parameters are shown in table 13 and the transverse ship hull line and hydrodynamic model in the hydroelastic analysis are shown in fig 29 and fig 30 respectively the hydrodynamic model of the ore carrier is composed of 2211 elements which is shown in fig 30 a there are 551 elements on free surface and 171 elements on the virtual control surface in fig 30 b respectively in the 1 68 segmented model test under full loading a single circular steel beam with equal cross sections is used to simulate the vertical vibration stiffness of the hull the hull is mainly made of fiberglass reinforced plastic which is divided into four sections to simulate the elastic vibration and measure the vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torque as shown in fig 31 the model tests of heading waves and oblique waves are carried out in the see keeping tank the viscous damping ratio of the roll and the two vertical vertical bending mode under full loading are 3 66 and 0 95 from the decay experiment in still water as shown in fig 34 and fig 35 in the 1 50 segmented model test of ballast conditions two i beams with equal cross sections are used to simulate the vertical vibration stiffness of the hull the hull is mainly made of fiberglass reinforced plastic which is divided into 10 sections to simulate the elastic vibration and measure the vertical bending moment as shown in fig 32 the model test of the heading wave is carried out in the see keeping tank as shown in fig 33 the viscous damping ratio of the two vertical vertical bending mode of the ballast is 0 60 from the hammering experiment in the model test because the full load model test does not simulate the horizontal vibration stiffness and torsional vibration stiffness of the hull structure the paper only uses a single circular steel beam with equal cross section to simulate the vertical vibration stiffness in the structural finite element modeling as the model test in addition the vertical vibration stiffness of the beam with equal cross sections is also used in the ballast condition as in the model test the modal shapes and frequencies of the first four orders of the vertical vibration modes of the dry structures under full loading and ballast conditions are shown in fig 36 and fig 37 the natural period of rigid body motion and the resonant period of the elastic mode are shown in table 14 and table 15 because the hull is divided into only four sections in the full load model test the natural frequency error corresponding to the three node vertical bending mode is very large and four node vertical bending cannot occur although the hull is divided into 10 sections in the ballast model test the wet resonant frequency of the four node vertical bending mode is too large and the characteristic frequency is not captured in the hydrostatic hammering test the prediction results of the three numerical methods are very close the results of the two node vertical bending mode for both loading conditions and the three node vertical bending mode of the ballast condition are very consistent with the model test results the roll period error is mainly caused by the transversal mass distribution error in the model test the wave load transfer functions of the vbm under full loading are shown in fig 38 and the corresponding uncertainty results are listed in table 16 the wave loading of the hbm horizontal bending moment under full loading is shown in fig 39 and the corresponding uncertainty results are listed in table 17 the wave loading of the tm torsional moment under full loading is shown in fig 40 and the corresponding uncertainty results are listed in table 18 the wave loading of the vbm under ballast is shown in fig 41 and the corresponding uncertainty results are listed in table 19 except for the torsional bending moment the prediction results of the fscm and iorm are the most consistent with the model test data and the dispersion is the smallest followed by the tdgf method fig 40 shows that the numerical results of the fscm and iorm are approximately 0 4 times the experimental data in particular the prediction results for the tm of the tdgf method are seriously distorted for ω e l g between 3 5 and 9 5 the prediction error of the tdgf method is the largest among the three methods under ballast conditions and the predicted accuracy of the tdgf method is lower than that under full loading because the flare of the ship hull at the static water surface is larger than that under full loading conditions the tdgf method easily diverges for ships with large flares however the prediction error of the vertical and horizontal bending moments under full loading is small while that of the torsional moment is obvious 5 conclusions research on the wave load uncertainty of very large traveling ships is of great importance for the rational design of ships in this paper many numerical calculations and analyses are conducted and relevant model tests are carried out according to different dry structure modeling methods and three numerical prediction methods the numerical method includes three dimensional time domain and three dimensional frequency domain hydroelastic methods the ship types include a very large bulk carrier ore carrier and lng carrier meanwhile the loading conditions include full loading and ballast cases and the load types include the vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and longitudinal torsional moment the error and uncertainty between the numerical predictions and model tests are investigated some important conclusions are as follows 1 the numerical results and experimental data indicate that the dry natural frequencies and wet resonant frequencies of the three node vertical bending mode are different from the actual 3d mode and cannot be accurately simulated even if the variable cross section steel beam of six segments is adopted however if the same simulation approach is adopted such as the beam model the results of the model test and numerical prediction are coincident the reason for the error between the 1d beam model and 3d fem is that the slender beam theory or euler bernoulli beam theory is no longer suitable for 3d hull vibration simulation for the simulation of three node bending vibration or higher order vibrations which overestimates the resonant frequencies thus it is better to adopt timoshenko beam theory for hydroelasticity in the future with sufficient sectional parameters 2 from the viewpoint of ship hulls with multiple segments ten segmented or nine segmented model tests can accurately simulate and obtain two node and three node vertical vibrations but the four node vertical vibration error is large as the segments are not fine enough to simulate four node bending vibration moreover the simulation error of the four node vertical vibration natural frequency is within 20 for a variable cross section beam and the simulation error of the four node vertical vibration natural frequency is approximately 30 for a constant cross section beam 3 for large forward speed ships the fscm method and iorm method have the best numerical prediction for most load cases but the tdgf method has the worst prediction for some load cases especially the ballast load case however the vertical bending moment and horizontal bending moment have smaller numerical prediction errors while the torsional moment has the largest error the numerical results of the torsional moment of the fscm and iorm are approximately 0 4 times that of the experimental data the total cov of the vertical bending moment ranges from 0 13 to 0 36 for the fscm 0 15 to 0 61 for the iorm and 0 27 to 0 73 for the tdgf method 4 for the very large bulk carrier ore carrier and lng carrier because the flare near the still water surface under ballast conditions is larger than that under full loading conditions the calculation results of the tdgf method are unstable and the error is large 5 the viscous damping ratios of the two node vertical bending mode obtained from the hammering experiments of the model tests range from 0 49 to 0 60 under ballast conditions and the values range from 0 67 to 0 95 under full loading credit authorship contribution statement peng yang conceptualization methodology writing review editing wei zhang formal analysis writing original draft xueliang wang model

21082,different modeling methods and potential flow methods have substantial influences on the prediction results of wave loads and hydroelastic responses of ships traveling in waves so it is of great importance to carry out uncertainty analyses for relevant aspects for a very large bulk carrier the 1d euler bernoulli beam and 3d fem are used to build the dry structure model and 3d methods in the frequency domain and time domain are used to predict the wave loads the influences and uncertainties of the structure modeling method on the hydroelastic response and wave load are assessed which indicates that the 1d euler bernoulli beam model overestimates the resonant frequencies furthermore the hydroelastic responses and wave loads are analyzed using three dimensional methods in the frequency domain and time domain for a 205 000 dwt bulk carrier a 500 000 dwt ore carrier and a 156 800 m3 lng carrier furthermore a comparison is conducted between the numerical prediction results and experimental data measured from the see keeping basin meanwhile the error principles of the numerical analysis are investigated which infers that the vertical bending moment and horizontal bending

approximately simulate three dimensional modeling uncertainties will be introduced in terms of the following aspects the ratio of the hull section width and height to the length width determines whether to use a short thick beam or slender beam the distribution of the mass and center of gravity of segments the distribution of the section stiffness vertical bending stiffness horizontal bending stiffness torsional stiffness and shear stiffness the adoption of a variable cross section or constant cross section and the influence of an abrupt section or discontinuous section on the structural stiffness in the initial design stage of a ship or in the absence of detailed structural drawings it is often impossible to obtain a very comprehensive section stiffness even if the vertical vibration of the ship is only simulated the vertical bending stiffness and vertical shear stiffness are needed for the simulation of a short thick beam here this paper uses the variable section slender beam to approximate the vertical vibration and the height of the gravity center of each section is set as the gravity center of the whole ship to study the difference between two dimensional modeling and three dimensional modeling on the one hand according to the analysis report and suggestion of ittc 2008 on uncertainty and the analysis of test uncertainty factors given by storhaug 2007 some uncertainty factors of the scale model test are summarized and analyzed in the manuscript the influence of temperature on instrument sensitivity and calibration the wave making quality the generated wave height and frequency are different from the required value the change in the wavelength along the length of the basin the reflection effect of the tank wall the limited repetition times of the signal tests the deviation of the inertia moment of the measuring beam section the rigid connection between the model measuring beam and the hull the inconsistent weight distribution between the model and the real ship the different damping values of the model and the real ship the limited number of segments etc the 1d beam model and 3d fem model are generally adopted for hydroelastic structure modeling the latter model needs detailed design data and is time consuming the process of 2d and 3d hydroelastic structural modeling in regular waves has been investigated for a bulk carrier hirdaris et al 2003 a simplified beam model for torsional and horizontal bending vibrations has been proposed malenica et al 2006 the wave loads and hydroelasticity in the design of ships and offshore structures have been comprehensively summarized hirdaris and temarel 2009 hirdaris et al 2014 an elastic beam model has been adopted to simultaneously simulate the vertical transversal and torsional stiffness of a container ship and the torsional moment and horizontal and vertical bending moments on the ship hull have been studied zhu et al 2011 a fluid structure interaction fsi model has been adopted to assess nonlinear global wave loads on a 10 000 teu container ship lee et al 2012 structural modeling of the hydroelastic responses and wave loads of an 11 400 teu large container ship has been analyzed senjanović et al 2014 the effects of different structural modeling methods on the global elastic vibration responses of a 16 000 teu ultralarge container ship have been investigated shin et al 2015 the torsional moment and horizontal and vertical bending moments of the beam model are different from those of the 3d fem model however part of the differences may be from the potential methods in which the beam model is combined with the rankine source in the time domain and the 3d fem model is combined with green s function in the frequency domain these studies show that there are some differences in the hydroelastic responses and wave loads of ship hulls when adopting the 1d beam model or 3d fem because the hull deformations induced by the bending shearing and torsional deformations of the beam model are not completely coordinated with the 3d fem to simulate the profile characteristics of large openings in model tests taking container ships as an example the vertical horizontal torsional stiffness and shear center of the backbone are satisfied simultaneously by model design in see keeping basins zhao et al 2017 the experiments on a 13 000 teu container ship were carried out in the wave basin chen et al 2017 a segmented model tank test of a 500 000 dwt ore carrier wang et al 2016 a b and a test on a 550 000 dwt ore carrier li et al 2018 has been carried out to study the hydroelastic responses and springing based on the similarity law of the vertical bending stiffness model tests have been carried out on a naval ship in a basin to study the wave loads and rigid motions of the vessel traveling on irregular waves jiao et al 2019 a model test study on the hydroelastic response of slamming effects has been presented for a 10 000 container ship on oblique waves lin et al 2020 unfortunately there is no statistical analysis of the factors affecting the accuracy of the model tests in terms of the numerical prediction of wave loads and springing the nonlinear effects on the wave loads and hydroelastic responses of a 10 000 teu container ship have been studied by comparing the results of four different numerical methods and model experiments hirdaris et al 2016 a boundary element method in the time domain has been adopted to assess wave loads and ship motions in waves riesner et al 2016 statistical values of linear responses were obtained for the comparison of experimental and computational results kim and kim 2016 several high fidelity procedures have been proposed for numerical analysis of hydroelastic responses and a fully coupled model was introduced including the 3d rankine panel method 2d generalized wagner model and 1d 3d fem kim et al 2015 by considering the nonlinear restoring force and slamming force a kind of 3d nonlinear time domain hydroelastic method has been developed for a 13 000 teu container ship chen et al 2015 2017 the wave loads and ship motions of a bow flare ship have been studied by model tests and numerical predictions of irregular waves jiao et al 2019 the nonlinear hydroelastic responses and horizontal and vertical bending moments of a 13 000 teu container ship have been numerically assessed by the rankine source and numerical damping beach methods in the time domain chen et al 2019 the above calculations and analyses did not fully involve statistical analyses to summarize the uncertainty in wave load assessment at present the uncertainty law of wave loads has not been fully clarified especially in terms of the error of the model tests and numerical methods it is urgent to develop proper methods amount of analyses and comparisons under realistic demands from industry standards in this paper model tests and numerical calculations are utilized to investigate the uncertainties of structural dynamic responses and wave loads for different structural modeling and potential methods and to clarify the uncertainty level the numerical prediction methods include the fscm frequency domain speed correction method yang et al 2020 tdgf time domain green s function yang et al 2019 and iorm inner and outer regions method yang et al 2018 in three dimensional hydroelastic mechanics all the model tests of the three ships were carried out in the basin of the cssrc china ship scientific research center 2 theoretical basis and solving equations 2 1 basic assumption and definition in the theory of seakeeping and hydroelasticity the problems of ship motion the wave load and the dynamic response are generally solved based on a potential hypothesis and

potential by the boundary element method bem the panels need to be distributed on the wetted body surface and free surface the sketch of the iorm method is shown in fig 2 a virtual control surface surrounding the floating body is introduced to satisfy the radiation condition in the far field the inner fluid region is composed of the floating structure control surface and free surface where the rankine sources are distributed on the whole enclosed surface with the unit normal vectors pointing out of the inner fluid field and the tdgf method is used in the outer fluid field the total perturbation velocity potential in the two fields is expressed as 2 φ i x t φ i x t φ 0 x t ω i φ i i x t φ i i x t φ 0 x t ω i i the integral equation in the internal fluid zones is expressed as

full loading is considered to assess the influence of structural modeling and the main parameters are shown in table 1 the hydrodynamic model of the bulk carrier is composed of 1962 elements 1035 elements under the still water plane which is shown in fig 3 a there are 551 elements on free surface and 171 elements on the virtual control surface in fig 3 b respectively 3 2 model test in the basin the 1 50 segmented model test was performed at the towing basin in the cssrc in the model test two circular steel beams with variable cross sections are used to simulate the vertical vibration stiffness of the ship hull structures and the dimensions and vertical inertia of the backbone are shown in table 2 the ship hull is mainly made of fiberglass reinforced plastic and is divided into 10 sections to simulate the elastic vibration and measure the vertical bending moment which is shown in fig 4 in the full load and ballast model tests the same hull model and beam model are used but the mass distribution is different if there is no special explanation all the numerical calculation and model test results presented later in the paper have been converted to full scale the model test scenario is shown in fig 5 the time history and spectrum of the vertical bending moment at the experimental scale are shown in fig 7 the vibration damping of a ship girder is very important to the dynamic response characteristics of wave loads the total viscous damping in the dynamic responses includes the hydrodynamic viscous effect and structural viscous effect the structural damping of a ship hull is formed by the internal hysteresis damping of structural materials and the friction between structures material hysteresis damping accounts for the main part of structural damping and is related to the ship type and structure type however hydrodynamic damping is related to the viscous fluid effect ship scale and hull shape the two viscous effects are difficult to assess theoretically and are always measured by decay experiments for convenience of calculation the logarithmic decay rate δ is usually used to represent the vibration damping of the ship girder the time domain attenuation curves of the hammering test in still water are shown in fig 6 the logarithmic attenuation rate of the ship girder is calculated by eq 9a and n denotes the number of cycles the nondimensional damping ratio μ is solved by formula 9b 9a δ 1 n ln x i x i n 9b δ 2 π μ 1 μ 2 2 π μ and the viscous damping b in eq 7 is obtained by the following formula 9c b 2 μ a a c c c the total nondimensional viscous damping ratio μ of the two vertical vertical bending mode is 0 69 which is obtained from the hammering experiment in the model test as shown in fig 7 then the artificial viscous damping ratio sets all the elastic modes in the numerical prediction to 0 69 the hydrodynamic viscous damping ratio is set to 3 for heave roll and pitch in the numerical prediction based on empirical formulas sheng and liu 2004 and former experience 3 3 dry structural modal analysis 1 3d fem structural model the 3d fem model of the ship hull is composed of 178 157 shell elements and 124 032 beam elements that is 302 189 elements in total the young s modulus and density of the steel are e 2 06 10 5 mpa and ρ 7850 kg m 3 respectively the modal response analysis is performed by patran nastran and the results are recognized as stable after trying different mesh sizes the first four vibration modes of the 3d fem model are the two node vertical bending mode one node torsional mode two node horizontal bending mode and three node vertical bending mode and the corresponding intrinsic frequencies range from 3 8 rad s to 7 6 rad s as shown in fig 8 because the vertical bending moment is the most important in the design of bulk cargo ship loads the variable section circular straight beam is used in the model test to simulate the vertical vibration stiffness of the ship structure the variable section beam which is the same as the model test is adopted in the numerical calculation and its elastic vibration mode is shown in fig 9 there are 100 beam elements in the 2d beam fem model the difference between the dry frequency corresponding to the two node vibration mode and that of the 3d fem is small but the difference in the dry frequency corresponding to the three node vertical bending vibration mode is large the natural frequencies of the three node vertical bending mode are different from those of the actual 3d model and cannot be accurately simulated even if the variable cross section steel beam of six segments is adopted the slender beam theory or euler bernoulli beam theory is no longer suitable for 3d hull vibration simulation in these cases thus the timoshenko beam theory should be used to simulate short and thick beams to consider the shear deformation of the section the theoretical study shows that the additional deformation mechanism of timoshenko beam theory can effectively reduce the stiffness of the beam that is the general euler bernoulli beam theory overestimates the natural frequencies this is confirmed by the numerical calculation results in this paper the results in fig 9 predicted by the general euler bernoulli beam theory are larger than those predicted by the 3d fem in fig 8 the wet resonant frequencies of the bulk carrier under full loads are shown in table 3 the resonant frequency of the two node vertical bending vibration mode of the model test is obtained by a hammering test in still water as well as the other segmented model tests in the paper the calculation results in the table show that the vertical two node and three node vibration frequencies predicted by the 1d beam model are very close to the model test results demonstrating the reliability of the numerical prediction method the predicted results of the 3d fem model are slightly smaller than the model test results and the vertical two node and three node vibration frequencies are 11 and 24 lower respectively this difference is mainly caused by the error of the dry structure frequencies between the 3d fem model and the beam model results in the model test when the beam model is used to simulate 3d structure modeling therefore the wet resonant frequencies of the three node vertical bending mode are different from the actual 3d mode and cannot be accurately simulated even if the variable cross section steel beam of six segments is adopted however the data from the model test also using a slender straight beam are coincident with the numerical results of the 1d beam model which demonstrates that there are no essential errors in the two cases however the slender beam theory is no longer suitable for 3d hull vibration simulation for the simulation of three node bending vibration or higher order vibrations which also leads to a certain error in the two node vertical bending mode 3 4 analysis of the results the numerical results of the amidship vertical bending moment corresponding to the 3d fem modeling method and 1d beam modeling method are shown in fig 10 11 and 12 representing the three numerical calculation methods of the fscm tdgf and iorm wm denotes the wave frequency component of the wave load which does not include a nonlinear high frequency component the numerical results show that regardless of which numerical method is used the difference between the two modeling methods is not obvious among the wave frequency ranges and all of them are slightly larger than the experimental data around the peak value responses the method using the beam model instead of complex 3d fem modeling is very effective which can greatly save modeling and data analysis time there are large differences in the response amplitudes among the fscm tdgf and iorm around the resonant frequency this is because the responses around the resonant frequency are very sensitive to damping however the numerical results of damping from the radiation potential of the three methods are different the radiation damping of the two node vertical bending mode obtained by the fscm is shown in fig 13 which is very small around the resonant frequency the responses of the tdgf and iorm are solved in the time domain so they do not have direct radiation potential damping to compare with that of the fscm however it is impossible to directly generate such short regular waves corresponding to the resonant frequency under laboratory conditions so it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the specific response amplitude of these three methods in the high frequency band and only the resonant frequency can be verified by the hamming test in still water 4 uncertainty analysis of different potential methods and nonlinear springing 4 1 error and uncertainty analysis method each point in the wave load transfer function represents a sample for statistics and then the ratio of the numerical results to the experimental data is defined as follows 10 r v num v exp the mean value r standard deviation σ r and cov coefficient of variation of the ratio are defined as follows 11a r i 1 n r i n 11b σ r i 1 n r i r 2 n 1 11c cov σ r r in the tank test of the cssrc the frp is generally used to make the ship hull and then it is divided into 4 to 10 segments one to two steel beams are used to connect the segments in the interior of ships variable cross section steel beams are used to transfer the wave load and simulate the vibration stiffness of the ship hull the weight of each segment is adjusted to the target state by steel blocks in the past 30 years based on the experience of dozens of ship model tests the cssrc considers that the error of wave load model tests under laboratory conditions is less than 5 wang et al 2010 si et al 2020 if there is 5 uncertainty in the model test the total cov of motion or the wave loads for the numerical prediction is 11d cov total cov 2 0 05 2 4 2 introduction of the experimental facilities the model tests of the bulk carrier and the ore carrier are carried out in a towing tank fig 14 a and those of the lng carrier are performed in a sea keeping basin fig 14 b this is because there are only head seas for bulk carriers and ore carriers but there are also oblique seas for lng carriers the length width and depth of the towing tank are 470 m 14 m and 7 m respectively and those of the sea keeping basin are 69 m 49 m and 4 m respectively 4 3 205 000 dwt bulk carrier 1 the model definition the main parameters of the 205 000 dwt bulk carrier under full loading have been given in the previous section and only the data under ballast conditions are given in table 4 the viscous damping ratio of the two vertical bending modes is 0 55 from the hammering experiment in the model test as shown in fig 15 the previous research in the paper shows that 1d beams are feasible for predicting wave loads beam simulation is used to model the structure of the bulk carrier under ballast conditions the modal shapes and the frequencies of the first four vertical bending vibration modes are shown in fig 16 the predicted wet resonant frequencies of different numerical methods are shown in table 5 the predicted results of the three numerical methods are very consistent and the first two elastic modal resonance frequencies are very consistent with the model test results but the four node vertical bending moment modal resonance frequency is approximately 18 5 larger than the model test data this is because the ten segment model is used to model the elastic hull in the model test which has limitations on the high order vibration simulation of the hull in addition the resonant frequency of the four node vertical bending moment mode predicted by the numerical simulation is approximately 18 compared with that of the model test under full loading conditions the wave height of all regular wave cases is taken as approximately 0 08 m in the model tests which is equivalent to 4 m at full scale the wave load transfer functions of the vbm vertical bending moment are shown in fig 17 and fig 18 and the uncertainty results of the vbm at amidship are shown in table 6 and table 7 the statistical mean values predicted by the three numerical methods are greater than the model test data the prediction results of the fscm method and iorm method show the same accuracy which are the most consistent with the model test data under full loading and the dispersion of the fscm is the smallest during ω e l g between 5 0 and 10 0 the prediction error of the tdgf method is the largest among the three methods under ballast conditions for the other frequency ranges the prediction accuracies of the three methods are almost the same the reason is that the flare of the ship hull at the static water surface is larger than that under full load conditions and the tdgf method easily diverges for ships with large flares 4 4 500 000 dwt ore carrier 1 the model definition the main parameters are shown in table 8 and the transverse ship hull line and hydrodynamic model in the hydroelastic analysis are shown in fig 19 and fig 20 respectively the hydrodynamic model of the ore carrier is composed of 1314 elements which is shown in fig 20 a there are 551 elements on free surface and 171 elements on the virtual control surface in fig 20 b respectively in the 1 73 5 segmented model test two circular steel beams with equal cross sections are used to simulate the vertical vibration stiffness of the hull the hull is mainly made of fiberglass reinforced plastic which is divided into nine sections to simulate the vertical elastic vibration and measure the vertical bending moment as shown in fig 21 the model test of the heading wave is carried out in the towing basin as shown in fig 22 the viscous damping ratios of the two vertical bending modes of the full load and ballast are 0 67 and 0 49 respectively from the hammering experiment in the model test as shown in fig 23 and fig 24 the vertical bending vibration modes and frequencies of the first four orders of the dry structures under full loading and ballast conditions are shown in fig 25 and fig 26 the resonant frequency under ballast conditions is substantially higher than that under full loading conditions the natural period of rigid body motion and the resonant period of the elastic mode are shown in table 9 and 10 the prediction results of the three numerical methods are very close except for the wet resonant period of pitching and the four node vertical bending moment vibration mode being larger than the model test results the other results are very consistent with the model test results the pitch period error is mainly caused by the longitudinal mass distribution error in the model test compared with the model test results under full loading and ballast cases the predicted four node vertical bending moment vibration modes are approximately 26 and 33 respectively however the four node vertical bending moment of the previous bulk carrier is only 18 larger this is because of the equal cross section beam instead of the variable cross section beam used in the model test of the ore carrier which further increases the error the wave load transfer functions of the vbm are shown in fig 27 and fig 28 and the uncertainty results of the vbm at amidship are shown in table 11 and table 12 the statistical mean values predicted by the three numerical methods are greater than the model test results the prediction results of the fscm are the most consistent with the model test data under full loading and the dispersion is the smallest followed by the iorm when ω e l g is between 5 0 and 6 5 or less than 1 0 the prediction error of the tdgf method is very large when ω e l g is between 5 0 and 8 0 the prediction error of the tdgf method is the largest under ballast conditions the standard deviation is 1 05 which is the largest in tables 11 and 12 because the flare of the ship hull at the static water surface is larger than that under full loading conditions the tdgf method easily diverges for ships with large flares 4 5 156 800 m3 lng carrier 1 the model definition the main parameters are shown in table 13 and the transverse ship hull line and hydrodynamic model in the hydroelastic analysis are shown in fig 29 and fig 30 respectively the hydrodynamic model of the ore carrier is composed of 2211 elements which is shown in fig 30 a there are 551 elements on free surface and 171 elements on the virtual control surface in fig 30 b respectively in the 1 68 segmented model test under full loading a single circular steel beam with equal cross sections is used to simulate the vertical vibration stiffness of the hull the hull is mainly made of fiberglass reinforced plastic which is divided into four sections to simulate the elastic vibration and measure the vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torque as shown in fig 31 the model tests of heading waves and oblique waves are carried out in the see keeping tank the viscous damping ratio of the roll and the two vertical vertical bending mode under full loading are 3 66 and 0 95 from the decay experiment in still water as shown in fig 34 and fig 35 in the 1 50 segmented model test of ballast conditions two i beams with equal cross sections are used to simulate the vertical vibration stiffness of the hull the hull is mainly made of fiberglass reinforced plastic which is divided into 10 sections to simulate the elastic vibration and measure the vertical bending moment as shown in fig 32 the model test of the heading wave is carried out in the see keeping tank as shown in fig 33 the viscous damping ratio of the two vertical vertical bending mode of the ballast is 0 60 from the hammering experiment in the model test because the full load model test does not simulate the horizontal vibration stiffness and torsional vibration stiffness of the hull structure the paper only uses a single circular steel beam with equal cross section to simulate the vertical vibration stiffness in the structural finite element modeling as the model test in addition the vertical vibration stiffness of the beam with equal cross sections is also used in the ballast condition as in the model test the modal shapes and frequencies of the first four orders of the vertical vibration modes of the dry structures under full loading and ballast conditions are shown in fig 36 and fig 37 the natural period of rigid body motion and the resonant period of the elastic mode are shown in table 14 and table 15 because the hull is divided into only four sections in the full load model test the natural frequency error corresponding to the three node vertical bending mode is very large and four node vertical bending cannot occur although the hull is divided into 10 sections in the ballast model test the wet resonant frequency of the four node vertical bending mode is too large and the characteristic frequency is not captured in the hydrostatic hammering test the prediction results of the three numerical methods are very close the results of the two node vertical bending mode for both loading conditions and the three node vertical bending mode of the ballast condition are very consistent with the model test results the roll period error is mainly caused by the transversal mass distribution error in the model test the wave load transfer functions of the vbm under full loading are shown in fig 38 and the corresponding uncertainty results are listed in table 16 the wave loading of the hbm horizontal bending moment under full loading is shown in fig 39 and the corresponding uncertainty results are listed in table 17 the wave loading of the tm torsional moment under full loading is shown in fig 40 and the corresponding uncertainty results are listed in table 18 the wave loading of the vbm under ballast is shown in fig 41 and the corresponding uncertainty results are listed in table 19 except for the torsional bending moment the prediction results of the fscm and iorm are the most consistent with the model test data and the dispersion is the smallest followed by the tdgf method fig 40 shows that the numerical results of the fscm and iorm are approximately 0 4 times the experimental data in particular the prediction results for the tm of the tdgf method are seriously distorted for ω e l g between 3 5 and 9 5 the prediction error of the tdgf method is the largest among the three methods under ballast conditions and the predicted accuracy of the tdgf method is lower than that under full loading because the flare of the ship hull at the static water surface is larger than that under full loading conditions the tdgf method easily diverges for ships with large flares however the prediction error of the vertical and horizontal bending moments under full loading is small while that of the torsional moment is obvious 5 conclusions research on the wave load uncertainty of very large traveling ships is of great importance for the rational design of ships in this paper many numerical calculations and analyses are conducted and relevant model tests are carried out according to different dry structure modeling methods and three numerical prediction methods the numerical method includes three dimensional time domain and three dimensional frequency domain hydroelastic methods the ship types include a very large bulk carrier ore carrier and lng carrier meanwhile the loading conditions include full loading and ballast cases and the load types include the vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and longitudinal torsional moment the error and uncertainty between the numerical predictions and model tests are investigated some important conclusions are as follows 1 the numerical results and experimental data indicate that the dry natural frequencies and wet resonant frequencies of the three node vertical bending mode are different from the actual 3d mode and cannot be accurately simulated even if the variable cross section steel beam of six segments is adopted however if the same simulation approach is adopted such as the beam model the results of the model test and numerical prediction are coincident the reason for the error between the 1d beam model and 3d fem is that the slender beam theory or euler bernoulli beam theory is no longer suitable for 3d hull vibration simulation for the simulation of three node bending vibration or higher order vibrations which overestimates the resonant frequencies thus it is better to adopt timoshenko beam theory for hydroelasticity in the future with sufficient sectional parameters 2 from the viewpoint of ship hulls with multiple segments ten segmented or nine segmented model tests can accurately simulate and obtain two node and three node vertical vibrations but the four node vertical vibration error is large as the segments are not fine enough to simulate four node bending vibration moreover the simulation error of the four node vertical vibration natural frequency is within 20 for a variable cross section beam and the simulation error of the four node vertical vibration natural frequency is approximately 30 for a constant cross section beam 3 for large forward speed ships the fscm method and iorm method have the best numerical prediction for most load cases but the tdgf method has the worst prediction for some load cases especially the ballast load case however the vertical bending moment and horizontal bending moment have smaller numerical prediction errors while the torsional moment has the largest error the numerical results of the torsional moment of the fscm and iorm are approximately 0 4 times that of the experimental data the total cov of the vertical bending moment ranges from 0 13 to 0 36 for the fscm 0 15 to 0 61 for the iorm and 0 27 to 0 73 for the tdgf method 4 for the very large bulk carrier ore carrier and lng carrier because the flare near the still water surface under ballast conditions is larger than that under full loading conditions the calculation results of the tdgf method are unstable and the error is large 5 the viscous damping ratios of the two node vertical bending mode obtained from the hammering experiments of the model tests range from 0 49 to 0 60 under ballast conditions and the values range from 0 67 to 0 95 under full loading credit authorship contribution statement peng yang conceptualization methodology writing review editing wei zhang formal analysis writing original draft xueliang wang model

21083,cavitation is a major problem in the hydraulic reaction turbine because it damages turbine components affects turbine performance and increases maintenance hence there is a need for further research and development on the minimization of cavitation in turbines based on previous research work cavitation occurs due to the fall in pressure below vapour pressure of water which may be due to inappropriate design frequent change in operating conditions or improper setting of the turbine runner to the tailrace level the cavitation prediction in the turbine is a challenging task and its prediction is useful in adopting appropriate techniques for its mitigation the theoretical and computational techniques are commonly used to predict cavitation at the design stage but the experimental techniques can be used during design as well as operating conditions this paper presents a review of cavitation prediction techniques and performance reduction of hydraulic turbines cavitation is inevitable in turbines but it can be mitigated by some techniques which avoid drastic pressure reduction in turbine components having presumable cavitation in addition the material damage due to cavitation can be minimized by using cavitation resistant materials and polishing surfaces the cavitation prevention or mitigation techniques have also been discussed keywords hydraulic turbines

operating characteristics of the plant jarry bolduc and côté 2014 mathur and wagner 2011 according to the hydrological situation of the site either impulse turbines like pelton or reaction turbines like francis propeller and kaplan turbine are used kumar and saini 2010 goyal and gandhi 2018 the steady state operation includes part load best efficiency point bep full load and overload whereas transient operation includes start stop load variations total load rejection and shut down trivedi et al 2013 all types of hydraulic turbines are designed for the rated design parameters like head speed and flow rate celebioglu et al 2017 gupta et al 2016 the operation of any turbine at the off design regime leads to cyclic loading between stationary and moving parts leading to the instability and cavitation phenomenon which decreases the overall efficiency of hydraulic turbines and damage the components the repairing of damage components increases the plant downtime leads to revenue loss goyal and gandhi 2018 miclosina et al 2012 cavitation is the phenomenon of dynamic phase change huang et al 2014 it occurs due to the formation of vapour cavities when the local static pressure falls below the vapour pressure of the liquid and their collapse in the liquid flow huang et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 cavitation is very significant in many fields associated with the transportation of liquid luo et al 2016 and mostly occurs in hydraulic turbines pumps marine propellers fuel injectors inducers and other fluid devices likely to be subjected to low pressure due to many factors like design fault and improper installation zhang et al 2018 cavitation increases the vibration and dynamic instability of the rotating and non rotating parts of the hydraulic turbines and hence affects the turbine performance kanta et al 2017 luo et al 2013 candelet al 2014 cavitation also damages and reduces the life of the turbine components due to pressure fluctuations and pitting of metallic surfaces luo et al 2013 escaler et al 2006 the occurrence of cavitation on different components also depends on the operating condition of the turbines escaler et al 2006 françois 2012 the occurrence of cavitation in the hydraulic turbines has created challenges for both manufacturers and operators candelet al 2014 the continuous effort has been made to enhance the efficiency cavitation performance and stability of hydraulic turbines at part load full load overload load and also at start stop runaway conditions goyal and gandhi 2018 trivedi et al 2013 chernyet al 2010 for cavitation free operations it is also necessary to identify the optimum working conditions of the hydraulic turbine it is seen that the adverse effects of cavitation are decreasing as the number of operating turbines increases it can understand that running a limited number of turbines at low hydraulic losses experiences the most hazardous working conditions kahraman et al 2019 the cavitation can occur at different locations in the hydraulic turbines such as leading edge trailing edge tip clearance draft tube swirl hub or crown and inner blade surfaces demirel et al 2015 avellan 2004 the locations of cavitation occurrence depend on operating conditions as shown in the speed factor versus the discharge factor graph in fig 1 demirel et al 2015 leading edge cavitation mostly occurs due to flow separation at the leading edge because of the variation in the improper flow angle of the incoming fluid trailing edge cavitation occurs during overload operations and it becomes severe when the cavitation moves towards the upstream of the runner blade escaler et al 2006 demirel et al 2015 avellan 2004 travelling bubble cavitation is usually seen during part load conditions tip clearance cavitation occurs due to very high velocity and low pressure in the clearance between the blade tip and shroud motycak et al 2012 this causes severe erosion near the blade tip acoustic noise vibration and performance drop avellan 2004 guo et al 2018 runner core cavitation takes place in the draft tube just after the runner it does not have any erosion effect on the runner blades but noise and vibration occur due to fluctuations in pressure inner blade surface cavitation mostly occurs at the blade surface due to the formation of secondary vortices between the consequent blades space at part load and overload conditions if these vortices strike on the blade surfaces then the vortices become unstable and erode the blade surfaces celebioglu et al 2017 demirel et al 2015 the perfect design of moving parts khurananavtej and singh 2012 and the use of cavitation erosive resistance materials will overcome the cavitation problem tôn thât 2010 a comprehensive literature review has been done for the prediction of cavitation using theoretical computational techniques and experimental techniques further a detailed review of various cavitation prevention or mitigation techniques such as air injection design improvement of turbine space and blade profile installation of the turbine at the proper height above the tailrace level and use of cavitation resistant material in the hydraulic turbine is also briefly summarized 1 1 cavitation parameters for the turbine in the hydraulic turbine cavitation will occur when the pressure falls below the vapour pressure either due to increased velocity in turbine space or due to increased suction height the schematic representation of the hydraulic turbine setting level is shown in fig 2 the setting of the reaction turbine above the tailrace leads to a vacuum formation at the runner location the pressure at the runner can be obtained by applying bernoulli s equation between the reference level of the turbine r and section 2 som et al 2014 as shown in fig 2 1 p r ρ v r 2 2 g h s h p 2 ρ v 2 2 2 0 g h l neglecting the velocity at the draft tube outlet and loss in the draft tube as being very small v2 0 hl 0 leads 2 p r ρ v r 2 2 g h s p a t m ρ for no cavitation pr pv and hence the net positive suction specific energy npse at the reference level som et al 2014 is defined as 3 n p s e p r ρ v r 2 2 p v ρ using eq 2 npse can be obtained as som et al 2014 4 n p s e p a t m ρ p v ρ g h s g h a t m h v h s a dimensionless number proposed by prof d thoma to determine the cavitation occurrence zone in the hydraulic turbines is termed as thoma s cavitation factor σ sigma and is expressed as lal 2011 5 σ n p s e g h h a t m h v h s h for a particular installation condition of the hydraulic turbine the thoma s cavitation factor σ calculated by eq 5 is known as plant or installation cavitation factor σinst and can be controlled by the static suction height the cavitation factor during the operating conditions of the turbine can be obtained as som et al 2014 6 σ o p a t m ρ p r ρ g h s g h h a t m h r h s h as seen from eq 6 the cavitation factor σo at the site depends on the operating conditions of the turbine as the pressure head at the reference section will vary with operating conditions both σo and σinst should always be greater than the critical value σc of the turbine for cavitation free running of the turbine the critical cavitation factor σc of the turbine depends on the specific speed of the turbine and can be determined either by the empirical equations or by the experimental model testing of the turbine the following empirical equations are suggested by prof f h roger to obtain the value of σc for the reaction turbines at the rated operation of the turbine lal 2011 1 2 for francis turbine 7 σ c 0 0317 n s 100 2 1 3 for propeller turbine 8 σ c 0 3 0 0024 n s 100 2 73 the critical cavitation factor σc determined by experimental model testing of the turbine is illustrated in fig 3 the point at which a sudden drop in efficiency starts is called the critical cavitation factor σc to run the hydraulic turbines cavitation free the value of σo should always be higher than σc kumar and saini 2010 celebioglu et al 2017 2 prediction of cavitation cavitation is a physical phenomenon of air bubbles formation and their collapse within the turbine flow space its prediction needs to determine pressure and velocity distributions especially in zones that are likely to be subjected to cavitation the runner and draft tube are most susceptible to cavitation the thoma s cavitation factor σ is the prime parameter for quantifying cavitation in hydraulic turbines this depends on the design installation and actual operating conditions of the hydraulic turbines extensive work has been done for the assessment of pressure velocity and the value of σ by theoretical computational techniques as well as experimental techniques celebioglu et al 2017 demirel et al 2015 motycak et al 2012 some researchers have considered the change in vibration change in signal and drop in turbine performance as the indicators for cavitation prediction 2 1 theoretical and computational techniques many researchers have developed the theoretical approaches for the prediction of cavitation based on variation in properties of fluid bubble dynamics pressure and velocity distributions earlier theoretical calculations using 1d and 2d flow equations and cascade theory were used to calculate pressure velocity distribution on turbine blades and then the cavitation parameter was evaluated at the design stage the mathematical equations for flow simulations are developed theoretically based on physical laws the fluid flows are almost turbulent in the hydraulic turbine it is not possible to analyze the development and interaction of boundary layers and boundary layer separation theoretically to predict the behaviour of fluids in the turbulent flow computational fluid dynamics cfd provides a better visual observation of flows and valuable data liu et al 2015 zhang and zhang 2012 later the cfd has become a cost effective tool for getting detailed pressure and velocity distribution in turbine space brijkishore and prasad 2020 in the initial stage cfd was used for a single phase model to identify the zone where the pressure drops below the vapour pressure of water in the flow field its main drawback was that the impact of the cavitation bubble in the flow field was neglected and did not give more information such as the cavitation effect on the hydraulic efficiency and accurate cavitation bubble prediction liu et al 2015 cavitation is a multiphase three dimensional unsteady and discontinuous phenomenon which leads to flow instability and damages components of the turbine zhang and zhang 2012 hence it requires particular mathematical models along with governing equations to capture the phenomenon efficiently there are two fundamental models such as the two fluid model and the mixture model to analyze cavitation flow the cavitation simulation can be accomplished by taking liquid vapour mixture flow as a single fluid multiphase flow and considering the mass transfer between these phases for the cavitation model tiwari et al 2020a later the rayleigh plesset two phase flow model became an efficient cavitation model for the development and collapse of the vapour bubble the bubble is a sphere of gas in liquids that may vary in size when external forces are applied the continuous flow of liquid around the bubble may produce shear stress on the bubble surfaces man et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 the bubble dynamics are time dependent due to the movement of the bubble because of the pressure variation for travelling bubble the well known generalized rayleigh plesset equation is found to be an adequate approximation of the bubble growth to solve for the radius of the bubble and the bubble pressure in the infinite flow domain escaler et al 2006 the rayleigh plesset bubble growth equation chang et al 2017 is given as 9 p b t p t ρ l r d 2 r d t 2 3 2 d r d t 2 4 μ l ρ l d r d t 2 σ s ρ l r the solution of reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for 3d flow in combination with the rayleigh plesset two phase model made it possible to predict and identify the occurrence of the cavitation area and variation in hydraulic efficiency liu et al 2015 later on it converted into a mixture model due to the advancement in mass and momentum transfer expression and it becomes a very reliable model for the study of cavitation in cfd analysis the parameters such as grid quality boundary and initial conditions suitable turbulence model patel et al 2010 prasad and khare 2012 multiphase model the numerical scheme are important parameters for prediction of performance and cavitation characteristics of the hydraulic turbines tiwari et al 2020b ayli et al 2016 the accuracy of cfd simulation mostly depends on boundary conditions which are generally specified on the flow domain at different boundaries in most of the literature surveys the mass flow rate different for different guide vane opening and loads as the inlet boundary and static pressure as the outlet boundary conditions were specified as boundary conditions zhang and zhang 2012 patel et al 2010 tiwari et al 2020b kumar and bhingole 2015 nennemann and vu 2007 it is understood from the literature survey that this type of boundary condition does not give accurate results in the case of cavitation analysis in turbines instead of this the specification of hydraulic energy as an inlet boundary condition is found to give better results in this type of boundary condition the total pressure is given as inlet boundary condition and static pressure as outlet boundary condition rajavamsi et al 2019 tiwari et al 2020a therefore suitability and appropriateness of boundary conditions as per the flow physics are must in order to get the realistic analysis of actual flow through water turbines the flow chart for the iterative design process and prediction of cavitation using ansys cfx are shown in fig 4 steady state cavitation analysis was carried out with the solution of the equivalent without cavitation simulations as an initial boundary condition celebioglu et al 2018 cavitation simulations are applied with a homogeneous multiphase model which permits the representation of the mixture as a pseudo fluid the rayleigh plesset model is used for the prediction of cavitation the governing equations consist of continuity momentum equations and the transport equation is solved for water vapour volume fraction celebioglu et al 2018 tiwari et al 2020b in ansys cfx the incompressible pressure based reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations solved by finite volume method is used many researchers have carried out flow simulation in the different turbine spaces using cfd by taking different turbulence models because it affects predicted hydraulic performance accuracy it is also grasped by the literature that various turbulence models have been adopted for the computational flow domain to analyze the influence of rotor stator interaction rsi k ω standard k ε shear stress transport sst and realizable k ε models are a better option than other turbulence models it is seen that the best suited turbulence model for solving the rans equations is sst because it precisely resolves flow separations very close to the walls brijkishore and prasad 2020 celebioglu et al 2018 ayli et al 2016 prasad 2012 khare et al 2012 additionally the advection schemes were used as high resolution and the turbulence numeric was resolved with first order finite differencing celebioglu et al 2018 tiwari et al 2020b it is also extremely important to correctly set the unsteady phenomenon like rotor stator interaction rsi fluid structure interaction and precessing vortex rope pvr during designing of iterative components such as guide vanes runner and draft tube the pressure and velocity contour as well as water vapour volume fraction at different locations on the runner blade surface are used to predict cavitation tiwari et al 2020b gohil and saini 2016 tiwari et al 2020c the cfd simulation of the turbine at off design operating regimes helps to analyze turbine performance at different loading conditions such as partial load bep full load and overload conditions goyal and gandhi 2018 tiwari et al 2020b su et al 2012 the development of water vapour volume fraction and different stages of cavitation have been shown in fig 5 for different loading conditions which shows the various stages of cavitating flow through the runner such as initial stage appreciable stage and developed stage of cavitation it is found that at partial loading the turbine is more susceptible to cavitation at the runner core because of high swirl velocity at the outlet of the runner while overload loading causes massive cavitation damage in the flow passage of the turbine due to predominantly available dynamic vacuum tiwari et al 2020b it is seen that the turbine efficiency drop and water vapour volume fraction on the suction side of the runner blades is maximum at overloading operating conditions in contrast the pressure pulsation is maximum in the draft tube at partial loading conditions gohil and saini 2016 cavitation is predicted in the kaplan turbine at different locations such as the gap between tip and shroud tip clearance the suction side of the runner blade and blade tip as illustrated in figs 6 and 7 the low pressure at point a on the suction side and point b on the tip is seen due to high flow velocity nennemann and vu 2007 another type of cavitation related to tip clearance is called tip vortex cavitation the tip vortex begins near the leading edge of the blade detaches on the blade suction side surface and flows downstream along the runner blade it can be diminished by the effective design of the anti cavitation lip the knowledge of the vortex shape and intensity of the tip vortex helps to design the anti cavitation lips more precisely motycak et al 2012 the flow pattern inside the pelton turbine is very intricate because of the free surface and multiphase mixture of water and air that s why it is challenging to assess the effect of jet quality on efficiency and cavitation characteristics hence cfd analysis of multiphase transient flow is very useful in understanding the flow behaviour and performance prediction it is very difficult to observe flow patterns and performance prediction in actual model testing at part load as well as overload operating conditions in pelton turbines patel et al 2010 peron et al 2008 the cfd analysis made it possible to visualize the mechanism of the hydrodynamics phenomenon occurring during the operation of the turbine for efficient design it is realized in cfd analysis that the correct set of boundary conditions initial conditions as well as the most suitable turbulence model played a vital role in obtaining the precise cavitation prediction from the numerical simulation in hydraulic turbines still it is challenging to accurately predict the cavitation through cfd analysis due to the very high approximation involved in initial guess and boundary conditions its accuracy also depends on various factors such as flow conditions properties of fluid and flow passage 2 2 experimental techniques the cavitation prediction through the experimental techniques is carried out by testing physical models in well established laboratories or prototypes on site the experimental model testing can be used to mitigate or eliminate problems related to cavitation vibration pressure pulsation and hydraulic thrust the model testing standard for hydraulic turbines is international standard iec 60193 usually iec 60193 refers to any kind of reaction or impulse turbine which has been tested under specified laboratory conditions therefore it is also used for prototype turbine acceptance tests liu et al 2015 the prediction of cavitation is based on an understanding of cavity dynamics and its position inside the hydraulic turbine this knowledge was obtained from the flow visualization and measurements in laboratory instruments such as a high speed cavitation tunnel and model testing escaler et al 2006 in the experimental technique the variables such as the level in the upper reservoir inlet and outlet pressure flow rates dynamic pressure structural vibration torque power etc are measured using sensors fitted at different locations for the prediction of cavitation the current or voltage signals are converted into signal processor variables to get the measured data escaler et al 2006 su et al 2014 escaler et al 2003 the flow visualization was done by stroboscopic light video filming and a high speed camera grekula and göran 2001 it is a difficult task as the cavitation inception affects the measurements and ability to predict the occurrence of cavitation escaler et al 2006 on the site a series of measurements were carried out using dynamic pressure sensors which were placed along with the distributor runner blades and draft tube strain gauges fitted to the turbine shaft were used to obtain the deformations for determining the torque and radial forces beatove et al 2010 the turbine design also affects the transfer of vibrations from the source of vibrations to the sensor escaler et al 2006 some important key points to be considered for the detection of cavitation by vibrations are appropriate sensors should always be applied to minimize the noise from the other mechanical or hydrodynamic phenomena the standard sensors locations are the pedestal bearing of guide vanes the guide vane arm top cover and the wall of the draft tube measurements should be done for the complete operating range of the hydraulic turbines during the model testing of the hydraulic turbines the variation in global parameters such as flow rate speed and power can be observed easily but the local parameters like velocity and actual flow angle were difficult to measure due to the rotation of the runner blade prasad et al 2009 the cavitation in the hydraulic machine is measured through hydrodynamic pressures structural vibrations and acoustic emissions measurements escaler et al 2006 the direct and indirect cavitation detection techniques were used in the hydraulic machinery to predict the cavitation it is a very efficient and robust method for cavitation detection in flowing fluid candelet al 2014 koivula et al 2000 the direct cavitation detection is possible by observing the developed cavities visually in the flow passage but the complicated constructions and very high speed cavitation phenomenon make it challenging to predict the cavitation by direct detection techniques due to the restrictions of direct detection techniques various indirect techniques can be used the indirect methods are used to detect cavitation by acoustic instruments accelerometers and pressure sensors to overcome the difficulties of direct detection techniques koivula et al 2000 the appropriate indirect methods of vibration measurement such as the vibratory approach were beneficial for calculating the risk of cavitation erosion during the model test avellan 2004 farhat and avellan 2001 escaler et al 2003 the cavitation phenomenon was observed through the vibration using onboard measurement it is seen that onboard measurements are more reliable than measurements on fixed parts escaler et al 2003 the spectral and statistical techniques are used for the detection of vortex cavitation using acoustic signals in spectral technique the received signal bandwidth reduces as the cavitation vortex rises in strength and size statistical analysis is very significant to detect phenomena of cavitation inside the hydraulic machinery these methods are constructive in minimizing the auxiliary system and the number of transducers candelet al 2014 in the experimental investigation of the hydraulic turbines the various transducers are fitted on different locations to monitor the development of cavitation and observed on the basis of pressure pulsation hydraulic characteristics pit counting and vibrations dupont et al 1996 the pressure fluctuation vibration and sound level were measured using the pressure transducers accelerometer and acoustic emission sensors demirel et al 2015 intrusive and non intrusive methods measured the downstream flow condition of the runner intrusive methods such as wall pressure measurements were used to measure the dynamic loading and pressure fluctuation frequency on the draft tube wall qian et al 2009 kc et al 2014 the non intrusive methods such as particle image velocimetry piv and laser doppler velocimetry ldv were used to identify the flow pattern inside the draft tube and formation of vortex rope at off design conditions goyal and gandhi 2018 su et al 2014 iliescu and ciocan 2008 the swirling flow inside the runner is complex and extremely turbulent that determined by the radial velocity components the radial velocity on downstream is also measured by the particle image velocimetry piv and laser doppler velocimetry ldv measurement methods tridon et al 2010 an on line cavitation monitoring system is also used to predict the cavitation with the help of the turbine monitoring and analysis unit trbmau it monitored both ultrasound 50 khz 300 khz and audible sound 20hz 20 khz continuously produced by the cavitation and evaluate the signal characteristics such as noise level frequency compositions and standard deviation as per the frequency characteristics of sound the cavitation sound is differentiated from the others such as flowing water sound and mechanical sound the calculated results were saved in the database and traced the intensity of cavitation for different operating conditions based on monitoring and evaluation results the engineers and operators plan for the maintenance of hydraulic turbines shi et al 2007 with the help of experimental measurements and numerical methods it becomes possible to predict the types of cavitation shape and intensity which are more dangerous and the locations where the low pressure zone bubble growth and collapse occur in the flow field ayli 2019 the cavitation prediction using experimental techniques is summarized in table 1 which is based on the consequences 3 techniques to prevent or mitigate cavitation the turbine can be designed for cavitation free operation at design operating conditions but the turbine mostly operates at the off design operating conditions on the site this affects the pressure and velocity distribution which may lead to the cavitation problem hence cavitation in the turbine can not be fully prevented but can be mitigated by some remedial measures developed by the different researchers to minimize its effect on the performance of hydraulic turbines and maintenance the essential requirement in most of the techniques for cavitation mitigation is to control the pressure drop in turbine space celebioglu et al 2017 avellan 2004 ayli et al 2016 rivetti et al 2015 the failure of turbine components due to cavitation erosion and surface fatigue can be minimized by identifying the cause of erosion erosion mechanism and methods of prevention senapati et al 2017 3 1 air injection method the air injection method is an important measure to reduce the possibility of cavitation during the operation of the turbine the operation of the turbine at part load full load and overload increases the dynamic instability due to cavitating fluid flow which leads to pressure pulsation and power oscillations adding ambient air into the flow is one of the practical ways to mitigate these pulsations in many situations the amplitude of such pulsations can be significantly reduced by the air admission injection below the runner during the operation of the turbine rivetti et al 2015 v chirkov et al 2017 in this method pressurized air is injected on the horizontal plane of the runner centerline at the discharge ring for every injection point the airflow through all the tubes is injected at constant pressure and constant discharge rivetti et al 2014 minakov et al 2017 it has been previously shown that air injection through the center of the runner cone substantially decreases the amplitude of pressure pulses both at part load and full load operating points chirkov et al 2019 in the various regions of the hydraulic turbines the rate of pressure pulsations was decreased almost twice by the delivery of air into the turbine s flow path minakov et al 2017 in the kaplan turbine model the air injection technique was used for minimizing cavitation as well as reducing the level of vibration as shown in fig 8 the holes of the same diameter are evenly made in the manifold of stainless steel the pressurized air was injected just above the runner blade centerline to minimize the tip vortex cavitation damage and discharge ring cavitation the numerous monitoring instruments such as accelerometer high speed flow visualization lighting setup and data acquisition etc are used to record the data and visualize pictures two different types of airflow meters are connected in parallel to measure the airflow rate the airflow rate is controlled with the help of a needle valve it is noted that the level of vibration was reduced by 50 at the efficiency drop of less than 1 for an airflow rate of 0 4 0 5 further increase in airflow rate beyond 0 8 there was no reduction in vibration level but causing a decrease in efficiency as seen in figs 9 and 10 rivetti et al 2014 the tip leakage vortex cavitation in axial flow turbines may induce noise vibration and erosion the air injection has become a beneficial effect on the reduction of cavitation damage and tip leakage cavitation a methodology has been developed to identify the interaction between tip leakage cavitation and guide vanes the air injection mitigates the erosive potential of tip leakage cavitation and reduces the vibration level of the turbine components at the expense of marginally decreasing the efficiency of the turbine rivetti et al 2015 3 2 design improvement of turbine space and blade profile the runner is most susceptible to cavitation and efficiency characteristics of the hydraulic turbine and the primary attention should be focused on the profile of the runner blade surfaces kawajiri et al 2014 soesanto et al 2017 the assessment of cavitation can be done by the examination of pressure and velocity distribution on the surface of the runner blade semenova et al 2014 the pressure and velocity distribution on the runner will depend on the curvature and thickness of the hydrofoils and their distribution angle of incidence ratio of the hub to tip diameter chord to pitch ratio solidity of the blade etc khare et al 2012 consul et al 2016 the most effective remedies to reduce cavitation in the hydraulic turbine are the enhancement of the turbine space and design improvement in the runner blade profile which will avoid very low pressure in fluid flow especially during off design operating conditions semenova et al 2014 gustavo et al 2010 lipej 2004 the important parameters which need to be improved in the design process are smoothening of blade slopes at inlet and outlet flow angle distribution and profile of the runner blade the length of the blade profile near the hub surface is increased by the use of the flow angle distribution to enhance cavitation properties celebioglu et al 2018 ayli et al 2016 the guide vane angle is also a crucial parameter for regulating and controlling the distribution of uniform flow from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the runner blade celebioglu et al 2018 qian et al 2009 for smooth distribution of velocity and cavitation free observation of the francis turbine the guide vane angle was held at around 160 the low pressure zone near the runner shroud can be minimized by providing a leaning to the shroud in the rotational direction celebioglu et al 2018 x blade design is strengthened to eradicate cavitation at the leading edge and to improve the turbine runner performance during the development stage of the three gorges project in china leaning is provided at the leading edge of the runner between 10 to 50 to ensure a balanced pressure distribution for x blade design demirel et al 2015 celebioglu et al 2018 ayli et al 2016 in x blade configurations a balanced pressure design must be accomplished otherwise at part load conditions the dynamic loads become more abundant which increases blade cracking risk the manufacturing of x blades is more costly and complicated and it is also a very challenging task to design a pressure balanced blade celebioglu et al 2018 brekke 2013 celebioglu et al 2017 modified the runner geometry of existing turbines using ansys bladegen software with the aim of cavitation free runner operation the numerical simulations were performed for 33 operating points and noted that shaft power is increased from 8 73 mw to 8 85 mw in addition to this runner efficiency is improved from 95 to 97 they identified the areas where the greatest amount of bubbles are highly generated and also observed various types of cavitation during off design operating conditions such as leading edge cavitation on the pressure side and suction side of the blade travelling bubble cavitation and inter blade non cavitating vortices the cavitation limit of the newly designed runner is determined by using the cavitating and non cavitating operating points it is seen that the cavitation free operating range is increased as compared to the existing runner 3 3 installation of the turbine at the proper height above the tailrace level the proper setting of the hydraulic turbine above the tailrace reduces the risk of cavitation and overcome the variation of performance characteristics of the turbine it is one of the most crucial parameters that should be considered at the time of turbine installation the absolute pressure at the outlet of the runner decreases with an increase in suction height this becomes more critical at part load operation due to the fall in the water level of the tailrace avellan 2004 from eq 5 it is clear that σ will increase with decreases in the suction head hs so that the turbine can run in the safe operating zone in the high specific speed turbines such as the propeller turbine and kaplan turbine runner exit velocity is very high which reduces the pressure at the exit of the runner thus increases the risk of cavitation hence suction height plays a very significant role in controlling cavitation risk celebioglu et al 2017 avellan 2004 the primary purpose is to find out the appropriate setting level of the hydraulic turbines to control the variation in efficiency and diminish the probability of cavitation erosion 4 cavitation prevention by the use of erosive resistant techniques as cavitation is inevitable and its occurrence will damage the material of turbine components which are susceptible to cavitation due to fatigue and erosion the erosion of component material will not only affect the performance but also helps to promote cavitation hence the material used for turbine components must be strong enough to resist erosion various techniques such as cathodic protection surface coating and cavitation resistance material are used for this purpose 4 1 cathodic protection cathodic protection is used to control the corrosion resistance of the metal surface by supplying the dc power to the runner blades from external sources wyatt 2010 ashworth 2010 the supply of electrical current and voltage should be at a particular magnitude and depends on the size of the runner and coating quality plesset 1962 due to electrical supply hydrogen gas is liberated from flowing fluid by the process of oxidation and reduction redox reaction it provides a cushioning effect on the blade surfaces wyatt 2010 plesset 1962 4 2 surface coating the erosion of components due to cavitation leads to damaged turbine components and also enhances cavitation this becomes challenging for hydro turbine components most of the researchers are working on selecting the appropriate turbine materials and their coatings to minimizes the damage a standard method of diminishing the impact of cavitation erosion is the application of hard coating on the surface the most crucial coating characteristics are cavitation resistance corrosion resistance abrasion resistance vibration damping strong bonding to the substrate and easy applicability at the site etc richman and mcnaughton 1990 singh et al 2012 the coatings like hard facing alloys ceramic pastes and ceramic paints are the common and standard surface coating materials used for the turbine components it has been found that the composites based on tungsten carbide such as 86 wc 10 co 4 cr improve the coating quality and surface finish dorji and ghomashchi 2014 table 2 shows the various types of coating material and processes used to minimize cavitation erosion on the hydraulic turbine components several investigators have used experimental and analytical approaches to study the hard surface coating materials and their erosive behaviour in different hydro turbine components some of the researchers have also revealed through the experimental study on coating for the improvement in the life of components the cost effective analysis of the materials should also be studied 4 3 cavitation erosive resistant material the erosion in the turbine component is a composite phenomenon due to the presence of cavitation and silt the erosion rate depends on the intensity of cavitation resistance of the material and silt properties singh et al 2012 the selection of the appropriate turbine material and manufacturing process will help in the prevention of cavitation damage cast iron is less resistive against cavitation because it contains more carbon contents tôn thât 2010 grewal et al 2013a liu et al 2016 cast steel is considered to be a better option than cast iron because of its unique quality of weldability the affected part due to cavitation can be easily repaired through the welding process the welded surface may resist the cavitation more than ordinary surfaces several authors have selected the austenitic stainless steel due to its excellent weldability and good cavitation erosion resistance at an economical cost bregliozzi et al 2005 ahmed et al 1994 stainless steel with 13 chromium is most commonly used as cavitation resistant material and possesses excellent mechanical properties like high elongation tensile strength impact resistance yield point etc martensitic stainless steel mss with combinations 16cr 5ni 13cr 4ni 13cr 0 5ni and manganese steels etc are mostly used to diminish the cavitation erosion and cavitation damage singh et al 2012 dorji and ghomashchi 2014 the runner blades are made of 13cr 4ni 13cr 1ni 18cr 8ni and 16cr 5ni stainless steel labyrinth stationary seal and guide vanes are made of nickel aluminum bronze alloy and 16cr 5ni 13cr 4ni the mss steel has more cavitation erosion resistance cer than the austenitic steel whereas the ferritic stainless steel possesses the lowest cer singh et al 2012 heathcock et al 1982 friction stir processing fsp is a very effective tool for improving the mechanical characteristics of the material the significant purpose of fsp is to enhance the cavitation erosive resistance and microhardness of materials 13cr4ni steel is the most commonly used for hydro turbine material fsp also improved the surface properties and refined the microstructure without any pre treatment of 13cr4ni steel astm 743 the improvement in the microhardness of steel is 2 6 times after processing and cer is also improved by 2 4 times compared to unprocessed steel grewal et al 2013b the prediction of cer has a vital role in order to evaluate the exact life of hydro turbine components the maximum depth of erosion the mean depth of erosion rate mder and the mean depth of erosion are determined the cer is defined as the inverse of the maximum value of mder the comparison of cer for the different forms of steel used in hydro turbine components is revealed in fig 11 he has tested six different materials such as tempered and quenched high strength steel s550ql and s690ql martensitic stainless steel s41500 welded high strength steel ds 110 and ds t 115 and welded austenitic stainless steel ec308lsi which are commonly used for the hydraulic turbines runner as a result he found that the s41500 material has excellent cavitation erosion resistance properties tôn thât 2010 5 conclusions it is seen from an extensive literature review that extensive work has been done on the prediction and mitigation of cavitation in hydraulic turbines cfd made it possible to carry out the flow simulation in the hydraulic turbine to identify the areas susceptible to cavitation by detailed information of pressure and velocity distribution most of the work on cavitation detection is done for the rated operating condition of the turbine but the turbines run mostly at the off design conditions on the site due to variation in head and discharge which is beyond control hence it is required to carry out research for the improvement of turbine components to minimize the cavitation at the off design operation of the turbine the improvement in design for minimizing cavitation at the off design conditions may lead to some drop in efficiency of the turbine for rated condition but shall reduce the breakdown and maintenance so detailed cost benefit studies are also required the prediction of cavitation by the theoretical and computational techniques is based on the solution of mathematical flow equations and may be subjected to errors due to many factors the different types of turbulence models such as k ε k epsilon k ω k omega shear stress transport sst rng k ε and zles zonal large eddy simulation were used for flow simulation and validated with the experiments the prediction of the flow field was good at bep but during the off design operation the flow field prediction was not predicted well due to the limitations of the appropriate turbulence model used most of the computational studies are lacking in the prediction of accurate flow and validation at the off design operating conditions the experimental technique is more reliable but it is costly and has the limitations of measuring equipment and their placement within the turbine space modern flow measurement systems like piv and ldv can be used to analyze the flow field very precisely so the best results for the cavitation prediction can be obtained by the combined approach of theoretical and experimental techniques the use of x shaped blade runners in place of traditional runner geometries helps to improve the turbine cavitation characteristics and also contributes to increasing the efficiency and power output the study of fluid structure interactions in the turbine can help to improve the components fatigue life the installation of the turbine at the proper suction height from the tailrace is the best method for the mitigation of cavitation however the suction height is subjected to variation due to varying operating conditions of the turbine its variation is more severe in the case of a multi unit power plant while running limited units hence it should be combined with other methods like air injection provisions of gates in tailrace to maintain its level and use of erosion resistant materials to minimize the cavitation at varying operating conditions it is concluded that extensive work needs to be done for the fundamental understanding of the cavitation zones under different operating conditions and cavitation mitigation techniques to reduce the operating and maintenance cost of power plants the design improvements using cfd to minimize off design cavitation cavitation prediction by noise hydro acoustics and development of erosive resistant materials such as composites nano composite of ternary and quaternary phases are some more areas of future research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
21083,cavitation is a major problem in the hydraulic reaction turbine because it damages turbine components affects turbine performance and increases maintenance hence there is a need for further research and development on the minimization of cavitation in turbines based on previous research work cavitation occurs due to the fall in pressure below vapour pressure of water which may be due to inappropriate design frequent change in operating conditions or improper setting of the turbine runner to the tailrace level the cavitation prediction in the turbine is a challenging task and its prediction is useful in adopting appropriate techniques for its mitigation the theoretical and computational techniques are commonly used to predict cavitation at the design stage but the experimental techniques can be used during design as well as operating conditions this paper presents a review of cavitation prediction techniques and performance reduction of hydraulic turbines cavitation is inevitable in turbines but it can be mitigated by some techniques which avoid drastic pressure reduction in turbine components having presumable cavitation in addition the material damage due to

operating characteristics of the plant jarry bolduc and côté 2014 mathur and wagner 2011 according to the hydrological situation of the site either impulse turbines like pelton or reaction turbines like francis propeller and kaplan turbine are used kumar and saini 2010 goyal and gandhi 2018 the steady state operation includes part load best efficiency point bep full load and overload whereas transient operation includes start stop load variations total load rejection and shut down trivedi et al 2013 all types of hydraulic turbines are designed for the rated design parameters like head speed and flow rate celebioglu et al 2017 gupta et al 2016 the operation of any turbine at the off design regime leads to cyclic loading between stationary and moving parts leading to the instability and cavitation phenomenon which decreases the overall efficiency of hydraulic turbines and damage the components the repairing of damage components increases the plant downtime leads to revenue loss goyal and gandhi 2018 miclosina et al 2012 cavitation is the phenomenon of dynamic phase change huang et al 2014 it occurs due to the formation of vapour cavities when the local static pressure falls below the vapour pressure of the liquid and their collapse in the liquid flow huang et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 cavitation is very significant in many fields associated with the transportation of liquid luo et al 2016 and mostly occurs in hydraulic turbines pumps marine propellers fuel injectors inducers and other fluid devices likely to be subjected to low pressure due to many factors like design fault and improper installation zhang et al 2018 cavitation increases the vibration and dynamic instability of the rotating and non rotating parts of the hydraulic turbines and hence affects the turbine performance kanta et al 2017 luo et al 2013 candelet al 2014 cavitation also damages and reduces the life of the turbine components due to pressure fluctuations and pitting of metallic surfaces luo et al 2013 escaler et al 2006 the occurrence of cavitation on different components also depends on the operating condition of the turbines escaler et al 2006 françois 2012 the occurrence of cavitation in the hydraulic turbines has created challenges for both manufacturers and operators candelet al 2014 the continuous effort has been made to enhance the efficiency cavitation performance and stability of hydraulic turbines at part load full load overload load and also at start stop runaway conditions goyal and gandhi 2018 trivedi et al 2013 chernyet al 2010 for cavitation free operations it is also necessary to identify the optimum working conditions of the hydraulic turbine it is seen that the adverse effects of cavitation are decreasing as the number of operating turbines increases it can understand that running a limited number of turbines at low hydraulic losses experiences the most hazardous working conditions kahraman et al 2019 the cavitation can occur at different locations in the hydraulic turbines such as leading edge trailing edge tip clearance draft tube swirl hub or crown and inner blade surfaces demirel et al 2015 avellan 2004 the locations of cavitation occurrence depend on operating conditions as shown in the speed factor versus the discharge factor graph in fig 1 demirel et al 2015 leading edge cavitation mostly occurs due to flow separation at the leading edge because of the variation in the improper flow angle of the incoming fluid trailing edge cavitation occurs during overload operations and it becomes severe when the cavitation moves towards the upstream of the runner blade escaler et al 2006 demirel et al 2015 avellan 2004 travelling bubble cavitation is usually seen during part load conditions tip clearance cavitation occurs due to very high velocity and low pressure in the clearance between the blade tip and shroud motycak et al 2012 this causes severe erosion near the blade tip acoustic noise vibration and performance drop avellan 2004 guo et al 2018 runner core cavitation takes place in the draft tube just after the runner it does not have any erosion effect on the runner blades but noise and vibration occur due to fluctuations in pressure inner blade surface cavitation mostly occurs at the blade surface due to the formation of secondary vortices between the consequent blades space at part load and overload conditions if these vortices strike on the blade surfaces then the vortices become unstable and erode the blade surfaces celebioglu et al 2017 demirel et al 2015 the perfect design of moving parts khurananavtej and singh 2012 and the use of cavitation erosive resistance materials will overcome the cavitation problem tôn thât 2010 a comprehensive literature review has been done for the prediction of cavitation using theoretical computational techniques and experimental techniques further a detailed review of various cavitation prevention or mitigation techniques such as air injection design improvement of turbine space and blade profile installation of the turbine at the proper height above the tailrace level and use of cavitation resistant material in the hydraulic turbine is also briefly summarized 1 1 cavitation parameters for the turbine in the hydraulic turbine cavitation will occur when the pressure falls below the vapour pressure either due to increased velocity in turbine space or due to increased suction height the schematic representation of the hydraulic turbine setting level is shown in fig 2 the setting of the reaction turbine above the tailrace leads to a vacuum formation at the runner location the pressure at the runner can be obtained by applying bernoulli s equation between the reference level of the turbine r and section 2 som

be obtained as som et al 2014 4 n p s e p a t m ρ p v ρ g h s g h a t m h v h s a dimensionless number proposed by prof d thoma to determine the cavitation occurrence zone in the hydraulic turbines is termed as thoma s cavitation factor σ sigma and is expressed as lal 2011 5 σ n p s e g h h a t m h v h s h for a particular installation condition of the hydraulic turbine the thoma s cavitation factor σ calculated by eq 5 is known as plant or installation cavitation factor σinst and can be controlled by the static suction height the cavitation factor during the operating conditions of the turbine can be obtained as som et al 2014 6 σ o p a t m ρ p r ρ g h s g h h a t m h r h s h as seen from eq 6 the cavitation factor σo at the site depends on the operating conditions of the turbine as the pressure head at the reference section will vary with operating conditions both σo and σinst should always be greater than the critical value σc of the turbine for cavitation free running of the turbine the critical cavitation factor σc of the turbine depends on the specific speed of the turbine and can be determined either by the empirical equations or by the experimental model testing of the turbine the following empirical equations are suggested by prof f h roger to obtain the value of σc for the reaction turbines at the rated operation of the turbine lal 2011 1 2 for francis turbine

point at which a sudden drop in efficiency starts is called the critical cavitation factor σc to run the hydraulic turbines cavitation free the value of σo should always be higher than σc kumar and saini 2010 celebioglu et al 2017 2 prediction of cavitation cavitation is a physical phenomenon of air bubbles formation and their collapse within the turbine flow space its prediction needs to determine pressure and velocity distributions especially in zones that are likely to be subjected to cavitation the runner and draft tube are most susceptible to cavitation the thoma s cavitation factor σ is the prime parameter for quantifying cavitation in hydraulic turbines this depends on the design installation and actual operating conditions of the hydraulic turbines extensive work has been done for the assessment of pressure velocity and the value of σ by theoretical computational techniques as well as experimental techniques celebioglu et al 2017 demirel et al 2015 motycak et al 2012 some researchers have considered the change in vibration change in signal and drop in turbine performance as the indicators for cavitation prediction 2 1 theoretical and computational techniques many researchers have developed the theoretical approaches for the prediction of cavitation based on variation in properties of fluid bubble dynamics pressure and velocity distributions earlier theoretical calculations using 1d and 2d flow equations and cascade theory were used to calculate pressure velocity distribution on turbine blades and then the cavitation parameter was evaluated at the design stage the mathematical equations for flow simulations are developed theoretically based on physical laws the fluid flows are almost turbulent in the hydraulic turbine it is not possible to analyze the development and interaction of boundary layers and boundary layer separation theoretically to predict the behaviour of fluids in the turbulent flow computational fluid dynamics cfd provides a better visual observation of flows and valuable data liu et al 2015 zhang and zhang 2012 later the cfd has become a cost effective tool for getting detailed pressure and velocity distribution in turbine space brijkishore and prasad 2020 in the initial stage cfd was used for a single phase model to identify the zone where the pressure drops below the vapour pressure of water in the flow field its main drawback was that the impact of the cavitation bubble in the flow field was neglected and did not give more information such as the cavitation effect on the hydraulic efficiency and accurate cavitation bubble prediction liu et al 2015 cavitation is a multiphase three dimensional unsteady and discontinuous phenomenon which leads to flow instability and damages components of the turbine zhang and zhang 2012 hence it requires particular mathematical models along with governing equations to capture the phenomenon efficiently there are two fundamental models such as the two fluid model and the mixture model to analyze cavitation flow the cavitation simulation can be accomplished by taking liquid vapour mixture flow as a single fluid multiphase flow and considering the mass transfer between these phases for the cavitation model tiwari et al 2020a later the rayleigh plesset two phase flow model became an efficient cavitation model for the development and collapse of the vapour bubble the bubble is a sphere of gas in liquids that may vary in size when external forces are applied the continuous flow of liquid around the bubble may produce shear stress on the bubble surfaces man et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 the bubble dynamics are time dependent due to the movement of the bubble because of the pressure variation for travelling bubble the well known generalized rayleigh plesset equation is found to be an adequate approximation of the bubble growth to solve for the radius of the bubble and the bubble pressure in the infinite flow domain escaler et al 2006 the rayleigh plesset bubble growth equation chang et al 2017 is given as 9 p b t p t ρ l r d 2 r d t 2 3 2 d r d t 2 4 μ l ρ l d r d t 2 σ s ρ l r the solution of reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for 3d flow in combination with the rayleigh plesset two phase model made it possible to predict and identify the occurrence of the cavitation area and variation in hydraulic efficiency liu et al 2015 later on it converted into a mixture model due to the advancement in mass and momentum transfer expression and it becomes a very reliable model for the study of cavitation in cfd analysis the parameters such as grid quality boundary and initial conditions suitable turbulence model patel et al 2010 prasad and khare 2012 multiphase model the numerical scheme are important parameters for prediction of performance and cavitation characteristics of the hydraulic turbines tiwari et al 2020b ayli et al 2016 the accuracy of cfd simulation mostly depends on boundary conditions which are generally specified on the flow domain at different boundaries in most of the literature surveys the mass flow rate different for different guide vane opening and loads as the inlet boundary and static pressure as the outlet boundary conditions were specified as boundary conditions zhang and zhang 2012 patel et al 2010 tiwari et al 2020b kumar and bhingole 2015 nennemann and vu 2007 it is understood from the literature survey that this type of boundary condition does not give accurate results in the case of cavitation analysis in turbines instead of this the specification of hydraulic energy as an inlet boundary condition is found to give better results in this type of boundary condition the total pressure is given as inlet boundary condition and static pressure as outlet boundary condition rajavamsi et al 2019 tiwari et al 2020a therefore suitability and appropriateness of boundary conditions as per the flow physics are must in order to get the realistic analysis of actual flow through water turbines the flow chart for the iterative design process and prediction of cavitation using ansys cfx are shown in fig 4 steady state cavitation analysis was carried out with the solution of the equivalent without cavitation simulations as an initial boundary condition celebioglu et al 2018 cavitation simulations are applied with a homogeneous multiphase model which permits the representation of the mixture as a pseudo fluid the rayleigh plesset model is used for the prediction of cavitation the governing equations consist of continuity momentum equations and the transport equation is solved for water vapour volume fraction celebioglu et al 2018 tiwari et al 2020b in ansys cfx the incompressible pressure based reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations solved by finite volume method is used many researchers have carried out flow simulation in the different turbine spaces using cfd by taking different turbulence models because it affects predicted hydraulic performance accuracy it is also grasped by the literature that various turbulence models have been adopted for the computational flow domain to analyze the influence of rotor stator interaction rsi k ω standard k ε shear stress transport sst and realizable k ε models are a better option than other turbulence models it is seen that the best suited turbulence model for solving the rans equations is sst because it precisely resolves flow separations very close to the walls brijkishore and prasad 2020 celebioglu et al 2018 ayli et al 2016 prasad 2012 khare et al 2012 additionally the advection schemes were used as high resolution and the turbulence numeric was resolved with first order finite differencing celebioglu et al 2018 tiwari et al 2020b it is also extremely important to correctly set the unsteady phenomenon like rotor stator interaction rsi fluid structure interaction and precessing vortex rope pvr during designing of iterative components such as guide vanes runner and draft tube the pressure and velocity contour as well as water vapour volume fraction at different locations on the runner blade surface are used to predict cavitation tiwari et al 2020b gohil and saini 2016 tiwari et al 2020c the cfd simulation of the turbine at off design operating regimes helps to analyze turbine performance at different loading conditions such as partial load bep full load and overload conditions goyal and gandhi 2018 tiwari et al 2020b su et al 2012 the development of water vapour volume fraction and different stages of cavitation have been shown in fig 5 for different loading conditions which shows the various stages of cavitating flow through the runner such as initial stage appreciable stage and developed stage of cavitation it is found that at partial loading the turbine is more susceptible to cavitation at the runner core because of high swirl velocity at the outlet of the runner while overload loading causes massive cavitation damage in the flow passage of the turbine due to predominantly available dynamic vacuum tiwari et al 2020b it is seen that the turbine efficiency drop and water vapour volume fraction on the suction side of the runner blades is maximum at overloading operating conditions in contrast the pressure pulsation is maximum in the draft tube at partial loading conditions gohil and saini 2016 cavitation is predicted in the kaplan turbine at different locations such as the gap between tip and shroud tip clearance the suction side of the runner blade and blade tip as illustrated in figs 6 and 7 the low pressure at point a on the suction side and point b on the tip is seen due to high flow velocity nennemann and vu 2007 another type of cavitation related to tip clearance is called tip vortex cavitation the tip vortex begins near the leading edge of the blade detaches on the blade suction side surface and flows downstream along the runner blade it can be diminished by the effective design of the anti cavitation lip the knowledge of the vortex shape and intensity of the tip vortex helps to design the anti cavitation lips more precisely motycak et al 2012 the flow pattern inside the pelton turbine is very intricate because of the free surface and multiphase mixture of water and air that s why it is challenging to assess the effect of jet quality on efficiency and cavitation characteristics hence cfd analysis of multiphase transient flow is very useful in understanding the flow behaviour and performance prediction it is very difficult to observe flow patterns and performance prediction in actual model testing at part load as well as overload operating conditions in pelton turbines patel et al 2010 peron et al 2008 the cfd analysis made it possible to visualize the mechanism of the hydrodynamics phenomenon occurring during the operation of the turbine for efficient design it is realized in cfd analysis that the correct set of boundary conditions initial conditions as well as the most suitable turbulence model played a vital role in obtaining the precise cavitation prediction from the numerical simulation in hydraulic turbines still it is challenging to accurately predict the cavitation through cfd analysis due to the very high approximation involved in initial guess and boundary conditions its accuracy also depends on various factors such as flow conditions properties of fluid and flow passage 2 2 experimental techniques the cavitation prediction through the experimental techniques is carried out by testing physical models in well established laboratories or prototypes on site the experimental model testing can be used to mitigate or eliminate problems related to cavitation vibration pressure pulsation and hydraulic thrust the model testing standard for hydraulic turbines is international standard iec 60193 usually iec 60193 refers to any kind of reaction or impulse turbine which has been tested under specified laboratory conditions therefore it is also used for prototype turbine acceptance tests liu et al 2015 the prediction of cavitation is based on an understanding of cavity dynamics and its position inside the hydraulic turbine this knowledge was obtained from the flow visualization and measurements in laboratory instruments such as a high speed cavitation tunnel and model testing escaler et al 2006 in the experimental technique the variables such as the level in the upper reservoir inlet and outlet pressure flow rates dynamic pressure structural vibration torque power etc are measured using sensors fitted at different locations for the prediction of cavitation the current or voltage signals are converted into signal processor variables to get the measured data escaler et al 2006 su et al 2014 escaler et al 2003 the flow visualization was done by stroboscopic light video filming and a high speed camera grekula and göran 2001 it is a difficult task as the cavitation inception affects the measurements and ability to predict the occurrence of cavitation escaler et al 2006 on the site a series of measurements were carried out using dynamic pressure sensors which were placed along with the distributor runner blades and draft tube strain gauges fitted to the turbine shaft were used to obtain the deformations for determining the torque and radial forces beatove et al 2010 the turbine design also affects the transfer of vibrations from the source of vibrations to the sensor escaler et al 2006 some important key points to be considered for the detection of cavitation by vibrations are appropriate sensors should always be applied to minimize the noise from the other mechanical or hydrodynamic phenomena the standard sensors locations are the pedestal bearing of guide vanes the guide vane arm top cover and the wall of the draft tube measurements should be done for the complete operating range of the hydraulic turbines during the model testing of the hydraulic turbines the variation in global parameters such as flow rate speed and power can be observed easily but the local parameters like velocity and actual flow angle were difficult to measure due to the rotation of the runner blade prasad et al 2009 the cavitation in the hydraulic machine is measured through hydrodynamic pressures structural vibrations and acoustic emissions measurements escaler et al 2006 the direct and indirect cavitation detection techniques were used in the hydraulic machinery to predict the cavitation it is a very efficient and robust method for cavitation detection in flowing fluid candelet al 2014 koivula et al 2000 the direct cavitation detection is possible by observing the developed cavities visually in the flow passage but the complicated constructions and very high speed cavitation phenomenon make it challenging to predict the cavitation by direct detection techniques due to the restrictions of direct detection techniques various indirect techniques can be used the indirect methods are used to detect cavitation by acoustic instruments accelerometers and pressure sensors to overcome the difficulties of direct detection techniques koivula et al 2000 the appropriate indirect methods of vibration measurement such as the vibratory approach were beneficial for calculating the risk of cavitation erosion during the model test avellan 2004 farhat and avellan 2001 escaler et al 2003 the cavitation phenomenon was observed through the vibration using onboard measurement it is seen that onboard measurements are more reliable than measurements on fixed parts escaler et al 2003 the spectral and statistical techniques are used for the detection of vortex cavitation using acoustic signals in spectral technique the received signal bandwidth reduces as the cavitation vortex rises in strength and size statistical analysis is very significant to detect phenomena of cavitation inside the hydraulic machinery these methods are constructive in minimizing the auxiliary system and the number of transducers candelet al 2014 in the experimental investigation of the hydraulic turbines the various transducers are fitted on different locations to monitor the development of cavitation and observed on the basis of pressure pulsation hydraulic characteristics pit counting and vibrations dupont et al 1996 the pressure fluctuation vibration and sound level were measured using the pressure transducers accelerometer and acoustic emission sensors demirel et al 2015 intrusive and non intrusive methods measured the downstream flow condition of the runner intrusive methods such as wall pressure measurements were used to measure the dynamic loading and pressure fluctuation frequency on the draft tube wall qian et al 2009 kc et al 2014 the non intrusive methods such as particle image velocimetry piv and laser doppler velocimetry ldv were used to identify the flow pattern inside the draft tube and formation of vortex rope at off design conditions goyal and gandhi 2018 su et al 2014 iliescu and ciocan 2008 the swirling flow inside the runner is complex and extremely turbulent that determined by the radial velocity components the radial velocity on downstream is also measured by the particle image velocimetry piv and laser doppler velocimetry ldv measurement methods tridon et al 2010 an on line cavitation monitoring system is also used to predict the cavitation with the help of the turbine monitoring and analysis unit trbmau it monitored both ultrasound 50 khz 300 khz and audible sound 20hz 20 khz continuously produced by the cavitation and evaluate the signal characteristics such as noise level frequency compositions and standard deviation as per the frequency characteristics of sound the cavitation sound is differentiated from the others such as flowing water sound and mechanical sound the calculated results were saved in the database and traced the intensity of cavitation for different operating conditions based on monitoring and evaluation results the engineers and operators plan for the maintenance of hydraulic turbines shi et al 2007 with the help of experimental measurements and numerical methods it becomes possible to predict the types of cavitation shape and intensity which are more dangerous and the locations where the low pressure zone bubble growth and collapse occur in the flow field ayli 2019 the cavitation prediction using experimental techniques is summarized in table 1 which is based on the consequences 3 techniques to prevent or mitigate cavitation the turbine can be designed for cavitation free operation at design operating conditions but the turbine mostly operates at the off design operating conditions on the site this affects the pressure and velocity distribution which may lead to the cavitation problem hence cavitation in the turbine can not be fully prevented but can be mitigated by some remedial measures developed by the different researchers to minimize its effect on the performance of hydraulic turbines and maintenance the essential requirement in most of the techniques for cavitation mitigation is to control the pressure drop in turbine space celebioglu et al 2017 avellan 2004 ayli et al 2016 rivetti et al 2015 the failure of turbine components due to cavitation erosion and surface fatigue can be minimized by identifying the cause of erosion erosion mechanism and methods of prevention senapati et al 2017 3 1 air injection method the air injection method is an important measure to reduce the possibility of cavitation during the operation of the turbine the operation of the turbine at part load full load and overload increases the dynamic instability due to cavitating fluid flow which leads to pressure pulsation and power oscillations adding ambient air into the flow is one of the practical ways to mitigate these pulsations in many situations the amplitude of such pulsations can be significantly reduced by the air admission injection below the runner during the operation of the turbine rivetti et al 2015 v chirkov et al 2017 in this method pressurized air is injected on the horizontal plane of the runner centerline at the discharge ring for every injection point the airflow through all the tubes is injected at constant pressure and constant discharge rivetti et al 2014 minakov et al 2017 it has been previously shown that air injection through the center of the runner cone substantially decreases the amplitude of pressure pulses both at part load and full load operating points chirkov et al 2019 in the various regions of the hydraulic turbines the rate of pressure pulsations was decreased almost twice by the delivery of air into the turbine s flow path minakov et al 2017 in the kaplan turbine model the air injection technique was used for minimizing cavitation as well as reducing the level of vibration as shown in fig 8 the holes of the same diameter are evenly made in the manifold of stainless steel the pressurized air was injected just above the runner blade centerline to minimize the tip vortex cavitation damage and discharge ring cavitation the numerous monitoring instruments such as accelerometer high speed flow visualization lighting setup and data acquisition etc are used to record the data and visualize pictures two different types of airflow meters are connected in parallel to measure the airflow rate the airflow rate is controlled with the help of a needle valve it is noted that the level of vibration was reduced by 50 at the efficiency drop of less than 1 for an airflow rate of 0 4 0 5 further increase in airflow rate beyond 0 8 there was no reduction in vibration level but causing a decrease in efficiency as seen in figs 9 and 10 rivetti et al 2014 the tip leakage vortex cavitation in axial flow turbines may induce noise vibration and erosion the air injection has become a beneficial effect on the reduction of cavitation damage and tip leakage cavitation a methodology has been developed to identify the interaction between tip leakage cavitation and guide vanes the air injection mitigates the erosive potential of tip leakage cavitation and reduces the vibration level of the turbine components at the expense of marginally decreasing the efficiency of the turbine rivetti et al 2015 3 2 design improvement of turbine space and blade profile the runner is most susceptible to cavitation and efficiency characteristics of the hydraulic turbine and the primary attention should be focused on the profile of the runner blade surfaces kawajiri et al 2014 soesanto et al 2017 the assessment of cavitation can be done by the examination of pressure and velocity distribution on the surface of the runner blade semenova et al 2014 the pressure and velocity distribution on the runner will depend on the curvature and thickness of the hydrofoils and their distribution angle of incidence ratio of the hub to tip diameter chord to pitch ratio solidity of the blade etc khare et al 2012 consul et al 2016 the most effective remedies to reduce cavitation in the hydraulic turbine are the enhancement of the turbine space and design improvement in the runner blade profile which will avoid very low pressure in fluid flow especially during off design operating conditions semenova et al 2014 gustavo et al 2010 lipej 2004 the important parameters which need to be improved in the design process are smoothening of blade slopes at inlet and outlet flow angle distribution and profile of the runner blade the length of the blade profile near the hub surface is increased by the use of the flow angle distribution to enhance cavitation properties celebioglu et al 2018 ayli et al 2016 the guide vane angle is also a crucial parameter for regulating and controlling the distribution of uniform flow from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the runner blade celebioglu et al 2018 qian et al 2009 for smooth distribution of velocity and cavitation free observation of the francis turbine the guide vane angle was held at around 160 the low pressure zone near the runner shroud can be minimized by providing a leaning to the shroud in the rotational direction celebioglu et al 2018 x blade design is strengthened to eradicate cavitation at the leading edge and to improve the turbine runner performance during the development stage of the three gorges project in china leaning is provided at the leading edge of the runner between 10 to 50 to ensure a balanced pressure distribution for x blade design demirel et al 2015 celebioglu et al 2018 ayli et al 2016 in x blade configurations a balanced pressure design must be accomplished otherwise at part load conditions the dynamic loads become more abundant which increases blade cracking risk the manufacturing of x blades is more costly and complicated and it is also a very challenging task to design a pressure balanced blade celebioglu et al 2018 brekke 2013 celebioglu et al 2017 modified the runner geometry of existing turbines using ansys bladegen software with the aim of cavitation free runner operation the numerical simulations were performed for 33 operating points and noted that shaft power is increased from 8 73 mw to 8 85 mw in addition to this runner efficiency is improved from 95 to 97 they identified the areas where the greatest amount of bubbles are highly generated and also observed various types of cavitation during off design operating conditions such as leading edge cavitation on the pressure side and suction side of the blade travelling bubble cavitation and inter blade non cavitating vortices the cavitation limit of the newly designed runner is determined by using the cavitating and non cavitating operating points it is seen that the cavitation free operating range is increased as compared to the existing runner 3 3 installation of the turbine at the proper height above the tailrace level the proper setting of the hydraulic turbine above the tailrace reduces the risk of cavitation and overcome the variation of performance characteristics of the turbine it is one of the most crucial parameters that should be considered at the time of turbine installation the absolute pressure at the outlet of the runner decreases with an increase in suction height this becomes more critical at part load operation due to the fall in the water level of the tailrace avellan 2004 from eq 5 it is clear that σ will increase with decreases in the suction head hs so that the turbine can run in the safe operating zone in the high specific speed turbines such as the propeller turbine and kaplan turbine runner exit velocity is very high which reduces the pressure at the exit of the runner thus increases the risk of cavitation hence suction height plays a very significant role in controlling cavitation risk celebioglu et al 2017 avellan 2004 the primary purpose is to find out the appropriate setting level of the hydraulic turbines to control the variation in efficiency and diminish the probability of cavitation erosion 4 cavitation prevention by the use of erosive resistant techniques as cavitation is inevitable and its occurrence will damage the material of turbine components which are susceptible to cavitation due to fatigue and erosion the erosion of component material will not only affect the performance but also helps to promote cavitation hence the material used for turbine components must be strong enough to resist erosion various techniques such as cathodic protection surface coating and cavitation resistance material are used for this purpose 4 1 cathodic protection cathodic protection is used to control the corrosion resistance of the metal surface by supplying the dc power to the runner blades from external sources wyatt 2010 ashworth 2010 the supply of electrical current and voltage should be at a particular magnitude and depends on the size of the runner and coating quality plesset 1962 due to electrical supply hydrogen gas is liberated from flowing fluid by the process of oxidation and reduction redox reaction it provides a cushioning effect on the blade surfaces wyatt 2010 plesset 1962 4 2 surface coating the erosion of components due to cavitation leads to damaged turbine components and also enhances cavitation this becomes challenging for hydro turbine components most of the researchers are working on selecting the appropriate turbine materials and their coatings to minimizes the damage a standard method of diminishing the impact of cavitation erosion is the application of hard coating on the surface the most crucial coating characteristics are cavitation resistance corrosion resistance abrasion resistance vibration damping strong bonding to the substrate and easy applicability at the site etc richman and mcnaughton 1990 singh et al 2012 the coatings like hard facing alloys ceramic pastes and ceramic paints are the common and standard surface coating materials used for the turbine components it has been found that the composites based on tungsten carbide such as 86 wc 10 co 4 cr improve the coating quality and surface finish dorji and ghomashchi 2014 table 2 shows the various types of coating material and processes used to minimize cavitation erosion on the hydraulic turbine components several investigators have used experimental and analytical approaches to study the hard surface coating materials and their erosive behaviour in different hydro turbine components some of the researchers have also revealed through the experimental study on coating for the improvement in the life of components the cost effective analysis of the materials should also be studied 4 3 cavitation erosive resistant material the erosion in the turbine component is a composite phenomenon due to the presence of cavitation and silt the erosion rate depends on the intensity of cavitation resistance of the material and silt properties singh et al 2012 the selection of the appropriate turbine material and manufacturing process will help in the prevention of cavitation damage cast iron is less resistive against cavitation because it contains more carbon contents tôn thât 2010 grewal et al 2013a liu et al 2016 cast steel is considered to be a better option than cast iron because of its unique quality of weldability the affected part due to cavitation can be easily repaired through the welding process the welded surface may resist the cavitation more than ordinary surfaces several authors have selected the austenitic stainless steel due to its excellent weldability and good cavitation erosion resistance at an economical cost bregliozzi et al 2005 ahmed et al 1994 stainless steel with 13 chromium is most commonly used as cavitation resistant material and possesses excellent mechanical properties like high elongation tensile strength impact resistance yield point etc martensitic stainless steel mss with combinations 16cr 5ni 13cr 4ni 13cr 0 5ni and manganese steels etc are mostly used to diminish the cavitation erosion and cavitation damage singh et al 2012 dorji and ghomashchi 2014 the runner blades are made of 13cr 4ni 13cr 1ni 18cr 8ni and 16cr 5ni stainless steel labyrinth stationary seal and guide vanes are made of nickel aluminum bronze alloy and 16cr 5ni 13cr 4ni the mss steel has more cavitation erosion resistance cer than the austenitic steel whereas the ferritic stainless steel possesses the lowest cer singh et al 2012 heathcock et al 1982 friction stir processing fsp is a very effective tool for improving the mechanical characteristics of the material the significant purpose of fsp is to enhance the cavitation erosive resistance and microhardness of materials 13cr4ni steel is the most commonly used for hydro turbine material fsp also improved the surface properties and refined the microstructure without any pre treatment of 13cr4ni steel astm 743 the improvement in the microhardness of steel is 2 6 times after processing and cer is also improved by 2 4 times compared to unprocessed steel grewal et al 2013b the prediction of cer has a vital role in order to evaluate the exact life of hydro turbine components the maximum depth of erosion the mean depth of erosion rate mder and the mean depth of erosion are determined the cer is defined as the inverse of the maximum value of mder the comparison of cer for the different forms of steel used in hydro turbine components is revealed in fig 11 he has tested six different materials such as tempered and quenched high strength steel s550ql and s690ql martensitic stainless steel s41500 welded high strength steel ds 110 and ds t 115 and welded austenitic stainless steel ec308lsi which are commonly used for the hydraulic turbines runner as a result he found that the s41500 material has excellent cavitation erosion resistance properties tôn thât 2010 5 conclusions it is seen from an extensive literature review that extensive work has been done on the prediction and mitigation of cavitation in hydraulic turbines cfd made it possible to carry out the flow simulation in the hydraulic turbine to identify the areas susceptible to cavitation by detailed information of pressure and velocity distribution most of the work on cavitation detection is done for the rated operating condition of the turbine but the turbines run mostly at the off design conditions on the site due to variation in head and discharge which is beyond control hence it is required to carry out research for the improvement of turbine components to minimize the cavitation at the off design operation of the turbine the improvement in design for minimizing cavitation at the off design conditions may lead to some drop in efficiency of the turbine for rated condition but shall reduce the breakdown and maintenance so detailed cost benefit studies are also required the prediction of cavitation by the theoretical and computational techniques is based on the solution of mathematical flow equations and may be subjected to errors due to many factors the different types of turbulence models such as k ε k epsilon k ω k omega shear stress transport sst rng k ε and zles zonal large eddy simulation were used for flow simulation and validated with the experiments the prediction of the flow field was good at bep but during the off design operation the flow field prediction was not predicted well due to the limitations of the appropriate turbulence model used most of the computational studies are lacking in the prediction of accurate flow and validation at the off design operating conditions the experimental technique is more reliable but it is costly and has the limitations of measuring equipment and their placement within the turbine space modern flow measurement systems like piv and ldv can be used to analyze the flow field very precisely so the best results for the cavitation prediction can be obtained by the combined approach of theoretical and experimental techniques the use of x shaped blade runners in place of traditional runner geometries helps to improve the turbine cavitation characteristics and also contributes to increasing the efficiency and power output the study of fluid structure interactions in the turbine can help to improve the components fatigue life the installation of the turbine at the proper suction height from the tailrace is the best method for the mitigation of cavitation however the suction height is subjected to variation due to varying operating conditions of the turbine its variation is more severe in the case of a multi unit power plant while running limited units hence it should be combined with other methods like air injection provisions of gates in tailrace to maintain its level and use of erosion resistant materials to minimize the cavitation at varying operating conditions it is concluded that extensive work needs to be done for the fundamental understanding of the cavitation zones under different operating conditions and cavitation mitigation techniques to reduce the operating and maintenance cost of power plants the design improvements using cfd to minimize off design cavitation cavitation prediction by noise hydro acoustics and development of erosive resistant materials such as composites nano composite of ternary and quaternary phases are some more areas of future research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

gas exploration in deep water arctic regions is expected to demand customized stationkeeping systems of particular interest are dynamic positioning dp capabilities for drill ships offshore supply ships floating production storage and offloading fpsos and icebreakers allowing them to operate under challenging sea ice drift conditions one of the greatest threats to the dp systems of ships and offshore installations is the multi directionality of drifting sea ice with a wide variety of types and forms ranging from isolated first year floes to compacted multi year ridges metrikin 2015 this issue is further complicated by the ice ship interaction process that depends on many complex and interconnected parameters and characteristics related to the ice field the ship and the surrounding environment metrikin 2014 analytical and numerical models and their validations using measurements are essential and a key to understanding the problem and designing both the floating and stationkeeping systems the operators have gained limited experience in real world stationkeeping in broken ice fields managed and unmanaged over the last few decades early experiences include the canmare dome drillship operations jolles et al 1989 the kulluk drilling campaigns wright 1999 and the sakhalin 2 phase 1 oil production operations that were using the floating storage and offloading tanker okha keinonen et al 2000 2006a 2006b for the first time in history dynamic positioning operations in ice were performed in the offshore sakhalin may june 1999 keinonen et al 2000 in support of compression diving the cso constructor performed the dynamic positioning operation in ice of a type b ice class ship with support from two icebreakers acting as an ice management team ice management has been an integral part of exploration and production activities in the arctic where stationkeeping is required rohlén 2009 discussed the relationship between ice management and stationkeeping in ice with specific references for some full scale efforts based on the experience in the arctic core expedition acex2004 and kanumas 2008 operations the author stressed the importance and relevance of ice management in stationkeeping of floating structures during oil and gas related activities in the arctic region impacts from unmanaged ice floes and changes in the ice drift direction were hazardous to the stationkeeping systems during the pioneering operations of the cso constructor keinonen et al 2000 and the vidar viking keinonen et al 2006a recently a dp operation was performed by the icebreaking rescue and emergency ship baltika equipped with the navis nav dp4000 dp system and the navis ap4000 heading control system autopilot in the kara sea navis engineering 2015 a majority of the researchers and operators above identified the need for developing prediction capabilities simulation technologies and training facilities for dp operations in heavy managed and unmanaged dynamic ice conditions before developing these technologies the current knowledge gap in understanding the magnitude and nature of ice actions encountered by the dp controlled drilling and production systems operating in broken ice fields need to be addressed several research and development projects were initiated worldwide to improve the understanding of ice structure interactions and enhance the capabilities of the existing stationkeeping systems hsva in germany led a 3 year 2010 2012 r d project titled dynamic positioning in ice covered waters dypic primarily aiming at developing and

different managed ice environments these projects resulted in multiple numerical tools for modelling the broken ice and floating structure interactions and contributed to the advancement of knowledge and understanding of the intricate ice structure interactions islam et al 2016 2018 besides the above endeavour several other methods have been developed for modelling the global ice loads on stationary and moving ships documentation on various numerical methods and their capabilities and limitations is expected to benefit the current and new researchers this encourages an effort to accumulate all existing research to better understand the effect of various ice field parameters on the performance of a stationkeeping structure and the ice structure interactions modelling endeavours this paper presents a comprehensive literature survey of publicly available ice structure interaction prediction models and research section 2 presented a summary of the detailed literature survey on various existing ice structure interaction models in the survey all methods are conveniently grouped into four categories a brief discussion is presented for each method highlighting their capabilities limitations and applicability for practical and real time simulations after this the authors present a summary of the methods in the context of several modelling aspects for practical and real time simulations of dp ships and broken ice interactions finally the authors present a few concluding remarks and a comprehensive list of references 2 literature survey of broken ice structure interaction models the accuracy and reliability of a modelling method depend on how accurately the most relevant ice structure interaction processes are modelled the design of a traditional ice structure numerical model typically addresses the most relevant physical property to the anticipated ice structure interaction modes typically a choice is made between bending and crushing for ice failure for the sloping ship bow and conical offshore platforms the bending failure of the ice sheet or large floe generally dominates over the other modes of failure lubbad and løset 2011 however the crushing failure dominates in the vertical sided structure hydrodynamic and viscosity effects are generally assumed to be relatively small in low speed interactions hence the reynolds law is usually ignored the ice structure interactions encountered during stationkeeping of ships and offshore platforms in the broken ice field have added complexity depending on the local geometrical configuration and relative velocity at the ice structure contact points the ice failure and subsequent load release can occur through local crushing buckling bending shearing splitting ridging rafting pure displacement or a mixture of two or more of the above failure modes after breaking from a large floe the smaller floes may accelerate rotate collide accumulate submerge and slide along the hull until they are cleared away the hydrodynamic interactions between the water ice structure may become relevant and significant during the broken ice and structure interactions particularly for high ice drifts on a stationary structure or for high advance speed of the structure through the stationary ice field also a dramatic change in ice ship interaction modes in the presence of brash ice and small ice floes has been observed and it is generally recommended that these effects are included in the model several numerical modelling efforts attempted to understand and model the ice interactions on a stationary or dp controlled moored stationkeeping floating structure or slowly maneuvering ships in managed or unmanaged broken ice over the last few decades kubat and sayed 2014 provided a brief literature survey on modelling and numerical simulation methods to investigate ice management related to ice structure interactions the authors noted a substantial increase in publications during 2009 2014 covering diverse subjects such as requirements for operational ice management systems ice basin testing of dp controlled ships reports on field trials and various numerical models to deal with aspects of stationkeeping and ice management metrikin 2015 provided a brief literature survey of different calculation methods for predicting ice forces on offshore structures the section presents a survey of publicly available ice structure interaction modelling methods categorized into four groups analytical methods empirical statistical methods numerical methods and hybrid methods the following sub sections present a summary of work on the sub sets of each group of methods with an emphasis on the methods highlights of the capabilities limitations and real time applicability 2 1 analytical methods analytical methods present mathematical or analytical solutions for each primary type of ice failure mode and ice movement events with consideration to the mechanics of ice interactions to predict ice actions on structures an analytical model generally takes into account the three primary limiting mechanisms of the ice load transfer to a structure namely the limiting driving force limiting momentum and limiting stress the limiting driving force and limiting momentum are computed using analytical empirical solutions and the limiting stress is computed by analyzing the salient interactions and the dominant modes of ice failure via closed form analytical solutions aboulazm 1989 pioneered the development of analytical models for simulating ship interactions with broken ice the author developed two analytical methods a micro model and a macro model to calculate the resistance of a ship in broken ice the micro model treats the ice as a collection of discrete elements impacting the ship and was stated to be suitable for ships advancing at moderate speeds in waters with relatively small concentrations of small ice floes and not suitable for either very slow speeds or very high ice concentrations the macro model treats the ice as a continuous domain with specified physical and mechanical properties and the ice load in this case is estimated based on the motion and drag of the ice fragments as they move away from the ship s path the macro model applies to relatively slow speeds in moderate concentrations of small ice floes another family of the analytical model is based on assuming plausible modes of ice failure upon encountering a ship e g breaking of ice wedges and friction due to ice sliding under the hull lubbad and løset 2011 used this approach to develop efficient simulations of ships transit through the ice gürtner et al 2012 later used the method to model managed ice forces on moored drillships this approach was also used to develop a model and simulations of ice interaction with moored structures by zhou et al 2013 and bonnemaire et al 2014 and 2015 tan et al 2013 and tan 2014 extended the approach to simulate 6 degrees of freedom motion of ships transiting through the ice both of these methods did not include the hydrodynamic effects of the broken ice researchers at the nrc ocre developed an ice hull interaction ihi model for real time simulations of ship maneuvering in level ice liu et al 2006 2008 liu 2009 lau 2011 the model was built on a detailed analysis of hull ice interaction mechanics using an analytical method and its numerical implementation the model incorporated multi failure ice modes and hydrodynamic effects and tracked the development of the broken ice channel ice flexural failure crushing and shear failure were modelled along with the breaking force buoyancy force and clearing force the hull was divided into ten or more segments and the global ice forces were calculated by vectorially adding the forces on the segments the hull ice contacts were calculated based on the ship motion and ice edge in time domain and the channel was tracked using a simple housekeeping method a flat plate model was used for the buoyancy force calculation both the viscous and inertial effects were incorporated into the clearing force the adoption of the analytical method yielded a short calculation time that is essential for real time simulator application since the forces were calculated at each new time increment of any prescribed motion the resulting simulation could respond to arbitrary control inputs and hence arbitrary maneuvers in ice the simple physical detail and short computation time make this method suitable for real time simulations the ihi model was validated using two planar motion mechanism pmm test series carried out with the canadian coast guard s terry fox and r class scale models lau 2011 a group of researchers in the norwegian university of science and technology ntnu trondheim norway investigated several ice sloping structure interaction processes primarily focusing on the fracture of ice floes using analytical means lu 2014 lu et al 2012a b c 2015a 2015b 2016 the researchers identified a knowledge gap regarding the fracture of a finite size ice floe in the context of ice structure interactions and studied several failure modes of a finite size ice floe the failure modes included an open ice condition such as 1 in plane splitting failure 2 out of plane flexural failure and 3 competition between different failure modes in the context of ice sloping structure interactions the research group proposed analytical solutions for each failure mode for ice floes of varying sizes and offered validation of using linear elastic fracture mechanics lefm to study an ice floe s splitting failure on an engineering scale the group used a method of combining both physical model tests and a theoretical model to study the ice force s spatial and temporal variations on a sloping structure under the influence of rubble accumulation lu 2014 they found that the presence of rubble accumulation increases the global ice resistance and the maximum value of ice resistance occurs in a location below the waterline which signifies the importance of the ice rotating process and rubble accumulation effect the research also revealed that an ice floe s confinement has a much more profound effect on increasing the force required to split an ice floe in comparison with the influence of floe geometry the researchers did not include the crushing failure which may be more prominent for vertical structures idrissova et al 2019 used a collision energy based method to predict ice loading on ships known as the popov method this method is fundamentally analytical however several coefficients related to the ship ice interaction process and the material properties of sea ice are determined empirically idrissova et al 2019 obtained a reasonable comparison with full scale ice ship interaction loads with specific combinations of the coefficients idrissova et al 2019 recommended future research is to address numerous unknowns related to the ship ice interaction and sea ice material properties such as the actual ship ice contact geometry and line load distribution in various types of a ship ice collisions 2 2 empirical statistical methods in empirical statistical methods a correlation between the global ice loads and prevalent ice and ship parameters is established using observations and analyses of full scale and model scale measurements in a purely statistical method generally a multi variate regression or a machine learning method is used for the correlation development in the semi empirical method expressions with coefficients are developed to correlate the control variable and the response functions the coefficient values are derived from measurements and observations a similar method using the popular design of experiment doe methods islam and lye 2008 is also used to extract the empirical relationship the doe method provides a straightforward methodology to encapsulate the global response of the ship to phenomenologically defined ice and ship states keinonen et al 1989 1991 1996 and 1998 and keinonen and robbins 1998 developed a pioneering empirical method for predicting ice structure interaction forces due to broken ice using the equivalent ice thickness method this method is based on empirical formulations for estimating the global ice forces from various parameters of the broken ice field once estimated the equivalent ice thickness can be inserted into the equations for the level ice resistance of a ship from keinonen and robbins 1998 the equivalent thickness heq for icebreakers

statistics for ice loads on a ship shaped or conical structure eik 2011 used the equivalent level ice thickness method to calculate horizontal managed ice forces on a moored symmetrical structure liferov 2014 also used the same method in the shtokman project spencer and molyneux 2009 woolgara and colbourne 2010 and wang et al 2010 developed empirical methods based on regression analyses of model tests performed in pack ice conditions wright 1999 croasdale and liferov 2009 palmer and croasdale 2013 derived empirical formulae from full scale measurements of the global ice forces on the kulluk platform woolgara and colbourne 2010 carried out extensive model tests with a moored offshore ship model and used the data to develop a regression model that included hull ice frictions ice floe size ice drift velocity ice concentration and limited ship geometries as the following 2 f x 100 2 c 5 88 ρ i g 0 5865 h 1 5865 l f 0 898 b 0 102 μ 0 265 v i 0 827 where f x l o n g i t u d i n a

ice and ship variables that are expected to influence pack ice load however this formulation is used only for the forward orientation whereas stationkeeping operations can encounter changing drift angles arising from sudden changes in ice encroaching direction hence the model is needed to be generalized to apply to a ship of different drift angles e g in terms of fx and fy for the surge and sway directions respectively wang et al 2010 fitted data based on the design of experiments doe technology and multi regression mr analysis and proposed the following empirical formulation for

experiment doe method based regression methods to develop empirical expressions between the time averaged global forces and various ice parameters using a model test dataset the analysis provided general insights into the most influential managed ice field parameters and combinations of parameters that significantly affect the global forces of a dynamically positioned ship through the work the authors illustrated how such a problem with a large number of variables could be systematically handled to develop an empirical model using a variety of modern statistical design of experiment tools which in turn can be used to understand the effects of various control parameters and their interactions on the response the primary advantage of the empirical methods is their numerical efficiency the ice force model adds almost no computational overhead to the real time simulations for ice structure interaction scenarios besides such methods would have short development and validation efforts and minimal integration complexity however this method provides only one value average or maximum or standard deviation of the ice loads for a specific ice structure scenario as such this method does not give interaction data for local force assessment as it pays no attention to the individual ice impact event thus limiting the visualization aspect this is inadequate for simulation of stationkeeping of dp ship because the dynamic properties of the ice force at each time step of the simulation are necessary as the control system must dynamically react to the changes in the imposed global ice forces there have been very few efforts to account for these deficiencies in the literature eik and aksnes 2010 used a max to mean ratios method to estimate the distribution of peak values of the global ice forces by combining an empirical formulation for the ice resistance of an icebreaking ship with the max mean ratios of the global ice forces measured in physical model tests eik and aksnes 2010 used this method for applications in level ice conditions and eik 2011 for managed ice conditions gash and millan 2012 have developed a machine vision analysis based system identification id method for extracting useful kinematic and dynamic information of ice pieces in ice structure interaction scenarios from videos recorded during physical model testing of stationkeeping of dp ship in managed ice conditions this machine vision based analysis uses a combination of segmentation edge intensity and morphological methods to produce accurate segmentation estimates for ice pieces it produced data of the ice field such as ice concentration number of ice pieces piece size position velocity rotation mass and momentum gash and millan 2012 used this method to correlate ice concentration with demand thrust for a dp controlled drillship model and found inconsistent correlation at low concentration the authors concluded that ice concentration alone is not capable of adequately describing the dynamics of the ice hull interactions additional ice parameters and their mutual interactions need to be considered even with the above enhancement the major shortcoming of the empirical statistical method is its lack of details of the floe dynamics this reduces the fidelity of visualization in the simulation further the representativeness of simulations using such a method is questionable because the imposed ice actions do not depend on the actual motion characteristics of the simulated ship i e the response of the ship to the ice loads and the coupled ice ship dynamics are not taken into account furthermore the method does not consider any dynamic inertial or damping effects from the ice therefore it may be difficult to extend this method beyond the boundaries of the particular scenario that served as the basis for the empirical formulation metrikin 2015 a significant improvement of this method is required before it can be considered suitable for time domain simulations of dp ships in ice operations 2 3 computational numerical methods computational methods often known as numerical methods are primarily based on the fundamental laws of physics computational methods have been proven to be useful for solving complex interaction processes hence researchers have applied them for ice structure interaction problems over the last few decades in contrast to the empirical statistical and analytical studies the literature of numerical modelling efforts for ice structure interactions in broken ice is extensive such a model naturally produces the time series of the ice structure interaction responses of a stationkeeping ship and can be coupled with its dp control system in a closed loop therefore these can be readily used in the simulations for performance assessment of the ship in ice as well as for testing the robustness of dp control systems metrikin 2015 there are multiple categories of numerical models based on a variety of tactics and targeting different aspects of ship ice interaction research two fundamentally different simulation methods are frequently consulted that deal with the broken ice characteristics and granular properties of ice the first method considers ice as discrete particles elements or the assembly of discrete elements each element particle or the assembly of elements has the properties of ice and the interactions between other elements structures or medium represent the behaviour of ice this method can be generally called the discrete element method dem the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method is also a particle based method which has recently been used for numerical modelling of ice and structure interactions the second method considers ice as a continuum material such as the finite element method fem finite difference method fdm finite volume method fvm and also the particle in cell pic method these methods have been widely applied in simulating the behaviour of structures and fluids recently these methods attracted many researchers to go beyond their traditional applications and use them to address unique ice failure problems such as ice crushing discontinuity or large deformation this section surveys the latest applications of these numerical methods that are most relevant in terms of modelling ice forces on floating structures and stationkeeping in broken ice 2 3 1 discrete element method dem discrete element method dem simulations as initially formulated by cundall and strack 1979 have been applied to modelling ice structure interaction related problems since the mid 1980s typical dem simulations consist of a few hundred up to a few thousand interacting ice blocks each element can have its material properties density elasticity flexural and compressive strengths the geometric shapes such as 3 dimensional disks spheres or polyhedral elements can represent the ice element lu et al 2014 tuhkuri and polojärvi 2018 provided a review of the use of dem in studying ice structure interaction with emphasis on the lessons learned about the behaviour of sea ice as a discontinuous medium the review emphasized the engineering applications of the method more than on the development of the method itself according to the authors the use of dem appears most beneficial in cases where modelling of discrete ice blocks is required two types of ice models are typically used firstly modelling an ice floe as one elementary element which can be defined by different geometric forms and is a solid with volume mass elastic modulus the elements are unbreakable hence the crushing or flexural bending failure mechanisms are not modelled secondly individual elements can be bound together to model an inhomogeneous or breakable level ice sheet or a large ice floe katsuragi et al 1997 the gluing strength is generally related to the crushing and flexural bending strength of ice each step of the dynamic simulation loop in the dem typically consists of three sub steps collision detection interaction force computation and time integration element motion calculation the contact detection is the most time consuming process on a given time step the contact forces and external forces acting on each block are solved fig 1 the dem simulates the ice element dynamics by implementing several contact algorithms canelas et al 2015 2016 the interaction forces can include the normal and tangential forces gravity hydrostatic hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces ice ice and ice structure collisions are typically modelled as linear spring damper systems whereas coulombic friction is considered for tangential sliding newton s second law is used to determine the accelerations and a numerical integration scheme of choice is used to update the velocities and positions of each block the motions of an element are calculated based on the force and momentum on each element for each time step these three processes are repeated different researchers have used dem to model ice interaction with fixed or moored floating structures løset 1994a b used a 2 dimensional dem method to simulate the dynamics and interaction forces between distinct unbreakable ice floes circular variable sizes and a pile in a broken ice field hansen and løset 1999a b used a similar model to examine ice action against moored offshore units the same method was used by karulina 2010 2011 to simulate a tanker moored to a production platform by karulin and karulina 2013 to simulate a semisubmersible in broken ice and by karulin and karulina 2014 to simulate a multi leg platform in broken ice richard and mckenna 2013 modelled the dynamics of a broken ice field and the displacements of a stationkeeping ship in the horizontal plane using a two dimensional dem the commercial dem code decice which is owned by oceanic consulting corporation based in newfoundland canada is frequently used by the researchers at the nrc ocre and at memorial university of newfoundland mun to study a variety of problems related to ice structure interactions in level and broken ice fields since the 1990s this software has been used extensively for simulating the behaviour of turret moored tankers in pack ice murray and spencer 1997 the manoeuvring of ships in ice lau 2006 lau and simões ré 2006 lau et al 2011 zhan et al 2010 zhan and molyneux 2012 and pack ice forces on floating offshore oil and gas exploration systems liu et al 2010 ji et al 2013 used a dem based software to simulate the interaction between drifting ice floes and a moving ship the authors used three dimensional 3 d dilated disk elements to model the pancake ice floes with considering the buoyancy drag force and additional mass induced by the current ji et al 2015 investigated the interaction between ice cover and conical offshore structures using dem and determined the dynamic ice forces under different structure parameters and ice conditions the authors modelled the ice cover by dispersing a series of bonded spherical elements with the parallel bonding model to investigate the influences of ice velocity ice thickness and conical angle on ice forces zhou and peng 2014 developed a numerical method to simulate the ice induced forces acting on the ship and the performance of a dynamically controlled ship operating in level ice in which the interaction between the ship and the ice was considered by adopting a 2 d dem subsequently dai and peng 2015a developed a numerical model of dp ship operating in a pack ice field using a two dimensional dem dai and peng 2015b analyzed and presented selected simulation results of different dp ship ice interaction scenarios prasanna and hissette 2018 presented a simulation tool for simulating the transit of ships through brash ice channels based on the dem the authors achieved a consistent behaviour of the ice particles near the structure see fig 2 however ice forces on the structure exhibited some discrepancies the cause for high ice forces is identified to be deficiencies in modelling the behaviour of far field ice particles in the current tool the simulation tends to overestimate the particle motions in far field due to the deficiencies in the implemented friction model cundall strack friction in recent years the dem has been extended to the analysis of continuum media the so called bonded dem celigueta et al 2017 implemented a bonded dem to study multi fracture and failure of solids involving geomaterials and concrete jou et al 2019 investigated broken ice interactions with moving structures representing ice breaking ships and cones by using a local bonded dem through several bonded dem simulations the authors provided some insights on the most frequently encountered ice infested scenarios the main characteristics of ice breaking ships and the predicted failure modes of floe ice depending on the loading conditions the structure type and the ice feature dimensions and thickness 2 3 2 non smooth dem ndem or physically based modelling pbm the non smooth dem ndem may be considered as a branch of the classical dem in which efficient contact detection and force calculation algorithms are used and which is developed for fast and accurate enough modelling of physical phenomena this modelling method is also known as physically based modelling radjaï and richefeu 2009 hedman 2011 and metrikin and løset 2013 in this method commercial and or publicly available open source physics engines are generally used to detect the contacts among all simulated bodies calculate the contact forces and time integrate the dynamical systems of equations although this method is relatively new in ice research and engineering it has already been used by several researchers in various institutions in the world particularly for developing real time simulators for ice structure interaction modelling the pbm or ndem method for ice structure interaction modelling was pioneered by konno and mizuki 2006a b and was developed further in their subsequent publications 2007 konno and yoshimoto 2008 konno 2009 konno and saitoh 2010 konno et al 2011a b konno et al 2013 ishibashi et al 2014 uto et al 2015 sawamura and kioka 2016 and the research group s previous works referred directly to this method and used similar concepts for simulating the rotation sliding and submergence of ice floes along the hull of a ship after the floes break off from level ice sawamura 2012 2014 sawamura et al 2015 sawamura and tachibana 2011 similar methods were used by lubbad and løset 2011 and berglund 2012 to simulate a ship in level ice by gürtner et al 2012 and amdahl et al 2014 to simulate a moored drillship in managed ice and by metrikin et al 2013 and 2015 to simulate dp in managed ice metrikin et al 2012 studied four open source physics engines agx multiphysics open dynamics engine physx and vortex in terms of integration performance and contact detection accuracy documentation quality and the level of technical support for possible applications in the real time simulation of stationkeeping of a floater in broken ice conditions metrikin 2014 developed a software package for simulation of stationkeeping of a ship in discontinuous ice using multiple physics engines gürtner et al 2012 used a real time simulation system to investigate ice loading and moored drillship responses in drifting managed ice different levels of ice management were represented in terms of ice concentration floe size distribution and ice thickness the results were compared with model scale experiments for a ship transiting in level ice metrikin and loset 2013 simulated a model test conducted in a towing tank that calculated the surge force in pack ice statoil and multiconsult inc jointly developed a numerical model based on the ndem method called sibis which is an acronym for simulation of interaction between broken ice and structures it was initially developed to create a numerical environment for efficient simulations of floating structures in discontinuous i e broken ice conditions in the time domain metrikin et al 2015a the numerical model estimates local and global ice actions on ships and offshore structures and the corresponding structural response in the time domain metrikin et al 2015b serre et al 2019 further developed the sibis to improve simulation capabilities of broken ice interaction with offshore structures to represent better the brash ice effects on the ice floes and the dynamicity of the load signal the authors illustrated the software capabilities by carrying out several benchmark test simulations and post simulation exercise of two interaction events recorded during full scale stationkeeping trials with a moored ship in drifting ice cover fig 3 presents a realistic vessel in broken ice fields simulations carried out in sibis where the ice fields were divided into two parts a near field area of managed ice and a far field area where the floes were unmanaged metrikin et al 2015a the physics engine based discrete element method is also utilized in a new ice simulation tool developed in france for simulating ice structure interactions of arctic offshore platforms septseault et al 2014 2015 dudal et al 2015 technip in collaboration with cervval and bureau veritas bv developed the ice modelling simulation program called ice star cambos 2014 the numerical tool has been developed further recently to incorporate a multi agent technology with the possibility to combine in a common framework multiple phenomena from various natures and heterogeneous scales i e drag friction ice sheet bending failure local crushing and rubble stack up cahay et al 2017 this is now known as the ice mass www ice mas com cahay et al 2017 presented the overall functionalities of ice mas and the different possibilities to model a semi submersible floater with different geometries subject to ice sheet loading through different incidence angles huisman et al 2016 developed a numerical model to predict the interaction between floating objects and the surrounding level ice only modelling the icebreaking due to bending lubbad et al 2018 introduced a numerical simulator sams simulator for arctic marine structures for structures in various ice conditions such as level ice broken ice and ice ridges sams is primarily based on the ndem with an implicit time stepping scheme and an improved contact model enabling general visco elastic contacts sams considers the contact crushing force and the force penetration gradient leading to more accurate contact force predictions as illustrated in berg et al 2018 also sams adopts an analytical framework that supplements the ndem method with analytical closed form solutions to simulate the fracture of sea ice the different modules described above were developed over many years by several researchers at ntnu at that stage many attempts were also made to validate each module against available full scale and lab scale data lu et al 2015a 2015b lu et al 2016c tsarau and løset 2015 tsarau et al 2014 van den berg et al 2018 showed that the proposed time stepping scheme predicts well the sheltering effects directionality and order of magnitude of ice loads on a 4 legged vertical walled structure in ice tank tests tsarau et al 2018 simulated several available experimental case studies from the field and ice tanks using sams for validation purposes berg et al 2019a 2019b investigated the effect of floe shape on the load experienced by vertical sided structures using a 2d non smooth dem ndem which is an adapted version of the simulator for arctic marine structures sams model hasegawa et al 2019 proposed a numerical simulation method by a non smooth discrete element method and used a fixed joint function available in the bullet physics engine to model breakable ice elements consisting of small square rigid bodies to represent ice failure the authors showed that the breakable ice elements reasonably reduce peak loads to the experimental results and ice ice friction was one of the most important tuning parameters for modelling ice failure in their model in a recent endeavour the national research council canada developed an ndem based numerical simulation model leveraging the bullet physics engine to model rigid and breakable ice elements consisting of randomly shaped polygons to represent managed and unmanaged ice fields the authors implemented new algorithms for modelling buoyancy and developed techniques to simulate ice dp ship interactions in an infinite loop pearson et al 2019 several challenges in using the commercial open source physics engine can be identified based on the experience of various researchers besides the limitations of modelling various ice failure modes such as crushing bending and splitting both static and dynamic frictions need correct modelling it is believed to be the most significant contributor to energy dissipation during icebreaking clearing ice rafting and ice ridging events the fluid modelling capabilities are another crucial aspect when choosing an engine for the numerical simulation of the floater ice interaction moreover the maneuvering characteristics of the slowly moving hull needs to be modelled correctly which are often ignored in the physics engine based modelling 2 3 3 finite element method fem in the finite element method fem simulation of the interaction between ice and structures the ice is described as a continuum material based on a constitutive model taking on the challenge to reliably simulate the complicated ice mechanical properties and ice failure mechanisms following continuum mechanics fem is one of the most powerful numerical methods and the industry has widely applied it in simulating the behaviour of structures the application of fem to the broken ice and structure interaction problems is significantly increased in recent times recent efforts by several ice experts in applying this numerical method to the ice structure interaction problems are discussed below through a survey of fem based ice models the majority of researchers favouring the fem method to model ice structure interactions in broken ice conditions use either ls dyna or ansys as their modelling tool both packages provide arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale technology to simulate better the multi medium interactions such as the hydrodynamic effects to the solid body motions wang and derradji aouat 2010 2011 millan and wang 2011 kim et al 2013 lee et al 2013 and kim et al 2014 have reported applications of the fem to the problem of simulating a ship in broken ice fields these researchers employed the commercial fem package ls dyna and the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method to calculate the hydrodynamic forces and ice structure interaction forces on a ship in broken ice numerically however the ice pieces were considered unbreakable in those studies lobanov 2011 developed an alternative fem method which considered the material behaviours of both the ice and the floater in addition to the ale formulation using the ansys package wang and derradji aouat 2011 simulated a downward breaking conical structure kulluk in pack ice condition using an explicit fem the authors studied the effect of floe concentration and floe shapes on the forces on the structure for the high concentration 80 numerical results showed a slightly higher average value due to ice accumulation see fig 4 the authors recommended using deformable and more realistic floe shape for future studies several research activities on the ice failure modes modelling are available in the public domain gagnon 2011 proposed to model ice with the general purpose commercial software ls dyna using a hard crushable foam type of constitutive material model this model was used to calculate the impact force due to the ice indentation in a bergy bit collision with a ship the author and his research group developed the crushable foam model to simulate the ice pressure in the crushing process of the ice the simulation results showed the cyclic saw tooth force events and pressure distributions that are roughly characteristic of observed local ice crushing failure behaviour applications and validation of this method are published in the works by gagnon and derradji aouat 2006 gagnon and wang 2012a and in gagnon and wang 2012b gao et al 2014 used a similar method to study the iceberg geometry effect on the collision process with a fixed structure nisja 2014 used four material models available in ls dyna to investigate the force displacement history of brittle failure in sea ice and concluded that all material models had resulted in the right order of magnitude and was optimistic about finding an existing material model that can give satisfactory results for interaction between ice and structures except for the work of wang and derradji aouat 2011 no validations or calibrations of fem simulations against full scale data have been reported for the case of a structure in drifting sea ice several researchers in europe and asia investigated the use of bonded particles to provide a reasonable representation of various ice failures modes of quasi brittle sea ice allowing for fracture crushing and flexural bending failure often termed as the cohesive element method cem the cohesive fracture laws and cohesive finite elements are used to formulate the nonlinear dynamic ice structure interactions in this method the ice sheet is modelled using bulk elements which are connected by zero thickness cohesive elements the cohesive elements are deleted once their energy to resist crack formation is fully consumed while the bulk elements retained in the system account for crushing and progressive rubbling of the ice fragments although the method is physics based leading to the better potential for acceptability a coherent guideline for the numerical inputs is still lacking zhang et al 2019b another fem based model is the extended fem xfem which is a relatively new method to model crack initiation and propagation in materials xfem is theoretically a mesh independent method which allows the crack to propagate through the element without remeshing this is achieved by enriching the solution space for solutions to differential equations with discontinuous functions in abaqus standard 2017 xfem is an available method allowing the modelling of crack growth using either a cohesive segment method or linear elastic fracture mechanics lefm hilding et al 2008 provided an overview of the cem for ice modelling including recent improvements made by the authors konuk et al 2009a b c developed a framework incorporating dynamic crack propagation and continuum mechanics for modelling ice structure interaction processes using the cem the authors presented a number of case studies to demonstrate the application of cem for modelling ice structure interaction processes konuk and yu 2010 gürtner 2009 developed a computational cohesive element model ccem method using finite element discretization in combination with cohesive elements and the cohesive zone model czm for fracture the author implemented the model into the finite element program ls dyna to study some aspects of dynamic ice structure interaction and analyze the dynamics of a structure resulting from ice loading as a coupled non linear dynamical system daiyan and sand 2011 utilized the czm to model ice fracture and fluid structure interaction fsi to model a more realistic boundary condition of a drifting ice sheet and implemented the models in ls dyna to simulate the problems related to ice sloping structure interactions lu et al 2012 investigated the czm to simulate both the fracturing and upcoming fragmentation of level ice lu et al 2012 tested the traditional finite element method with element erosion methods the cohesive element method cem the discrete element method dem with cohesive contacts and the extended finite element method xfem in simulating the ice sloping structure interactions feng et al 2016 developed a 3d finite element model with the use of the cem in ls dyna for simulating ice structure interaction in relatively recent research xu et al 2019 proposed a three dimensional constitutive ice model with nonlinear viscoelastic and plastic components the authors implemented the material model in the commercial software ls dyna as a user defined material and verified the viscoelastic plastic and brittle behaviour of ice through a series of experiments zhang et al 2019b investigated various shapes of the bulk constitutive law and found that the softening response had a considerable influence on the corresponding ice induced forces for simulations involving the crushing failure of the ice sheet the authors recommended to carefully model the post yield aspect of the bulk constitutive law to predict the ice induced forces accurately li et al 2020 proposed a novel method to model ship ice interaction to be applied to ship scale simulations xfem with lefm is used to identify and characterize the bending cracks and simplified the crushing process the hydrodynamic effect is neglected and the water is modelled as an elastic foundation the xefm based simulation provides insights into the observed failure mode wang et al 2020 used fem based arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method and penalty function offered in ls dyna to simulate the navigation of an ice area bulk carrier in broken ice fields where the ice material was defined as elastic the authors confirmed that the movements of ice floes in the simulation were consistent with those in the model test as shown in fig 5 the authors also achieved less than 15 percentage deviation of the numerical ice resistance from the ice resistance in the model test the authors recommended improving this method by incorporating ice failure modes and using an improved hydrodynamic model for more realistic modelling of the three phase ship ice water coupling among all these numerical methods the element erosion method turns out to be the most efficient method the cem can capture a stabilized icebreaking force but the whole structure appears to be softened with increasing cohesive element density the dem with cohesive contact alleviates us from the structural softening problem but it is so computationally expensive that only limited simulations and conclusions are made the xfem needs to be tested with various applications and validation using full scale ice structure interaction data the majority of the fem applications to ice problems have been focused on modelling ice properties to simulate better the failure modes such as the use of exotic material modelling for spalling or fracture failures these failures directly affect the local forces on structures while the focus for the floating structures is global responses expanding the application to modelling the ice floes structure and the fluid domain in a fine mesh to predict the global ice forces on floating structures accurately maybe by the computational expense performing this simulation in real time for applications of dp in broken ice simulation is beyond the possible range of current hardware capability 2 3 4 particle in cell pic method the particle in cell pic method solves the stresses velocities and deformation distributions of an ice field by solving equations of conservation of mass and linear momentum together with constitutive equations that represent ice properties those properties are introduced through a failure envelope that incorporates the tensile shear and compressive strengths solving those equations gives the evolution of the distributions of stresses deformation thickness concentration or coverage and velocities of the ice cover the method takes advantage of both eulerian and lagrangian descriptions to address large deformations more naturally thereby avoiding the mesh lock up problems encountered in the fem sayed et al 2012 2014 2015 three dimensional simulations can be used to investigate the details of ice failure and clearing near the structure or depth averaged simulations can be used where the primary concern is the deformation of the ice cover over the vast area pic based software was developed at the nrc ocre and adapted to simulate ice management and stationkeeping problems over the last two decades some applications of the pic based method in simulating ice structure interactions include but are not limited to the work on ice forces on bridge piers barker et al 2000a 2002 ice forces on fixed offshore structures kamesaki et al 2000 vachon et al 2012 barker and sayed 2012 barker et al 2014 ice forces on moored and thruster assisted drillships including the kulluk drillship barker et al 2000b sayed and barker 2011 sayed et al 2012 2014 2015 and ice forces on a newly designed floating structure iyerusalimskiy et al 2012 in a recent endeavour sayed et al 2017 carried out a comparison study between results from ice basin tests and numerical simulations the study examined the dynamic positioning dp of a ship in managed ice conditions at a scale of 1 40 the pic based numerical tool was used to simulate several representative ice basin test conditions the resulting pressure mean normal stress distributions and positions of the ship are shown at an interval in fig 6 the distributions show that high pressures occur around the bow as may be expected the packing of the floes causes the distributions to show some irregularity or tree branch like patterns as was reported in previous studies e g sayed et al 2016 the results indicate that surge direction thrust and moments are in good agreement sayed et al 2018 illustrated how to assess acceptable ice conditions for ship stationkeeping in pack ice using the pic based methods islam et al 2019 used the pic based ice dynamics model idm to simulate a representative full scale scenario of the dynamic positioning of an ice management ship this work indicates that numerical simulations can predict the full scale stationkeeping scenarios with reasonable accuracy 2 3 5 smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method is a mesh free lagrangian particle method in which the state of a system is represented by a set of particles which possess individual material properties and move according to the given conservation equations field properties such as velocity and stress are evaluated at the particle positions and no finite differences or grids are necessary similar to pic based methods the most attractive feature of the sph method is its ability to handle problems with considerable deformations this method offers a natural advantage over traditional grid based methods for problems especially related to fracture collapse or fragmentation for an accurate sph simulation uniformly sized particles are required throughout the model and as such if high accuracy is required in such simulations long run time can be a problem sph is a powerful tool for the simulation of systems characterized by the rheology of mohr coulomb type it has essential advantages compared to standard finite differences methods when applied to problems involving both frictional solid surfaces and free surfaces this type of rheological behaviour can be found in ice broken fields and in numerous problems in the field of quasi static granular flows gutfraind and savage 1997 the spalling of ice for instance is an ice structure interaction event that can be reproduced by an sph simulation keegan et al 2013 investigated the hailstone impact on the leading edge of a wind turbine s blade pan et al 2012 developed a new sph model for coupled ice sheet and ice shelf dynamics the authors studied ice sheet ice shelf behaviour and the dynamics of the grounding line in which the ice is modelled as a viscous newtonian fluid typically ice sheets are modelled as a non newtonian fluid accounting for the changes in the mechanical properties of the ice implementation of non newtonian rheology in the sph model is the subject of ongoing research das et al 2014 modelled the sea ice in four point bending for flexural strength testing using the sph method to predict the force displacement and failure time of an ice piece and found a good comparison with the available literature das and ehlers 2015 simulated bending and crushing failure of sea ice on a local scale using sph ryszard 2017 presents a smoothed particle hydrodynamics model for modelling sea ice dynamic phenomena occurring on geophysical scales cabrera 2017 used an open source sph implementation for solving a single phase granular flow that represents brash ice behaviour as it interacts with a moving cylinder the author compared the model predictions with experimental data obtained from a cylinder resistance test conducted in the hsva ice tank facilities in the comparison the granular behaviour of the brash ice was captured correctly and the velocity field visual comparison was regarded as reasonably good see fig 7 zhang et al 2019 integrated the drucker prager yield criterion based softening elastoplastic model into the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method to simulate the ice failure process and ice ship interactions after satisfactory validation against standard benchmarking tests the authors employed the extended sph method to simulate level ice interacting with sloping structure and three dimensional ice ship interaction in level ice 2 3 6 gpu event mechanics gem method a research group at the memorial university of newfoundland canada developed a gpu event mechanics gem modelling method to simulate broken ice actions on ships daley et al 2012 2014 alawneh 2014 alawneh et al 2015 the main idea of this method is to treat ice as a set of discrete objects with specific properties and to model the system mechanics mainly as a set of discrete contact and failure events a set of simulation domains each containing hundreds of discrete and interacting ice floes is modelled the model focuses on the event sequence rather than on the continuum mechanics of a single event this method is called the ice event mechanics modelling iemm method which builds a system solution from a large set of discrete events occurring between a broad set of discrete objects each event forms a step in developing the results and creates the initial conditions for the next event the event sequence is a nonlinear process and does not lend itself to an easy analytical description a simple ship is modelled as it navigates through the domains each ship ice collision is modelled as is every ice ice contact see fig 8 it is claimed that the gem methodology allows the simulations to be performed much faster than real time which may be attributed to the simplicity of the ice ice and ice structure interaction modelling method the physical processes modelled may need enhancement to provide more realistic simulations the research group is currently implementing additional functions for future development including the flexural floe edge failure rafting floe splitting and ridge building 2 4 hybrid numerical methods researchers have been developing methods to integrate multiple numerical methods tightly coupled or loosely coupled to handle the high complexity of ice structure interaction phenomena one such example is the coupling of dem with the fem method the classical dems are suited for problems governed by limit energy and perhaps limit force mechanisms but not for the problems where the limit stress is essential researchers overcome this shortcoming by combining dem with the fem where the latter is used to simulate the fracture of ice floes a fem dem model was developed in house by the department of applied mechanics at aalto university in finland paavilainen et al 2009 2011 paavilainen and tuhkuri 2012 2013 paavilainen 2013 polojärvi and tuhkuri 2009 2010 2013 2014 polojärvi 2013 ranta et al 2014 paavilainen et al 2009 2011 used a combined fem dem to describe an ice structure interaction vroegrijk 2015 used a hybrid cfd dem model to predict the added resistance due to brash ice and compared the results with measured data the american bureau of shipping abs has recently invested in developing a graphic processing unit gpu based on a discrete element method dem model for developing practical and advanced tools to assess the ice forces on offshore structures liu et al 2016 this arrangement processes the computations in parallel and solves the dem model with millions of particles for complicated ice structure interaction problems e g ice simultaneously loading on multiple legs and ice loading on a large csdu liu et al 2016 liu et al 2016 presented details of the developing abs gpu dem tool status of the verification program plans for the current and future developments and applications gutfraind and savage 1998 presented computer simulations of the wind driven motion of fractured ice in a wedge shaped channel by combining dem with sph to model the ice blocks or floes and to solve continuum equations for flow of fractured ice respectively duchting 2018 investigated a fem an sph and a combined fem sph method to deal with the physical effects of crushed ice that formed during a compression test the author compared the results of a fem sph simulation to the results of a simulation without sph with the measurements of ultimate strength and the behaviour of an ice specimen in compression the author claimed to have proven the ability of the fem sph method to model the transformation of the material and to handle large deformation with more realistic interface pressure and stress distribution see fig 9 mintu and molyneux 2018 presented a method of coupling an open sourced sph with three dimensional dem code to model several scenarios of ships and offshore structures interacting with pack ice taking into account the hydrodynamic effects the effect of modelling ice pieces a rigid body on the responses was not discussed and no validation of the predictions was offered li et al 2019 used analytically derived differential equations and finite difference method fdm to numerically solve the ice failure including icebreaking patterns and ice bearing capacity of ships going through level ice lemström et al 2019 2020 used two dimensional combined fem dem simulations to investigate the effect of water depth and ice thickness on peak ice load magnitudes on a wide inclined offshore structure in shallow water the authors carried out a probabilistic analysis on the extensive amount of simulation results to evaluate the probability of rubble pile grounding the rubble pile geometries and the load transmission from the intact ice sheet to the structure through the ice rubble pile luo et al 2020 presented a cfd dem coupling numerical method to study the ship resistance of a certain type of ice strengthened panama bulk carrier in the brash ice channel the authors compared the numerical results with the measurements carried out at the hsva ice tank the authors showed that the cfd dem coupling numerical method took a full account of the effect of ship water and the interaction between fluid and particles with an average error within 6 for all cases studied more research is required to model the brash ice more accurately and to improve numerical efficiency huang et al 2020 used cfd and dem to simulate the ship wave ice interaction in arctic ice conditions the authors applied fvm based cfd to obtain fluid solutions for the floes and incorporated it with the dem to govern ice motions and account for ship ice ice ice collisions the authors compared the model predictions using model basin measurements and carried out a series of simulations are performed to investigate how the resistance is influenced by ship speed ice concentration ice thickness and floe diameter this work appears to be the first work that includes ship generated waves and ice piece interactions see fig 10 this method accounts for the relevant hydrodynamics of the ice pieces however the ice pieces were modelled as rigid bodies hence the wave ice interactions may require further validation and improvement to incorporate the relevant ice failure modes the computational complexity of the majority of the above models renders them unusable for real time applications such as a control system decision support and training simulators 2 5 summary of broken ice structure interaction models table 1 summarizes all notable methodologies and methods

success of the models keywords ice structure interactions numerical modelling dynamic positioning empirical and analytical models real time simulations 1 introduction the interest in future oil and gas exploration in deep water arctic regions is expected to demand customized stationkeeping systems of particular interest are dynamic positioning dp capabilities for drill ships offshore supply ships floating production storage and offloading fpsos and icebreakers allowing them to operate under challenging sea ice drift conditions one of the greatest threats to the dp systems of ships and offshore installations is the multi directionality of drifting sea ice with a wide variety of types and forms ranging from isolated first year floes to compacted multi year ridges metrikin 2015 this issue is further complicated by the ice ship interaction process that depends on many complex and interconnected parameters and characteristics related to the ice field the ship and the surrounding environment metrikin 2014 analytical and numerical models and their validations using measurements are essential and a key to understanding the problem and designing both the floating and stationkeeping systems the operators have gained limited experience in real world stationkeeping in broken ice fields managed and unmanaged over the last few decades early experiences include the canmare dome drillship operations jolles et al 1989 the kulluk drilling campaigns wright 1999 and the sakhalin 2 phase 1 oil production operations that were using the floating storage and offloading tanker okha keinonen et al 2000 2006a 2006b for the first time in history dynamic positioning operations in ice were performed in the offshore sakhalin may june 1999 keinonen et al 2000 in support of compression diving the cso constructor performed the dynamic positioning operation in ice of a type b ice class ship with support from two icebreakers acting as an ice management team ice management has been an integral part of exploration and production activities in the arctic where stationkeeping is required rohlén 2009 discussed the relationship between ice management and stationkeeping in ice with specific references for some full scale efforts based on the experience in the arctic core expedition acex2004 and kanumas 2008 operations the author stressed the importance and relevance of ice management in stationkeeping of floating structures during oil and gas related activities in the arctic region impacts from unmanaged ice floes and changes in the ice drift direction were hazardous to the stationkeeping systems during the pioneering operations of the cso constructor keinonen et al 2000 and the vidar viking keinonen et al 2006a recently a dp operation was performed by the icebreaking rescue and emergency ship baltika equipped with the navis nav dp4000 dp system and the navis ap4000 heading control system autopilot in the kara sea navis engineering 2015 a majority of the researchers and operators above identified the need for developing prediction capabilities simulation technologies and training facilities for dp operations in heavy managed and unmanaged dynamic ice conditions before developing these technologies the current knowledge gap in understanding the magnitude and nature of ice actions encountered by the dp controlled drilling and production systems operating in broken ice fields need to be addressed several research and development projects were initiated worldwide to improve the understanding of ice structure interactions and enhance the capabilities of the existing stationkeeping systems hsva in germany led a 3 year 2010 2012 r d project titled dynamic positioning in ice covered waters dypic primarily aiming at developing and improving its numerical modelling and physical model testing capabilities of dp ships jenssen et al 2012 kerkeni et al 2014 norwegian university of science and technology ntnu led a five year 2010

project and developed a statistically reliable numerical model to predict in real time the ice actions encountered by stationkeeping ships due to the complex and dynamic ice ship interactions in different managed ice environments these projects resulted in multiple numerical tools for modelling the broken ice and floating structure interactions and contributed to the advancement of knowledge and understanding of the intricate ice structure interactions islam et al 2016 2018 besides the above endeavour several other methods have been developed for modelling the global ice loads on stationary and moving ships documentation on various numerical methods and their capabilities and limitations is expected to benefit the current and new researchers this encourages an effort to accumulate all existing research to better understand the effect of various ice field parameters on the performance of a stationkeeping structure and the ice structure interactions modelling endeavours this paper presents a comprehensive literature survey of publicly available ice structure interaction prediction models and research section 2 presented a summary of the detailed literature survey on various existing ice structure interaction models in the survey all methods are conveniently grouped into four categories a brief discussion is presented for each method highlighting their capabilities limitations and applicability for practical and real time simulations after this the authors present a summary of the methods in the context of several modelling aspects for practical and real time simulations of dp ships and broken ice interactions finally the authors present a few concluding remarks and a comprehensive list of references 2 literature survey of broken ice structure interaction models the accuracy and reliability of a modelling method depend on how accurately the most relevant ice structure interaction processes are modelled the design of a traditional ice structure numerical model typically addresses the most relevant physical property to the anticipated ice structure interaction modes typically a choice is made between bending and crushing for ice failure for the sloping ship bow and conical offshore platforms the bending failure of the ice sheet or large floe generally dominates over the other modes of failure lubbad and løset 2011 however the crushing failure dominates in the vertical sided structure hydrodynamic and viscosity effects are generally assumed to be relatively small in low speed interactions hence the reynolds law is usually ignored the ice structure interactions encountered during stationkeeping of ships and offshore platforms in the broken ice field have added complexity depending on the local geometrical configuration and relative velocity at the ice structure contact points the ice failure and subsequent load release can occur through local crushing buckling bending shearing splitting ridging rafting pure displacement or a mixture of two or more of the above failure modes after breaking from a large floe the smaller floes may accelerate rotate collide accumulate submerge and slide along the hull until they are cleared away the hydrodynamic interactions between the water ice structure may become relevant and significant during the broken ice and structure interactions particularly for high ice drifts on a stationary structure or for high advance speed of the structure through the stationary ice field also a dramatic change in ice ship interaction modes in the presence of brash ice and small ice floes has been observed and it is generally recommended that these effects are included in the model several numerical modelling efforts attempted to understand and model the ice interactions on a stationary or dp controlled moored stationkeeping floating structure or slowly maneuvering ships in managed or unmanaged broken ice over the last few decades kubat and sayed 2014 provided a brief literature survey on modelling and numerical simulation methods to investigate ice management related to ice structure interactions the authors noted a substantial increase in publications during 2009 2014 covering diverse subjects such as requirements for operational ice management systems ice basin testing of dp controlled ships reports on field trials and various numerical models to deal with aspects of stationkeeping and ice management metrikin 2015 provided a brief literature survey of different calculation methods for predicting ice forces on offshore structures the section presents a survey of publicly available ice structure interaction modelling methods categorized into four groups analytical methods empirical statistical methods numerical methods and hybrid methods the following sub sections present a summary of work on the sub sets of each group of methods with an emphasis on the methods highlights of the capabilities limitations and real time applicability 2 1 analytical methods analytical methods present mathematical or analytical solutions for each primary type of ice failure mode and ice movement events with consideration to the mechanics of ice interactions to predict ice actions on structures an analytical model generally takes into account the three primary limiting mechanisms of the ice load transfer to a structure namely the limiting driving force limiting momentum and limiting stress the limiting driving force and limiting momentum are computed using analytical empirical solutions and the limiting stress is computed by analyzing the salient interactions and the dominant modes of ice failure via closed form analytical solutions aboulazm 1989 pioneered the development of analytical models for simulating ship interactions with broken ice the author developed two analytical methods a micro model and a macro model to calculate the resistance of a ship in broken ice the micro model treats the ice as a collection of discrete elements impacting the ship and was stated to be suitable for ships advancing at moderate speeds in waters with relatively small concentrations of small ice floes and not suitable for either very slow speeds or very high ice concentrations the macro model treats the ice as a continuous domain with specified physical and mechanical properties and the ice load in this case is estimated based on the motion and drag of the ice fragments as they move away from the ship s path the macro model applies to relatively slow speeds in moderate concentrations of small ice floes another family of the analytical model is based on assuming plausible modes of ice failure upon encountering a ship e g breaking of ice wedges and friction due to ice sliding under the hull lubbad and løset 2011 used this approach to develop efficient simulations of ships transit through the ice gürtner et al 2012 later used the method to model managed ice forces on moored drillships this approach was also used to develop a model and simulations of ice interaction with moored structures by zhou et al 2013 and bonnemaire et al 2014 and 2015 tan et al 2013 and tan 2014 extended the approach to simulate 6 degrees of freedom motion of ships transiting through the ice both of these methods did not include the hydrodynamic effects of the broken ice researchers at the nrc ocre developed an ice hull interaction ihi model for real time simulations of ship maneuvering in level ice liu et al 2006 2008 liu 2009 lau 2011 the model was built on a detailed analysis of hull ice interaction mechanics using an analytical method and its numerical implementation the model incorporated multi failure ice modes and hydrodynamic effects and tracked the development of the broken ice channel ice flexural failure crushing and shear failure were modelled along with the breaking force buoyancy force and clearing force the hull was divided into ten or more segments and the global ice forces were calculated by vectorially adding the forces on the segments the hull ice contacts were calculated based on the ship motion and ice edge in time domain and the channel was tracked using a simple housekeeping method a flat plate model was used for the buoyancy force calculation both the viscous and inertial effects were incorporated into the clearing force the adoption of the analytical method yielded a short calculation time that is essential for real time simulator application since the forces were calculated at each new time increment of any prescribed motion the resulting simulation could respond to arbitrary control inputs and hence arbitrary maneuvers in ice the simple physical detail and short computation time make this method suitable for real time simulations the ihi model was validated using two planar motion mechanism pmm test series carried out with the canadian coast guard s terry fox and r class scale models lau 2011 a group of researchers in the norwegian university of science and technology ntnu trondheim norway investigated several ice sloping structure interaction processes primarily focusing on the fracture of ice floes using analytical means lu 2014 lu et al 2012a b c 2015a 2015b 2016 the researchers identified a knowledge gap regarding the fracture of a finite size ice floe in the context of ice structure interactions and studied several failure modes of a finite size ice floe the failure modes included an open ice condition such as 1 in plane splitting failure 2 out of plane flexural failure and 3 competition between different failure modes in the context of ice sloping structure interactions the research group proposed analytical solutions for each failure mode for ice floes of varying sizes and offered validation of using linear elastic fracture mechanics lefm to study an ice floe s splitting failure on an engineering scale the group used a method of combining both physical model tests and a theoretical model to study the ice force s spatial and temporal variations on a sloping structure under the influence of rubble accumulation lu 2014 they found that the presence of rubble accumulation increases the global ice resistance and the maximum value of ice resistance occurs in a location below the waterline which signifies the importance of the ice rotating process and rubble accumulation effect the research also revealed that an ice floe s confinement has a much more profound effect on increasing the force required to split an ice floe in comparison with the influence of floe geometry the researchers did not include the crushing failure which may be more prominent for vertical structures idrissova et al 2019 used a collision energy based method to predict ice loading on ships known as the popov method this method is fundamentally analytical however several coefficients related to the ship ice interaction process and the material properties of sea ice are determined empirically idrissova et al 2019 obtained a reasonable comparison with full scale ice ship interaction loads with specific combinations of the coefficients idrissova et al 2019 recommended future research is to address numerous unknowns related to the ship ice interaction and sea ice material properties such as the actual ship ice contact geometry and line load distribution in various types of a ship ice collisions 2 2 empirical statistical methods in empirical statistical methods a correlation between the global ice loads and prevalent ice and ship parameters is established using observations and analyses of full scale and model scale measurements in a purely statistical method generally a multi variate regression or a machine learning method is used for the correlation development in the semi empirical method expressions with coefficients are developed to correlate the control variable and the response functions the coefficient values are derived from measurements and observations a similar method using the popular design of experiment doe methods islam and lye 2008 is also used to extract the empirical relationship the doe method provides a straightforward methodology to encapsulate the global response of the ship to phenomenologically defined ice and ship states keinonen et al 1989 1991 1996 and 1998 and keinonen and robbins 1998 developed a pioneering empirical method for predicting ice structure interaction forces due to broken ice using the equivalent ice thickness method this method is based on empirical formulations for estimating the global ice forces from various parameters of the broken ice field once estimated the equivalent ice thickness can be inserted into the equations for the level ice resistance of a ship from keinonen and robbins 1998 the equivalent thickness heq for icebreakers

liferov 2014 also used the same method in the shtokman project spencer and molyneux 2009 woolgara and colbourne 2010 and wang et al 2010 developed empirical methods based on regression analyses of model tests performed in pack ice conditions wright 1999 croasdale and liferov 2009 palmer and croasdale 2013 derived empirical formulae from full scale measurements of the global ice forces on the kulluk platform woolgara and colbourne 2010 carried out extensive model tests with a moored offshore ship model and used the data to develop a regression model that included hull ice frictions ice

ice and ship variables that are expected to influence pack ice load however this formulation is used only for the forward orientation whereas stationkeeping operations can encounter changing drift angles arising from sudden changes in ice encroaching direction hence the model is needed to be generalized to apply to a ship of different drift angles e g in terms of fx and fy for the surge and sway directions respectively wang et al 2010 fitted data based on the design of experiments doe technology and multi regression mr analysis and proposed the following empirical formulation for estimating pack ice force from arbitrary floe encroaching direction 3 f x 817 03 1509 2 h 1621 2 c 9 7 2128 7 h c 0 28 h 0 095 c 353 4 h 2 527 0 c 2 0 002 2 v i 0 827 4 f y 10 2 11 h 1 34 c 4 21 1 21

experiment doe method based regression methods to develop empirical expressions between the time averaged global forces and various ice parameters using a model test dataset the analysis provided general insights into the most influential managed ice field parameters and combinations of parameters that significantly affect the global forces of a dynamically positioned ship through the work the authors illustrated how such a problem with a large number of variables could be systematically handled to develop an empirical model using a variety of modern statistical design of experiment tools which in turn can be used to understand the effects of various control parameters and their interactions on the response the primary advantage of the empirical methods is their numerical efficiency the ice force model adds almost no computational overhead to the real time simulations for ice structure interaction scenarios besides such methods would have short development and validation efforts and minimal integration complexity however this method provides only one value average or maximum or standard deviation of the ice loads for a specific ice structure scenario as such this method does not give interaction data for local force assessment as it pays no attention to the individual ice impact event thus limiting the visualization aspect this is inadequate for simulation of stationkeeping of dp ship because the dynamic properties of the ice force at each time step of the simulation are necessary as the control system must dynamically react to the changes in the imposed global ice forces there have been very few efforts to account for these deficiencies in the literature eik and aksnes 2010 used a max to mean ratios method to estimate the distribution of peak values of the global ice forces by combining an empirical formulation for the ice resistance of an icebreaking ship with the max mean ratios of the global ice forces measured in physical model tests eik and aksnes 2010 used this method for applications in level ice conditions and eik 2011 for managed ice conditions gash and millan 2012 have developed a machine vision analysis based system identification id method for extracting useful kinematic and dynamic information of ice pieces in ice structure interaction scenarios from videos recorded during physical model testing of stationkeeping of dp ship in managed ice conditions this machine vision based analysis uses a combination of segmentation edge intensity and morphological methods to produce accurate segmentation estimates for ice pieces it produced data of the ice field such as ice concentration number of ice pieces piece size position velocity rotation mass and momentum gash and millan 2012 used this method to correlate ice concentration with demand thrust for a dp controlled drillship model and found inconsistent correlation at low concentration the authors concluded that ice concentration alone is not capable of adequately describing the dynamics of the ice hull interactions additional ice parameters and their mutual interactions need to be considered even with the above enhancement the major shortcoming of the empirical statistical method is its lack of details of the floe dynamics this reduces the fidelity of visualization in the simulation further the representativeness of simulations using such a method is questionable because the imposed ice actions do not depend on the actual motion characteristics of the simulated ship i e the response of the ship to the ice loads and the coupled ice ship dynamics are not taken into account furthermore the method does not consider any dynamic inertial or damping effects from the ice therefore it may be difficult to extend this method beyond the boundaries of the particular scenario that served as the basis for the empirical formulation metrikin 2015 a significant improvement of this method is required before it can be considered suitable for time domain simulations of dp ships in ice operations 2 3 computational numerical methods computational methods often known as numerical methods are primarily based on the fundamental laws of physics computational methods have been proven to be useful for solving complex interaction processes hence researchers have applied them for ice structure interaction problems over the last few decades in contrast to the empirical statistical and analytical studies the literature of numerical modelling efforts for ice structure interactions in broken ice is extensive such a model naturally produces the time series of the ice structure interaction responses of a stationkeeping ship and can be coupled with its dp control system in a closed loop therefore these can be readily used in the simulations for performance assessment of the ship in ice as well as for testing the robustness of dp control systems metrikin 2015 there are multiple categories of numerical models based on a variety of tactics and targeting different aspects of ship ice interaction research two fundamentally different simulation methods are frequently consulted that deal with the broken ice characteristics and granular properties of ice the first method considers ice as discrete particles elements or the assembly of discrete elements each element particle or the assembly of elements has the properties of ice and the interactions between other elements structures or medium represent the behaviour of ice this method can be generally called the discrete element method dem the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method is also a particle based method which has recently been used for numerical modelling of ice and structure interactions the second method considers ice as a continuum material such as the finite element method fem finite difference method fdm finite volume method fvm and also the particle in cell pic method these methods have been widely applied in simulating the behaviour of structures and fluids recently these methods attracted many researchers to go beyond their traditional applications and use them to address unique ice failure problems such as ice crushing discontinuity or large deformation this section surveys the latest applications of these numerical methods that are most relevant in terms of modelling ice forces on floating structures and stationkeeping in broken ice 2 3 1 discrete element method dem discrete element method dem simulations as initially formulated by cundall and strack 1979 have been applied to modelling ice structure interaction related problems since the mid 1980s typical dem simulations consist of a few hundred up to a few thousand interacting ice blocks each element can have its material properties density elasticity flexural and compressive strengths the geometric shapes such as 3 dimensional disks spheres or polyhedral elements can represent the ice element lu et al 2014 tuhkuri and polojärvi 2018 provided a review of the use of dem in studying ice structure interaction with emphasis on the lessons learned about the behaviour of sea ice as a discontinuous medium the review emphasized the engineering applications of the method more than on the development of the method itself according to the authors the use of dem appears most beneficial in cases where modelling of discrete ice blocks is required two types of ice models are typically used firstly modelling an ice floe as one elementary element which can be defined by different geometric forms and is a solid with volume mass elastic modulus the elements are unbreakable hence the crushing or flexural bending failure mechanisms are not modelled secondly individual elements can be bound together to model an inhomogeneous or breakable level ice sheet or a large ice floe katsuragi et al 1997 the gluing strength is generally related to the crushing and flexural bending strength of ice each step of the dynamic simulation loop in the dem typically consists of three sub steps collision detection interaction force computation and time integration element motion calculation the contact detection is the most time consuming process on a given time step the contact forces and external forces acting on each block are solved fig 1 the dem simulates the ice element dynamics by implementing several contact algorithms canelas et al 2015 2016 the interaction forces can include the normal and tangential forces gravity hydrostatic hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces ice ice and ice structure collisions are typically modelled as linear spring damper systems whereas coulombic friction is considered for tangential sliding newton s second law is used to determine the accelerations and a numerical integration scheme of choice is used to update the velocities and positions of each block the motions of an element are calculated based on the force and momentum on each element for each time step these three processes are repeated different researchers have used dem to model ice interaction with fixed or moored floating structures løset 1994a b used a 2 dimensional dem method to simulate the dynamics and interaction forces between distinct unbreakable ice floes circular variable sizes and a pile in a broken ice field hansen and løset 1999a b used a similar model to examine ice action against moored offshore units the same method was used by karulina 2010 2011 to simulate a tanker moored to a production platform by karulin and karulina 2013 to simulate a semisubmersible in broken ice and by karulin and karulina 2014 to simulate a multi leg platform in broken ice richard and mckenna 2013 modelled the dynamics of a broken ice field and the displacements of a stationkeeping ship in the horizontal plane using a two dimensional dem the commercial dem code decice which is owned by oceanic consulting corporation based in newfoundland canada is frequently used by the researchers at the nrc ocre and at memorial university of newfoundland mun to study a variety of problems related to ice structure interactions in level and broken ice fields since the 1990s this software has been used extensively for simulating the behaviour of turret moored tankers in pack ice murray and spencer 1997 the manoeuvring of ships in ice lau 2006 lau and simões ré 2006 lau et al 2011 zhan et al 2010 zhan and molyneux 2012 and pack ice forces on floating offshore oil and gas exploration systems liu et al 2010 ji et al 2013 used a dem based software to simulate the interaction between drifting ice floes and a moving ship the authors used three dimensional 3 d dilated disk elements to model the pancake ice floes with considering the buoyancy drag force and additional mass induced by the current ji et al 2015 investigated the interaction between ice cover and conical offshore structures using dem and determined the dynamic ice forces under different structure parameters and ice conditions the authors modelled the ice cover by dispersing a series of bonded spherical elements with the parallel bonding model to investigate the influences of ice velocity ice thickness and conical angle on ice forces zhou and peng 2014 developed a numerical method to simulate the ice induced forces acting on the ship and the performance of a dynamically controlled ship operating in level ice in which the interaction between the ship and the ice was considered by adopting a 2 d dem subsequently dai and peng 2015a developed a numerical model of dp ship operating in a pack ice field using a two dimensional dem dai and peng 2015b analyzed and presented selected simulation results of different dp ship ice interaction scenarios prasanna and hissette 2018 presented a simulation tool for simulating the transit of ships through brash ice channels based on the dem the authors achieved a consistent behaviour of the ice particles near the structure see fig 2 however ice forces on the structure exhibited some discrepancies the cause for high ice forces is identified to be deficiencies in modelling the behaviour of far field ice particles in the current tool the simulation tends to overestimate the particle motions in far field due to the deficiencies in the implemented friction model cundall strack friction in recent years the dem has been extended to the analysis of continuum media the so called bonded dem celigueta et al 2017 implemented a bonded dem to study multi fracture and failure of solids involving geomaterials and concrete jou et al 2019 investigated broken ice interactions with moving structures representing ice breaking ships and cones by using a local bonded dem through several bonded dem simulations the authors provided some insights on the most frequently encountered ice infested scenarios the main characteristics of ice breaking ships and the predicted failure modes of floe ice depending on the loading conditions the structure type and the ice feature dimensions and thickness 2 3 2 non smooth dem ndem or physically based modelling pbm the non smooth dem ndem may be considered as a branch of the classical dem in which efficient contact detection and force calculation algorithms are used and which is developed for fast and accurate enough modelling of physical phenomena this modelling method is also known as physically based modelling radjaï and richefeu 2009 hedman 2011 and metrikin and løset 2013 in this method commercial and or publicly available open source physics engines are generally used to detect the contacts among all simulated bodies calculate the contact forces and time integrate the dynamical systems of equations although this method is relatively new in ice research and engineering it has already been used by several researchers in various institutions in the world particularly for developing real time simulators for ice structure interaction modelling the pbm or ndem method for ice structure interaction modelling was pioneered by konno and mizuki 2006a b and was developed further in their subsequent publications 2007 konno and yoshimoto 2008 konno 2009 konno and saitoh 2010 konno et al 2011a b konno et al 2013 ishibashi et al 2014 uto et al 2015 sawamura and kioka 2016 and the research group s previous works referred directly to this method and used similar concepts for simulating the rotation sliding and submergence of ice floes along the hull of a ship after the floes break off from level ice sawamura 2012 2014 sawamura et al 2015 sawamura and tachibana 2011 similar methods were used by lubbad and løset 2011 and berglund 2012 to simulate a ship in level ice by gürtner et al 2012 and amdahl et al 2014 to simulate a moored drillship in managed ice and by metrikin et al 2013 and 2015 to simulate dp in managed ice metrikin et al 2012 studied four open source physics engines agx multiphysics open dynamics engine physx and vortex in terms of integration performance and contact detection accuracy documentation quality and the level of technical support for possible applications in the real time simulation of stationkeeping of a floater in broken ice conditions metrikin 2014 developed a software package for simulation of stationkeeping of a ship in discontinuous ice using multiple physics engines gürtner et al 2012 used a real time simulation system to investigate ice loading and moored drillship responses in drifting managed ice different levels of ice management were represented in terms of ice concentration floe size distribution and ice thickness the results were compared with model scale experiments for a ship transiting in level ice metrikin and loset 2013 simulated a model test conducted in a towing tank that calculated the surge force in pack ice statoil and multiconsult inc jointly developed a numerical model based on the ndem method called sibis which is an acronym for simulation of interaction between broken ice and structures it was initially developed to create a numerical environment for efficient simulations of floating structures in discontinuous i e broken ice conditions in the time domain metrikin et al 2015a the numerical model estimates local and global ice actions on ships and offshore structures and the corresponding structural response in the time domain metrikin et al 2015b serre et al 2019 further developed the sibis to improve simulation capabilities of broken ice interaction with offshore structures to represent better the brash ice effects on the ice floes and the dynamicity of the load signal the authors illustrated the software capabilities by carrying out several benchmark test simulations and post simulation exercise of two interaction events recorded during full scale stationkeeping trials with a moored ship in drifting ice cover fig 3 presents a realistic vessel in broken ice fields simulations carried out in sibis where the ice fields were divided into two parts a near field area of managed ice and a far field area where the floes were unmanaged metrikin et al 2015a the physics engine based discrete element method is also utilized in a new ice simulation tool developed in france for simulating ice structure interactions of arctic offshore platforms septseault et al 2014 2015 dudal et al 2015 technip in collaboration with cervval and bureau veritas bv developed the ice modelling simulation program called ice star cambos 2014 the numerical tool has been developed further recently to incorporate a multi agent technology with the possibility to combine in a common framework multiple phenomena from various natures and heterogeneous scales i e drag friction ice sheet bending failure local crushing and rubble stack up cahay et al 2017 this is now known as the ice mass www ice mas com cahay et al 2017 presented the overall functionalities of ice mas and the different possibilities to model a semi submersible floater with different geometries subject to ice sheet loading through different incidence angles huisman et al 2016 developed a numerical model to predict the interaction between floating objects and the surrounding level ice only modelling the icebreaking due to bending lubbad et al 2018 introduced a numerical simulator sams simulator for arctic marine structures for structures in various ice conditions such as level ice broken ice and ice ridges sams is primarily based on the ndem with an implicit time stepping scheme and an improved contact model enabling general visco elastic contacts sams considers the contact crushing force and the force penetration gradient leading to more accurate contact force predictions as illustrated in berg et al 2018 also sams adopts an analytical framework that supplements the ndem method with analytical closed form solutions to simulate the fracture of sea ice the different modules described above were developed over many years by several researchers at ntnu at that stage many attempts were also made to validate each module against available full scale and lab scale data lu et al 2015a 2015b lu et al 2016c tsarau and løset 2015 tsarau et al 2014 van den berg et al 2018 showed that the proposed time stepping scheme predicts well the sheltering effects directionality and order of magnitude of ice loads on a 4 legged vertical walled structure in ice tank tests tsarau et al 2018 simulated several available experimental case studies from the field and ice tanks using sams for validation purposes berg et al 2019a 2019b investigated the effect of floe shape on the load experienced by vertical sided structures using a 2d non smooth dem ndem which is an adapted version of the simulator for arctic marine structures sams model hasegawa et al 2019 proposed a numerical simulation method by a non smooth discrete element method and used a fixed joint function available in the bullet physics engine to model breakable ice elements consisting of small square rigid bodies to represent ice failure the authors showed that the breakable ice elements reasonably reduce peak loads to the experimental results and ice ice friction was one of the most important tuning parameters for modelling ice failure in their model in a recent endeavour the national research council canada developed an ndem based numerical simulation model leveraging the bullet physics engine to model rigid and breakable ice elements consisting of randomly shaped polygons to represent managed and unmanaged ice fields the authors implemented new algorithms for modelling buoyancy and developed techniques to simulate ice dp ship interactions in an infinite loop pearson et al 2019 several challenges in using the commercial open source physics engine can be identified based on the experience of various researchers besides the limitations of modelling various ice failure modes such as crushing bending and splitting both static and dynamic frictions need correct modelling it is believed to be the most significant contributor to energy dissipation during icebreaking clearing ice rafting and ice ridging events the fluid modelling capabilities are another crucial aspect when choosing an engine for the numerical simulation of the floater ice interaction moreover the maneuvering characteristics of the slowly moving hull needs to be modelled correctly which are often ignored in the physics engine based modelling 2 3 3 finite element method fem in the finite element method fem simulation of the interaction between ice and structures the ice is described as a continuum material based on a constitutive model taking on the challenge to reliably simulate the complicated ice mechanical properties and ice failure mechanisms following continuum mechanics fem is one of the most powerful numerical methods and the industry has widely applied it in simulating the behaviour of structures the application of fem to the broken ice and structure interaction problems is significantly increased in recent times recent efforts by several ice experts in applying this numerical method to the ice structure interaction problems are discussed below through a survey of fem based ice models the majority of researchers favouring the fem method to model ice structure interactions in broken ice conditions use either ls dyna or ansys as their modelling tool both packages provide arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale technology to simulate better the multi medium interactions such as the hydrodynamic effects to the solid body motions wang and derradji aouat 2010 2011 millan and wang 2011 kim et al 2013 lee et al 2013 and kim et al 2014 have reported applications of the fem to the problem of simulating a ship in broken ice fields these researchers employed the commercial fem package ls dyna and the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method to calculate the hydrodynamic forces and ice structure interaction forces on a ship in broken ice numerically however the ice pieces were considered unbreakable in those studies lobanov 2011 developed an alternative fem method which considered the material behaviours of both the ice and the floater in addition to the ale formulation using the ansys package wang and derradji aouat 2011 simulated a downward breaking conical structure kulluk in pack ice condition using an explicit fem the authors studied the effect of floe concentration and floe shapes on the forces on the structure for the high concentration 80 numerical results showed a slightly higher average value due to ice accumulation see fig 4 the authors recommended using deformable and more realistic floe shape for future studies several research activities on the ice failure modes modelling are available in the public domain gagnon 2011 proposed to model ice with the general purpose commercial software ls dyna using a hard crushable foam type of constitutive material model this model was used to calculate the impact force due to the ice indentation in a bergy bit collision with a ship the author and his research group developed the crushable foam model to simulate the ice pressure in the crushing process of the ice the simulation results showed the cyclic saw tooth force events and pressure distributions that are roughly characteristic of observed local ice crushing failure behaviour applications and validation of this method are published in the works by gagnon and derradji aouat 2006 gagnon and wang 2012a and in gagnon and wang 2012b gao et al 2014 used a similar method to study the iceberg geometry effect on the collision process with a fixed structure nisja 2014 used four material models available in ls dyna to investigate the force displacement history of brittle failure in sea ice and concluded that all material models had resulted in the right order of magnitude and was optimistic about finding an existing material model that can give satisfactory results for interaction between ice and structures except for the work of wang and derradji aouat 2011 no validations or calibrations of fem simulations against full scale data have been reported for the case of a structure in drifting sea ice several researchers in europe and asia investigated the use of bonded particles to provide a reasonable representation of various ice failures modes of quasi brittle sea ice allowing for fracture crushing and flexural bending failure often termed as the cohesive element method cem the cohesive fracture laws and cohesive finite elements are used to formulate the nonlinear dynamic ice structure interactions in this method the ice sheet is modelled using bulk elements which are connected by zero thickness cohesive elements the cohesive elements are deleted once their energy to resist crack formation is fully consumed while the bulk elements retained in the system account for crushing and progressive rubbling of the ice fragments although the method is physics based leading to the better potential for acceptability a coherent guideline for the numerical inputs is still lacking zhang et al 2019b another fem based model is the extended fem xfem which is a relatively new method to model crack initiation and propagation in materials xfem is theoretically a mesh independent method which allows the crack to propagate through the element without remeshing this is achieved by enriching the solution space for solutions to differential equations with discontinuous functions in abaqus standard 2017 xfem is an available method allowing the modelling of crack growth using either a cohesive segment method or linear elastic fracture mechanics lefm hilding et al 2008 provided an overview of the cem for ice modelling including recent improvements made by the authors konuk et al 2009a b c developed a framework incorporating dynamic crack propagation and continuum mechanics for modelling ice structure interaction processes using the cem the authors presented a number of case studies to demonstrate the application of cem for modelling ice structure interaction processes konuk and yu 2010 gürtner 2009 developed a computational cohesive element model ccem method using finite element discretization in combination with cohesive elements and the cohesive zone model czm for fracture the author implemented the model into the finite element program ls dyna to study some aspects of dynamic ice structure interaction and analyze the dynamics of a structure resulting from ice loading as a coupled non linear dynamical system daiyan and sand 2011 utilized the czm to model ice fracture and fluid structure interaction fsi to model a more realistic boundary condition of a drifting ice sheet and implemented the models in ls dyna to simulate the problems related to ice sloping structure interactions lu et al 2012 investigated the czm to simulate both the fracturing and upcoming fragmentation of level ice lu et al 2012 tested the traditional finite element method with element erosion methods the cohesive element method cem the discrete element method dem with cohesive contacts and the extended finite element method xfem in simulating the ice sloping structure interactions feng et al 2016 developed a 3d finite element model with the use of the cem in ls dyna for simulating ice structure interaction in relatively recent research xu et al 2019 proposed a three dimensional constitutive ice model with nonlinear viscoelastic and plastic components the authors implemented the material model in the commercial software ls dyna as a user defined material and verified the viscoelastic plastic and brittle behaviour of ice through a series of experiments zhang et al 2019b investigated various shapes of the bulk constitutive law and found that the softening response had a considerable influence on the corresponding ice induced forces for simulations involving the crushing failure of the ice sheet the authors recommended to carefully model the post yield aspect of the bulk constitutive law to predict the ice induced forces accurately li et al 2020 proposed a novel method to model ship ice interaction to be applied to ship scale simulations xfem with lefm is used to identify and characterize the bending cracks and simplified the crushing process the hydrodynamic effect is neglected and the water is modelled as an elastic foundation the xefm based simulation provides insights into the observed failure mode wang et al 2020 used fem based arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method and penalty function offered in ls dyna to simulate the navigation of an ice area bulk carrier in broken ice fields where the ice material was defined as elastic the authors confirmed that the movements of ice floes in the simulation were consistent with those in the model test as shown in fig 5 the authors also achieved less than 15 percentage deviation of the numerical ice resistance from the ice resistance in the model test the authors recommended improving this method by incorporating ice failure modes and using an improved hydrodynamic model for more realistic modelling of the three phase ship ice water coupling among all these numerical methods the element erosion method turns out to be the most efficient method the cem can capture a stabilized icebreaking force but the whole structure appears to be softened with increasing cohesive element density the dem with cohesive contact alleviates us from the structural softening problem but it is so computationally expensive that only limited simulations and conclusions are made the xfem needs to be tested with various applications and validation using full scale ice structure interaction data the majority of the fem applications to ice problems have been focused on modelling ice properties to simulate better the failure modes such as the use of exotic material modelling for spalling or fracture failures these failures directly affect the local forces on structures while the focus for the floating structures is global responses expanding the application to modelling the ice floes structure and the fluid domain in a fine mesh to predict the global ice forces on floating structures accurately maybe by the computational expense performing this simulation in real time for applications of dp in broken ice simulation is beyond the possible range of current hardware capability 2 3 4 particle in cell pic method the particle in cell pic method solves the stresses velocities and deformation distributions of an ice field by solving equations of conservation of mass and linear momentum together with constitutive equations that represent ice properties those properties are introduced through a failure envelope that incorporates the tensile shear and compressive strengths solving those equations gives the evolution of the distributions of stresses deformation thickness concentration or coverage and velocities of the ice cover the method takes advantage of both eulerian and lagrangian descriptions to address large deformations more naturally thereby avoiding the mesh lock up problems encountered in the fem sayed et al 2012 2014 2015 three dimensional simulations can be used to investigate the details of ice failure and clearing near the structure or depth averaged simulations can be used where the primary concern is the deformation of the ice cover over the vast area pic based software was developed at the nrc ocre and adapted to simulate ice management and stationkeeping problems over the last two decades some applications of the pic based method in simulating ice structure interactions include but are not limited to the work on ice forces on bridge piers barker et al 2000a 2002 ice forces on fixed offshore structures kamesaki et al 2000 vachon et al 2012 barker and sayed 2012 barker et al 2014 ice forces on moored and thruster assisted drillships including the kulluk drillship barker et al 2000b sayed and barker 2011 sayed et al 2012 2014 2015 and ice forces on a newly designed floating structure iyerusalimskiy et al 2012 in a recent endeavour sayed et al 2017 carried out a comparison study between results from ice basin tests and numerical simulations the study examined the dynamic positioning dp of a ship in managed ice conditions at a scale of 1 40 the pic based numerical tool was used to simulate several representative ice basin test conditions the resulting pressure mean normal stress distributions and positions of the ship are shown at an interval in fig 6 the distributions show that high pressures occur around the bow as may be expected the packing of the floes causes the distributions to show some irregularity or tree branch like patterns as was reported in previous studies e g sayed et al 2016 the results indicate that surge direction thrust and moments are in good agreement sayed et al 2018 illustrated how to assess acceptable ice conditions for ship stationkeeping in pack ice using the pic based methods islam et al 2019 used the pic based ice dynamics model idm to simulate a representative full scale scenario of the dynamic positioning of an ice management ship this work indicates that numerical simulations can predict the full scale stationkeeping scenarios with reasonable accuracy 2 3 5 smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method is a mesh free lagrangian particle method in which the state of a system is represented by a set of particles which possess individual material properties and move according to the given conservation equations field properties such as velocity and stress are evaluated at the particle positions and no finite differences or grids are necessary similar to pic based methods the most attractive feature of the sph method is its ability to handle problems with considerable deformations this method offers a natural advantage over traditional grid based methods for problems especially related to fracture collapse or fragmentation for an accurate sph simulation uniformly sized particles are required throughout the model and as such if high accuracy is required in such simulations long run time can be a problem sph is a powerful tool for the simulation of systems characterized by the rheology of mohr coulomb type it has essential advantages compared to standard finite differences methods when applied to problems involving both frictional solid surfaces and free surfaces this type of rheological behaviour can be found in ice broken fields and in numerous problems in the field of quasi static granular flows gutfraind and savage 1997 the spalling of ice for instance is an ice structure interaction event that can be reproduced by an sph simulation keegan et al 2013 investigated the hailstone impact on the leading edge of a wind turbine s blade pan et al 2012 developed a new sph model for coupled ice sheet and ice shelf dynamics the authors studied ice sheet ice shelf behaviour and the dynamics of the grounding line in which the ice is modelled as a viscous newtonian fluid typically ice sheets are modelled as a non newtonian fluid accounting for the changes in the mechanical properties of the ice implementation of non newtonian rheology in the sph model is the subject of ongoing research das et al 2014 modelled the sea ice in four point bending for flexural strength testing using the sph method to predict the force displacement and failure time of an ice piece and found a good comparison with the available literature das and ehlers 2015 simulated bending and crushing failure of sea ice on a local scale using sph ryszard 2017 presents a smoothed particle hydrodynamics model for modelling sea ice dynamic phenomena occurring on geophysical scales cabrera 2017 used an open source sph implementation for solving a single phase granular flow that represents brash ice behaviour as it interacts with a moving cylinder the author compared the model predictions with experimental data obtained from a cylinder resistance test conducted in the hsva ice tank facilities in the comparison the granular behaviour of the brash ice was captured correctly and the velocity field visual comparison was regarded as reasonably good see fig 7 zhang et al 2019 integrated the drucker prager yield criterion based softening elastoplastic model into the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method to simulate the ice failure process and ice ship interactions after satisfactory validation against standard benchmarking tests the authors employed the extended sph method to simulate level ice interacting with sloping structure and three dimensional ice ship interaction in level ice 2 3 6 gpu event mechanics gem method a research group at the memorial university of newfoundland canada developed a gpu event mechanics gem modelling method to simulate broken ice actions on ships daley et al 2012 2014 alawneh 2014 alawneh et al 2015 the main idea of this method is to treat ice as a set of discrete objects with specific properties and to model the system mechanics mainly as a set of discrete contact and failure events a set of simulation domains each containing hundreds of discrete and interacting ice floes is modelled the model focuses on the event sequence rather than on the continuum mechanics of a single event this method is called the ice event mechanics modelling iemm method which builds a system solution from a large set of discrete events occurring between a broad set of discrete objects each event forms a step in developing the results and creates the initial conditions for the next event the event sequence is a nonlinear process and does not lend itself to an easy analytical description a simple ship is modelled as it navigates through the domains each ship ice collision is modelled as is every ice ice contact see fig 8 it is claimed that the gem methodology allows the simulations to be performed much faster than real time which may be attributed to the simplicity of the ice ice and ice structure interaction modelling method the physical processes modelled may need enhancement to provide more realistic simulations the research group is currently implementing additional functions for future development including the flexural floe edge failure rafting floe splitting and ridge building 2 4 hybrid numerical methods researchers have been developing methods to integrate multiple numerical methods tightly coupled or loosely coupled to handle the high complexity of ice structure interaction phenomena one such example is the coupling of dem with the fem method the classical dems are suited for problems governed by limit energy and perhaps limit force mechanisms but not for the problems where the limit stress is essential researchers overcome this shortcoming by combining dem with the fem where the latter is used to simulate the fracture of ice floes a fem dem model was developed in house by the department of applied mechanics at aalto university in finland paavilainen et al 2009 2011 paavilainen and tuhkuri 2012 2013 paavilainen 2013 polojärvi and tuhkuri 2009 2010 2013 2014 polojärvi 2013 ranta et al 2014 paavilainen et al 2009 2011 used a combined fem dem to describe an ice structure interaction vroegrijk 2015 used a hybrid cfd dem model to predict the added resistance due to brash ice and compared the results with measured data the american bureau of shipping abs has recently invested in developing a graphic processing unit gpu based on a discrete element method dem model for developing practical and advanced tools to assess the ice forces on offshore structures liu et al 2016 this arrangement processes the computations in parallel and solves the dem model with millions of particles for complicated ice structure interaction problems e g ice simultaneously loading on multiple legs and ice loading on a large csdu liu et al 2016 liu et al 2016 presented details of the developing abs gpu dem tool status of the verification program plans for the current and future developments and applications gutfraind and savage 1998 presented computer simulations of the wind driven motion of fractured ice in a wedge shaped channel by combining dem with sph to model the ice blocks or floes and to solve continuum equations for flow of fractured ice respectively duchting 2018 investigated a fem an sph and a combined fem sph method to deal with the physical effects of crushed ice that formed during a compression test the author compared the results of a fem sph simulation to the results of a simulation without sph with the measurements of ultimate strength and the behaviour of an ice specimen in compression the author claimed to have proven the ability of the fem sph method to model the transformation of the material and to handle large deformation with more realistic interface pressure and stress distribution see fig 9 mintu and molyneux 2018 presented a method of coupling an open sourced sph with three dimensional dem code to model several scenarios of ships and offshore structures interacting with pack ice taking into account the hydrodynamic effects the effect of modelling ice pieces a rigid body on the responses was not discussed and no validation of the predictions was offered li et al 2019 used analytically derived differential equations and finite difference method fdm to numerically solve the ice failure including icebreaking patterns and ice bearing capacity of ships going through level ice lemström et al 2019 2020 used two dimensional combined fem dem simulations to investigate the effect of water depth and ice thickness on peak ice load magnitudes on a wide inclined offshore structure in shallow water the authors carried out a probabilistic analysis on the extensive amount of simulation results to evaluate the probability of rubble pile grounding the rubble pile geometries and the load transmission from the intact ice sheet to the structure through the ice rubble pile luo et al 2020 presented a cfd dem coupling numerical method to study the ship resistance of a certain type of ice strengthened panama bulk carrier in the brash ice channel the authors compared the numerical results with the measurements carried out at the hsva ice tank the authors showed that the cfd dem coupling numerical method took a full account of the effect of ship water and the interaction between fluid and particles with an average error within 6 for all cases studied more research is required to model the brash ice more accurately and to improve numerical efficiency huang et al 2020 used cfd and dem to simulate the ship wave ice interaction in arctic ice conditions the authors applied fvm based cfd to obtain fluid solutions for the floes and incorporated it with the dem to govern ice motions and account for ship ice ice ice collisions the authors compared the model predictions using model basin measurements and carried out a series of simulations are performed to investigate how the resistance is influenced by ship speed ice concentration ice thickness and floe diameter this work appears to be the first work that includes ship generated waves and ice piece interactions see fig 10 this method accounts for the relevant hydrodynamics of the ice pieces however the ice pieces were modelled as rigid bodies hence the wave ice interactions may require further validation and improvement to incorporate the relevant ice failure modes the computational complexity of the majority of the above models renders them unusable for real time applications such as a control system decision support and training simulators 2 5 summary of broken ice structure interaction models table 1 summarizes all notable methodologies and methods to the authors best knowledge developed and utilized by various research organizations to model the ice structure interaction scenarios the capabilities low or moderate or high of each of the methods in the following categories are also presented in the table the capabilities and limitations of each of the methods are provided based on the authors best judgement real time calculation numerical efficiency implementation and integration complexity closeness to the actual physical processes of ice structure interactions realistic visualization information validation requirements simulation dimensions 3d 2d 1d note not all the methods listed can model ice structure interaction with the relevant reliability and accuracy the empirical and statistical methods often show high numerical efficiency and ease of integration however they do not model the relevant physical processes accurately hence these methods should not be considered where closeness to physical processes is the most important the fem pic classic dem 3d cfd and sph do not possess high numerical efficiency and are often deemed unsuitable where the real time prediction capability is required often the hybrid modelling methods are adopted to compensate for the deficiencies of one method by another this may be why there is a recent increasing trend in research on hybrid methods to model ice structure interactions regardless of the methods adopted the availability and quality of measured data is paramount to the success of the ice structure interaction models although researchers have made considerable progress in analytical empirical and numerical methods the lack of high quality physical model tests and full scale measurements in the public domain for a thorough validation adversely impacts confidence in the modelling some of the methods have been validated against physical ice model tests and to some extent against full scale measurements more full scale validations are essential for building confidence in the methods for accurately predicting ice structure interaction forces for the ships and offshore platforms in full scale operations 3 concluding remarks this paper presents a comprehensive survey of all published ice structure modelling research primarily in the context of their applications to predict the ice structure interactions of ships or floating platforms with broken ice fields in this survey the existing methods are categorized into four groups analytical methods empirical statistical methods numerical methods and hybrid methods discussions are presented on the sub sets of each group of references with an emphasis on the capabilities limitations and applicability of the method for a realistic and real time simulation application not all the methods surveyed can model ice structure interaction with the relevant reliability and accuracy the empirical and statistical methods often show high numerical efficiency and ease of integration however they do not accurately model the relevant physical processes hence these methods should not be considered where closeness to physical processes is the most important the fem pic classic dem 3d cfd and sph do not possess high numerical efficiency and are often deemed unsuitable when the real time prediction capability is required the hybrid modelling methods to combine two or multiple methods are adopted to compensate for the deficiencies of one method by another this may be why there is a recent increasing trend in using hybrid methods to model ice structure interactions regardless of the methods adopted validations with quality measurements is paramount to the success of the ice structure interaction models although researchers have made much progress in analytical
