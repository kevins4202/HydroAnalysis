13095,aquaculture activities surge tremendously worldwide and intensively shifted the landscape of food consuming across the globe as the fish catch production from natural environment has reached its limit the public has begun to rely on farmed aquatic products for continuity of protein sources the aquaculture industry is currently dominated by asia and has evolved into multiple configurations to increase fish production nonetheless the constituent in aquaculture wastewater mainly from fish feed and other pharmaceutical substances have raised public concern as those constituents are potent to jeopardize surrounding environment when released into the ecosystem in order to minimize the impact of aquaculture wastewater rigorous researches have been proposed and conducted to effectively treat aquaculture effluent a thorough treatment mechanisms have been covered of which the recirculation aquaculture system ras is the most extensively implemented other technologies introduced include biological physical and chemical treatments this review covers an in depth analysis of these technologies including their pros and cons treatment efficacies and process intensifications bioreactor bio floc wetlands and phytoremediation are among the biological treatment methods revealed in the discussion while the physiochemical section encompassed an overview of adsorption advanced oxidation processes aops and membranes technologies future recommendations are proposed in terms of aquaculture regulations to ensure sustainable aquaculture development graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aquaculture environmental conservations wastewater treatment regulations 1 introduction the necessity of aquatic farming has risen as a consequence of an increasing world population because the fish catch production has reached its limits in 2017 aquaculture accounted for 67 7 of the total fisheries production reaching a staggering 53 million tons 1 compared to 2000 production of aquaculture has increased significantly there was merely 20 8 million tons in 2000 accounting for only 26 3 of the total aquatic production 1 to cope with the increasing demand for fish and other aquatic products aquaculture activities have been intensified which has led to a more intense competition for the fundamental needs of aquaculture development such as land water and natural resources 2 aquaculture activities are usually carried out in a controlled environments not limited to fish farming but also includes mollusks crustaceans shrimps and many other aquatic species 3 in addition to meeting global food demand the aquaculture industry also brings a positive impact to the economy by providing more employment opportunities according to nasr allah et al 4 and ottinger et al 5 the aquaculture industry directly or indirectly creates approximately 23 million full time jobs especially in developing countries the most cultivated aquatic species is freshwater fish which account for 56 of the total aquaculture production followed by mollusks and crustaceans at 23 and 10 respectively 5 from the analysis of the geographical distribution of the production of the top 10 aquaculture species it can be seen that asian countries particularly china dominates the production which account for around 53 of the total global output 5 however the rapid development of aquaculture has led to land subsidence and mangrove destruction the most critical issue is that it seriously pollutes the surrounding water bodies and has a negative impact on the environment 5 wastewater containing large amount of nutrients suspended solids 6 chemicals and pharmaceutical products 7 are often discharged from the aquatic species farms in view of the escalating urge to mitigate the adverse effects of aquaculture on the environment various treatment technologies have emerged treatment technologies introduced involved either biological or physicochemical treatment mechanisms biological methods use microorganisms to break down pollutants physical treatment usually involves separating contaminants from the aquaculture wastewater in their original form adsorption 8 membranes 9 and coagulation 10 are examples of the physical separation applications as for chemical treatment process undesired substances are degraded into by products to minimize the harmful effects on the environment when the wastewater is discharged the degradation of constituents often achieved through advanced oxidation process which can transform parent compounds into miscellaneous by products through a series of chemical reactions rather than standalone biological or physicochemical treatments the wastewater purification operation performances can also be enhanced through integration of different modes of treatment mechanisms through process integration the degradation and separation of the harmful substances are performed simultaneously to achieve better treatment efficiency with the information gathered it is certain that the further growth of the aquaculture industry is inevitable hence in depth understandings and researches of aquaculture wastewater treatment technologies are crucial nonetheless a thorough review of aquaculture wastewater treatment technology is still scarce therefore this review serves the purpose to close the review gaps in assembling available treatment technologies for aquaculture effluent the current aquaculture landscape and the impact of aquaculture on the ecosystem will be outlined to emphasize the importance of wastewater treatment followed by the reviews of treatment technologies the treatment mechanisms advantages disadvantages and efficacies of the treatment methods will be disclosed lastly recommendations for sustainable aquaculture development were summarized to ensure that the ecosystem is protected despite having to cope with surging growth of the fish farming activities 2 current aquaculture landscape aquaculture is becoming more prevalent globally due to the increasing demand for food to address the nutritional imbalance of the population 11 several countries have started to improve their food security by establishing different development stages of aquaculture production fig 1 values of g depicts the global aquaculture production both marine and inland in 2019 summarized from the report fishery and aquaculture statistics global aquaculture production 1950 2019 12 the report shows that asia yields about 110 million ton of aquaculture products annually valued at approximately us 232 million in the past 20 years aquaculture production in other regions including africa americas europe and oceania has also seen rapid growth 12 the global distribution of the aquaculture sector is influenced by many factors including geography market demand infrastructure human resources technical capability and institutional system 13 according to bostock et al 14 the main factor that promotes the development of aquaculture industry is market competition market competition has compelled culturists to seek out any alternative to meet demand several strategies have been implemented to improve fish production through proper practices technological development and regulations nowadays most farmers have shifted to closed system technologies which have been found to be more environmental friendly than open waters 15 common types of traditional closed aquaculture systems developed by farmers include pond cages raceways and recirculating aquaculture system ras each system has its own advantages and drawbacks depending on the species and location of the culture in addition according to anh et al 16 in order to increase annual production most of the culturists have widely adopted modern intensive semi intensive and improved intensive systems the goal of these cutting edge techniques is to boost fish production by concentrating additional nutrients and additives in the aquaculture environment 17 the proliferation of pharmaceutical products as highly prescribed compound over the counter in the aquaculture industry can effectively prevent many diseases among farmed species however improper production practices such as excessive use of antibiotics are classified as illegal unreported and unregulated iuu fishing which can lead to unsustainable fisheries 18 furthermore hormones used to deliberately feminize fish may have a negative impact on the surrounding ecosystem for instance 17β estradiol introduced in the aquaculture feed had improved the female eels species 19 however the residual of the 17β estradiol in the water matrices even at low concentration of 1 ng l become harmful towards environmental and health problems since it had proven to have a linked towards immune and reproductive system 20 fig 2 shows the conceptual path of aquaculture wastewater to the surrounding environment it shows that nutrient and pharmaceutical products are the two major components added to fish ponds which will cause problems for aquaculture wastewater based on fig 2 various treatment technologies are potentially sustainable solutions for treating aquaculture wastewater and improving nutrient recovery water recovery sludge recycling and contaminants of emerging concern cec removal 21 this paper will review each stage involved in the aquaculture wastewater pathways with particular emphasis on treatment technologies 3 impacts of aquaculture towards the ecosystem though aquaculture alleviates food supply issue and boosts the economy the impacts of aquaculture on the ecosystem cannot be overlooked this is because culture of aquatic species involves the addition of foreign constituents to the cultured water and also exploitation of lands for fish farming the artificially added constituents served different functions with the main purpose to keep the fish healthy however it is usually not possible to be completely absorbed leaving the residue in the water as contaminant besides the metabolic excretion of fish will also lead to waste generation in aquaculture water 2 3 1 constituent of aquaculture wastewater there are multiple waste sources in aquaculture namely the feed chemicals and pathogens feed is the main source of waste in aquaculture systems and its impact on waste depends on several factors such as the quantity of feed per unit time composition of nutrient whether to feed in pellet form extruded form etc on the other hand chemicals are added to treat and control fish diseases some chemicals including antibiotics vaccines salts and lime are used to prevent microbial infections adjust ph of aquaculture pond and relieve fish stress 2 these sources subsequently lead to two types of waste which are the solid wastes and the dissolved wastes solid waste is mainly produced by feed in the form of uneaten food or components that have not been digested and excreted as feces solid waste can be further categorized into suspended solids and settled solids 3 while the settled solids will sink in short period of time and can be easily removed from the aquaculture water the suspended solids are the fine particles that are difficult to remove causing pressing issues in all kinds of aquaculture 22 dissolved wastes on the other hand comprises of nutrients and pharmaceutical drugs nitrogenous product in the form of ammonia and phosphorus are the main dissolved contaminants in aquaculture water n and p commonly originate from unconsumed feed and excreta from farmed fish table 1 shows the components found in aquaculture wastewater from various culture species according to crab et al 23 1 kg of fish biomass requires approximately 1 to 3 kg of dry feed and 36 of the consumed feed will be excreted from the fish as organic waste due to indigestibility a research by ackefors and enell 24 reported that assuming that fishmeal contains 7 2 n and 0 9 p with a conversion coefficient of 1 5 producing 1 ton of fish will release 75 kg n and 9 5 kg p cec constitute another part of dissolved waste in aquaculture cec in the form of antibiotics 25 disinfectants 3 vaccines 26 steroids 27 are usually added to control diseases promote aquatic growth and productivity the concentration of cec in aquaculture is very low ranging from 0 01 to 4000 ng g of farmed fish however trace amount of cec has raised public attention because they tend to accumulate in water bodies and aquatic products thereby causing harm to consumers and the environment 3 2 impact of aquaculture wastewater towards environment as discussed in section 3 1 the wastewater discharged from the aquaculture sector contains excessive nutrients and cec these contaminants have a negative impact on the surrounding environment including aquatic ecosystems plants and to a lesser extent humans 3 2 1 toxicological impact the excess nutrients and cec residues in aquaculture wastewater have a negative impact on non aquaculture ecosystems according to camargo et al 15 nitrate is a toxic compound that will adversely affect the surrounding aquatic species nitrate reacts with hemoglobin to produce methemoglobin which can hinder the breathing ability of aquatic organisms due to hypoxia 36 done et al 37 reported that antibiotics such as oxytetracycline otc 4 epioxytetracycline sulfadimethoxine ormetoprim and virginiamycin have exceeded the limits of the food and drug administration fda as a result human consumption of these contaminated aquatic organisms can cause problems such as allergies and toxicity which are difficult to diagnose due to the lack of information on antibiotic consumption 38 not to mention that the contaminated water in the surrounding environment also harms the aquatic plants due to the presence of a low concentrations of the pharmaceutical compounds 39 according to vilvert et al 40 otc has a concentration range of 0 5 μg l to 25 μg l which can disrupt the physiological functions of aquatic plants after prolonged exposure therefore proper treatment is needed to remove cec in aquaculture wastewater to reduce the impact over time 3 2 2 eutrophication eutrophication occurs when the surrounding water environment is rich in phytoplankton due to increased nutrient availability the accumulation of fish excreta excessive nitrogen phosphorus and ammonia from aquaculture discharges contains the nutrient source required for the rapid cyanobacterial activity 41 according to garmichael et al cyanobacteria also known as blue green algae is photosynthetic bacteria that can produce secondary metabolites that are toxic to organisms such as cyanobacteria toxins 42 several studies reported that microcystins mcs produced by cyanobacteria have contaminated a variety of aquatic organisms into the polluted eutrophic waters 43 in addition to excess nutrients in the surrounding water climate may also cause algae to rapidly multiply in surface waters 44 for instance algal blooms have become more common in tropical climates leading to increased mc level in water bodies 45 in addition because algae multiply in surface water the aquatic organisms and plants in the water receive less light and to some extent depletion of the living resources according to cai et al 46 the decomposition of dead algae and plants will increase the acidity of the surrounding water due to the presence of co2 therefore excessive nutrient levels in aquaculture wastewater increase the risk of eutrophication and stressed the surrounding aquatic ecosystem 3 2 3 bacteria resistant pharmaceutical compounds found in aquaculture wastewater such as antibiotics steroids and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids may also degrade the quality of the surrounding water common antibiotics in aquaculture wastewater include cyclines quinolones macrolides and sulfonamides zou et al 47 discovered that low concentrations up to 7722 ngl 1 of sulfadiazine sdz otc norfloxacin nor and ofloxacin ofl were detected in rivers near fish pond frequent use of antibiotics causes bacteria in the surrounding environment to develop resistance according to tendencia et al 48 otc is the most reported case due to the presence of otc resistant bacteria based on the analysis of le et al 49 bacillus and vibrio are examples of bacteria that resisted to trimethoprim tmp and sulfamethoxazole smx antibiotics these antibiotics are at low concentration of 0 1 mg ml although the concentration detected was low in a short period of time the situation will deteriorate and it will accumulate in the water body and cause a greater impact on the surrounding environment 4 aquaculture effluent treatment as the adverse impact caused by aquaculture wastewater on the environment is alarming there is an urgent need to find effective treatment methods to separate or degrade undesired substances from the wastewater and to recover nutrients sludge and water from the effluent the aquaculture industry has identified several treatment methods such as ras biological and physiochemical fig 3 depicts the classification of aquaculture wastewater treatment methods and their existing technologies 4 1 recirculation aquaculture system farming model ras is a closed system that recirculates clean water into the culturing environment and has been used widely by the culturist as a farming model the ras processes includes several unit operations such as culture tank solid waste removal anaerobic digestion and disinfection several authors mentioned the advantages of ras including reduced water consumption 50 improved sludge management 51 and reduced pollution 52 fig 4 depicts a general commercial ras configuration widely designed by culturists 53 4 1 1 physical filtration physical filtration is the first entering unit to remove the solid waste consisted of biofilter floc feces and excessive waste feed 54 the unit operation involved in the filtration can be classified into sedimentation mechanical filtration or centrifugation stages according to badiola et al centrifugation is not recommended to be used in the recirculating aquaculture system since it required high energy and provide less efficiency of solid removal 55 in addition sedimentation considered less effective due to the insufficient residence time for the particulates to settle down and thus result low solid removal and time consuming 56 franco nava et al reported that microscreen filter such as drum filter is the most common unit employed to remove the particulates and suspended solids 57 several factors affecting the effectiveness of the drum filter such as the particles size distribution of the suspended solids and the quality of the treated ras water 58 the mechanism of the drum filter is based on the aperture size in which only the clean water will pass through and the solid will be remained inside the screen 59 4 1 2 anaerobic digestion anaerobic digestion ad is a process involving the facultative bacteria under anaerobic conditions to degrade the organic matter 60 this process is a subsequent step after physical filtration in order to minimize the generated organic sludge there common type of digester has been employed by the culturist in treating the sludge including continuously stirred tank reactor cstr upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb and anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr table 2 summarizes the digestion efficiency of the sludge for cstr uasb and asbr digester zhang et al reviewed that ad offers several advantages such as high loading rates compatible with wastewater treatment unit of ras minimal risk of contamination caused by sludge and high survival rate of anaerobic bacteria without having any feed for an extended period of time 4 1 3 uv disinfection the ras consists of complex microbial communities which impacts both fish health and the surrounding environment disinfection of aquaculture water hence becomes vital to decrease the risk of entry and spreading of pathogens into the fish rearing system and to ensure the biosecurity of land based security uv treatment is effective to disinfect the aquaculture water by destabilizing the microbial composition and inactivate the pathogenic bacteria in the ras 67 dahle et al 67 successfully decreased the number of live bacteria to an extent of 89 reduction of colony forming units without compromising microbial water quality surrounding the fish in the ras in another study qi et al 68 introduced mercury free uv led combined with peroxymonosulfate pms as a potential strategy to disinfect aquaculture water in ras the proposed strategy not only improved the inactivation efficiency of uv led but also lowered the energy consumption in the research the uv led pms combination attained 0 57 log total bacteria reduction of ras within 60 min using only single uva led chip the disinfection capacity is expected to be enhanced by exposing the water to higher irradiance intensity in the uva led pms system a higher irradiance intensity could be achieved by coupling dozens of uva led chips in the system the current unit operation in ras has several limitations due to present of low concentration pharmaceutical residual in the feed additives used in the processing not to mention excessive feeding activity to meet high production demand may also lead to excessive nutrient accumulation composed nitrates phosphates and organic matter 69 freitag et al 70 found that the presence of nitrate from recovered ras significantly inhibited the growth of cultured species for a long period of time the remaining fine solids classified as organic matter will remain in the circulating water and promote the growth of heterotrophic bacteria to a certain extent 71 as a result several technologies including physicochemical and extensive biological treatment have been investigated to improve the current ras 4 2 biological method the biological method also known as bioremediation is a low cost traditional technique that uses microorganisms to restore environmental quality algae is a commonly used microorganism in bioremediation because it can be used in a variety of environmental conditions according to a number of studies the efficiency of bioremediation largely depends on the availability of nutrients biosorption mechanisms microbial activities operating conditions and the use of different types of algae 72 73 the main nutrients used as substrates for biomass production in aquaculture wastewater are carbon nitrogen and phosphorus the commonly used biotechnology in aquaculture is bioreactor biofloc technology wetland and phytoremediation 4 2 1 bioreactor bioreactor is a treatment method that uses biologically active organisms such as algae to perform biological reactions to achieve the purpose of product separation and purification there are two types of bioreactors moving bed bioreactor and fixed bed bioreactor a trickling filter tf for example is a fixed media bed bioreactor in which aerobic bacteria are embedded in a film and form a biofilm the substrate on which the microbial activity occurs determines the performance of the bioreactor tsukuda et al 74 found that the removal rate of nitrogenous compound in the fluidized sand bed fsb is related to the carbon source represented by the substrates carolyne et al 75 investigated the influence of different beds in the tf reactor and discovered that woodchips improved the contaminant removal efficiency by 94 like the type of bed used in bioreactors algae play a vital role in increasing biological activity so it can decompose organic matter in aquaculture wastewater tetraslemis suecica is a kind of microalgae used in tubular photobioreactors which can remove 49 4 of nitrate and 99 of phosphate from fish farm wastewater 76 andreotti et al 77 obtained a high removal efficiency of 94 4 dissolve inorganic nitrogen din and 96 06 dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip researchers have begun to investigate the potential of integrated bioreactors with various technologies to overcome the limitations of single unit bioreactor shitu et al 78 reviewed the development of a hybrid moving bed bioreactor mbbr as a better process for creating a sustainable culture environment for farmed fish according to li et al 79 at most of 98 7 of e2 has been removed through mbbr after 68 days process in addition the combination of bioreactors and nanoparticles nps technology may increase processing efficiency hesni et al 35 reported that in the designed bioreactor chlorella vulgaris microalgae and iron oxide nps were used and the results showed high removal of no 3 92 2 no 2 89 3 nh4 93 67 and po3 4 89 25 however some integrated systems seem to be in the development stage and they were not entirely suitable for real aquaculture wastewater since some parameters must be considered it is expected that the implementation of a denitrification reactor in ras will incur additional operating costs for example the ras requirements for denitrification unit may only be applicable to nitrate concentrations above 50 ppm 80 pungrasmi et al 81 on the other hand reported that combining nitrification and denitrification processes in a single unit operation can increase the removal rate of ammonia and nitrate without affecting the growth of culture species and may reduce costs table 3 shows the literatures of existing bioreactors for treatment of aquaculture wastewater 4 2 2 biofloc technology biofloc technology bft also known as symbiotic process employs accumulated biolfloc particles derived from bacteria algae and organic matter to improve water quality in aquaculture 82 the bft system is considered to be more cost effective than ras due to fewer facilities requirement in the process it is classified into two configurations of batch reactor and continuous reactor fig 5 illustrates two configuration systems of biofloc technology including non circulation system and recirculation system 83 there is no need for a filtration unit in bft such as the biological treatment stage because the microbial activity of toxic nitrogen conversion occurs in the water column 84 in super intensive culture systems feeding more frequently produces more culture species the increased microbial activity due to nutrient availability is the result of increased culture species diversity however large amounts of feces and uneaten nutrients will remain in the system negatively impacting water quality therefore feed is vital in controlling aquaculture water quality 4 2 3 wetlands and phytoremediation wetland is an economical system to help the culturist to reduce the pollution towards the surrounding environment by performing several processes including nitrification denitrification demineralization in the present of living plants bacteria fungus and non living organism soil water light air minerals 85 the performance of the wetland is depending on the design and configuration of the wetland nutrient availability water salinity and root characteristics 86 lin et al 87 have reported at least 98 nitrogen removal from the aquaculture wastewater after a few months operation however the increased hydraulic loading rate leads to a decrease in wetland performance which results to a decrease in the removal efficiency of suspended solids in aquaculture wastewater 88 phytoremediation is an emerging technology that uses living plants to reduce the toxicity of the aquaculture environment this method largely depends on the selectivity of plants that contribute to the main function of the treatment ghaly et al 89 have shown that plants such as barley oat and rye have different pollutant removal percentages due to differences in growth rate and disease resistance according to chavan et al 90 the implementation of phytoremediation technique in the wetland system can provide better contaminants removal and the operation is simple and cost effective like the wetland system several factors affect the performance of phytoremediation such as a good rooting system high biomass source and high growth rate 91 92 table 4 summarizes the research on the removal of pollutants through phytoremediation based on the types of plants used in addition liu et al 93 made some improvements by isolating several types of microalgae to achieve high pollutant removal from actual aquaculture wastewater 4 3 physicochemical physicochemical treatment of aquaculture wastewater involves the separation and degradation of wastes from the wastewater the removals of undesired substances are predominantly achieved by refining the properties of the treatment technologies to deal with the different characteristics of the substances to treat them physically chemically or the combination of both examples of the physicochemical treatment methods deployed in the aquaculture industry include adsorption aops and membranes 4 3 1 adsorption adsorption is a potential treatment technology employed to purify aquaculture wastewater in the adsorption process the substances to be treated adsorbate are captured by the adsorbent fig 6 thereby separating the undesired substances from the bulk fluid the adsorbent usually consists of a highly porous surface at which the adsorbate could accumulate and retain the bonding between the adsorbate and the adsorbent are generally governed by van der waals forces covalent bonding or electrostatic attraction adsorption has several well known advantages for instance low cost handy operation and resistance to toxic chemicals 99 an effective absorbent must be inert and have a large superficial area to boost the adsorption efficiency 100 thus a huge variation of absorbents has been explored to achieve the desired separation efficiency ammonia and phosphorus are common constituent in aquaculture wastewater and they must be eliminated to minimize harm to fish farms and the surrounding environment several researchers have studied adsorption technology to separate ammonia and phosphorus from aquaculture wastewater in an investigation conducted by zadinelo et al 100 with real fish farming water containing 0 84 mg l of ammonium ions as the target substance the smectite clays with various chemical compositions are used to adsorb ammonium ions by using 0 5 w w clay 93 of ammonium ions were successfully removed chitosan was deployed to adsorb ammonia from several fish farms in the city of palotina pr in bernardi et al s 8 study for fish farm water with an ammonia content of 0 14 0 27 and 0 50 mg l the removal efficiency of ammonia was 100 showing the great potential of chitosan as an adsorbent to treat aquaculture wastewater in order to treat another common contaminant kumararaja et al 101 harnessed aluminium pillared bentonite as an adsorbent to remove the phosphate in aquaculture wastewater it was found that the removal efficiency varied with the salinity of the discharged water several samples of aquaculture wastewater were collected for the study including the waters of shrimp farm and fish larval ponds the resulting phosphate removal rate reached 85 3 to 99 6 adsorption is more commonly used to treat therapeutic substances in aquaculture wastewater aitcheson et al 102 studied the adsorption behavior of four therapeutants oxytetracycline malachite green formaldehyde and chloramine t on coal based activated carbon 207ea the criticality to remove these substances was highlighted when oxytetracycline was found to persist in the sediment for several months and it encourages the growth of oxytetracycline resistant bacteria malachite green is known to promote liver tumor and is toxic to mammalian cells while formaldehyde is a probable human carcinogen chloramine t s organic trihalomethane byproducts may also be carcinogenic by altering the ph temperature and ionic strength the highest adsorption efficiency of oxytetracycline malachite green formaldehyde and chloramine t were 88 100 99 and 99 respectively another antibiotic under the tetracycline family found in aquaculture wastewater namely the chlortetracycline ctc was adsorbed onto lanthanum modified zeolite la z by yu et al 103 according to reports both internal and external diffusion in a multi step process are the controlling factors of the la z adsorption rate in that experiment 98 4 of removal rate was attained with the initial ctc concentration of 5 mg l 20 min adsorption time and ph 7 apart from being a standalone technology adsorption can also be combined with ras to maximize the separation efficiency of undesired components in an effort to separate tricaine methanesulfonate ms 222 from a real aquaculture wastewater ferreira et al 104 incorporated an adsorption process to ras using pyrolyzed biological paper mill sludge as an adsorbent the aquaculture effluent was under the conditions of 18 19 c 20 21 salinity and ph 7 7 5 during the experiment the dissolved organic carbon and inorganic carbon content in the effluent did not compete with ms 222 to occupy adsorption sites on the adsorbent the examined adsorbent proved to be effective when the adsorption efficiency of the aquaculture wastewater was similar to that evaluated using ultrapure water adsorption can also be integrated with photocatalysis process zeolite was coupled with tio2 by nomura et al 105 to remove sulfamonomethoxine smm and its intermediates in freshwater aquaculture wastewater when tio2 was used alone the degradation of smm was inhibited while the usage of composite zeolite tio2 alleviates the issue the composite zeolite tio2 also demonstrated their efficacy when the evaluated smm was decomposed completely within 30 min 4 3 2 advanced oxidation process the advanced oxidation process aop mechanism is initiated by highly reactive oxidants mainly hydroxyl radicals oh which accelerate the oxidation and degradation of a large number of pollutants in wastewater as described by eq 1 1 organic species oh c o 2 h 2 o inorganic ions the reactive oxidants applied in the wastewater are capable to oxidize the undesired compounds in the water unselectively the contaminants in the water would be effectively disintegrated from the original form once reacted with the reactive species besides oh superoxide radicals o2 hydroperoyl radicals ho2 sulfate radicals so4 and organic peroxyl radicals roo generated from hydrogen peroxide h2o2 or ozone o3 are formed in aop the formation of these radicals can be attained by several methods such as ozonation ultraviolet uv irradiation fenton oxidation photocatalysis or combination of these technologies in most cases the applications of aop are to treat organic compounds as shown in table 5 the different types of aop processes used are capable to degrade various organic constituents in aquaculture effluent in addition to the organic compounds listed in table 5 aop is mainly use to degrade antibiotics in aquaculture wastewater the research of liu et al 112 used green synthesized rgo nfe pd nanocomposite to successfully remove 77 9 rifampicin antibiotics from aquaculture wastewater during the fenton oxidation process another common antibiotic found in aquatic farming sulfamonomethoxine smm was treated by nomura et al 113 using a rotating advanced oxidation contactor equipped with high silica zeolite tio2 an almost perfect degradation was achieved after 3 h of aop application besides smm the treatment process developed in the study can also remove the conversion by products of smm from fresh aquaculture wastewater faww without being affected by coexisting substances in faww in another study pereira et al 114 initiated the photocatalysis of oxalinic acid and oxytetracycline oxalinic acid and oxytetracycline are the two most extensively found antibiotics in aquaculture water in that study tio2 was suspended on a pilot plant scale under natural solar radiation with an initial concentration of 20 mg l of separate oxa and otc as well as a mixture of oxa otc the photocatalytic treatment successfully removed antibiotics with 100 efficiency the cumulative uv energy required per liter of solution was very low at approximately 1 kjuv l demonstrating that the process is sustainable in that study it was reported that although several inorganic ions including cl so4 2 no3 nh4 and hco3 did not interfere with the degradation process of oxa and otc the presence of po4 3 affected the efficiency of photocatalysis employing tio2 hence when using tio2 photocatalyst to treat wastewater with complex constituent the presence of po4 3 must be considered the efficacy of aop which was the ultimate goal of the treatment process was focused in the narration above in a more thorough view the entire technical operation process involves many other components and mechanisms revealing the overall advantages and disadvantages of the aop as listed in table 6 it is explicit that aop offers superior treatment efficiency for organic compounds yet there are some limitations that may jeopardize the sustainability of the process 4 3 3 membranes separation technology the application of membrane aquaculture wastewater treatment is rising as the experimental results of using membrane in both the laboratory and on site are promising membrane technologies has shown great potential in eliminating fine contaminants found in aquaculture effluent including organic compounds viruses and pathogenic bacteria 116 117 the operation mechanism of membranes varied based on the types and configurations in general membranes act as a separation unit that filter undesired substances from the water the membrane which serves as a selective barrier would allow certain molecules to pass through while refraining other substances from penetrating through the membrane separation of the contaminants from the wastewater are hence achieved nonetheless membranes technology is often plagued by fouling issues in which the flux declines over time due to the deposition of undesired substance on the membrane surface that clogged the membrane pores 118 119 a research by widiasa et al 118 reported that the fouling behavior depends on the membrane pore size and the type of foulant the constituents in an aquaculture system are complex and their characteristics are also varied thus the specifications of the membranes used in the treatment such as molecular weight cut off surface characteristics and materials are tuned to achieve the best separation performance and minimize fouling in the respective researches studies employing membrane technologies in treating aquaculture wastewater are summarized in table 7 in addition to its own efficiency membrane also involves in technology integration to further improve the efficacy of aquaculture wastewater treatment 125 some studies have associated membrane to recirculating aquaculture system holan et al 126 pointed out that the conventional systems in ras faces the challenge of removing fine solid particles 35 μm and colloidal particles 1 μm the challenge can lead to the accumulation of particles and harm the cultured species a biofilm membrane bioreactor bf mbr was then introduced in the ras water treatment system to ease the challenge the results showed that the installed ultrafiltration membrane was capable to remove colloidal particles and reduce the turbidity to 44 and 77 respectively which was typically much lower than the turbidity obtained in conventional systems besides lowering the bacteria concentrations up to 80 the ammonia content was also reduced by 56 compared to conventional system in the experiment healthier cod larvae with higher survival rate and growth rate were obtained other than integrating ras and membrane systems sharrer et al 127 also investigated the function of mbr in the treatment of wastewater from ras cultured rainbow trout in the study the mbr can remove up to 99 98 and 99 99 of total suspended solids and total volatile solids respectively excellent removal efficiencies of up to 95 5 and 96 1 have also been achieved in the removal of total nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater widiasa et al 118 included fouling studies in their effort to use polysulfone ultrafiltration uf membranes 10 50 and 100 kda in the ras system to remove contaminants from aquaculture wastewater according to their investigation 100 kda membrane was the most promising uf membrane for ras owing to its highest flux without compromising the rejection of contaminants in aquaculture wastewater the 100 kda uf membrane successfully removed humic acid and shrimp feed at 94 5 and 99 3 respectively and simultaneously removed microalgae pathogenic bacteria vibrio harveyi and viruses ihhnv infection hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus from the effluent 5 sustainable development of aquaculture as summarized aquaculture is booming globally to bridge the gap between the supply and demand of fishery products which has aroused the attention to the treatment of wastewater in order to minimize the impact of aquaculture on the environment it is projected that the world population will exceed approximately 9 billion by 2050 128 as micronutrient deficiency is still an urgent problem for a growing population the rapid growth of aquaculture is anticipated to provide people with sufficient essential proteins and micronutrients 129 nevertheless the efforts to ensure food source for the population should not be tied to sacrificing the well being of the surrounding environment although a plenty of aquaculture treatment technologies were introduced in section 4 the regulation on the discharge of for aquaculture wastewater is vague in many countries and there is no clear standard for the safety level of constituents especially the cec content in the wastewater 7 in coherence with the rapid development of the aquaculture industry it is utterly important for academia government and industry to establish partnerships to critically plan and implement sustainable development strategies for the aquaculture industry 128 the aquaculture industry regulations must be drafted and executed as a comprehensive guideline for the entire life cycle of aquaculture 5 1 aquaculture regulations aquaculture is usually operated by several departments so it is necessary to implement regulations to supervise each division to ensure the efficiency and safety of aquatic production 130 some non government organizations such as global aquaculture alliance gaa and international finance corporation ifc have established wastewater standards for aquaculture gaa recommends aquaculture farmers to adopt environmentally responsible production methods to ensure the discharged effluent complies with standards ifc provides low interest loans to developing countries to encourage the development of aquaculture projects that comply to water quality standards on the government side many countries such as the united states have established aquaculture regulations based on sewage standards the us environmental protection agency has made rule making procedures for aquaculture 131 other countries such as thailand and taiwan imposed aquaculture effluent standards which involved several parameters including total suspended solids tss ph biochemical oxygen demand bod and cod for thailand the effluent discharged from the aquaculture farm shall meet specifications of ph 6 5 to 9 0 bod not exceeding 20 mg l tss lesser than 70 mg l and total nitrogen not more than 4 0 mgn l for taiwan the aquaculture effluent should have ph between 6 0 and 9 0 tss not more than 30 mg l bod and cod lesser than 30 and 100 mg l respectively 132 in china there are three different wastewater discharge standards which can be further categorized into five grades of sub standards for aquaculture the standard applied is the environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 133 it is recommended that countries without clear regulations for aquaculture can follow the effluent standard drafted by gaa and ifc some countries like malaysia that has not enforce regulations for aquaculture embraced alternatives by using guidelines of environmental quality industrial effluent regulation 2009 as the main reference for aquaculture wastewater discharge standards 3 6 conclusions aquaculture has become the world s main fresh food production sector forcing culturists to compete in the market because of this demand improper feeding practices and the use of pharmaceutical products have posed a risk to the environment this article reviews the current aquaculture treatment technology classified as ras biological aops absorption and membrane to achieve the goal of zero discharge of aquaculture wastewater traditional ras is a commonly used closed system technology in the aquaculture field however due to some limitations of ras researchers have been motivated to upgrade the current ras to improve system efficiency by introducing additional treatment technology the major challenges of biological and adsorption are the selection of specific macrophytes and adsorbents respectively it has been found that some macrophytes and adsorbents are highly dependent on the source of nutrients in aquaculture wastewater aop on the other hand is considered to be one of the potential solutions for the degradation of cec however major drawbacks of aop have been identified such as the generation of toxic by products membrane treatment can simultaneously remove cec and nutrient recovery nevertheless due to the accumulation of suspended solids in wastewater membrane fouling and instability would occur furthermore membrane fouling leads to increased operating costs due to frequent replacement of membrane since multiple functions can be used in one process hybrid technology offers better treatment than independent methods nonetheless the technology appears to be in its early stages and additional research on its effectiveness and system optimization is needed as a result when designing treatments for the pilot scale researchers must consider a variety of factors through appropriate treatment methods the ultimate goal of reducing environmental pollution can be achieved funding this research was funded by the university of sains malaysia s long term

13095,aquaculture activities surge tremendously worldwide and intensively shifted the landscape of food consuming across the globe as the fish catch production from natural environment has reached its limit the public has begun to rely on farmed aquatic products for continuity of protein sources the aquaculture industry is currently dominated by asia and has evolved into multiple configurations to increase fish production nonetheless the constituent in aquaculture wastewater mainly from fish feed and other pharmaceutical substances have raised public concern as those constituents are potent to jeopardize surrounding environment when released into the ecosystem in order to minimize the impact of aquaculture wastewater rigorous researches have been proposed and conducted to effectively treat aquaculture effluent a thorough treatment mechanisms have been covered of which the recirculation aquaculture system ras is the most extensively implemented other technologies introduced include biological physical and chemical treatments this review covers an in depth analysis of these technologies including their pros and cons treatment efficacies and process intensifications bioreactor bio floc wetlands and phytoremediation are among the biological treatment methods revealed in the discussion while the physiochemical section encompassed an overview of adsorption advanced oxidation processes aops and membranes technologies future recommendations are proposed in terms of aquaculture regulations to ensure sustainable aquaculture development graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aquaculture environmental conservations wastewater treatment regulations 1 introduction the necessity of aquatic farming has risen as a consequence of an increasing world population because the fish catch production has reached its limits in 2017 aquaculture accounted for 67 7 of the total fisheries production reaching a staggering 53 million tons 1 compared to 2000 production of aquaculture has increased significantly there was merely 20 8 million tons in 2000 accounting for only 26 3 of the total aquatic production 1 to cope with the increasing demand for fish and other aquatic products aquaculture activities have been intensified which has led to a more intense competition for the fundamental needs of aquaculture development such as land water and natural resources 2 aquaculture activities are usually carried out in a controlled environments not limited to fish farming but also includes mollusks crustaceans shrimps and many other aquatic species 3 in addition to meeting global food demand the aquaculture industry also brings a positive impact to the economy by providing more employment opportunities according to nasr allah et al 4 and ottinger et al 5 the aquaculture industry directly or indirectly creates approximately 23 million full time jobs especially in developing countries the most cultivated aquatic species is freshwater fish which account for 56 of the total aquaculture production followed by mollusks and crustaceans at 23 and 10 respectively 5 from the analysis of the geographical distribution of the production of the top 10 aquaculture species it can be seen that asian countries particularly china dominates the production which account for around 53 of the total global output 5 however the rapid development of aquaculture has led to land subsidence and mangrove destruction the most critical issue is that it seriously pollutes the surrounding water bodies and has a negative impact on the environment 5 wastewater containing large amount of nutrients suspended solids 6 chemicals and pharmaceutical products 7 are often discharged from the aquatic species farms in view of the escalating urge to mitigate the adverse effects of aquaculture on the environment various treatment technologies have emerged treatment technologies introduced involved either biological or physicochemical treatment mechanisms biological methods use microorganisms to break down pollutants physical treatment usually involves separating contaminants from the aquaculture wastewater in their original form adsorption 8 membranes 9 and coagulation 10 are examples of the physical separation applications as for chemical treatment process undesired substances are degraded into by products to minimize the harmful effects on the environment when the wastewater is discharged the degradation of constituents often achieved through advanced oxidation process which can transform parent compounds into miscellaneous by products through a series of chemical reactions rather than standalone biological or physicochemical treatments the wastewater purification operation performances can also be enhanced through integration of different modes of treatment mechanisms through process integration the degradation and separation of the harmful substances are performed simultaneously to achieve better treatment efficiency with the information gathered it is certain that the further growth of the aquaculture industry is inevitable hence in depth understandings and researches of aquaculture wastewater treatment technologies are crucial nonetheless a thorough review of aquaculture wastewater treatment technology is still scarce therefore this review serves the purpose to close the review gaps in assembling available treatment technologies for aquaculture effluent the current aquaculture landscape and the impact of aquaculture on the ecosystem will be outlined to emphasize the importance of wastewater treatment followed by the reviews of treatment technologies the treatment mechanisms advantages disadvantages and efficacies of the treatment methods will be disclosed lastly recommendations for sustainable aquaculture development were summarized to ensure that the ecosystem is protected despite having to cope with surging growth of the fish farming activities 2 current aquaculture landscape aquaculture is becoming more prevalent globally due to the increasing demand for food to address the nutritional imbalance of the population 11 several countries have started to improve their food security by establishing different development stages of aquaculture production fig 1 values of g depicts the global aquaculture production both marine and inland in 2019 summarized from the report fishery and aquaculture statistics global aquaculture production 1950 2019 12 the report shows that asia yields about 110 million ton of aquaculture products annually valued at approximately us 232 million in the past 20 years aquaculture production in other regions including africa americas europe and oceania has also seen rapid growth 12 the global distribution of the aquaculture sector is influenced by many factors including geography market demand infrastructure human resources technical capability and institutional system 13 according to bostock et al 14 the main factor that promotes the development of aquaculture industry is market competition market competition has compelled culturists to seek out any alternative to meet demand several strategies have been implemented to improve fish production through proper practices technological development and regulations nowadays most farmers have shifted to closed system technologies which have been found to be more environmental friendly than open waters 15 common types of traditional closed aquaculture systems developed by farmers include pond cages raceways and recirculating aquaculture system ras each system has its own advantages and drawbacks depending on the species and location of the culture in addition according to anh et al 16 in order to increase annual production most of the culturists have widely adopted modern intensive semi intensive and improved intensive systems the goal of these cutting edge techniques is to boost fish production by concentrating additional nutrients and additives in the aquaculture environment 17 the proliferation of pharmaceutical products as highly prescribed compound over the counter in the aquaculture industry can effectively prevent many diseases among farmed species however improper production practices such as excessive use of antibiotics are classified as illegal unreported and unregulated iuu fishing which can lead to unsustainable fisheries 18 furthermore hormones used to deliberately feminize fish may have a negative impact on the surrounding ecosystem for instance 17β estradiol introduced in the aquaculture feed had improved the female eels species 19 however the residual of the 17β estradiol in the water matrices even at low concentration of 1 ng l become harmful towards environmental and health problems since it had proven to have a linked towards immune and reproductive system 20 fig 2 shows the conceptual path of aquaculture wastewater to the surrounding environment it shows that nutrient and pharmaceutical products are the two major components added to fish ponds which will cause problems for aquaculture wastewater based on fig 2 various treatment technologies are potentially sustainable solutions for treating aquaculture wastewater and improving nutrient recovery water recovery sludge recycling and contaminants of emerging concern cec removal 21 this paper will review each stage involved in the aquaculture wastewater pathways with particular emphasis on treatment technologies 3 impacts of aquaculture towards the ecosystem though aquaculture alleviates food supply issue and boosts the economy the impacts of aquaculture on the ecosystem cannot be overlooked this is because culture of aquatic species involves the addition of foreign constituents to the cultured water and also exploitation of lands for fish farming the artificially added constituents served different functions with the main purpose to keep the fish healthy however it is usually not possible to be completely absorbed leaving the residue in the water as contaminant besides the metabolic excretion of fish will also lead to waste generation in aquaculture water 2 3 1 constituent of aquaculture wastewater there are multiple waste sources in aquaculture namely the feed chemicals and pathogens feed is the main source of waste in aquaculture systems and its impact on waste depends on several factors such as the quantity of feed per unit time composition of nutrient whether to feed in pellet form extruded form etc on the other hand chemicals are added to treat and control fish diseases some chemicals including antibiotics vaccines salts and lime are used to prevent microbial infections adjust ph of aquaculture pond and relieve fish stress 2 these sources subsequently lead to two types of waste which are the solid wastes and the dissolved wastes solid waste is mainly produced by feed in the form of uneaten food or components that have not been digested and excreted as feces solid waste can be further categorized into suspended solids and settled solids 3 while the settled solids will sink in short period of time and can be easily removed from the aquaculture water the suspended solids are the fine particles that are difficult to remove causing pressing issues in all kinds of aquaculture 22 dissolved wastes on the other hand comprises of nutrients and pharmaceutical drugs nitrogenous product in the form of ammonia and phosphorus are the main dissolved contaminants in aquaculture water n and p commonly originate from unconsumed feed and excreta from farmed fish table 1 shows the components found in aquaculture wastewater from various culture species according to crab et al 23 1 kg of fish biomass requires approximately 1 to 3 kg of dry feed and 36 of the consumed feed will be excreted from the fish as organic waste due to indigestibility a research by ackefors and enell 24 reported that assuming that fishmeal contains 7 2 n and 0 9 p with a conversion coefficient of 1 5 producing 1 ton of fish will release 75 kg n and 9 5 kg p cec constitute another part of dissolved waste in aquaculture cec in the form of antibiotics 25 disinfectants 3 vaccines 26 steroids 27 are usually added to control diseases promote aquatic growth and productivity the concentration of cec in aquaculture is very low ranging from 0 01 to 4000 ng g of farmed fish however trace amount of cec has raised public attention because they tend to accumulate in water bodies and aquatic products thereby causing harm to consumers and the environment 3 2 impact of aquaculture wastewater towards environment as discussed in section 3 1 the wastewater discharged from the aquaculture sector contains excessive nutrients and cec these contaminants have a negative impact on the surrounding environment including aquatic ecosystems plants and to a lesser extent humans 3 2 1 toxicological impact the excess nutrients and cec residues in aquaculture wastewater have a negative impact on non aquaculture ecosystems according to camargo et al 15 nitrate is a toxic compound that will adversely affect the surrounding aquatic species nitrate reacts with hemoglobin to produce methemoglobin which can hinder the breathing ability of aquatic organisms due to hypoxia 36 done et al 37 reported that antibiotics such as oxytetracycline otc 4 epioxytetracycline sulfadimethoxine ormetoprim and virginiamycin have exceeded the limits of the food and drug administration fda as a result human consumption of these contaminated aquatic organisms can cause problems such as allergies and toxicity which are difficult to diagnose due to the lack of information on antibiotic consumption 38 not to mention that the contaminated water in the surrounding environment also harms the aquatic plants due to the presence of a low concentrations of the pharmaceutical compounds 39 according to vilvert et al 40 otc has a concentration range of 0 5 μg l to 25 μg l which can disrupt the physiological functions of aquatic plants after prolonged exposure therefore proper treatment is needed to remove cec in aquaculture wastewater to reduce the impact over time 3 2 2 eutrophication eutrophication occurs when the surrounding water environment is rich in phytoplankton due to increased nutrient availability the accumulation of fish excreta excessive nitrogen phosphorus and ammonia from aquaculture discharges contains the nutrient source required for the rapid cyanobacterial activity 41 according to garmichael et al cyanobacteria also known as blue green algae is photosynthetic bacteria that can produce secondary metabolites that are toxic to organisms such as cyanobacteria toxins 42 several studies reported that microcystins mcs produced by cyanobacteria have contaminated a variety of aquatic organisms into the polluted eutrophic waters 43 in addition to excess nutrients in the surrounding water climate may also cause algae to rapidly multiply in surface waters 44 for instance algal blooms have become more common in tropical climates leading to increased mc level in water bodies 45 in addition because algae multiply in surface water the aquatic organisms and plants in the water receive less light and to some extent depletion of the living resources according to cai et al 46 the decomposition of dead algae and plants will increase the acidity of the surrounding water due to the presence of co2 therefore excessive nutrient levels in aquaculture wastewater increase the risk of eutrophication and stressed the surrounding aquatic ecosystem 3 2 3 bacteria resistant pharmaceutical compounds found in aquaculture wastewater such as antibiotics steroids and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids may also degrade the quality of the surrounding water common antibiotics in aquaculture wastewater include cyclines quinolones macrolides and sulfonamides zou et al 47 discovered that low concentrations up to 7722 ngl 1 of sulfadiazine sdz otc norfloxacin nor and ofloxacin ofl were detected in rivers near fish pond frequent use of antibiotics causes bacteria in the surrounding environment to develop resistance according to tendencia et al 48 otc is the most reported case due to the presence of otc resistant bacteria based on the analysis of le et al 49 bacillus and vibrio are examples of bacteria that resisted to trimethoprim tmp and sulfamethoxazole smx antibiotics these antibiotics are at low concentration of 0 1 mg ml although the concentration detected was low in a short period of time the situation will deteriorate and it will accumulate in the water body and cause a greater impact on the surrounding environment 4 aquaculture effluent treatment as the adverse impact caused by aquaculture wastewater on the environment is alarming there is an urgent need to find effective treatment methods to separate or degrade undesired substances from the wastewater and to recover nutrients sludge and water from the effluent the aquaculture industry has identified several treatment methods such as ras biological and physiochemical fig 3 depicts the classification of aquaculture wastewater treatment methods and their existing technologies 4 1 recirculation aquaculture system farming model ras is a closed system that recirculates clean water into the culturing environment and has been used widely by the culturist as a farming model the ras processes includes several unit operations such as culture tank solid waste removal anaerobic digestion and disinfection several authors mentioned the advantages of ras including reduced water consumption 50 improved sludge management 51 and reduced pollution 52 fig 4 depicts a general commercial ras configuration widely designed by culturists 53 4 1 1 physical filtration physical filtration is the first entering unit to remove the solid waste consisted of biofilter floc feces and excessive waste feed 54 the unit operation involved in the filtration can be classified into sedimentation mechanical filtration or centrifugation stages according to badiola et al centrifugation is not recommended to be used in the recirculating aquaculture system since it required high energy and provide less efficiency of solid removal 55 in addition sedimentation considered less effective due to the insufficient residence time for the particulates to settle down and thus result low solid removal and time consuming 56 franco nava et al reported that microscreen filter such as drum filter is the most common unit employed to remove the particulates and suspended solids 57 several factors affecting the effectiveness of the drum filter such as the particles size distribution of the suspended solids and the quality of the treated ras water 58 the mechanism of the drum filter is based on the aperture size in which only the clean water will pass through and the solid will be remained inside the screen 59 4 1 2 anaerobic digestion anaerobic digestion ad is a process involving the facultative bacteria under anaerobic conditions to degrade the organic matter 60 this process is a subsequent step after physical filtration in order to minimize the generated organic sludge there common type of digester has been employed by the culturist in treating the sludge including continuously stirred tank reactor cstr upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb and anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr table 2 summarizes the digestion efficiency of the sludge for cstr uasb and asbr digester zhang et al reviewed that ad offers several advantages such as high loading rates compatible with wastewater treatment unit of ras minimal risk of contamination caused by sludge and high survival rate of anaerobic bacteria without having any feed for an extended period of time 4 1 3 uv disinfection the ras consists of complex microbial communities which impacts both fish health and the surrounding environment disinfection of aquaculture water hence becomes vital to decrease the risk of entry and spreading of pathogens into the fish rearing system and to ensure the biosecurity of land based security uv treatment is effective to disinfect the aquaculture water by destabilizing the microbial composition and inactivate the pathogenic bacteria in the ras 67 dahle et al 67 successfully decreased the number of live bacteria to an extent of 89 reduction of colony forming units without compromising microbial water quality surrounding the fish in the ras in another study qi et al 68 introduced mercury free uv led combined with peroxymonosulfate pms as a potential strategy to disinfect aquaculture water in ras the proposed strategy not only improved the inactivation efficiency of uv led but also lowered the energy consumption in the research the uv led pms combination attained 0 57 log total bacteria reduction of ras within 60 min using only single uva led chip the disinfection capacity is expected to be enhanced by exposing the water to higher irradiance intensity in the uva led pms system a higher irradiance intensity could be achieved by coupling dozens of uva led chips in the system the current unit operation in ras has several limitations due to present of low concentration pharmaceutical residual in the feed additives used in the processing not to mention excessive feeding activity to meet high production demand may also lead to excessive nutrient accumulation composed nitrates phosphates and organic matter 69 freitag et al 70 found that the presence of nitrate from recovered ras significantly inhibited the growth of cultured species for a long period of time the remaining fine solids classified as organic matter will remain in the circulating water and promote the growth of heterotrophic bacteria to a certain extent 71 as a result several technologies including physicochemical and extensive biological treatment have been investigated to improve the current ras 4 2 biological method the biological method also known as bioremediation is a low cost traditional technique that uses microorganisms to restore environmental quality algae is a commonly used microorganism in bioremediation because it can be used in a variety of environmental conditions according to a number of studies the efficiency of bioremediation largely depends on the availability of nutrients biosorption mechanisms microbial activities operating conditions and the use of different types of algae 72 73 the main nutrients used as substrates for biomass production in aquaculture wastewater are carbon nitrogen and phosphorus the commonly used biotechnology in aquaculture is bioreactor biofloc technology wetland and phytoremediation 4 2 1 bioreactor bioreactor is a treatment method that uses biologically active organisms such as algae to perform biological reactions to achieve the purpose of product separation and purification there are two types of bioreactors moving bed bioreactor and fixed bed bioreactor a trickling filter tf for example is a fixed media bed bioreactor in which aerobic bacteria are embedded in a film and form a biofilm the substrate on which the microbial activity occurs determines the performance of the bioreactor tsukuda et al 74 found that the removal rate of nitrogenous compound in the fluidized sand bed fsb is related to the carbon source represented by the substrates carolyne et al 75 investigated the influence of different beds in the tf reactor and discovered that woodchips improved the contaminant removal efficiency by 94 like the type of bed used in bioreactors algae play a vital role in increasing biological activity so it can decompose organic matter in aquaculture wastewater tetraslemis suecica is a kind of microalgae used in tubular photobioreactors which can remove 49 4 of nitrate and 99 of phosphate from fish farm wastewater 76 andreotti et al 77 obtained a high removal efficiency of 94 4 dissolve inorganic nitrogen din and 96 06 dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip researchers have begun to investigate the potential of integrated bioreactors with various technologies to overcome the limitations of single unit bioreactor shitu et al 78 reviewed the development of a hybrid moving bed bioreactor mbbr as a better process for creating a sustainable culture environment for farmed fish according to li et al 79 at most of 98 7 of e2 has been removed through mbbr after 68 days process in addition the combination of bioreactors and nanoparticles nps technology may increase processing efficiency hesni et al 35 reported that in the designed bioreactor chlorella vulgaris microalgae and iron oxide nps were used and the results showed high removal of no 3 92 2 no 2 89 3 nh4 93 67 and po3 4 89 25 however some integrated systems seem to be in the development stage and they were not entirely suitable for real aquaculture wastewater since some parameters must be considered it is expected that the implementation of a denitrification reactor in ras will incur additional operating costs for example the ras requirements for denitrification unit may only be applicable to nitrate concentrations above 50 ppm 80 pungrasmi et al 81 on the other hand reported that combining nitrification and denitrification processes in a single unit operation can increase the removal rate of ammonia and nitrate without affecting the growth of culture species and may reduce costs table 3 shows the literatures of existing bioreactors for treatment of aquaculture wastewater 4 2 2 biofloc technology biofloc technology bft also known as symbiotic process employs accumulated biolfloc particles derived from bacteria algae and organic matter to improve water quality in aquaculture 82 the bft system is considered to be more cost effective than ras due to fewer facilities requirement in the process it is classified into two configurations of batch reactor and continuous reactor fig 5 illustrates two configuration systems of biofloc technology including non circulation system and recirculation system 83 there is no need for a filtration unit in bft such as the biological treatment stage because the microbial activity of toxic nitrogen conversion occurs in the water column 84 in super intensive culture systems feeding more frequently produces more culture species the increased microbial activity due to nutrient availability is the result of increased culture species diversity however large amounts of feces and uneaten nutrients will remain in the system negatively impacting water quality therefore feed is vital in controlling aquaculture water quality 4 2 3 wetlands and phytoremediation wetland is an economical system to help the culturist to reduce the pollution towards the surrounding environment by performing several processes including nitrification denitrification demineralization in the present of living plants bacteria fungus and non living organism soil water light air minerals 85 the performance of the wetland is depending on the design and configuration of the wetland nutrient availability water salinity and root characteristics 86 lin et al 87 have reported at least 98 nitrogen removal from the aquaculture wastewater after a few months operation however the increased hydraulic loading rate leads to a decrease in wetland performance which results to a decrease in the removal efficiency of suspended solids in aquaculture wastewater 88 phytoremediation is an emerging technology that uses living plants to reduce the toxicity of the aquaculture environment this method largely depends on the selectivity of plants that contribute to the main function of the treatment ghaly et al 89 have shown that plants such as barley oat and rye have different pollutant removal percentages due to differences in growth rate and disease resistance according to chavan et al 90 the implementation of phytoremediation technique in the wetland system can provide better contaminants removal and the operation is simple and cost effective like the wetland system several factors affect the performance of phytoremediation such as a good rooting system high biomass source and high growth rate 91 92 table 4 summarizes the research on the removal of pollutants through phytoremediation based on the types of plants used in addition liu et al 93 made some improvements by isolating several types of microalgae to achieve high pollutant removal from actual aquaculture wastewater 4 3 physicochemical physicochemical treatment of aquaculture wastewater involves the separation and degradation of wastes from the wastewater the removals of undesired substances are predominantly achieved by refining the properties of the treatment technologies to deal with the different characteristics of the substances to treat them physically chemically or the combination of both examples of the physicochemical treatment methods deployed in the aquaculture industry include adsorption aops and membranes 4 3 1 adsorption adsorption is a potential treatment technology employed to purify aquaculture wastewater in the adsorption process the substances to be treated adsorbate are captured by the adsorbent fig 6 thereby separating the undesired substances from the bulk fluid the adsorbent usually consists of a highly porous surface at which the adsorbate could accumulate and retain the bonding between the adsorbate and the adsorbent are generally governed by van der waals forces covalent bonding or electrostatic attraction adsorption has several well known advantages for instance low cost handy operation and resistance to toxic chemicals 99 an effective absorbent must be inert and have a large superficial area to boost the adsorption efficiency 100 thus a huge variation of absorbents has been explored to achieve the desired separation efficiency ammonia and phosphorus are common constituent in aquaculture wastewater and they must be eliminated to minimize harm to fish farms and the surrounding environment several researchers have studied adsorption technology to separate ammonia and phosphorus from aquaculture wastewater in an investigation conducted by zadinelo et al 100 with real fish farming water containing 0 84 mg l of ammonium ions as the target substance the smectite clays with various chemical compositions are used to adsorb ammonium ions by using 0 5 w w clay 93 of ammonium ions were successfully removed chitosan was deployed to adsorb ammonia from several fish farms in the city of palotina pr in bernardi et al s 8 study for fish farm water with an ammonia content of 0 14 0 27 and 0 50 mg l the removal efficiency of ammonia was 100 showing the great potential of chitosan as an adsorbent to treat aquaculture wastewater in order to treat another common contaminant kumararaja et al 101 harnessed aluminium pillared bentonite as an adsorbent to remove the phosphate in aquaculture wastewater it was found that the removal efficiency varied with the salinity of the discharged water several samples of aquaculture wastewater were collected for the study including the waters of shrimp farm and fish larval ponds the resulting phosphate removal rate reached 85 3 to 99 6 adsorption is more commonly used to treat therapeutic substances in aquaculture wastewater aitcheson et al 102 studied the adsorption behavior of four therapeutants oxytetracycline malachite green formaldehyde and chloramine t on coal based activated carbon 207ea the criticality to remove these substances was highlighted when oxytetracycline was found to persist in the sediment for several months and it encourages the growth of oxytetracycline resistant bacteria malachite green is known to promote liver tumor and is toxic to mammalian cells while formaldehyde is a probable human carcinogen chloramine t s organic trihalomethane byproducts may also be carcinogenic by altering the ph temperature and ionic strength the highest adsorption efficiency of oxytetracycline malachite green formaldehyde and chloramine t were 88 100 99 and 99 respectively another antibiotic under the tetracycline family found in aquaculture wastewater namely the chlortetracycline ctc was adsorbed onto lanthanum modified zeolite la z by yu et al 103 according to reports both internal and external diffusion in a multi step process are the controlling factors of the la z adsorption rate in that experiment 98 4 of removal rate was attained with the initial ctc concentration of 5 mg l 20 min adsorption time and ph 7 apart from being a standalone technology adsorption can also be combined with ras to maximize the separation efficiency of undesired components in an effort to separate tricaine methanesulfonate ms 222 from a real aquaculture wastewater ferreira et al 104 incorporated an adsorption process to ras using pyrolyzed biological paper mill sludge as an adsorbent the aquaculture effluent was under the conditions of 18 19 c 20 21 salinity and ph 7 7 5 during the experiment the dissolved organic carbon and inorganic carbon content in the effluent did not compete with ms 222 to occupy adsorption sites on the adsorbent the examined adsorbent proved to be effective when the adsorption efficiency of the aquaculture wastewater was similar to that evaluated using ultrapure water adsorption can also be integrated with photocatalysis process zeolite was coupled with tio2 by nomura et al 105 to remove sulfamonomethoxine smm and its intermediates in freshwater aquaculture wastewater when tio2 was used alone the degradation of smm was inhibited while the usage of composite zeolite tio2 alleviates the issue the composite zeolite tio2 also demonstrated their efficacy when the evaluated smm was decomposed completely within 30 min 4 3 2 advanced oxidation process the advanced oxidation process aop mechanism is initiated by highly reactive oxidants mainly hydroxyl radicals oh which accelerate the oxidation and degradation of a large number of pollutants in wastewater as described by eq 1 1 organic species oh c o 2 h 2 o inorganic ions the reactive oxidants applied in the wastewater are capable to oxidize the undesired compounds in the water unselectively the contaminants in the water would be effectively disintegrated from the original form once reacted with the reactive species besides oh superoxide radicals o2 hydroperoyl radicals ho2 sulfate radicals so4 and organic peroxyl radicals roo generated from hydrogen peroxide h2o2 or ozone o3 are formed in aop the formation of these radicals can be attained by several methods such as ozonation ultraviolet uv irradiation fenton oxidation photocatalysis or combination of these technologies in most cases the applications of aop are to treat organic compounds as shown in table 5 the different types of aop processes used are capable to degrade various organic constituents in aquaculture effluent in addition to the organic compounds listed in table 5 aop is mainly use to degrade antibiotics in aquaculture wastewater the research of liu et al 112 used green synthesized rgo nfe pd nanocomposite to successfully remove 77 9 rifampicin antibiotics from aquaculture wastewater during the fenton oxidation process another common antibiotic found in aquatic farming sulfamonomethoxine smm was treated by nomura et al 113 using a rotating advanced oxidation contactor equipped with high silica zeolite tio2 an almost perfect degradation was achieved after 3 h of aop application besides smm the treatment process developed in the study can also remove the conversion by products of smm from fresh aquaculture wastewater faww without being affected by coexisting substances in faww in another study pereira et al 114 initiated the photocatalysis of oxalinic acid and oxytetracycline oxalinic acid and oxytetracycline are the two most extensively found antibiotics in aquaculture water in that study tio2 was suspended on a pilot plant scale under natural solar radiation with an initial concentration of 20 mg l of separate oxa and otc as well as a mixture of oxa otc the photocatalytic treatment successfully removed antibiotics with 100 efficiency the cumulative uv energy required per liter of solution was very low at approximately 1 kjuv l demonstrating that the process is sustainable in that study it was reported that although several inorganic ions including cl so4 2 no3 nh4 and hco3 did not interfere with the degradation process of oxa and otc the presence of po4 3 affected the efficiency of photocatalysis employing tio2 hence when using tio2 photocatalyst to treat wastewater with complex constituent the presence of po4 3 must be considered the efficacy of aop which was the ultimate goal of the treatment process was focused in the narration above in a more thorough view the entire technical operation process involves many other components and mechanisms revealing the overall advantages and disadvantages of the aop as listed in table 6 it is explicit that aop offers superior treatment efficiency for organic compounds yet there are some limitations that may jeopardize the sustainability of the process 4 3 3 membranes separation technology the application of membrane aquaculture wastewater treatment is rising as the experimental results of using membrane in both the laboratory and on site are promising membrane technologies has shown great potential in eliminating fine contaminants found in aquaculture effluent including organic compounds viruses and pathogenic bacteria 116 117 the operation mechanism of membranes varied based on the types and configurations in general membranes act as a separation unit that filter undesired substances from the water the membrane which serves as a selective barrier would allow certain molecules to pass through while refraining other substances from penetrating through the membrane separation of the contaminants from the wastewater are hence achieved nonetheless membranes technology is often plagued by fouling issues in which the flux declines over time due to the deposition of undesired substance on the membrane surface that clogged the membrane pores 118 119 a research by widiasa et al 118 reported that the fouling behavior depends on the membrane pore size and the type of foulant the constituents in an aquaculture system are complex and their characteristics are also varied thus the specifications of the membranes used in the treatment such as molecular weight cut off surface characteristics and materials are tuned to achieve the best separation performance and minimize fouling in the respective researches studies employing membrane technologies in treating aquaculture wastewater are summarized in table 7 in addition to its own efficiency membrane also involves in technology integration to further improve the efficacy of aquaculture wastewater treatment 125 some studies have associated membrane to recirculating aquaculture system holan et al 126 pointed out that the conventional systems in ras faces the challenge of removing fine solid particles 35 μm and colloidal particles 1 μm the challenge can lead to the accumulation of particles and harm the cultured species a biofilm membrane bioreactor bf mbr was then introduced in the ras water treatment system to ease the challenge the results showed that the installed ultrafiltration membrane was capable to remove colloidal particles and reduce the turbidity to 44 and 77 respectively which was typically much lower than the turbidity obtained in conventional systems besides lowering the bacteria concentrations up to 80 the ammonia content was also reduced by 56 compared to conventional system in the experiment healthier cod larvae with higher survival rate and growth rate were obtained other than integrating ras and membrane systems sharrer et al 127 also investigated the function of mbr in the treatment of wastewater from ras cultured rainbow trout in the study the mbr can remove up to 99 98 and 99 99 of total suspended solids and total volatile solids respectively excellent removal efficiencies of up to 95 5 and 96 1 have also been achieved in the removal of total nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater widiasa et al 118 included fouling studies in their effort to use polysulfone ultrafiltration uf membranes 10 50 and 100 kda in the ras system to remove contaminants from aquaculture wastewater according to their investigation 100 kda membrane was the most promising uf membrane for ras owing to its highest flux without compromising the rejection of contaminants in aquaculture wastewater the 100 kda uf membrane successfully removed humic acid and shrimp feed at 94 5 and 99 3 respectively and simultaneously removed microalgae pathogenic bacteria vibrio harveyi and viruses ihhnv infection hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus from the effluent 5 sustainable development of aquaculture as summarized aquaculture is booming globally to bridge the gap between the supply and demand of fishery products which has aroused the attention to the treatment of wastewater in order to minimize the impact of aquaculture on the environment it is projected that the world population will exceed approximately 9 billion by 2050 128 as micronutrient deficiency is still an urgent problem for a growing population the rapid growth of aquaculture is anticipated to provide people with sufficient essential proteins and micronutrients 129 nevertheless the efforts to ensure food source for the population should not be tied to sacrificing the well being of the surrounding environment although a plenty of aquaculture treatment technologies were introduced in section 4 the regulation on the discharge of for aquaculture wastewater is vague in many countries and there is no clear standard for the safety level of constituents especially the cec content in the wastewater 7 in coherence with the rapid development of the aquaculture industry it is utterly important for academia government and industry to establish partnerships to critically plan and implement sustainable development strategies for the aquaculture industry 128 the aquaculture industry regulations must be drafted and executed as a comprehensive guideline for the entire life cycle of aquaculture 5 1 aquaculture regulations aquaculture is usually operated by several departments so it is necessary to implement regulations to supervise each division to ensure the efficiency and safety of aquatic production 130 some non government organizations such as global aquaculture alliance gaa and international finance corporation ifc have established wastewater standards for aquaculture gaa recommends aquaculture farmers to adopt environmentally responsible production methods to ensure the discharged effluent complies with standards ifc provides low interest loans to developing countries to encourage the development of aquaculture projects that comply to water quality standards on the government side many countries such as the united states have established aquaculture regulations based on sewage standards the us environmental protection agency has made rule making procedures for aquaculture 131 other countries such as thailand and taiwan imposed aquaculture effluent standards which involved several parameters including total suspended solids tss ph biochemical oxygen demand bod and cod for thailand the effluent discharged from the aquaculture farm shall meet specifications of ph 6 5 to 9 0 bod not exceeding 20 mg l tss lesser than 70 mg l and total nitrogen not more than 4 0 mgn l for taiwan the aquaculture effluent should have ph between 6 0 and 9 0 tss not more than 30 mg l bod and cod lesser than 30 and 100 mg l respectively 132 in china there are three different wastewater discharge standards which can be further categorized into five grades of sub standards for aquaculture the standard applied is the environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 133 it is recommended that countries without clear regulations for aquaculture can follow the effluent standard drafted by gaa and ifc some countries like malaysia that has not enforce regulations for aquaculture embraced alternatives by using guidelines of environmental quality industrial effluent regulation 2009 as the main reference for aquaculture wastewater discharge standards 3 6 conclusions aquaculture has become the world s main fresh food production sector forcing culturists to compete in the market because of this demand improper feeding practices and the use of pharmaceutical products have posed a risk to the environment this article reviews the current aquaculture treatment technology classified as ras biological aops absorption and membrane to achieve the goal of zero discharge of aquaculture wastewater traditional ras is a commonly used closed system technology in the aquaculture field however due to some limitations of ras researchers have been motivated to upgrade the current ras to improve system efficiency by introducing additional treatment technology the major challenges of biological and adsorption are the selection of specific macrophytes and adsorbents respectively it has been found that some macrophytes and adsorbents are highly dependent on the source of nutrients in aquaculture wastewater aop on the other hand is considered to be one of the potential solutions for the degradation of cec however major drawbacks of aop have been identified such as the generation of toxic by products membrane treatment can simultaneously remove cec and nutrient recovery nevertheless due to the accumulation of suspended solids in wastewater membrane fouling and instability would occur furthermore membrane fouling leads to increased operating costs due to frequent replacement of membrane since multiple functions can be used in one process hybrid technology offers better treatment than independent methods nonetheless the technology appears to be in its early stages and additional research on its effectiveness and system optimization is needed as a result when designing treatments for the pilot scale researchers must consider a variety of factors through appropriate treatment methods the ultimate goal of reducing environmental pollution can be achieved funding this research was funded by the university of sains malaysia s long term

13096,the eutrophication of reservoir water leads to the proliferation of algae the daf process can overcome the lack of algae removal capacity in conventional treatment processes and its pollution removal efficiency is affected by the equipment performance among daf equipment multiphase flow pumps have attracted attention because of their simple configuration and low failure rate this paper studied the equipment performance and pollution removal efficiency of a multiphase flow pump for daf the results showed that the dissolution efficiency of the equipment was approximately 55 and the average particle size of bubbles was less than 26 μm when the pressure was greater than 0 36 mpa the bubble stability time exceeded 4 min the optimal working conditions were achieved at a dissolved gas pressure of 0 4 mpa the maximum removal rates of turbidity chlorophyll a toc uv254 and codmn by the daf process were 56 49 50 23 23 73 28 75 and 23 98 respectively the trend in pollution removal efficiency was consistent with that of equipment performance parameters the surface of the microbubbles was hydrophobic and could more easily adsorb high molecular weight organic substances with strong hydrophobicity and algae with strongly hydrophobic colloidal layers inside in addition regarding the thmfp the experimental results showed that the removal rates of the precursors chcl3 chbrcl2 and chbr2cl after daf were 28 93 23 26 and 21 53 respectively surface hydrophobicity is one of the main mechanisms by which microbubbles adhere to pollutants keywords multiphase flow pump air

suva characteristic uv absorbance 1 introduction as a drinking water resource in china lake reservoir water plays a pivotal role in the national urban water supply system 1 however when water sources are limited large basin water sources with a high organic content such as the yellow river and the yangtze river are constantly introduced into lake reservoir water the composition of pollutants in water becomes increasingly complex resulting in serious water eutrophication extensive algae growth and seasonal fluctuations 2 which are difficult to address by conventional coagulation and sedimentation processes 3 in contrast the daf process which is a widely used algae removal technology can effectively remove algae and other microorganisms while removing turbidity and oil 4 5 the principle of the daf process for algae removal is the production of a large number of microbubbles to collide with and adhere to light colloids in water forming air entrained flocs which float to the water surface and are effectively removed 6 8 the air entrained flocs formed during the daf process are largely affected by the operating conditions for coagulation and daf an appropriate combination of conditions can produce a large number of microbubbles with moderate size the microbubble particle size is uniform and smaller than the floc particle size which can adhere well to the surface of particles and effectively improve the pollution removal effect 9 10 therefore the performance of daf equipment directly affects the decontamination efficiency of the daf process among the many types of air flotation equipment pressurized daf equipment is the most widely used at home and abroad 11 12 this kind of air flotation equipment can produce a large number of microbubbles with uniform particle size and long term stability in water 13 which is convenient for maintenance and management however the traditional pressurized daf system is composed of a dissolved air pump dissolved air tank and air compressor which occupy a large space and consume a large amount of energy in contrast multiphase flow pumps can dissolve air directly without an air compressor dissolved air tank or other equipment to produce water containing dissolved air release microbubbles and save energy 14 at present multiphase flow pumps have been applied in domestic water treatment the jianghua water treatment equipment company introduced the edur germany multiphase flow pump for daf with this pump the whole gas dissolution process is completed simultaneously at elevated pump pressures significantly improving the sewage treatment effect 15 zhu et al 16 conducted an experimental study on the application of a gas liquid mixing pump to the treatment of low concentration secondary effluent via daf and achieved good results shi 17 combined the multiphase flow pump air flotation process with sedimentation and ultrafiltration processes his research showed that the sequential sedimentation air flotation process can effectively remove particulate matter and aromatic macromolecular nom and the combined air flotation ultrafiltration process can effectively remove nh4 n small molecule nom and pathogenic bacteria however there are few studies on the treatment of high algae reservoir water by the multiphase flow pump daf process furthermore the performance of air flotation equipment directly affects the pollution removal efficiency of the air flotation process but currently the multiphase flow pumps used in daf generally have problems such as uneven operational parameters therefore it is necessary to explore the performance of multiphase flow pumps for daf and their optimal operating parameters to improve the daf system and improve the water purification effect of the daf process to explore the relationship between the performance of multiphase flow pump equipment and reservoir water pollution removal efficiency a pilot study on the performance parameters gas dissolution efficiency microbubble particle size bubble stability time etc of daf equipment and the key factors dissolved gas pressure coagulant dosage air intake reflux ratio etc affecting the treatment effect of daf was performed and the adhesion mechanism between microbubbles and flocs was expounded the results are intended to provide a technical reference for the evaluation and improvement of daf equipment in water plants 2 experimental part 2 1 chemicals methyl tert butyl ether and ascorbic acid were obtained from aladdin shanghai china and both were analytical reagent grade sulfuric acid sodium hydroxide acetone sodium chloride sodium hypochlorite pafc potassium permanganate and sodium oxalate were all of analytical reagent grade and purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent company shanghai china 2 2 raw water quality the water used in this experiment was raw water from the quehua reservoir and the ranges of various water quality indices are shown in table 1 2 3 experimental device and process the flotation sedimentation tank of the pilot test facility of the jinan quehua water plant was selected as the test site and the designed water flow rate of the pilot test equipment was 8 m3 h the volume size of daf area was 2 4 1 2 2 15 m3 the contact time was 1 min and the rising speed of the separation chamber was 1 63 mm s an eb3u multiphase flow pump and three sf series gas dissolvers two in the daf contact chamber and one in the secondary reaction area were used in the experiment the experimental device is shown in fig 1 the g value of primary mixing was 70 000 s 1 and that of secondary mixing was 15 000 s 1 the device ran continuously for 30 h under each set of working conditions and samples were taken every 2 h 2 3 1 experimental process the raw water entered the mixing tank through the raw water pipeline entered the flocculation tank after fully mixing with the flocculant and then flowed into the contact area of the daf tank from the opening at the bottom of the flocculation tank when the water level of the flotation sedimentation tank exceeded the elevation of the multiphase flow pump the multiphase flow pump was opened and the opening of the inlet valve of the dissolved air pump was increased after the dissolved air pump operated stably the pressure reducing valve was opened and the opening of the pressure reducing valve was adjusted according to the pressure gauge reading until the predetermined pressure value was reached after the dissolved air containing water in the dissolved air tank was fully mixed and had been stable for a period of time milk colored liquid began to appear in the daf tank which indicated stable daf operation 2 4 analytical indices and detection methods 2 4 1 conventional indicators the basic indicators of daf algae removal include turbidity do toc uv254 and codmn turbidity was measured by a scattered light turbidimeter 2100n hach usa do content was measured by a multiparameter water quality detector multi 3410 wtw germany doc was measured by a toc analyzer toc v cph shimadzu japan uv254 was determined by a uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1810 purkinje china codmn was determined by the acidic potassium permanganate method 2 4 2 other indicators other indicators were determined in accordance with water and wastewater detection and analysis methods fourth edition 18 1 chlorophyll a content was analyzed with a dds 307a conductivity meter first the algae were trapped on a 0 45 μm membrane by a vacuum filter and chlorophyll a was extracted with 80 acetone solution then ultrasonication was performed for 40 min in an ice bath and the samples were stored in a refrigerator for 12 h after extraction ultrasonication was performed for 20 min in an ice bath the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm and the supernatant was extracted after extraction the absorbance at 630 nm 645 nm 663 nm and 750 nm was measured by uv spectrophotometry and finally the concentration of chlorophyll a in the water sample was calculated according to the following formula 2 1 chlorophyll a 11 64 d 663 d 750 2 16 d 645 d 750 0 10 d 630 d 750 v 1 v δ where d is absorbency v is the volume of the water sample l and v1 is the extract volume after adjustment to a constant volume ml 2 the molecular weight of macromolecular hydrophobic organics was measured by lc ocd by using a large water quality analysis instrument developed by german doc labor company the detection conditions for lc ocd were as follows the injection volume was 1000 μl and the total running time of each sample was 70 min the experimental results were obtained by peak integration of the experimental results with specific software 3 the thmfp was determined according to usepa standard method 5710b a 100 ml water sample was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and transferred to a brown sample bottle an appropriate amount of kh2po4 naoh buffer solution ph 7 was added to the bottle followed by naclo the chlorine dosage was calculated as follows 2 2 effective chlorine dosage mg l 7 6 nh 3 n 3 doc 10 mg l when the ph reached 7 0 0 2 the water sample was placed in an incubator for reaction for 5 days then 0 2 mg l ascorbic acid was added to terminate the reaction and the sample was extracted with 50 ml methyl tert butyl ether the total amount of thms was determined by headspace gas chromatography 6890 n agilent usa and considered the thmfp content in the water 4 fluorescent organic matter three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectra of the water samples were acquired with a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan equipped with a xenon lamp as the excitation source the excitation and emission slit widths were 5 nm and 3 nm respectively the spectra were scanned over excitation wavelengths of 200 450 nm and emission wavelengths of 200 550 nm with increments of 5 nm the scanning speed was 12 00 nm min deionized water was used as the blank to neutralize the influence of rayleigh and raman scattering during fluorescence regional integration calculations 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of the performance of daf equipment 3 1 1 determination and analysis of air dissolution efficiency the relationship between the theoretical and actual release volumes at an experimental water temperature of approximately 6 c and gas liquid ratio of 2 is shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the actual measured gas released was smaller than the theoretical value and the gas dissolution efficiency was less than 55 this was because during the continuous measurement the dissolved air containing water flowed out from the upper end of the surge tank the liquid flow state in the surge tank was unstable and the pressure reflux ratio and other parameters of daf operation changed under the influence of the device thus the actual value was low when the dissolved gas pressure was 0 36 0 44 mpa the gas dissolution efficiency was relatively stable when the dissolved gas pressure exceeded 0 44 mpa the actual measured gas release tended to be stable the theoretical dissolved gas in the water gradually increased with increasing pressure however with increasing pressure to a certain amount the actual amount of dissolved air in the water remained basically unchanged therefore the gas dissolution efficiency decreased with increasing dissolved gas pressure in addition the air dissolution tank used in the experiment was an empty tank without any filler and as a result the air dissolution efficiency was approximately 30 lower than that of a tank with filler 19 3 1 2 determination and analysis of bubble stability time fig 3 shows that when the gas liquid ratio was constant the bubble stability time increased with increasing pressure when the pressure exceeded 0 44 mpa the microbubble stability time began to decrease except when the gas liquid ratio was 2 6 from 0 4 mpa to 0 48 mpa the stability time of microbubbles changed little and the daf operation was relatively stable at this time when the gas liquid ratio was 2 6 or 1 4 the bubble stability time was significantly lower than that under other working conditions as shown in fig 3 when the gas liquid ratio was relatively low 1 4 the amount of compressed gas entering the dissolved gas pump was low resulting in little dissolved gas in the water so the stability time was relatively short when the gas liquid ratio was relatively high 2 6 the liquid flowing into the dissolved gas pump and the vacuum in the pump were reduced so the air in the inlet pipe could not be exhausted and the gas liquid mixture in the pump was difficult to pump into the surge tank therefore the amount of gas in the released gas liquid mixture was large and the degree of bubble breakage was insufficient resulting in an increase in large bubbles in the water and greatly reduced existence time of bubbles when the pressure remained unchanged and the gas liquid ratio was between 1 7 and 2 3 the bubble stability time changed little indicating that a better milky color of the liquid would be observed for a gas liquid ratio within this range when the pressure decreased the amount of dissolved gas in water was low and more large bubbles were generated during gas release resulting in insufficient bubble stability time that is the quality of micro nanobubbles was not good according to the change trend in fig 3 it can be concluded that the bubble containing water produced by the device met the experimental requirements when the pressure was 0 4 mpa and the gas liquid ratio was 1 7 3 1 3 measurement and analysis of bubble particle size 3 1 3 1 particle size and distribution of microbubbles analysis of the performance of the multiphase flow pump at the pilot test facility of the quehua water plant indicated that when the dissolved gas pressure of the equipment decreased the daf effect was poor and the operation was extremely unstable therefore to study the size of microbubbles generated by the equipment and find the optimal working conditions measurements were conducted under pressures of 0 36 0 60 mpa to ensure the reliability of the data and reduce experimental error the number of microbubbles measured under each working condition was not less than 1000 the probability density distribution of the microbubble size obtained with the equipment at pressures of 0 36 0 60 mpa is shown in fig 4 when the pressure was 0 36 mpa the maximum frequency diameter of microbubbles was 15 μm corresponding to a frequency of 49 with increasing pressure the peak value of the probability density distribution gradually shifted to the right but the shift amplitude was not very large and the microbubble diameter with the highest frequency remained within the range 16 20 μm when the pressure reached 0 40 mpa the operation of the daf equipment was relatively stable when the pressure was appropriately increased the range of bubble particle sizes and the size with the highest frequency did not change significantly the microbubble diameter data remained relatively concentrated indicating that the daf equipment could produce a large number of microbubbles with a relatively uniform particle size at 0 40 mpa and achieve a relatively stable operation state when the pressure rose to 0 60 mpa the number of relatively large bubbles in the equipment increased and the main distribution range of bubble particle size was 10 38 μm the particle size with the highest frequency was 23 μm overall with increasing pressure the bubble particle size did not decrease significantly and the operation was relatively stable the reason for this phenomenon was that the negative pressure value in the pipeline changed with the change in pressure so a set air intake could not be fixed although the dissolved gas pressure changed the gas water ratio also changed slightly so the bubble particle size did not gradually decrease with increasing pressure 3 1 3 2 bubble number density and average particle size because the microbubbles had a large specific surface area the greater the density of the bubbles was the greater the adhesion probability with light colloids in the water microbubbles with a particle size of 20 60 μm met the specified requirements of daf assuming that the generated bubbles were uniform in size and there was no coalescence or fragmentation between bubbles the number of bubbles was determined as follows 3 1 n v 4 3 π r 3 where n is the number of bubbles per unit volume v is the unit volume 1 cm3 and r is the average radius of the bubbles μm fig 5 shows the variation of average particle size and bubble number density with dissolved gas pressure when the pressure was in the range of 0 36 0 48 mpa the bubble particle size changed little with increasing pressure and the bubble number density was stable in the range of 225 000 245 000 cm 3 indicating that the daf effect was good during operation within this pressure range and that the bubble density at the water surface of the daf tank was high see fig 6 a and b at 0 52 mpa the bubble number density decreased sharply indicating that the daf effect of the equipment began to deteriorate the number of large bubbles began to increase and the height of the milk colored water layer in the daf tank decreased at the water surface of the tank the bubble density was low the tank was clear and the daf effect was poor see fig 6 c 3 1 4 determination and analysis of do the multiphase flow pump was operated at a dissolved air pressure of 0 4 mpa water tank temperature of 6 c and initial do value of 11 85 mg l after the operation of the daf system was stable the water in the daf tank gradually turned white and milky in color which indicated that the operation effect of the daf equipment was very good the variation trend of the do content in water with bubble stability time is shown in fig 7 after daf the do value of the water was 12 72 mg l which is higher than the theoretical saturated do value 12 42 mg l of clean water at the same temperature and pressure the do value for traditional daf equipment is close to this value fig 7 shows that the do in the water decreased rapidly in the first 30 s with the gradual disappearance of bubbles and the diffusion of do in the water the rate of decline in do value began to slow until the value stabilized at a level consistent with the do content in clean water 3 2 operational effect of daf equipment 3 2 1 algae turbidity removal efficiency fig 8 suggests that with increasing coagulant dosage the removal rates of turbidity and chlorophyll a first increased and then decreased under different pressure and reflux ratio conditions the turbidity removal rate was the highest when the coagulant dosage was 4 mg l while the chlorophyll a removal rate was the highest when the coagulant dosage was 6 mg l fig 8 a b shows that when the coagulant dosage was constant the turbidity and chlorophyll a removal efficiency decreased overall with increasing dissolved gas pressure and their highest removal rates were 56 49 and 59 56 respectively when the pressure was 0 4 mpa it can be seen from the previous section that when the dissolved gas pressure rose to 0 44 mpa the gas dissolution efficiency of the equipment reached the maximum however as the pressure continued to rise the gas dissolution efficiency began to decline and the microbubble particle size began to change greatly indicating that the operation of the daf equipment was not stable during the pressure rise so the removal rate began to decrease the results for various reflux ratios are shown in fig 8 c d the turbidity removal efficiency was the best when the reflux ratio was 25 and the turbidity removal rate reached 56 49 fig 8 c fig 8 d shows that when the dosage of coagulant remained unchanged with an increase in the reflux ratio the removal of chlorophyll a first gradually increased and then tended to stabilize which was consistent with relevant research results 20 indicating that increasing the reflux ratio could increase the bubble concentration in water and promote the collision and adhesion of microbubbles and particles in the influent however increasing the reflux ratio of dissolved air containing water would increase the working load of the reflux pump therefore in practical production and applications economic factors should be considered and an appropriate dissolved gas pressure and reflux ratio should be selected to save energy consumption 3 2 2 removal efficiency of organic matter according to fig 9 a b c as the dissolved gas pressure increased from 0 40 mpa the removal rates of toc uv254 and cod by the daf process gradually decreased reaching maxima at 0 40 mpa with values of 30 96 39 17 and 37 31 respectively the reductions in the removal rates were due to the instability of the air water ratio when the pressure increased and the resulting deviations in the bubble number density and particle size distribution were large as shown in fig 2 when the pressure reached 0 44 mpa the gas dissolution efficiency began to decline therefore the gas water ratio was relatively stable and the operation effect was relatively good when the gas dissolution pressure was 0 4 mpa as shown in fig 9 d e f with an increase in the reflux ratio toc and codmn first increased and then decreased and the removal rate of uv254 decreased when the reflux ratio increased from 20 to 25 the removal efficiency of toc increased from 23 6 to 29 91 the removal efficiency of codmn increased from 27 06 to 37 31 and the removal efficiency of uv254 decreased whose highest removal rate was 42 08 when the reflux ratio was 20 when the reflux ratio increased from 25 to 30 the removal rates of the above indices decreased by 2 9 20 08 and 12 28 respectively from fig 9 overall as the dosage of coagulant increased the removal rate of each index increased and tended to become stable and the influence of the reflux ratio on the removal effect was higher than those of dissolved gas pressure and dosage after the coagulation stage negatively charged organic molecules in the water and positively charged metal ions in the coagulant were destabilized through the action of electrical neutralization to form flocs which collided and adhered to the microbubbles in addition the organic compounds containing benzene rings and aromatic macromolecules in the water were hydrophobic and the microbubbles had a hydrophobic surface thus these components could sorb to each other and organic colloids and bubbles formed air entrained flocs which then floated to the water surface for removal 3 3 analysis of the decontamination mechanism of daf equipment 3 3 1 removal efficiency of algae scanning analysis of the algae content in water before and after daf is shown in fig 10 and the data indicate that algae were suspended in the form of stable colloids before and after daf after daf the effluent algae content was significantly reduced and the morphology of algae cells had not changed indicating that the daf process had effectively removed algae without damaging the cells and the substances in the cells had not flowed out this process effectively avoided the release of toxic substances in algae which is also an advantage of applying daf for algae removal the surfaces of microbubbles are negatively charged and hydrophobic and most algae surfaces are also negatively charged after adding the coagulant the surfaces of algae flocs are positively charged the electrostatic interaction between bubbles and algae flocs promotes adhesion between them however for surfaces with high hydrophobicity the electrostatic effect is relatively weak and the hydrophobicity of the algal surface is one of the main mechanisms promoting adhesion between algal cells and microbubbles hydrophobic attraction between microbubbles and algal cells promoted the adhesion of bubbles to the surface of algal cells to form algal aggregates fig 10 thus improving the capture and collection efficiency in the process of bubble flotation the adhesion between bubbles and particles can usually be explained by dlvo theory micromolecular forces such as hydrophobic van der waals and electrostatic forces exist between the bubble surface and algal cell surface the removal of algae by microbubbles is due to the colloidal layer inside algae which has a strong hydrophobic effect the surface of the algae and hydrophobic microbubbles easily combine and the algae float to the water surface 3 3 2 removal efficiency of fluorescent organic matter fig 11 shows five obvious fluorescence peaks i e a c b f and t in the raw water indicating that there was abundant dom in the raw water 21 as shown in the figure the fluorescence peak areas of area iv and area v were relatively high area iv represents microbial metabolites in water and area v represents ha like organic matter the b and t2 peaks in these two areas represent tyrosine and tryptophan in the ultraviolet region respectively and both had a maximum light absorption at a wavelength of 280 nm this indicates that the dom was mainly humic organic matter and soluble protein after coagulation and daf organic substances in the water were removed to varying degrees and the reductions in peak a and peak f were relatively large hydrophobic polymeric organic substances were mainly removed by adhesion to microbubbles and flotation to the water surface with the bubbles because the surface of the microbubbles was hydrophobic the interface energy was reduced the microbubbles more easily adsorbed substances with good hydrophobicity which is in line with the thermodynamic theory of collision adhesion 22 3 3 3 removal efficiency of dbp precursors daf can appropriately reduce the content of organic matter in water but some nom still enters the next stage and reacts with chlorine disinfectants to produce dbps in the process of water purification it is very important to inhibit the production of dbps by effectively controlling the dbpfp 23 to investigate the effect of the multiphase flow pump daf process on the removal of dbpfp doc uv254 the suva and thm precursors were selected as alternative parameters to dbpfp content to monitor dbpfp levels in the effluent of the daf process the experimental removal results are shown in table 2 suva is the ratio of uv254 to doc which can reflect the humification degree of organic matter the relative content of unsaturated double bonds or aromatic rings in organic matter and the structural orientation of organic matter suva can be used as an indicator of dbpfp 24 in the surface water of the united states suva ranges from 1 4 to 5 5 suva 3 indicates that the organic pollutants in the water mainly contain nonhumus materials while suva 3 indicates that the pollutants in the water mainly contain humus the suva in the effluent after air flotation was reduced to 2 19 indicating that a certain amount of humus like organic matter had been removed the above table shows that the removal rate of uv254 by the daf process was higher than that of doc and the removal rates were 35 85 and 31 62 respectively which is consistent with the results obtained in fig 9 daf had a certain inhibitory effect on dbpfp the experimental results show that the removal rates of the precursors chcl3 chbrcl2 and chbr2cl after daf were 28 93 23 26 and 21 53 respectively reducing subsequent thms production 3 3 4 organic compounds with different molecular weights according to the analysis of organic matter with different molecular weights in raw water from the quehua reservoir organic matter with a molecular weight of 3 10 kda accounted for a large proportion i e 47 37 of the total dom and organic matter with a molecular weight greater than 3 kda accounted for 76 19 of the total dom it can be concluded that the raw water contained more organic matter with a high molecular weight as shown in fig 12 the removal rate of organics with molecular weights greater than 3 kda by daf was 41 13 higher than that of organics with molecular weights less than 3 kda the removal effect of daf for small molecule organics was minor and the removal efficiency was less than 10 therefore it can be concluded that the removal effect of organics with high molecular weights was better 3 3 5 removal efficiency of macromolecular hydrophobic organics lc ocd is a technique for qualitative and quantitative analysis of dom in water based on sec using ultraviolet organic nitrogen detector and organic carbon infrared detector 25 in recent years lc ocd has been widely used in the characterization of nom in drinking water the study of membrane pollution characteristics and the detection and characterization of algal don 26 table 3 shows the quantitative analytical results for the removal effect of each component by daf table 3 shows that the content of hydrophobic organic compounds hydrophobic organic carbon in the incoming raw water of the quehua water plant was relatively small and that most components were hydrophilic organic carbon the contents of bp hs bb lmwa and lmwn in the raw water accounted for 8 55 14 3 and 20 respectively protein accounted for approximately 35 of bp with an n c ratio of approximately 0 12 indicating that the nitrogen content in the raw water was low the don content in hs was 0 088 mg l and ha degradation products accounted for 14 of all products it can be concluded that the organic matter in the raw water was mainly hs after daf treatment the removal rates of bp hs bb lmwa and lmwn were 44 87 24 20 6 20 100 and 7 46 respectively after the reaction the proportion of protein in bp decreased by 3 and the average molecular weight of hs decreased from 377 kda to 298 kda which further proved that the microbubbles could adsorb macromolecular hoc in water the content of ha degradation products in the effluent increased by 5 due to the poor stability of ha it is very easily decomposed and microbubbles release oh when broken which can oxidize macromolecular organics slightly increasing the content of ha degradation products in the water 4 conclusion 1 the operation of multiphase flow pump daf equipment met the requirements of experimental analysis and production the average efficiency was less than 55 the do content produced was 12 72 mg l at a temperature of 6 c through a process optimization experiment the optimal operating conditions were obtained which were 0 4 mpa pressure 25 reflux ratio and 4 mg l pafc dosage allowing stable equipment performance and the achievement of relevant specifications 2 the multiphase flow pump daf process was used to carry out pollution removal efficiency tests under optimal

13096,the eutrophication of reservoir water leads to the proliferation of algae the daf process can overcome the lack of algae removal capacity in conventional treatment processes and its pollution removal efficiency is affected by the equipment performance among daf equipment multiphase flow pumps have attracted attention because of their simple configuration and low failure rate this paper studied the equipment performance and pollution removal efficiency of a multiphase flow pump for daf the results showed that the dissolution efficiency of the equipment was approximately 55 and the average particle size of bubbles was less than 26 μm when the pressure was greater than 0 36 mpa the bubble stability time exceeded 4 min the optimal working conditions were achieved at a dissolved gas pressure of 0 4 mpa the maximum removal rates of turbidity chlorophyll a toc uv254 and codmn by the daf process were 56 49 50 23 23 73 28 75 and 23 98 respectively the trend in pollution removal efficiency was consistent with that of equipment performance parameters the surface of the microbubbles was hydrophobic and could more easily adsorb high molecular weight organic substances with strong hydrophobicity and algae with strongly hydrophobic colloidal layers inside in addition regarding the thmfp the experimental results showed that the removal rates of the precursors chcl3 chbrcl2 and chbr2cl after daf were 28 93 23 26 and 21 53 respectively surface hydrophobicity is one of the main mechanisms by which microbubbles adhere to pollutants keywords multiphase flow pump air

suva characteristic uv absorbance 1 introduction as a drinking water resource in china lake reservoir water plays a pivotal role in the national urban water supply system 1 however when water sources are limited large basin water sources with a high organic content such as the yellow river and the yangtze river are constantly introduced into lake reservoir water the composition of pollutants in water becomes increasingly complex resulting in serious water eutrophication extensive algae growth and seasonal fluctuations 2 which are difficult to address by conventional coagulation and sedimentation processes 3 in contrast the daf process which is a widely used algae removal technology can effectively remove algae and other microorganisms while removing turbidity and oil 4 5 the principle of the daf process for algae removal is the production of a large number of microbubbles to collide with and adhere to light colloids in water forming air entrained flocs which float to the water surface and are effectively removed 6 8 the air entrained flocs formed during the daf process are largely affected by the operating conditions for coagulation and daf an appropriate combination of conditions can produce a large number of microbubbles with moderate size the microbubble particle size is uniform and smaller than the floc particle size which can adhere well to the surface of particles and effectively improve the pollution removal effect 9 10 therefore the performance of daf equipment directly affects the decontamination efficiency of the daf process among the many types of air flotation equipment pressurized daf equipment is the most widely used at home and abroad 11 12 this kind of air flotation equipment can produce a large number of microbubbles with uniform particle size and long term stability in water 13 which is convenient for maintenance and management however the traditional pressurized daf system is composed of a dissolved air pump dissolved air tank and air compressor which occupy a large space and consume a large amount of energy in contrast multiphase flow pumps can dissolve air directly without an air compressor dissolved air tank or other equipment to produce water containing dissolved air release microbubbles and save energy 14 at present multiphase flow pumps have been applied in domestic water treatment the jianghua water treatment equipment company introduced the edur germany multiphase flow pump for daf with this pump the whole gas dissolution process is completed simultaneously at elevated pump pressures significantly improving the sewage treatment effect 15 zhu et al 16 conducted an experimental study on the application of a gas liquid mixing pump to the treatment of low concentration secondary effluent via daf and achieved good results shi 17 combined the multiphase flow pump air flotation process with sedimentation and ultrafiltration processes his research showed that the sequential sedimentation air flotation process can effectively remove particulate matter and aromatic macromolecular nom and the combined air flotation ultrafiltration process can effectively remove nh4 n small molecule nom and pathogenic bacteria however there are few studies on the treatment of high algae reservoir water by the multiphase flow pump daf process furthermore the performance of air flotation equipment directly affects the pollution removal efficiency of the air flotation process but currently the multiphase flow pumps used in daf generally have problems such as uneven operational parameters therefore it is necessary to explore the performance of multiphase flow pumps for daf and their optimal operating parameters to improve the daf system and improve the water purification effect of the daf process to explore the relationship between the performance of multiphase flow pump equipment and reservoir water pollution removal efficiency a pilot study on the performance parameters gas dissolution efficiency microbubble particle size bubble stability time etc of daf equipment and the key factors dissolved gas pressure coagulant dosage air intake reflux ratio etc affecting the treatment effect of daf was performed and the adhesion mechanism between microbubbles and flocs was expounded the results are intended to provide a technical reference for the evaluation and improvement of daf equipment in water plants 2 experimental part 2 1 chemicals methyl tert butyl ether and ascorbic acid were obtained from aladdin shanghai china and both were analytical reagent grade sulfuric acid sodium hydroxide acetone sodium chloride sodium hypochlorite pafc potassium permanganate and sodium oxalate were all of analytical reagent grade and purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent company shanghai china 2 2 raw water quality the water used in this experiment was raw water from the quehua reservoir and the ranges of various water quality indices are shown in table 1 2 3 experimental device and process the flotation sedimentation tank of the pilot test facility of the jinan quehua water plant was selected as the test site and the designed water flow rate of the pilot test equipment was 8 m3 h the volume size of daf area was 2 4 1 2 2 15 m3 the contact time was 1 min and the rising speed of the separation chamber was 1 63 mm s an eb3u multiphase flow pump and three sf series gas dissolvers two in the daf contact chamber and one in the secondary reaction area were used in the experiment the experimental device is shown in fig 1 the g value of primary mixing was 70 000 s 1 and that of secondary mixing was 15 000 s 1 the device ran continuously for 30 h under each set of working conditions and samples were taken every 2 h 2 3 1 experimental process the raw water entered the mixing tank through the raw water pipeline entered the flocculation tank after fully mixing with the flocculant and then flowed into the contact area of the daf tank from the opening at the bottom of the flocculation tank when the water level of the flotation sedimentation tank exceeded the elevation of the multiphase flow pump the multiphase flow pump was opened and the opening of the inlet valve of the dissolved air pump was increased after the dissolved air pump operated stably the pressure reducing valve was opened and the opening of the pressure reducing valve was adjusted according to the pressure gauge reading until the predetermined pressure value was reached after the dissolved air containing water in the dissolved air tank was fully mixed and had been stable for a period of time milk colored liquid began to appear in the daf tank which indicated stable daf operation 2 4 analytical indices and detection methods 2 4 1 conventional indicators the basic indicators of daf algae removal include turbidity do toc uv254 and codmn turbidity was measured by a scattered light turbidimeter 2100n hach usa do content was measured by a multiparameter water quality detector multi 3410 wtw germany doc was measured by a toc analyzer toc v cph shimadzu japan uv254 was determined by a uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1810 purkinje china codmn was determined by the acidic potassium permanganate method 2 4 2 other indicators other indicators were determined in accordance with water and wastewater detection and analysis methods fourth edition 18 1 chlorophyll a content was analyzed with a dds 307a conductivity meter first the algae were trapped on a 0 45 μm membrane by a vacuum filter and chlorophyll a was extracted with 80 acetone solution then ultrasonication was performed for 40 min in an ice bath and the samples were stored in a refrigerator for 12 h after extraction ultrasonication was performed for 20 min in an ice bath the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm and the supernatant was extracted after extraction the absorbance at 630 nm 645 nm 663 nm and 750 nm was measured by uv spectrophotometry and finally the concentration of chlorophyll a in the water sample was calculated according to the following formula 2 1 chlorophyll a 11 64 d 663 d 750 2 16 d 645 d 750 0 10 d 630 d 750 v 1 v δ where d is absorbency v is the volume of the water sample l and v1 is the extract volume after adjustment to a constant volume ml 2 the molecular weight of macromolecular hydrophobic organics was measured by lc ocd by using a large water quality analysis instrument developed by german doc labor company the detection conditions for lc ocd were as follows the injection volume was 1000 μl and the total running time of each sample was 70 min the experimental results were obtained by peak integration of the experimental results with specific software 3 the thmfp was determined according to usepa standard method 5710b a 100 ml water sample was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and transferred to a brown sample bottle an appropriate amount of kh2po4 naoh buffer solution ph 7 was added to the bottle followed by naclo the chlorine dosage was calculated as follows 2 2 effective chlorine dosage mg l 7 6 nh 3 n 3 doc 10 mg l when the ph reached 7 0 0 2 the water sample was placed in an incubator for reaction for 5 days then 0 2 mg l ascorbic acid was added to terminate the reaction and the sample was extracted with 50 ml methyl tert butyl ether the total amount of thms was determined by headspace gas chromatography 6890 n agilent usa and considered the thmfp content in the water 4 fluorescent organic matter three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectra of the water samples were acquired with a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan equipped with a xenon lamp as the excitation source the excitation and emission slit widths were 5 nm and 3 nm respectively the spectra were scanned over excitation wavelengths of 200 450 nm and emission wavelengths of 200 550 nm with increments of 5 nm the scanning speed was 12 00 nm min deionized water was used as the blank to neutralize the influence of rayleigh and raman scattering during fluorescence regional integration calculations 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of the performance of daf equipment 3 1 1 determination and analysis of air dissolution efficiency the relationship between the theoretical and actual release volumes at an experimental water temperature of approximately 6 c and gas liquid ratio of 2 is shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the actual measured gas released was smaller than the theoretical value and the gas dissolution efficiency was less than 55 this was because during the continuous measurement the dissolved air containing water flowed out from the upper end of the surge tank the liquid flow state in the surge tank was unstable and the pressure reflux ratio and other parameters of daf operation changed under the influence of the device thus the actual value was low when the dissolved gas pressure was 0 36 0 44 mpa the gas dissolution efficiency was relatively stable when the dissolved gas pressure exceeded 0 44 mpa the actual measured gas release tended to be stable the theoretical dissolved gas in the water gradually increased with increasing pressure however with increasing pressure to a certain amount the actual amount of dissolved air in the water remained basically unchanged therefore the gas dissolution efficiency decreased with increasing dissolved gas pressure in addition the air dissolution tank used in the experiment was an empty tank without any filler and as a result the air dissolution efficiency was approximately 30 lower than that of a tank with filler 19 3 1 2 determination and analysis of bubble stability time fig 3 shows that when the gas liquid ratio was constant the bubble stability time increased with increasing pressure when the pressure exceeded 0 44 mpa the microbubble stability time began to decrease except when the gas liquid ratio was 2 6 from 0 4 mpa to 0 48 mpa the stability time of microbubbles changed little and the daf operation was relatively stable at this time when the gas liquid ratio was 2 6 or 1 4 the bubble stability time was significantly lower than that under other working conditions as shown in fig 3 when the gas liquid ratio was relatively low 1 4 the amount of compressed gas entering the dissolved gas pump was low resulting in little dissolved gas in the water so the stability time was relatively short when the gas liquid ratio was relatively high 2 6 the liquid flowing into the dissolved gas pump and the vacuum in the pump were reduced so the air in the inlet pipe could not be exhausted and the gas liquid mixture in the pump was difficult to pump into the surge tank therefore the amount of gas in the released gas liquid mixture was large and the degree of bubble breakage was insufficient resulting in an increase in large bubbles in the water and greatly reduced existence time of bubbles when the pressure remained unchanged and the gas liquid ratio was between 1 7 and 2 3 the bubble stability time changed little indicating that a better milky color of the liquid would be observed for a gas liquid ratio within this range when the pressure decreased the amount of dissolved gas in water was low and more large bubbles were generated during gas release resulting in insufficient bubble stability time that is the quality of micro nanobubbles was not good according to the change trend in fig 3 it can be concluded that the bubble containing water produced by the device met the experimental requirements when the pressure was 0 4 mpa and the gas liquid ratio was 1 7 3 1 3 measurement and analysis of bubble particle size 3 1 3 1 particle size and distribution of microbubbles analysis of the performance of the multiphase flow pump at the pilot test facility of the quehua water plant indicated that when the dissolved gas pressure of the equipment decreased the daf effect was poor and the operation was extremely unstable therefore to study the size of microbubbles generated by the equipment and find the optimal working conditions measurements were conducted under pressures of 0 36 0 60 mpa to ensure the reliability of the data and reduce experimental error the number of microbubbles measured under each working condition was not less than 1000 the probability density distribution of the microbubble size obtained with the equipment at pressures of 0 36 0 60 mpa is shown in fig 4 when the pressure was 0 36 mpa the maximum frequency diameter of microbubbles was 15 μm corresponding to a frequency of 49 with increasing pressure the peak value of the probability density distribution gradually shifted to the right but the shift amplitude was not very large and the microbubble diameter with the highest frequency remained within the range 16 20 μm when the pressure reached 0 40 mpa the operation of the daf equipment was relatively stable when the pressure was appropriately increased the range of bubble particle sizes and the size with the highest frequency did not change significantly the microbubble diameter data remained relatively concentrated indicating that the daf equipment could produce a large number of microbubbles with a relatively uniform particle size at 0 40 mpa and achieve a relatively stable operation state when the pressure rose to 0 60 mpa the number of relatively large bubbles in the equipment increased and the main distribution range of bubble particle size was 10 38 μm the particle size with the highest frequency was 23 μm overall with increasing pressure the bubble particle size did not decrease significantly and the operation was relatively stable the reason for this phenomenon was that the negative pressure value in the pipeline changed with the change in pressure so a set air intake could not be fixed although the dissolved gas pressure changed the gas water ratio also changed slightly so the bubble particle size did not gradually decrease with increasing pressure 3 1 3 2 bubble number density and average particle size because the microbubbles had a large specific surface area the greater the density of the bubbles was the greater the adhesion probability with light colloids in the water microbubbles with a particle size of 20 60 μm met the specified requirements of daf assuming that the generated bubbles were uniform in size and there was no coalescence or fragmentation between bubbles the number of bubbles was determined as follows 3 1 n v 4 3 π r 3 where n is the number of bubbles per unit volume v is the unit volume 1 cm3 and r is the average radius of the bubbles μm fig 5 shows the variation of average particle size and bubble number density with dissolved gas pressure when the pressure was in the range of 0 36 0 48 mpa the bubble particle size changed little with increasing pressure and the bubble number density was stable in the range of 225 000 245 000 cm 3 indicating that the daf effect was good during operation within this pressure range and that the bubble density at the water surface of the daf tank was high see fig 6 a and b at 0 52 mpa the bubble number density decreased sharply indicating that the daf effect of the equipment began to deteriorate the number of large bubbles began to increase and the height of the milk colored water layer in the daf tank decreased at the water surface of the tank the bubble density was low the tank was clear and the daf effect was poor see fig 6 c 3 1 4 determination and analysis of do the multiphase flow pump was operated at a dissolved air pressure of 0 4 mpa water tank temperature of 6 c and initial do value of 11 85 mg l after the operation of the daf system was stable the water in the daf tank gradually turned white and milky in color which indicated that the operation effect of the daf equipment was very good the variation trend of the do content in water with bubble stability time is shown in fig 7 after daf the do value of the water was 12 72 mg l which is higher than the theoretical saturated do value 12 42 mg l of clean water at the same temperature and pressure the do value for traditional daf equipment is close to this value fig 7 shows that the do in the water decreased rapidly in the first 30 s with the gradual disappearance of bubbles and the diffusion of do in the water the rate of decline in do value began to slow until the value stabilized at a level consistent with the do content in clean water 3 2 operational effect of daf equipment 3 2 1 algae turbidity removal efficiency fig 8 suggests that with increasing coagulant dosage the removal rates of turbidity and chlorophyll a first increased and then decreased under different pressure and reflux ratio conditions the turbidity removal rate was the highest when the coagulant dosage was 4 mg l while the chlorophyll a removal rate was the highest when the coagulant dosage was 6 mg l fig 8 a b shows that when the coagulant dosage was constant the turbidity and chlorophyll a removal efficiency decreased overall with increasing dissolved gas pressure and their highest removal rates were 56 49 and 59 56 respectively when the pressure was 0 4 mpa it can be seen from the previous section that when the dissolved gas pressure rose to 0 44 mpa the gas dissolution efficiency of the equipment reached the maximum however as the pressure continued to rise the gas dissolution efficiency began to decline and the microbubble particle size began to change greatly indicating that the operation of the daf equipment was not stable during the pressure rise so the removal rate began to decrease the results for various reflux ratios are shown in fig 8 c d the turbidity removal efficiency was the best when the reflux ratio was 25 and the turbidity removal rate reached 56 49 fig 8 c fig 8 d shows that when the dosage of coagulant remained unchanged with an increase in the reflux ratio the removal of chlorophyll a first gradually increased and then tended to stabilize which was consistent with relevant research results 20 indicating that increasing the reflux ratio could increase the bubble concentration in water and promote the collision and adhesion of microbubbles and particles in the influent however increasing the reflux ratio of dissolved air containing water would increase the working load of the reflux pump therefore in practical production and applications economic factors should be considered and an appropriate dissolved gas pressure and reflux ratio should be selected to save energy consumption 3 2 2 removal efficiency of organic matter according to fig 9 a b c as the dissolved gas pressure increased from 0 40 mpa the removal rates of toc uv254 and cod by the daf process gradually decreased reaching maxima at 0 40 mpa with values of 30 96 39 17 and 37 31 respectively the reductions in the removal rates were due to the instability of the air water ratio when the pressure increased and the resulting deviations in the bubble number density and particle size distribution were large as shown in fig 2 when the pressure reached 0 44 mpa the gas dissolution efficiency began to decline therefore the gas water ratio was relatively stable and the operation effect was relatively good when the gas dissolution pressure was 0 4 mpa as shown in fig 9 d e f with an increase in the reflux ratio toc and codmn first increased and then decreased and the removal rate of uv254 decreased when the reflux ratio increased from 20 to 25 the removal efficiency of toc increased from 23 6 to 29 91 the removal efficiency of codmn increased from 27 06 to 37 31 and the removal efficiency of uv254 decreased whose highest removal rate was 42 08 when the reflux ratio was 20 when the reflux ratio increased from 25 to 30 the removal rates of the above indices decreased by 2 9 20 08 and 12 28 respectively from fig 9 overall as the dosage of coagulant increased the removal rate of each index increased and tended to become stable and the influence of the reflux ratio on the removal effect was higher than those of dissolved gas pressure and dosage after the coagulation stage negatively charged organic molecules in the water and positively charged metal ions in the coagulant were destabilized through the action of electrical neutralization to form flocs which collided and adhered to the microbubbles in addition the organic compounds containing benzene rings and aromatic macromolecules in the water were hydrophobic and the microbubbles had a hydrophobic surface thus these components could sorb to each other and organic colloids and bubbles formed air entrained flocs which then floated to the water surface for removal 3 3 analysis of the decontamination mechanism of daf equipment 3 3 1 removal efficiency of algae scanning analysis of the algae content in water before and after daf is shown in fig 10 and the data indicate that algae were suspended in the form of stable colloids before and after daf after daf the effluent algae content was significantly reduced and the morphology of algae cells had not changed indicating that the daf process had effectively removed algae without damaging the cells and the substances in the cells had not flowed out this process effectively avoided the release of toxic substances in algae which is also an advantage of applying daf for algae removal the surfaces of microbubbles are negatively charged and hydrophobic and most algae surfaces are also negatively charged after adding the coagulant the surfaces of algae flocs are positively charged the electrostatic interaction between bubbles and algae flocs promotes adhesion between them however for surfaces with high hydrophobicity the electrostatic effect is relatively weak and the hydrophobicity of the algal surface is one of the main mechanisms promoting adhesion between algal cells and microbubbles hydrophobic attraction between microbubbles and algal cells promoted the adhesion of bubbles to the surface of algal cells to form algal aggregates fig 10 thus improving the capture and collection efficiency in the process of bubble flotation the adhesion between bubbles and particles can usually be explained by dlvo theory micromolecular forces such as hydrophobic van der waals and electrostatic forces exist between the bubble surface and algal cell surface the removal of algae by microbubbles is due to the colloidal layer inside algae which has a strong hydrophobic effect the surface of the algae and hydrophobic microbubbles easily combine and the algae float to the water surface 3 3 2 removal efficiency of fluorescent organic matter fig 11 shows five obvious fluorescence peaks i e a c b f and t in the raw water indicating that there was abundant dom in the raw water 21 as shown in the figure the fluorescence peak areas of area iv and area v were relatively high area iv represents microbial metabolites in water and area v represents ha like organic matter the b and t2 peaks in these two areas represent tyrosine and tryptophan in the ultraviolet region respectively and both had a maximum light absorption at a wavelength of 280 nm this indicates that the dom was mainly humic organic matter and soluble protein after coagulation and daf organic substances in the water were removed to varying degrees and the reductions in peak a and peak f were relatively large hydrophobic polymeric organic substances were mainly removed by adhesion to microbubbles and flotation to the water surface with the bubbles because the surface of the microbubbles was hydrophobic the interface energy was reduced the microbubbles more easily adsorbed substances with good hydrophobicity which is in line with the thermodynamic theory of collision adhesion 22 3 3 3 removal efficiency of dbp precursors daf can appropriately reduce the content of organic matter in water but some nom still enters the next stage and reacts with chlorine disinfectants to produce dbps in the process of water purification it is very important to inhibit the production of dbps by effectively controlling the dbpfp 23 to investigate the effect of the multiphase flow pump daf process on the removal of dbpfp doc uv254 the suva and thm precursors were selected as alternative parameters to dbpfp content to monitor dbpfp levels in the effluent of the daf process the experimental removal results are shown in table 2 suva is the ratio of uv254 to doc which can reflect the humification degree of organic matter the relative content of unsaturated double bonds or aromatic rings in organic matter and the structural orientation of organic matter suva can be used as an indicator of dbpfp 24 in the surface water of the united states suva ranges from 1 4 to 5 5 suva 3 indicates that the organic pollutants in the water mainly contain nonhumus materials while suva 3 indicates that the pollutants in the water mainly contain humus the suva in the effluent after air flotation was reduced to 2 19 indicating that a certain amount of humus like organic matter had been removed the above table shows that the removal rate of uv254 by the daf process was higher than that of doc and the removal rates were 35 85 and 31 62 respectively which is consistent with the results obtained in fig 9 daf had a certain inhibitory effect on dbpfp the experimental results show that the removal rates of the precursors chcl3 chbrcl2 and chbr2cl after daf were 28 93 23 26 and 21 53 respectively reducing subsequent thms production 3 3 4 organic compounds with different molecular weights according to the analysis of organic matter with different molecular weights in raw water from the quehua reservoir organic matter with a molecular weight of 3 10 kda accounted for a large proportion i e 47 37 of the total dom and organic matter with a molecular weight greater than 3 kda accounted for 76 19 of the total dom it can be concluded that the raw water contained more organic matter with a high molecular weight as shown in fig 12 the removal rate of organics with molecular weights greater than 3 kda by daf was 41 13 higher than that of organics with molecular weights less than 3 kda the removal effect of daf for small molecule organics was minor and the removal efficiency was less than 10 therefore it can be concluded that the removal effect of organics with high molecular weights was better 3 3 5 removal efficiency of macromolecular hydrophobic organics lc ocd is a technique for qualitative and quantitative analysis of dom in water based on sec using ultraviolet organic nitrogen detector and organic carbon infrared detector 25 in recent years lc ocd has been widely used in the characterization of nom in drinking water the study of membrane pollution characteristics and the detection and characterization of algal don 26 table 3 shows the quantitative analytical results for the removal effect of each component by daf table 3 shows that the content of hydrophobic organic compounds hydrophobic organic carbon in the incoming raw water of the quehua water plant was relatively small and that most components were hydrophilic organic carbon the contents of bp hs bb lmwa and lmwn in the raw water accounted for 8 55 14 3 and 20 respectively protein accounted for approximately 35 of bp with an n c ratio of approximately 0 12 indicating that the nitrogen content in the raw water was low the don content in hs was 0 088 mg l and ha degradation products accounted for 14 of all products it can be concluded that the organic matter in the raw water was mainly hs after daf treatment the removal rates of bp hs bb lmwa and lmwn were 44 87 24 20 6 20 100 and 7 46 respectively after the reaction the proportion of protein in bp decreased by 3 and the average molecular weight of hs decreased from 377 kda to 298 kda which further proved that the microbubbles could adsorb macromolecular hoc in water the content of ha degradation products in the effluent increased by 5 due to the poor stability of ha it is very easily decomposed and microbubbles release oh when broken which can oxidize macromolecular organics slightly increasing the content of ha degradation products in the water 4 conclusion 1 the operation of multiphase flow pump daf equipment met the requirements of experimental analysis and production the average efficiency was less than 55 the do content produced was 12 72 mg l at a temperature of 6 c through a process optimization experiment the optimal operating conditions were obtained which were 0 4 mpa pressure 25 reflux ratio and 4 mg l pafc dosage allowing stable equipment performance and the achievement of relevant specifications 2 the multiphase flow pump daf process was used to carry out pollution removal efficiency tests under optimal conditions and the removal rates of turbidity chlorophyll a toc uv254 and codmn were 56 49 50 23 23 73 28 75 and 23 98 respectively the variations in decontamination efficiency are consistent with the variations in the equipment s performance parameters moreover the removal rates of the precursors chcl3 chbrcl2 and chbr2cl were 28 93 23 26 and 21 53 respectively 3 microbubbles with hydrophobic surfaces were more likely to adsorb macromolecular organic matter with strong hydrophobicity and algae with a strong hydrophobic colloid layer inside after daf algae cells in the water were intact and not damaged and surface hydrophobicity was one of the main mechanisms by which microbubbles adhered to pollutants thmfp was inhibited by air flotation in addition humic like compounds were transformed into ha degradation products indicating that microbubble rupture produced hydroxyl radicals with redox effects declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exits in the submission of this

this approach is true only under particular conditions water matrix composition otherwise their usage should be limited to a well defined time range the effectiveness of such a process is investigated using the azo dye mordant orange 1 mo1 as a model compound it has a high level of toxicity and carcinogenicity its absorption through the skin inhalation or swallowing is highly harmful it causes damage such as eye skin and respiratory tract irritations through bio accumulating in fauna transferring to the higher food chain 36 it is widely used in many sectors such as foods textile and pharmaceuticals which differ in wastewater characteristics 29 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals the synthetic solution is made by dissolving 100 mg l 1 of mo1 c13h9n3o5 sigma aldrich with purity 70 in

conductivity 11 s cm 5 the pollutant is dissolved in distilled water while tap water and modified tap water with the addition of na2so4 and nacl are used to operate in conditions closer to real applications tap water composition and the chemical structure of mo1 benzoic acid 2 hydroxy 5 4 nitrophenyl azo are shown in table s 1 and fig s 1 respectively na2so4 and nacl are analytical grades from sigma aldrich 2 2 electrolysis and sonoelectrolysis system the electrochemical oxidation is conducted in an open undivided cylindrical glass cell containing a 300 ml aqueous solution of 100 mg l 1 mo1 the effluent is treated for 3 h under galvanostatic conditions and nature ph 6 2 6 6 applying a current intensity ranging from 0 25 to 1 a by an amel 2055 potentiostat galvanostat the natural solution ph is considered to minimize the addition of chemicals to the process the stirring rate is varied from 200 to 1000 rpm using a vertical stirrer an nb bdd diachem condias electrode has been selected as the anode with a diamond layer of about 5 μm it contains 3500 ppm of boron carbon ratio deposited onto 1 5 mm thickness of nb substrate with six boreholes diameter 4 5 mm and the thickness of electrode was 0 90 mm a ti ruo2 de nora industries mesh has been used as the cathode with 0 20 mm thickness both mesh electrodes have a width of 3 5 cm height of 7 5 cm and they are spaced by a distance of 150 μm which corresponded to the thickness of the nafion n117 ion exchange membrane used as solid polymer electrolyte nafion 117 has been selected for its conductivity and chemical stability 37 more details on this cell are given in elsewhere 38 a schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in fig s 2 in some experiments different amounts of na2so4 from 2 to 20 mm or

are the constant rate of pseudo first order kinetic min 1 of sech ech and us process respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of operating conditions on electrochemical oxidation the first stage of the study faces the degradation of mo1 by electrochemical oxidation this step is fundamental to evaluate the synergistic effect in sech process discussed in the second part of the paper the applied current has a strong impact on electrochemical system performance both in the degradation rate and energy consumption degradation of 100 mg l 1 of mo1 with different current intensities 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1a is performed for 180 min of electrolysis using the spe system and the results are reported in fig 1 in this preliminary investigation the pollutant is dissolved in distilled water and supporting electrolyte is not added to the solution σ 1 1 10 5 s cm 1 the colour removal changes from 90 60 at 0 25 a to a complete mo1 oxidation at 0 75 a and 1 a respectively the decolourization occurs thanks to using a very effective anode towards the degradation of organics such as bdd in particular using bdd the degradation of organic matter is expected to occur mainly by hydroxyl radicals generated from water oxidation 40 as reported in fig s 3 and table s 2 supplementary materials the mo1 oxidation follows a pseudo first order kinetic and the apparent constant rate grows up from 0 013 to 0 030 min 1 as a function of the applied current the higher production of oh could explain this increase in the oxidation rate at high current intensity on the other hand increasing the current up to 1a does not significantly improve the degradation rate thus the process can be controlled either by charge transfer when the applied current is less than 0 75 a or under mass transfer control with a current intensity above 0 75a over the increase of the applied current does not favour the oxidation of the pollutants but increase the hydroxyl radicals decomposition eqs 8 41 8 2 oh h 2 o 1 2o 2 further confirmation about the ability of the spe based system to remove the azo dye from wastewater is reported in fig 2 which correlates energy consumption with cod removal excluding the experiment at 0 25 a with a cod removal of 78 the others selected current values are able to reach 90 with a maximum of 97 at 1 a it highlights that a solid polymer electrolyte based cell allows also treating intermediate compounds nevertheless a higher current negatively affects energy consumption with a small profit in cod removal indeed moving from 0 75 a to 1 a the energy required grows from 49 5 to 72 8 kwh m 3 gaining only 1 in cod removal from 96 5 to 97 5 given the degradation rate and the energy consumption the authors select the current intensity of 0 75 a as a value for the following investigations the stirring rate is another important parameter that can affect process performance and is directly connected with mass transport four experiments are conducted at 0 75 a with different stirring rates 200 400 800 and 1000 rpm and the results are presented in fig s 4 the oxidation rate increases when the stirring rate grows from 200 to 400 rpm which means that the process is under mass transport limitation in this range a further increase is obtained at 800 rpm while over this value the process is almost unaffected by agitation nevertheless it is important to highlight that despite the absolute mo1 degradation enhancement being quite limited from 93 3 at 200 rpm to 100 at 800 rpm the mass transport affects the degradation rate in fact the apparent rate constant increases from 0 156 to 0 22 min 1 41 faster colourant oxidation supported by enhanced mass transport is reflected in higher cod removal as reported in fig 3 this is because more hydroxyl radicals are available for the oxidations of by products cod removal is penalized at 200 rpm due to the mo1 lower oxidation rate the variation of colour removal throughout the electrolysis treatment is shown at 20 38 and 43 c in fig s 5 as can be seen the temperature increase has a slight effect on the degradation of dye an increase in temperature from 20 to 38 c leads to a slight increase in the oxidation rate at the beginning of electrolysis further growth to 43 c does not provide any improvement this behaviour according to the literature is because with bdd anodes the increase in temperature has a positive effect mainly with the electrogeneration of oxidizing agents from inorganic ions deriving from supporting electrolyte that in this specific case has not been added into the solution 42 44 moreover we need additional energy to change the temperature which negatively affects the cost of the degradation therefore room temperature can be selected as the best choice for the electrochemical oxidation process this weak influence is a relevant result for the following analysis carried out applying the us which affects the solution temperature 3 2 influence of solution properties an investigation of the influence of tap water ions the nature of the supporting electrolyte and the effect of the solution conductivity is performed moreover the employment of water containing inorganic ions has the aim to investigate the solid polymer based cell performance under conditions closer to a real effluent a current of 0 75 a is selected to treat different mo1 polluted solutions distilled water tap water and different amounts of na2so4 in the range 2 20 mm and nacl in the range 2 4 mm are used as reported in fig 4 the nacl concentration is limited to 4 mm for the extremely negative impact on cod removal as described below first it is interesting to highlight that the substitution of distilled water with tap water and the consequent presence of ions in solution do not penalize system performance this confirmation about degradation capability also in the presence of ions is an essential step for investigating and developing this kind of solid electrolyte cell based the results markedly show the influence of the supporting electrolyte the presence of salt in the solution reduces energy consumption but it can also interfere with cod removal such worsening in performance is not so strong in the presence of na2so4 while it becomes relevant when nacl is used in the first case cod removal decreases from 96 5 with distilled water to 90 0 and 86 8 with 2 mm and 20 mm na2so4 respectively the main cause is identified in the presence of sulphate ions that dimerize forming s2o8 2 45 47 9 2so 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 2e this drawback is counterbalanced by an energy consumption decrement especially at 20 mm na2so4 under these conditions the energy supplied downs from 49 5 kwh m 3 with distilled water to 30 2 kwh m 3 39 on the contrary the nacl addition causes a not negligible worsening of cod removal performance with 37 4 compared to the reference case carried out in distilled water although the oxidant power of chloride solution is well known other studies documented the detrimental effect of such species on removing organic material when a bdd anode is adopted 48 50 in particular polcaro et al 48 scialdone et al 50 well investigated the negative impact of operating at low chloride concentration using a bdd anode the active chlorine can react with hydroxyl radicals to form chlorite and chlorate or the chlorine may react with peroxides produced by reaction 5 following reactions 10 and 11 10 h 2 o 2 cl 2 2hcl o 2 11 2clo 2 h 2 o 2 2oh 2clo 2 o 2 h 2 o on the other hand operating at a high chlorine concentration is not suitable due to the possible formation of more toxic and recalcitrant species these results confirm that the nature of supporting electrolytes can drastically affect the degradation process due to their interaction with anode material the results reported in this paragraph are highly significant about the ability of the system to treat solutions in a wide electrical conductivity range 10 5 10 2 s cm 1 avoiding any water body and electrochemical cell modification in presence of sulphate media 3 3 eaop integration with ultrasound experiments at different current intensities 0 25 a 0 5 a 0 75 a are carried out applying us to understand how their application can enhance the degradation of mo1 in the sonoelectrochemical process this section focuses on the mo1 degradation performance and the duration of us application the us application completely changes the global energy consumptions balance to be competitive this coupling of the electrochemical process with ultrasound must be considered if integrated with renewable energy for power supply the investigation of the impact of ultrasound on the overall energy cost is out of the scope of this paper fig 5 compares sech results with those obtained in the absence of sonication and without the addition of supporting electrolytes it is observed that the us improves the degradation rate of mo1 in the first 90 min for all the applied current values for example operating at 0 75 a after 30 min of electrolysis the degradation rate with the us increases from 55 7 to 71 14 the main reasons for such relevant improvement in the sech process are i strong oxidizing species are generated such as oh ho2 o and h2o2 eqs 1 5 which in turn accelerate the destruction of the dye chromogenic groups and achieving dye degradation ii ultrasound promotes the mass transfer of pollutants and iii cleaning and activating electrode surface 14 21 24 51 these positive ultrasound effects are well highlighted by the synergistic indexes reported in table 2 which has a value higher than 1 for all the applied current values it is noteworthy that by increasing the current from 0 25 a to 0 75 a the synergistic index decreases from 1 57 up to 1 48 then the influence of ultrasound is more relevant at low current indeed the higher the current applied to the cell the higher the amount of oh produced at bdd interface by the electrochemical process nevertheless in a time range between 90 and 120 min a crossing between the sech and ech curves is identified as a function of the applied current the higher is the current the earlier the intersection between the two curves occurs over this threshold the application of ultrasound penalized the degradation process and it is confirmed by the synergistic index in table 2 which becomes lower than one for all the three cases reported in fig 5 the final degradation of sech process is lower than those obtained in the absence of ultrasound the crossing time depends on the applied current and it occurs in a narrow mo1 concentration range 12 18 mg l 1 such peculiar behaviour identified for the mo1 oxidation process could be due to mass transfer limitation which occurs only at low pollutant concentrations a first hypothesis recalls the results about the effect of the stirring rate discussed above which over 800 rpm does not significantly increase system performance a further enhancement of mass transport caused by the us can negatively affect the interaction between the remaining organic matter and hydroxyl radicals at the electrode interface this result suggests that the management of ultrasound during the degradation process can be optimized indeed such negative impact caused a worsening in oxidation performance and wasting of energy due to us application based on these facts two other types of experiments are then carried out to reach a deeper understanding of this peculiar behaviour and improve us application management in all the cases an applied current of 0 75 a is considered the first kind of experiment investigates the us application time range and results are reported in fig 6 where the references cases of fig 5a are compared with two cases with the following features 1 the us are applied only for the first 90 min 2 the us are applied after 90 min in the first case the system follows the us behaviour previously obtained in the first 90 min and the interruption of ultrasound after 90 min avoids the crossing discussed above reaching a complete decolourization on the other hand in the second case the application of ultrasound after 90 min hindered the degradation process limiting it to the same plateau described above during the discussion of fig 5 when us are applied for all the process time although literature reports that us application should enhance colour degradation 23 52 the results obtained here suggest that in this specific case the us application for mo1 concentration lower than 20 mg l 1 penalized the process this experimental evidence confirms the high sensitivity by operating conditions e g electrode materials effluent composition fluid dynamic conditions of the electrochemical oxidation process performance the second series of tests are performed to investigate this peculiar behaviour identified in mo1 oxidation in the presence of us in this case different amounts of na2so4 are added to the solution in sulphate media the main reaction path for electrogeneration of persulfate is those proposed by eq 8 nevertheless in the presence of us the electrogenerated s2o8 2 is converted into the more powerful radical so4 by the reaction 12 s 2 o 8 2 ultrasound 2 so 4 results in fig 7 highlight that with 20 mm of sodium sulphate the process with us application for the entire duration not shows a limitation in colour removal this na2so4 value represents a threshold beyond what the us application for more than 90 min increases the degradation rate with a complete decolourization in 150 min instead of 180 min such improvement might be related to the formation of so4 radicals by us in the bulk solution moving the oxidation process beyond the electrode surface where radicals are electrochemically produced and act the sulphate radicals produced by us counterbalance the negative impact of us on mass transport detected before at low mo1 concentration allowing for complete mo1 degradation such improvement with bdd anode in presence of sulphate has been detected by rodrigo and martínez huitle groups who report so4 bulk production in presence of uv irradiation 53 here the effect provided by a light source is guaranteed by us 53 a further investigation is carried out treating a solution with an initial concentration equal to 15 mg l 1 fig 8 confirms the behaviour described above the sech process in the absence or with a low concentration of supporting electrolyte 20 mm hinders the mo1 oxidation when the solution has a low pollutant load see fig s 6 in the supporting material the coupling of the electrochemical process with sonication to treat low concentrated mo1 solution makes a positive effect only at 20 mm of na2so4 at the beginning of this section it is reported the importance to couple the us application with renewable energy the results reported here add a second important point about us application and management indeed despite the most adopted practice being to apply us for the entire process duration a deeper knowledge of the degradation process allows a higher electrochemical performance and energy saving as suggested here limiting the us application only to a specific interval time 4 conclusion in this paper a flexible electrochemical cell setup is proposed for the electrochemical oxidation of pollutants to operate in a large range of electrical conductivity 1 10 5 10 2 s cm 1 without changing the wastewater composition making the electrochemical plant handling easier the eaop cell flexibility regarding solution conductivity composition is a fundamental step to improve process management and exploitation leading this kind of technology to a real application for the treatment of industrial wastewater in several sectors such a system is based on the employment of a solid polymer electrolyte nafion 117 sandwiched between a bdd anode and a tiruo2 cathode the experiments are carried out evaluating the degradation of 100 mg l 1 of mo1 dye the first operating parameters considered are the current intensity 0 25 1 00 a and the stirring rate 200 1000 rpm an applied current of 0 75 a at 800 rpm allows completely degrading mo1 reaching 96 5 of cod removal with an energy consumption of 49 5 kwh m 3 despite the low electrical conductivity of wastewater equal to 2 1 10 5 s cm 1 the experiments in the presence of sulphate ions highlight a slight change in cod removal 86 8 in 20 mm na2so4 with a consistent reduction of energy consumption 39 due to an increase of solution conductivity 10 2 s cm 1 the presence of chloride negatively influences cod removal with a performance loss of 37 compared to the optimal case moreover the eaop integration with ultrasound is investigated focusing on the importance of ultrasound management and their optimization as a function of effluent properties experiments carried out with us show that their application is recommended for the entire duration of the oxidation process only in the presence of sulphate 20 mm otherwise us application must be limited to the first part of the process to reach a complete mo1 degradation which is mainly driven by electrochemical oxidation this us management represents an improvement compared to the conventional method which applies the us for the entire process allowing the reduction of us energy consumption declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

are the constant rate of pseudo first order kinetic min 1 of sech ech and us process respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of operating conditions on electrochemical oxidation the first stage of the study faces the degradation of mo1 by electrochemical oxidation this step is fundamental to evaluate the synergistic effect in sech process discussed in the second part of the paper the applied current has a strong impact on electrochemical system performance both in the degradation rate and energy consumption degradation of 100 mg l 1 of mo1 with different current intensities 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1a is performed for 180 min of electrolysis using the spe system and the results are reported in fig 1 in this preliminary investigation the pollutant is dissolved in distilled water and supporting electrolyte is not added to the solution σ 1 1 10 5 s cm 1 the colour removal changes from 90 60 at 0 25 a to a complete mo1 oxidation at 0 75 a and 1 a respectively the decolourization occurs thanks to using a very effective anode towards the degradation of organics such as bdd in particular using bdd the degradation of organic matter is expected to occur mainly by hydroxyl radicals generated from water oxidation 40 as reported in fig s 3 and table s 2 supplementary materials the mo1 oxidation follows a pseudo first order kinetic and the apparent constant rate grows up from 0 013 to 0 030 min 1 as a function of the applied current the higher production of oh could explain this increase in the oxidation rate at high current intensity on the other hand increasing the current up to 1a does not significantly improve the degradation rate thus the process can be controlled either by charge transfer when the applied current is less than 0 75 a or under mass transfer control with a current intensity above 0 75a over the increase of the applied current does not favour the oxidation of the pollutants but increase the hydroxyl radicals decomposition eqs 8 41 8 2 oh h 2 o 1 2o 2 further confirmation about the ability of the spe based system to remove the azo dye from wastewater is reported in fig 2 which correlates energy consumption with cod removal excluding the experiment at 0 25 a with a cod removal of 78 the others selected current values are able to reach 90 with a maximum of 97 at 1 a it highlights that a solid polymer electrolyte based cell allows also treating intermediate compounds nevertheless a higher current negatively affects energy consumption with a small profit in cod removal indeed moving from 0 75 a to 1 a the energy required grows from 49 5 to 72 8 kwh m 3 gaining only 1 in cod removal from 96 5 to 97 5 given the degradation rate and the energy consumption the authors select the current intensity of 0 75 a as a value for the following investigations the stirring rate is another important parameter that can affect process performance and is directly connected with mass transport four experiments are conducted at 0 75 a with different stirring rates 200 400 800 and 1000 rpm and the results are presented in fig s 4 the oxidation rate increases when the stirring rate grows from 200 to 400 rpm which means that the process is under mass transport limitation in this range a further increase is obtained at 800 rpm while over this value the process is almost unaffected by agitation nevertheless it is important to highlight that despite the absolute mo1 degradation enhancement being quite limited from 93 3 at 200 rpm to 100 at 800 rpm the mass transport affects the degradation rate in fact the apparent rate constant increases from 0 156 to 0 22 min 1 41 faster colourant oxidation supported by enhanced mass transport is reflected in higher cod removal as reported in fig 3 this is because more hydroxyl radicals are available for the oxidations of by products cod removal is penalized at 200 rpm due to the mo1 lower oxidation rate the variation of colour removal throughout the electrolysis treatment is shown at 20 38 and 43 c in fig s 5 as can be seen the temperature increase has a slight effect on the degradation of dye an increase in temperature from 20 to 38 c leads to a slight increase in the oxidation rate at the beginning of electrolysis further growth to 43 c does not provide any improvement this behaviour according to the literature is because with bdd anodes the increase in temperature has a positive effect mainly with the electrogeneration of oxidizing agents from inorganic ions deriving from supporting electrolyte that in this specific case has not been added into the solution 42 44 moreover we need additional energy to change the temperature which negatively affects the cost of the degradation therefore room temperature can be selected as the best choice for the electrochemical oxidation process this weak influence is a relevant result for the following analysis carried out applying the us which affects the solution temperature 3 2 influence of solution properties an investigation of the influence of tap water ions the nature of the supporting electrolyte and the effect of the solution conductivity is performed moreover the employment of water containing inorganic ions has the aim to investigate the solid polymer based cell performance under conditions closer to a real effluent a current of 0 75 a is selected to treat different mo1 polluted solutions distilled water tap water and different amounts of na2so4 in the range 2 20 mm and nacl in the range 2 4 mm are used as reported in fig 4 the nacl concentration is limited to 4 mm for the extremely negative impact on cod removal as described below first it is interesting to highlight that the substitution of distilled water with tap water and the consequent presence of ions in solution do not penalize system performance this confirmation about degradation capability also in the presence of ions is an essential step for investigating and developing this kind of solid electrolyte cell based the results markedly show the influence of the supporting electrolyte the presence of salt in the solution reduces energy consumption but it can also interfere with cod removal such worsening in performance is not so strong in the presence of na2so4 while it becomes relevant when nacl is used in the first case cod removal decreases from 96 5 with distilled water to 90 0 and 86 8 with 2 mm and 20 mm na2so4 respectively the main cause is identified in the presence of sulphate ions that dimerize forming s2o8 2 45 47 9 2so 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 2e this drawback is counterbalanced by an energy consumption decrement especially at 20 mm na2so4 under these conditions the energy supplied downs from 49 5 kwh m 3 with distilled water to 30 2 kwh m 3 39 on the contrary the nacl addition causes a not negligible worsening of cod removal performance with 37 4 compared to the reference case carried out in distilled water although the oxidant power of chloride solution is well known other studies documented the detrimental effect of such species on removing organic material when a bdd anode is adopted 48 50 in particular polcaro et al 48 scialdone et al 50 well investigated the negative impact of operating at low chloride concentration using a bdd anode the active chlorine can react with hydroxyl radicals to form chlorite and chlorate or the chlorine may react with peroxides produced by reaction 5 following reactions 10 and 11 10 h 2 o 2 cl 2 2hcl o 2 11 2clo 2 h 2 o 2 2oh 2clo 2 o 2 h 2 o on the other hand operating at a high chlorine concentration is not suitable due to the possible formation of more toxic and recalcitrant species these results confirm that the nature of supporting electrolytes can drastically affect the degradation process due to their interaction with anode material the results reported in this paragraph are highly significant about the ability of the system to treat solutions in a wide electrical conductivity range 10 5 10 2 s cm 1 avoiding any water body and electrochemical cell modification in presence of sulphate media 3 3 eaop integration with ultrasound experiments at different current intensities 0 25 a 0 5 a 0 75 a are carried out applying us to understand how their application can enhance the degradation of mo1 in the sonoelectrochemical process this section focuses on the mo1 degradation performance and the duration of us application the us application completely changes the global energy consumptions balance to be competitive this coupling of the electrochemical process with ultrasound must be considered if integrated with renewable energy for power supply the investigation of the impact of ultrasound on the overall energy cost is out of the scope of this paper fig 5 compares sech results with those obtained in the absence of sonication and without the addition of supporting electrolytes it is observed that the us improves the degradation rate of mo1 in the first 90 min for all the applied current values for example operating at 0 75 a after 30 min of electrolysis the degradation rate with the us increases from 55 7 to 71 14 the main reasons for such relevant improvement in the sech process are i strong oxidizing species are generated such as oh ho2 o and h2o2 eqs 1 5 which in turn accelerate the destruction of the dye chromogenic groups and achieving dye degradation ii ultrasound promotes the mass transfer of pollutants and iii cleaning and activating electrode surface 14 21 24 51 these positive ultrasound effects are well highlighted by the synergistic indexes reported in table 2 which has a value higher than 1 for all the applied current values it is noteworthy that by increasing the current from 0 25 a to 0 75 a the synergistic index decreases from 1 57 up to 1 48 then the influence of ultrasound is more relevant at low current indeed the higher the current applied to the cell the higher the amount of oh produced at bdd interface by the electrochemical process nevertheless in a time range between 90 and 120 min a crossing between the sech and ech curves is identified as a function of the applied current the higher is the current the earlier the intersection between the two curves occurs over this threshold the application of ultrasound penalized the degradation process and it is confirmed by the synergistic index in table 2 which becomes lower than one for all the three cases reported in fig 5 the final degradation of sech process is lower than those obtained in the absence of ultrasound the crossing time depends on the applied current and it occurs in a narrow mo1 concentration range 12 18 mg l 1 such peculiar behaviour identified for the mo1 oxidation process could be due to mass transfer limitation which occurs only at low pollutant concentrations a first hypothesis recalls the results about the effect of the stirring rate discussed above which over 800 rpm does not significantly increase system performance a further enhancement of mass transport caused by the us can negatively affect the interaction between the remaining organic matter and hydroxyl radicals at the electrode interface this result suggests that the management of ultrasound during the degradation process can be optimized indeed such negative impact caused a worsening in oxidation performance and wasting of energy due to us application based on these facts two other types of experiments are then carried out to reach a deeper understanding of this peculiar behaviour and improve us application management in all the cases an applied current of 0 75 a is considered the first kind of experiment investigates the us application time range and results are reported in fig 6 where the references cases of fig 5a are compared with two cases with the following features 1 the us are applied only for the first 90 min 2 the us are applied after 90 min in the first case the system follows the us behaviour previously obtained in the first 90 min and the interruption of ultrasound after 90 min avoids the crossing discussed above reaching a complete decolourization on the other hand in the second case the application of ultrasound after 90 min hindered the degradation process limiting it to the same plateau described above during the discussion of fig 5 when us are applied for all the process time although literature reports that us application should enhance colour degradation 23 52 the results obtained here suggest that in this specific case the us application for mo1 concentration lower than 20 mg l 1 penalized the process this experimental evidence confirms the high sensitivity by operating conditions e g electrode materials effluent composition fluid dynamic conditions of the electrochemical oxidation process performance the second series of tests are performed to investigate this peculiar behaviour identified in mo1 oxidation in the presence of us in this case different amounts of na2so4 are added to the solution in sulphate media the main reaction path for electrogeneration of persulfate is those proposed by eq 8 nevertheless in the presence of us the electrogenerated s2o8 2 is converted into the more powerful radical so4 by the reaction 12 s 2 o 8 2 ultrasound 2 so 4 results in fig 7 highlight that with 20 mm of sodium sulphate the process with us application for the entire duration not shows a limitation in colour removal this na2so4 value represents a threshold beyond what the us application for more than 90 min increases the degradation rate with a complete decolourization in 150 min instead of 180 min such improvement might be related to the formation of so4 radicals by us in the bulk solution moving the oxidation process beyond the electrode surface where radicals are electrochemically produced and act the sulphate radicals produced by us counterbalance the negative impact of us on mass transport detected before at low mo1 concentration allowing for complete mo1 degradation such improvement with bdd anode in presence of sulphate has been detected by rodrigo and martínez huitle groups who report so4 bulk production in presence of uv irradiation 53 here the effect provided by a light source is guaranteed by us 53 a further investigation is carried out treating a solution with an initial concentration equal to 15 mg l 1 fig 8 confirms the behaviour described above the sech process in the absence or with a low concentration of supporting electrolyte 20 mm hinders the mo1 oxidation when the solution has a low pollutant load see fig s 6 in the supporting material the coupling of the electrochemical process with sonication to treat low concentrated mo1 solution makes a positive effect only at 20 mm of na2so4 at the beginning of this section it is reported the importance to couple the us application with renewable energy the results reported here add a second important point about us application and management indeed despite the most adopted practice being to apply us for the entire process duration a deeper knowledge of the degradation process allows a higher electrochemical performance and energy saving as suggested here limiting the us application only to a specific interval time 4 conclusion in this paper a flexible electrochemical cell setup is proposed for the electrochemical oxidation of pollutants to operate in a large range of electrical conductivity 1 10 5 10 2 s cm 1 without changing the wastewater composition making the electrochemical plant handling easier the eaop cell flexibility regarding solution conductivity composition is a fundamental step to improve process management and exploitation leading this kind of technology to a real application for the treatment of industrial wastewater in several sectors such a system is based on the employment of a solid polymer electrolyte nafion 117 sandwiched between a bdd anode and a tiruo2 cathode the experiments are carried out evaluating the degradation of 100 mg l 1 of mo1 dye the first operating parameters considered are the current intensity 0 25 1 00 a and the stirring rate 200 1000 rpm an applied current of 0 75 a at 800 rpm allows completely degrading mo1 reaching 96 5 of cod removal with an energy consumption of 49 5 kwh m 3 despite the low electrical conductivity of wastewater equal to 2 1 10 5 s cm 1 the experiments in the presence of sulphate ions highlight a slight change in cod removal 86 8 in 20 mm na2so4 with a consistent reduction of energy consumption 39 due to an increase of solution conductivity 10 2 s cm 1 the presence of chloride negatively influences cod removal with a performance loss of 37 compared to the optimal case moreover the eaop integration with ultrasound is investigated focusing on the importance of ultrasound management and their optimization as a function of effluent properties experiments carried out with us show that their application is recommended for the entire duration of the oxidation process only in the presence of sulphate 20 mm otherwise us application must be limited to the first part of the process to reach a complete mo1 degradation which is mainly driven by electrochemical oxidation this us management represents an improvement compared to the conventional method which applies the us for the entire process allowing the reduction of us energy consumption declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

13098,design and assembly of a novel sustainable unique nanocomposite with multi purpose activities with efficient adsorptive removal behavior toward different organic inorganic and biological pollutants is a challenging aspect therefore the current work is directed to prepare graphene quantum dots gqds from mango peels via a facile method gqds were coupled with feal double layered hydroxide fa dlh and intercalated via co precipitation with gemifloxacin antibiotic gem for the formation of a 3d structure with multiple functional nanocomposite gqds gem fa dlh this was utilized for various pollutants removal including lead pb ii 4 nitroaniline 4na enterococcus faecalis e faecalis and escherichia coli e coli gqds gem fa dlh was characterized from ft ir edx hr tem bet xrd and tga techniques the maximum removal of 4na and pb ii were established as 90 7 ph 2 0 and 98 8 ph 6 0 respectively the adsorption performance by gqds gem fa dlh was favored according to langmuir and pseudo second order furthermore the antibacterial removal activity against gram positive e faecalis and gram negative e coli by gqds gem fa dlh was assessed using two different methods minimum inhibitory concentration mic and minimum bactericidal concentration mbc and the removal percentages reached to 91 3 and 82 9 respectively moreover the removal of bacteria from wastewater based on the total plate count was established as 80 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords graphene quantum dots gemifloxacin fe al layered double hydroxide pb ii and 4 nitroaniline enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli bacterial activity 1 introduction the recent development in industrial activities and the high increase in worldwide population have led to excessive increase in wastewater generation with different pollutants as organics pharmaceuticals dyes aromatics and their nitro chlorinated and fluorinated derivatives etc inorganics as heavy metals pb hg cd cr and as etc and biologicals bactericides and fungicides etc 1 5 these pollutants are well known to impose high harmful and toxic effects on public health due to their crucial impact in increasing the damage to organisms and human health 1 2 however heavy metal ions have been widely utilized in many industries such as paint dyes pipes and lubricants 3 4 pb ii as an example of heavy metals is enormously toxic in water at low concentration levels and brings out a serious threat to the human body due to possible binding with red blood cells and final coagulation into bones 6 in addition pb ii ions are generally absorbed in the body through inhalation of about 20 80 while the ingestion amount is ranging between 5 and 15 7 therefore exposure to pb ii ions was found to cause serious problems such as anemia cancer liver diseases and kidneys damages 3 6 8 4 nitroaniline 4na is an example of nitro compounds utilized as a precursor for the production of a number of organic derivatives with potential applications as corrosion inhibitors azo dyes antiseptic agents pharmaceuticals and antioxidants 9 12 however 4na is typically classified as a hazardous material that has the ability to cause nephrotoxicity and hematotoxicity 13 14 therefore 4na has been categorized as one of the substances on the black list in china with the limitation in water is less than 1 0 mg l 1 15 another highly risky class of pollutants in contaminated water is related to some bacteria with the capability of causing side effects such as typhoid eye and stomach infections diarrhea and hepatitis b and c 16 it is well known that bacteria can survive in the aqueous environment for lengthy periods of time due to their resistance ability for typical disinfection procedures 17 moreover bacteria are categorized in the forms of gram negative and positive which are typically listed as highly dangerous organisms e coli is a gram negative and known to cause cholecystitis bacteremia diarrhea cholangitis urinary infection and neonatal meningitis and pneumonia 18 19 e faecalis is a class of gram positive intestinal bacteria that can cause some infection including dysplasia and inflammatory bowel gastrointestinal disorders and crohn s disease 20 therefore it is vital and essential aspect with respect to design and develop new technological routes with high efficiency for declining or elimination of pb ii 4na and bacteria from water in order to prevent their toxic impact and adversative effects 3 13 20 many treatment methods such as oxidation 21 23 chemical precipitation 24 reverse osmosis 25 biodegradation 26 and adsorption 27 were widely applied for elimination of a number of organic and inorganic pollutants from wastewater however adsorption 28 29 ozonization 30 chlorination 31 and uv irradiation 32 were proved to be beneficial for removing bacteria from wastewater unfortunately some technologies are inefficient costly and usually produce some side products as additional secondary pollutant 1 2 for example 4na as an aromatic compound was found resistant to degradation via chemical and oxidation processes 6 8 in addition the anaerobic degradation of 4na was characterized to produce two biproducts viz nitroso and hydroxylamines which are listed as carcinogenic compounds 33 34 consequently water treatment of such pollutants represents a great challenge subject to researchers for finding out effective materials low cost techniques and facile applications adsorption technique has been recently reported and recognized to afford a good varieties of cost effective and simply synthesized sorbents with developed affinity to remove pb ii and 4na from wastewater based on using activated carbon 35 metal oxides 36 and polymers 37 the use of adsorption techniques for removal of pb ii 4na and bacteria were also reported by some researches for example fabricated calcium alginate with carbon nanotube ca mwcnts showed a high pb ii adsorption level at 88 0 under ph 5 5 38 zeolitic adsorbents were synthesized from bagasse fly ash and applied to remove 4na and nitrobenzene 39 cataldo et al reported that nanosponges of cyclodextrin calixarene was used as adsorbent material for removal of pb ii from water 40 on the other hand high percent removal of some bacteria was explored by a number of adsorbents as magnetic chitosan 41 functionalized polyethersulfone 42 and ceramic ag impregnated pot filter with zeolite and activated carbon 43 all these cases seemingly account for better performance of adsorption technique for removal of different pollutants graphene quantum dots gqds and carbon quantum dots cqds are examples of new carbonaceous nanomaterials with oxygenated multifunctional groups and characterized by several important incorporated characteristics as direct preparation and production from low cost sustainable materials good chemical reactivity simple functionalization low toxicity biocompatibility tiny particle size and high surface area 44 52 the gqds were utilized for removal of inorganic and organic wastes due to the presence of oxygenated functional groups with good capability of chelating metal ions from aqueous solutions 53 54 in addition modified and functionalized gqds adsorbents have recently shown vital growing interests in different fields including removal of pollutants from wastewater 55 58 for example modification of carbon dots with gold was prepared and investigated for removal of some nitro aromatic compounds via adsorption process based on the formation of h bonding between nitro groups aromatic compounds and hydroxyl groups of carbon dots 55 recently the efficiency of modified gqds with graphitic carbon nitride in removal of antibiotics via photocatalytic reaction was reported 56 another study reported the removal of hg ii by using fe3o4 sio2 gqds 57 the investigation of polyvinyl chloride membrane embedded by gqds for removal of dye from wastewater was also discussed 58 successful immobilization of gqds onto nife2o4 halloysite for elimination of cd ii was applied 59 finally functionalized gqds was proved as novel materials for application in removal of pollutants from wastewater 60 layered double hydroxide materials dlh are defined types of anionic 2d materials with excellent affinity for binding and removal of heavy metal ions and other cationic species 60 64 dlh materials possess structure features which permit their developments as excellent adsorbents to catch cationic pollutants from water 54 such chemical adaptability is mainly owing to the direct interaction of dlh via negatively charged hydroxyl functional groups with various cationic materials to build up architectures with the formation of 3d composites 53 as a result of the excellent chemical adsorption features in both gqds and dlh it is aimed in this study to explore an innovative nanocomposite by direct combination of gqds with dlh in order to increase the tailored functional groups to accomplish this target firstly gqds were prepared by a facile method from sustainable low cost precursor of mango peels feal double layered hydroxide fa dlh was fabricated and intercalated with gemifloxacin antibiotic gem via a co precipitation procedure for the formation of a 3d structure with multiply different functional groups gem fa dlh the produced gem fa dlh was then bonded with gqds for the formation of a novel nanocomposite gqds gem fa dlh with directed multipurpose functionalities for adsorptive removal of inorganic pollutants as pb ii ions organic contaminants as 4 nitroaniline 4na and bactericidal pollutants as e faecalis and e coli using two methods viable cell count and mic mbc furthermore removal processes of these pollutants from different water systems were investigated and evaluated under different experimental contributing parameters the reusability of gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite was also aimed to examine as an important issue for performance appraisal in the future work the structure of gqds gem fa dlh was confirmed from the ft ir edx hr tem bet xrd and and tga characterizations 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and instrumentations table 1 shows all chemical substances and analytical devices that were employed in experimental and characterization procedures 2 2 synthesis of gqds from sustainable mango peels waste mango peels were cut down into small pieces washed with distilled water dw and dried at 80 c the dried peels were then heated in a muffle furnace for 1 h at 300 c the obtained carbonaceous material 10 0 g was refluxed with sulfuric acid and nitric acid for 24 h at 80 c for oxygenolysis and followed by the addition of suitable amount of naoh to adjust the ph value to 7 0 the suspension was centrifuged for 25 min to remove undesired materials and the final supernatant solution was evaporated to obtain the orangish brown powder of gqds the uv vis spectrophotometry of gqds produced a λmax at 270 nm due to π π and n π transitions in c c and c o respectively in addition the fluorescence spectrophotometery of gqds generated a λexcitation at 320 nm while the maximum emission of gqds was obtained at 491 nm 2 3 synthesis of gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite 3 0 g of gqds and 2 0 g of gem were sonicated in dw for 1 h this mixture was then added and reacted with stirring to 0 019 mol fecl3 6h2o and 0 0375 mol alcl3 6h2o solution for 30 min naoh solution 4 0 mol l 1 was added to adjust the ph value to 10 0 and refluxed at 60 c for 24 h the formed precipitate was treated with dw and centrifuged with ethanol water mixture the final precipitate was dried at 70 c the pure fa dlh material was prepared by utilizing the same method without addition of gqds and gem 2 4 adsorptive removal of 4na and pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite the sorption experiments were approved to recognize the removal efficiency of 4na and pb ii under a number of controlling parameters in each experiment a selected amount of gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite was mixed with 10 0 ml of suitable concentrations of 4na or pb ii and shaken for a certain period of time after shaking this mixture was filtrated and rinsed with dw then the residual concentration of 4na and pb ii was measured by uv visible spectrophotometry at λmax 352 nm and atomic absorption spectrophotometry respectively the removal values of 4na and pb ii was calculated from eq 1 as listed in table 2 the impact of ph was carried out in the range 1 0 7 0 by mixing 20 0 mg l 1 of 4na or 10 mg l 1 pb ii with 10 0 mg of gqds gem fa dlh and shaken 30 min the point of zero charge phpzc of gqds gem fa dlh was studied according to the salt method 65 in this experiment 0 2 g of gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite was added to 50 ml of nacl 0 01 mol l 1 and adjusted from ph 2 to10 phinitial and shaken for 4 h then the values of phfinal were measured after 24 h the difference between phfinal and phinitial was plotted against phinitial to determine the phpzc in the dosage factor 10 ml of 4na 20 0 mg l 1 and pb ii 10 0 mg l 1 pollutants were mixed with different gqds gem fa dlh masses 1 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 mg and shaken for 30 min in the adsorption isotherm experiments 10 0 ml of 4na or pb ii with concentration from 1 0 to 100 0 mg l 1 were employed at adsorption time 30 min in the kinetic tests 10 0 mg of gqds gem fa dlh was added to 10 0 ml of 4na 20 0 mg l 1 or pb ii 10 0 mg l 1 and shaken for 1 30 min the parameters of isotherm and kinetic studies were determined by using the given equations in table 2 in the co existing ions experiments 10 0 mg of gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite was mixed with 100 0 mg of these salts na2so4 kcl nh4cl cacl2 and mgso4 and 10 0 ml of 20 0 mg l 1 4na or 10 0 mg l 1 of pb ii in the temperature experiments 10 0 mg of gqds gem fa dlh was mixed with 10 0 ml of 20 0 mg l 1 4na or 10 0 mg l 1 of pb ii and shaken 30 min in the temperature range 298 348 k adsorptive removal of spiked 4na or pb ii into the examined tap water wastewater and sea water samples was accomplished by mixing 100 mg of gqds gem fa dlh in 500 ml of 4na spiked samples 10 mg l 1 at ph 2 and pb ii 1 0 mg l 1 at ph 6 and shaken for 30 min the removal values of 4na and pb ii were calculated from eq 1 as listed in table 2 regeneration and reusability of gqds gem fa dlh were accomplished according to the following procedure 20 0 mg of gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite was placed in 20 ml solution of 4na 10 0 mg l 1 or pb ii 10 0 mg l 1 and shaken for 30 min the gqds gem fa dlh bound 4na and gqds gem fa dlh bound pb ii were isolated washed with dw and dried the dried solids were shaken with 50 0 ml of hcl 0 1 mol l 1 for 1 0 h and the samples were well washed with dw and dried at 60 c overnight the previously steps were repeated 5 times and the removal percentage values of pb ii and 4na were then calculated after each cycle 2 5 removal of bactericidal pollutants by the action of gqds gem fa dlh 2 5 1 preparation and preservation of microbiological reference material 2 5 1 1 microorganism and culture medium the microorganisms were used to determine the antimicrobial activity using the viable cell count method like enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 e faecalis gram positive bacteria and escherichia coli atcc 8739 e coli gram negative bacteria the selective medium was membrane enterococcus agar and chromocult coliform agar for e faecalis and e coli respectively 66 tryptic soy broth medium tsb was used for mic determination while plate count agar medium pca was used to determine mbc for the two organisms under investigation 67 each culture medium was sterilized according to manufacturer procedures 2 5 1 2 membrane filter technique cellulose membrane filter 47 mm diameter and 0 45 μm pore size was utilized to filter and retain the bacteria present in the sample 68 the filter was placed on the selective medium then the incubation of plate was adjusted at 35 c for 48 h e faecalis at 36 c for 24 h e coli all light and dark red colonies were counted as enterococci a typical e coli colony has dark blue to violet color 2 5 1 3 preparation of stock reference material by a sterile forceps a disc aseptically was removed and placed in tryptic soy broth and followed by incubation at 35 37 c for 24 h 66 then 10 15 glycerol v v was added and slowly stirred for 15 min 1 5 ml of the stock solution was dispensed into each cryovial and stored at 20 c after 24 h serial dilutions were prepared 10 1 10 9 plate out the serial dilutions on non selective and selective medium and then incubate at 35 37 c for 24 h for the non selective plate count agar medium the suitable count plates were 30 300 cfu ml while for the selective medium 100 cfu ml and 80 cfu ml were used for e faecalis and e coli respectively for quantitative determination 2 5 2 antibacterial activity measurements the antibacterial activity of gqds gem fa dlh was evaluated by two methods the viable cell count and mic mbc 2 5 2 1 viable cell count 2 5 2 1 1 time removal of e faecalis and e coli by the action of gqds gem fa dlh at ph 7 0 a 1 0 ml of two bacterial strains with optimum dilution was added to 9 0 ml sterilized buffer then 10 0 mg of gqds gem fa dlh was placed into this tube with constant shaking at 25 1 c using various times 1 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 min after filtration the residual solution was washed with 50 ml sterilized ddw finally the removal percentage values of e faecalis and e coli were computed from eq 1 as given in table 2 2 5 2 1 2 mass effect of gqds gem fa dlh on removal of e faecalis and e coli as described in the above experiment gqds gem fa dlh was added by using different masses 1 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 mg at 10 min and the removal percentage values of e faecalis and e coli were computed from eq 1 as given in table 2 2 5 2 2 mic and mbc determination the mic of gqds gem fa dlh was investigated by broth dilution technique 67 in this 1 0 ml of test organisms was added to tubes containing 9 ml tsb medium with different amounts of gqds gem fa dlh ranging from 10 to 1000 μg ml 1 all the tubes were incubated at 35 c for 24 h and then investigated for the presence of turbidity that indicates bacterial growth mic is the lowest concentration of gqds gem fa dlh to inhibit bacterial growth which is detected by the absence of turbidity in addition the positive control and negative control sterility were examined the positive control was the tube without the bacterial culture while the negative control was the tube without the bacterial agent the two tubes with the mic tube were subculture on pca plates and incubated at 35 c for 48 h mbc value was determined through the tube that prevents any visible bacterial growth 2 5 2 3 potential application of gqds gem fa dlh for removal of e faecalis and e coli from wastewater in this study wastewater was collected from el siouf intake mahmodia canal alexandria egypt this experiment was carried out in 500 ml of wastewater from viable cell count the optimum conditions were obtained for e faecalis 0 1 mg ml 1 and e coli 0 6 mg ml 1 at 10 min the application was accomplished by two conditions i 500 ml sample was combined with 50 mg of gqds gem fa dlh and ii 500 ml of sample was merged with 300 mg followed by shaking for 10 min and the percentage removal values and total plate count were then calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization fig 1 represents the ft ir spectra of gqds fa dlh and gqds gem fa dlh the peaks appearing in fig 1a for gqds at 3495 2876 1717 1656 and 1165 1034 are due to hydroxyl group oh ch co cc and c o respectively 69 in fig 1b the peak at 3339 cm 1 was generated due to the oh in the hydroxide like layers or intercalated water molecules while the peak at 1636 cm 1 was formed by the bending of interlayer and adsorbed water molecules the peak at 702 cm 1 is due the stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups in fig 1c a broad peak at 3367 cm 1 is assigned to the oh stretching mode of hydroxyl group the strong absorption peaks at 1569 and 1356 cm 1 are ascribed to the asymmetric and symmetric coo group in gem and or gqds anions respectively the band of carboxylate group at 1717 cm 1 was shifted to a lower frequency 1569 cm 1 due to the interaction between gem gqds and fa dlh layers when compared with the pure gqds or gem in addition two bands at 1037 and 613 cm 1 could be related to the metal layers o mo of the host material the outlined results confirm that gem and gqds has been intercalated into the interlayer space of fa dlh as illustrated in scheme 1 thus the surface modification of fa dlh with hydrophilic functional groups carboxyl and amino is expected to enhance the adsorption efficiency for removal of hazardous pollutants from contaminated water as 4na and pb ii fig 2a shows the surface morphology of gqds gem fa dlh by using sem the nanocomposite was tended to coagulate and randomly disseminate with average particles size 20 5 nm the structural morphology of gqds and gqds gem fa dlh was further confirmed by hr tem fig 2b and c in fig 2b the hr tem of gqds exhibited a typically spherical shaped structure the average size of gqds was found 6 5 nm to confirm its quantum dots size the edx image of gqds gem fa dlh is illustrated in fig 3a to refer to the presence of elemental composition including c n o fe and al of the assembled gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite the c n and o peaks were evidently dispersed in fa dlh nanosheets the atom were characterized to correspond to 51 34 c 2 21 n 40 34 o 5 69 fe and 0 42 al in the assembled gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite the tga and dta results of assembled gqds gem fa dlh are presented in fig 3b the tga diagram of assembled gqds gem fa dlh showed a weight loss with temperature elevation due to the loss of water adsorbed molecules and interlayer adsorbed water from the surface in dta the endothermic peak around 100 c indicates that water on the surface was evaporated this peak refer to a mass loss 13 6 from gqds gem fa dlh at 35 1 141 0 c the strong exothermic peak between 213 7 and 407 6 c is due to loss of interlayer water and dehydroxylation of gqds gem fa dlh in this range the weight loss of gqds gem fa dlh was found 2 7 in addition an exothermic characteristic peak of fe2o3 was observed at 545 2 c while the observed exothermic peak at 635 2 c is ascribed to phase change from fe3o4 to α fe3o4 in the assembled gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite 70 71 above 380 1 c and up to 698 4 c the weight loss was reached to 11 4 the powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns of gqds fa dlh and gqds gem fa dlh are shown in fig 4 the xrd pattern of gqds exhibited a characteristic peak of pristine graphite at 2θ 24 60o as shown in fig 4a the xrd peaks fig 4b of fa dlh exhibited several peaks at 2θ 15 12 26 91 32 92 35 05 38 89 due to 101 003 203 221 planes with 15 58 crytallinity degree to confirms the formation of alooh and feooh in the composite according to jcpds card no 21 1307 and 34 1266 respectively 72 the diffraction angles of gqds gem fa dlh at 2θ 14 89 24 10 29 78 34 62 43 58 61 98 63 80 74 59 are corresponding to 101 112 003 301 223 005 334 621 to approve the tetragonal phase the degree of crystallinity of gqds gem fa dlh is 10 40 and this means that the overall crystallinity was decreased after binding of gem and gqds with fa dlh after intercalation of gem and gqds in fa dlh the typical plane d003 3 32 nm of fa dlh was shifted to a higher angle at 2θ 29 78 d003 3 69 nm with significant increase of 0 37 nm in the d spacing the enlargement of interlayer distance in gqds gem fa dlh is mainly attributed to a direct binding of fa dlh with gqds and gem the surface area and porosity of gqds gem fa dlh were investigated by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms the measured bet surface area of assembled gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite was 20 05 m2 g 1 the total pore volume and mean pore diameter were 0 029 cm3 g 1 and 5 77 nm respectively according to iupac classification 73 gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite was found to refer to a type iv physisorption isotherm and h3 hysteresis shape fig 5 this structure is dependent on the formation of assembled gqds gem fa dlh network by capillary condensation and complex characteristics incorporated into gqds gem and fa dlh 73 3 2 adsorptive removal studies of 4na and pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite 3 2 1 influence of ph on the adsorption of 4na and pb ii the adsorption process can be influenced by the presence of various ph conditions of the interaction solution by changing ph the binding sites are expected to be controlled and also affected by the loaded charges on the sorbent surface consequently this influences the interaction or binding process between sorbent and sorbate 74 76 fig 6a presents the effect of ph values 1 0 7 0 on the removal efficiency of pb ii and 4na pollutants onto gqds gem fa dlh the maximum removal value were established as 90 7 and 99 1 at ph 2 and 7 for 4na and pb ii respectively three forms of 4na exist at different phs i positively charged form at ph 1 0 ii neutral molecules and few of positively charged ions at ph 1 0 3 0 iii neutral molecules at ph 3 0 77 the phpzc of gqds gem fa dlh in this experiment was detected as 8 91 fig 6b to predict that the gqds gem fa dlh surface would be positively or protonated below this point so the adsorption process may involve other forces such as van der waals hydrogen bond electron donor acceptor and π π interaction 78 at low phs the nitro group was protonated no2h and therefore 4na interacted with gqds gem fa dlh through intermolecular h bonding 79 in addition the adsorption process was also enhanced in an acidic medium to favor direct interact between amino group on 4na and hydroxyl group onto gqds gem fa dlh surface by the creation of acid base complex 80 moreover the net charge on gqds gem fa dlh surface was positive while the 4na was negative induced by the mesomeric effect caused by the interaction of the lone pair of electron in amine group aromatic ring so the interaction of gqds gem fa dlh might lead to an electrostatic force with negatively resonated aromatic ring 39 in the case of pb ii removal by gqds gem fa dlh several active functional groups as nh2 cooh and oh are expected to be responsible for regulation of the pb ii adsorption process the pb ii removal were increased with raising ph and referred to the supreme at ph 7 0 99 1 at low phs the functional groups onto gqds gem fa dlh were protonated to form positively charged groups to create repulsive forces with pb ii ions however the working functional groups onto gqds gem fa dlh surface were found to strongly interact and bind with pb ii ions through complex formation and ion exchange mechanisms at ph 5 7 to generate higher removal percentages moreover pb ii ion has low charge density and therefore it behaves as a soft acid to favor strong reactions with soft bases 1 8 naphthyridine in gem and form covalent bonds on the surface of gqds gem fa dlh 81 3 2 2 the mass effect of gqds gem fa dlh on removal of 4na and pb ii the dosage impact of gqds gem fa dlh on the uptake of 4na and pb ii fig 6c and the removal values of these two pollutants were dramatically increased from 67 5 to 90 7 and 74 8 to 98 8 respectively upon the mass increase of gqds gem fa dlh from 1 0 to 10 0 mg besides the removal values of 4na were 67 5 68 8 78 6 79 8 83 2 87 3 and 90 7 using 1 2 4 5 6 8 and 10 mg of gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite respectively similarly pb ii was reached to 74 8 84 5 86 7 90 0 91 2 96 9 and 98 8 removal by using 1 2 4 5 6 8 and 10 mg of gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite respectively accordingly the outlined results are mainly referring to a great numbers of active sites on the surface of investigated gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite upon increasing the dosage that possesses 74 3 2 3 concentration effect of 4na and pb ii and adsorption isotherms the change in uptakes of 4na and pb ii are generally changed according to the alteration in concentration of pollutants fig 6d reveals the impact of initial concentrations of 4na and pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh the uptakes of 4na and pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh were rapidly enhanced with the increased concentrations of 4na and pb ii to attain the equilibrium at this point almost all active sites on the gqds gem fa dlh surface were occupied by 4na or pb ii and then the uptakes became optimal the maximum established qe values of gqds gem fa dlh for 4na and pb ii were 51 2 and 80 1 mg l 1 respectively in this respect the langmuir d r temkin and freundlich nonlinear models were modeled to evaluate the adsorption mechanisms of 4na or pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh the langmuir model was established to describe a homogeneous mechanism and monolayer process in dynamic equilibrium the freundlich model was designed to describe the formation of nonuniform multilayer figuration during the adsorption process the d r model was also set as a heterogeneous mechanism onto the surface of the adsorbent 81 the temkin model was mainly dependent on the temperature by neglecting the amount of sorbent and sorbate during the sorption process 82 fig 7a and b are the nonlinear isotherm models for removal of 4na and pb ii by gqds gem fa dlh respectively the computed parameters and constants are listed in table 3 and according to the high r2 the data of langmuir was figured out to fit best rather than the other three models the theoretical qmax of 4na and pb ii were 56 6 and 85 1 mg g 1 respectively which are extremely close to the maximum capacity of experimental qe these data confirm that the removal of 4na and pb ii by gqds gem fa dlh were recognized to proceed via monolayer sorption processes in the d r model the values of qmax were 47 2 and 70 9 mg g 1 for 4na and pb ii respectively in addition the calculated e values were 0 016 and 0 025 kj mol 1 for 4na and pb ii respectively to refer to physisorption process e 8 kj mol 1 the calculated 1 nf values from the freundlich model were 0 33 and 0 37 between 0 0 and 1 0 for removal of 4na and pb ii respectively to indicate favorable adsorption of 4 n and pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh 81 according to the temkin model the nonlinear r2 values were 0 9647 and 0 9312 for 4na and pb ii respectively furthermore the rl could be deliberated from the langmuir isotherm to describe and classify the sorption process the reaction is i irreversible at rl 0 ii linear at rl 1 iii favorable at 0 rl 1 and iv unfavorable at rl 1 the range of rl values were 0 034 0 263 and 0 019 0 164 for 4na and pb ii respectively according to the computed rl values between 0 and 1 for 4na and pb ii pollutants the sorption processes of the two pollutants onto gqds gem fa dlh were favorable 3 2 4 time effect on removal of 4na and pb ii and kinetics study fig 7c illustrates the change in removal values of 4na and pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh versus time in the time range from 1 to 10 min removal of pb ii was increased rapidly from 87 9 to 97 9 to confirm that sufficient active sites on the surface of gqds gem fa dlh were available to interact and bind with 4na and pb ii after 10 min the removal of both pollutants declined due to the decrease in number of active sites after a long time periods on the other side the adsorption of 4na was gradually increased with time to reach to the equilibrium at 15 min adsorption kinetics is affected by different variables like the rate of diffusion and chemical adsorption reaction the kinetic models were then studied by elovich pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion 74 the pseudo first order is employed to depict the adsorption rate controlled by the surface of the adsorbent materials the pseudo second order is utilized to find out the mechanism of adsorption which governs the rate of adsorption for the interaction between sorbent and active sites of adsorbent 81 table 4 shows the fitting parameters for adsorption of 4na and pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh the r2 of pseudo second order 4na 0 999 and pb ii 0 999 for both pollutants are greater than the other three models the qcal values 4na 18 2 mg g 1 and pb ii 9 9 mg g 1 are close to the experimental ones this confirms that the results are excellent to describe the fitting with the pseudo second order so the rate determining step rds can be interpreted as chemisorption reaction that may be interpreted on the basis of electron sharing ion exchange and or complexation mechanism between 4na and pb ii with the active sites on the gqds gem fa dlh surface 3 2 5 influence of co existing species on 4na and pb ii adsorption onto gqds gem fa dlh in this part the experiments were investigated to follow up the impact of co existing salts at initial 4na and pb ii concentrations on the adsorption process onto gqds gem fa dlh table 5 compiles the removal of 4na and pb ii with without salts addition naso4 kcl nh4cl cacl2 and mgso4 the removal of 4na was found to slightly increase while removal of pb ii was decreased in the presence of these salts as compared to their percentages without salts for 4na the salts were dissociated and hydrated with water and thus caused a decline order in water solvation of 4na so the presence of salts improved the 4na hydrophobic which was beneficial for adsorption onto gqds gem fa dlh 82 83 in the case of pb ii the reported results are mainly due to the small size of salt ions compared to lead ii ion that increased the competition for adsorption on gqds gem fa dlh 3 2 6 temperature influence and thermodynamic parameters in this factor the removal of 4na and pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh were slightly increased with elevating the temperature from 298 to 348 k in addition the removal increased from 90 6 to 93 9 and 98 9 to 99 3 for 4na and pb ii respectively in table 6 the spontaneity of 4na and pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh were examined by computation of δgo which appeared with negative values 84 the values of δgo were negatively changed from 5 64 to 7 92 kj mol 1 for 4na and from 10 93 to 14 33 kj mol 1 for pb ii when the temperatures changed from 298 to 348 k these results confirm the spontaneity of adsorption onto gqds gem fa dlh moreover the δho values were assigned with positive sign as 7 84 4na and 9 31 pb ii kj mol 1 indicating that the adsorption processes were endothermic the δso value for 4na was found 44 33 j k 1 mol 1 and for pb ii was identified 66 48 k 1 mol 1 to indicate that more randomness and adsorption affinity of gqds gem fa dlh toward 4na and pb ii pollutants 74 3 2 7 application of gqds gem fa dlh in 4na and pb ii removal from water samples three types of water were applied to investigate removal of pb ii and 4na from tap water sea water and wastewater samples this experiment was accomplished by mixing 100 mg of gqds gem fa dlh into 500 ml of water that was spiked with 4na 10 0 mg l 1 in ph 2 0 or pb ii 1 0 mg l 1 in ph 6 0 and the mixtures were automatically shaken for 30 min for wastewater the removal percentages were 99 1 and 99 9 using 4na and pb ii respectively the removal percentages were 93 7 and 94 6 for 4na and pb ii from sea water while 98 8 and 100 for 4na and pb ii from tap water respectively thus the assembled gqds gem fa dlh proved excellent ability as a new nanocomposite for the elimination of 4na and pb ii as examples of organic and inorganic pollutants respectively from water 3 2 8 reusability of gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite reusability is known as another major and important parameter for the best visualization of the sorption process and judging the performance of gqds gem fa dlh as an efficient regenerable nanocomposite in water treatment hydrochloric acid was exploited as an excellent reagent to desorb and elute 4na and pb ii pollutants from the surface of gqds gem fa dlh without distorting the gqds gem fa dlh structure fig 7d shows five successive cycles for regeneration of gqds gem fa dlh from 4na and pb ii pollutants the percentage values r 90 7 90 5 82 79 9 and 75 2 were identified for 4na while pb ii were 98 8 98 6 96 2 94 3 and 90 1 by using 1st 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th cycles respectively it is evident that insignificant change in the removal percentages of both 4na and pb ii in the first two cycles however at the 5th cycle the r was declined by 15 5 and 8 7 to reach 75 2 and 90 1 by 4na and pb ii respectively thus gqds gem fa dlh can be recycled numerous times without significantly influence its adsorption proficiencies 3 3 removal killing study of e faecalis and e coli by the action of gqds gem fa dlh 3 3 1 time removal e faecalis and e coli the antibacterial activity is focused on the relation between time and concentrations and their contribution on the removal killing of bacteria therefore time killing and concentration must be investigated and optimized to evaluate the study of antibacterial activity 85 the removal percentages of e faecalis and e coli fig 8a were gradually increased to reach to the maximum at 10 min the removal percentages of e faecalis and e coli were characterized as 60 9 and 59 4 respectively such results suggest that gqds gem fa dlh is behaving as an active material against both e faecalis and e coli at a short time after 10 min the rate of bacterial removal was declined due to the developed resistance mechanism by the bacterial population 86 in addition the bacteria showed certain ability to develop inherited resistance toward gqds gem fa dlh antibacterial that is related to physiological reasons therefore the removal properties of the two organisms are taken into consideration in the following application section 3 3 2 mass of gqds gem fa dlh for bacteria removal killing fig 8b shows the dosage impact of gqds gem fa dlh on the removal percentages of e faecalis and e coli the maximum e faecalis removal was obtained by using 1 0 mg per 10 ml while e coli reached the maximum removal upon using 6 mg per 10 ml as the removal were identified by 91 3 and 82 9 for e faecalis and e coli respectively this trend is related to the gram positive e faecalis which produces a higher negative charge on the cell surface than gram negative e coli 87 88 so positively charged surface of gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite is expected to attract the negatively charged bacterial cell surface via electrostatic attraction as a consequence the balance of charge on the surface causes the cell to seriously distort and bacteria to kill after the optimum values the removal of bacteria were gradually decreased these results promote that the high dosage of gqds gem fa dlh would not remove e faecalis and e coli better than the lower dosage but the optimum dosage is the most significant one furthermore at high concentrations of gqds gem fa dlh bacteria may start to regrowth 89 3 3 3 mic and mbc determination the mic and mbc of gqds gem fa dlh antibacterial against e faecalis and e coli were also examined it is evident in table 7 that the behaviors of e faecalis and e coli are different both tests were investigated at 10 30 50 100 200 400 500 600 800 and 1000 μg ml 1 the bacterial growth was detected by turbidity while transparency was used to indicate no growth according to fig 9 e coli has become more visible than e faecalis that indicates no bacteria growth the mic of e coli was related to 400 μg ml while mbc was 600 μg ml 1 the inhibition effect of gqds gem fa dlh might be referred to possible diffusion into e coli membrane and interacting with intracellular organelles to destroy proteins and or dna of the cell membrane 89 on the other hand the mic of e faecalis was found greater than 1000 μg ml 1 and mbc could not be detected in the viable count method removal of e faecalis occured at a concentration lower than mic subinhibitory concentrations the population cells were more susceptible to the antibacterial agent than the mic as described for total population 89 in this case the mic may alter as a role of inoculum size in addition e faecalis can be characterized as intrinsic resistance 90 finally these results confirm that gqds gem fa dlh exhibited a bactericidal effect against gram positive and gram negative 3 3 4 removal of e faecalis and e coli from wastewater by gqds gem fa dlh several water samples were collected from el siouf intake and mahmodia canal alexandria egypt as sources of wastewater based on the viable cell count the detected optimum conditions for e faecalis 0 1 mg ml 1 and e coli 0 6 mg ml 1 at 10 min the removal study in this section was applied via two conditions i 500 ml of sample was combined with 50 mg of gqds gem fa dlh and ii 500 ml of sample was emerged with 300 mg under 10 min shaking and then the removal of total plate count was calculated under optimum conditions of e faecalis 50 mg 500 ml the removal was 93 e faecalis and 36 e coli while the total plate count was 80 another specified condition of e coli was applied as declined results to 68 for e faecalis and 30 for the total plate count while the result was slightly increased for e coli to 50 according to the outlined results the first condition was preferred for the purification of water from bacteria it should be noted that gqds gem fa dlh exhibited a superiority effects on gram negative and gram positive bacteria in wastewater 4 conclusion a novel gqds gem fa dlh was prepared as a unique specific multitask nanocomposite for various pollutants removal from water including organic inorganic and gram positive and gram negative bacteria e faecalis and e coli the nanocomposite was fabricated from gqds using sustainable low cost precursor of mango peels and coupled with feal double layered hydroxide and gemifloxacin antibiotic the measured bet surface area of gqds gem fa dlh was 20 05 m2 g 1 while 0 029 cm3 g 1 and 5 77 nm were identified for total pore volume and mean pore diameter respectively the maximum removal of 4na and pb ii were established as 90 7 ph 2 0 and 98 8 ph 6 0 respectively the adsorption isotherm and kinetics of 4na and pb ii were suitably described by langmuir and pseudo second order models the thermodynamic parameter confirmed that the adsorption processes of 4na and pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh were endothermic regeneration and reusability of gqds gem fa dlh were found highly acceptable after five adsorption desorption cycles furthermore bacterial removal from wastewater by the action of gqds gem fa dlh was also evaluated against e faecalis and e coli and the results referred to 93 and 36 respectively while the total plate count was 80 the outlined results in this study give good evidences for the innovative and effectivness of this modified gqds for enhancing pollutants removal prospects of organic 4na inorganic pb ii as well as gram positive and gram negative bacteria from wastewater therefore the assembled and investigated gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite can be categorized as a low cost sustainable material and easy reusable for complete water purification and must be regarded as a general and talented material for purification of water resources containing multi pollutants finally this study is expected to open up new prospects for manufacturing new nanocomposites based gqds to deal with different pollutants viruses and bacteria

paper 
13098,design and assembly of a novel sustainable unique nanocomposite with multi purpose activities with efficient adsorptive removal behavior toward different organic inorganic and biological pollutants is a challenging aspect therefore the current work is directed to prepare graphene quantum dots gqds from mango peels via a facile method gqds were coupled with feal double layered hydroxide fa dlh and intercalated via co precipitation with gemifloxacin antibiotic gem for the formation of a 3d structure with multiple functional nanocomposite gqds gem fa dlh this was utilized for various pollutants removal including lead pb ii 4 nitroaniline 4na enterococcus faecalis e faecalis and escherichia coli e coli gqds gem fa dlh was characterized from ft ir edx hr tem bet xrd and tga techniques the maximum removal of 4na and pb ii were established as 90 7 ph 2 0 and 98 8 ph 6 0 respectively the adsorption performance by gqds gem fa dlh was favored according to langmuir and pseudo second order furthermore the antibacterial removal activity against gram positive e faecalis and gram negative e coli by gqds gem fa dlh was assessed using two different methods minimum inhibitory concentration mic and minimum bactericidal concentration mbc and the removal percentages reached to 91 3 and 82 9 respectively moreover the removal of bacteria from wastewater based on the total plate count was established as 80 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords graphene quantum dots gemifloxacin fe al layered double hydroxide pb ii and 4 nitroaniline enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli bacterial activity 1 introduction the recent development in industrial activities and the high increase in worldwide population have led to excessive increase in wastewater generation with different pollutants as organics pharmaceuticals dyes aromatics and their nitro chlorinated and fluorinated derivatives etc inorganics as heavy metals pb hg cd cr and as etc and biologicals bactericides and fungicides etc 1 5 these pollutants are well known to impose high harmful and toxic effects on public health due to their crucial impact in increasing the damage to organisms and human health 1 2 however heavy metal ions have been widely utilized in many industries such as paint dyes pipes and lubricants 3 4 pb ii as an example of heavy metals is enormously toxic in water at low concentration levels and brings out a serious threat to the human body due to possible binding with red blood cells and final coagulation into bones 6 in addition pb ii ions are generally absorbed in the body through inhalation of about 20 80 while the ingestion amount is ranging between 5 and 15 7 therefore exposure to pb ii ions was found to cause serious problems such as anemia cancer liver diseases and kidneys damages 3 6 8 4 nitroaniline 4na is an example of nitro compounds utilized as a precursor for the production of a number of organic derivatives with potential applications as corrosion inhibitors azo dyes antiseptic agents pharmaceuticals and antioxidants 9 12 however 4na is typically classified as a hazardous material that has the ability to cause nephrotoxicity and hematotoxicity 13 14 therefore 4na has been categorized as one of the substances on the black list in china with the limitation in water is less than 1 0 mg l 1 15 another highly risky class of pollutants in contaminated water is related to some bacteria with the capability of causing side effects such as typhoid eye and stomach infections diarrhea and hepatitis b and c 16 it is well known that bacteria can survive in the aqueous environment for lengthy periods of time due to their resistance ability for typical disinfection procedures 17 moreover bacteria are categorized in the forms of gram negative and positive which are typically listed as highly dangerous organisms e coli is a gram negative and known to cause cholecystitis bacteremia diarrhea cholangitis urinary infection and neonatal meningitis and pneumonia 18 19 e faecalis is a class of gram positive intestinal bacteria that can cause some infection including dysplasia and inflammatory bowel gastrointestinal disorders and crohn s disease 20 therefore it is vital and essential aspect with respect to design and develop new technological routes with high efficiency for declining or elimination of pb ii 4na and bacteria from water in order to prevent their toxic impact and adversative effects 3 13 20 many treatment methods such as oxidation 21 23 chemical precipitation 24 reverse osmosis 25 biodegradation 26 and adsorption 27 were widely applied for elimination of a number of organic and inorganic pollutants from wastewater however adsorption 28 29 ozonization 30 chlorination 31 and uv irradiation 32 were proved to be beneficial for removing bacteria from wastewater unfortunately some technologies are inefficient costly and usually produce some side products as additional secondary pollutant 1 2 for example 4na as an aromatic compound was found resistant to degradation via chemical and oxidation processes 6 8 in addition the anaerobic degradation of 4na was characterized to produce two biproducts viz nitroso and hydroxylamines which are listed as carcinogenic compounds 33 34 consequently water treatment of such pollutants represents a great challenge subject to researchers for finding out effective materials low cost techniques and facile applications adsorption technique has been recently reported and recognized to afford a good varieties of cost effective and simply synthesized sorbents with developed affinity to remove pb ii and 4na from wastewater based on using activated carbon 35 metal oxides 36 and polymers 37 the use of adsorption techniques for removal of pb ii 4na and bacteria were also reported by some researches for example fabricated calcium alginate with carbon nanotube ca mwcnts showed a high pb ii adsorption level at 88 0 under ph 5 5 38 zeolitic adsorbents were synthesized from bagasse fly ash and applied to remove 4na and nitrobenzene 39 cataldo et al reported that nanosponges of cyclodextrin calixarene was used as adsorbent material for removal of pb ii from water 40 on the other hand high percent removal of some bacteria was explored by a number of adsorbents as magnetic chitosan 41 functionalized polyethersulfone 42 and ceramic ag impregnated pot filter with zeolite and activated carbon 43 all these cases seemingly account for better performance of adsorption technique for removal of different pollutants graphene quantum dots gqds and carbon quantum dots cqds are examples of new carbonaceous nanomaterials with oxygenated multifunctional groups and characterized by several important incorporated characteristics as direct preparation and production from low cost sustainable materials good chemical reactivity simple functionalization low toxicity biocompatibility tiny particle size and high surface area 44 52 the gqds were utilized for removal of inorganic and organic wastes due to the presence of oxygenated functional groups with good capability of chelating metal ions from aqueous solutions 53 54 in addition modified and functionalized gqds adsorbents have recently shown vital growing interests in different fields including removal of pollutants from wastewater 55 58 for example modification of carbon

double hydroxide materials dlh are defined types of anionic 2d materials with excellent affinity for binding and removal of heavy metal ions and other cationic species 60 64 dlh materials possess structure features which permit their developments as excellent adsorbents to catch cationic pollutants from water 54 such chemical adaptability is mainly owing to the direct interaction of dlh via negatively charged hydroxyl functional groups with various cationic materials to build up architectures with the formation of 3d composites 53 as a result of the excellent chemical adsorption features in both gqds and dlh it is aimed in this study to explore an innovative nanocomposite by direct combination of gqds with dlh in order to increase the tailored functional groups to accomplish this

adjusted from ph 2 to10 phinitial and shaken for 4 h then the values of phfinal were measured after 24 h the difference between phfinal and phinitial was plotted against phinitial to determine the phpzc in the dosage factor 10 ml of 4na 20 0 mg l 1 and pb ii 10 0 mg l 1 pollutants were mixed with different gqds gem fa dlh masses 1 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 mg and shaken for 30 min in the adsorption isotherm experiments 10 0 ml of 4na or pb ii with concentration from 1 0 to 100 0 mg l 1 were employed at adsorption time 30 min in the kinetic tests 10 0 mg of gqds gem fa dlh was added to 10 0 ml of 4na 20 0 mg l 1 or pb ii 10 0 mg l 1 and shaken for 1 30 min the parameters of isotherm and kinetic studies were determined by using the given equations in table 2 in the co existing ions

steps were repeated 5 times and the removal percentage values of pb ii and 4na were then calculated after each cycle 2 5 removal of bactericidal pollutants by the action of gqds gem fa dlh 2 5 1 preparation and preservation of microbiological reference material 2 5 1 1 microorganism and culture medium the microorganisms were used to determine the antimicrobial activity using the viable cell count method like enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 e faecalis gram positive bacteria and escherichia coli atcc 8739 e coli gram negative bacteria the selective medium was membrane enterococcus agar and chromocult coliform agar for e faecalis and e coli respectively 66 tryptic soy broth medium tsb was used for mic determination while plate count agar medium pca was used to determine mbc for the two organisms under investigation 67 each culture medium was sterilized according to manufacturer procedures 2 5 1 2 membrane filter technique cellulose membrane filter 47 mm diameter and 0 45 μm pore

at 35 37 c for 24 h for the non selective plate count agar medium the suitable count plates were 30 300 cfu ml while for the selective medium 100 cfu ml and 80 cfu ml were used for e faecalis and e

2 5 2 1 viable cell count 2 5 2 1 1 time removal of e faecalis and e coli by the action of gqds gem fa dlh at ph 7 0 a 1 0 ml of two bacterial strains with optimum dilution was added to 9 0 ml sterilized buffer then 10 0 mg of gqds gem fa dlh was placed into this tube with constant shaking at 25 1 c using various times 1 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 min after filtration the residual solution was washed with 50 ml sterilized ddw finally the removal percentage values of e faecalis and e coli were computed from eq 1 as given in table 2 2 5 2 1 2 mass effect of gqds gem fa dlh on removal of e faecalis and e coli as described in the above experiment gqds gem fa dlh was added by using different masses 1 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 mg at 10 min and the removal percentage values of e faecalis and e coli were computed from eq 1 as given in table 2 2 5 2 2 mic and mbc determination the mic of gqds gem fa dlh was investigated by broth dilution technique 67 in this 1 0 ml of test organisms was added to tubes containing 9 ml tsb medium with different amounts of gqds gem fa dlh ranging from 10 to 1000 μg ml 1 all the tubes were incubated at 35 c for 24 h and then investigated for the presence of turbidity that indicates bacterial growth mic is the lowest concentration of gqds gem fa dlh to inhibit bacterial growth which is detected by the absence of turbidity in addition the positive control and negative control sterility were examined the positive control was the tube without the bacterial culture while the negative control was the tube without the bacterial agent the two tubes with the mic tube were subculture on pca plates and incubated at 35 c for 48 h mbc value was determined through the tube that prevents any visible bacterial growth 2 5 2 3 potential application of gqds gem fa dlh for removal of e faecalis and e coli from wastewater in this study wastewater was collected from el siouf intake mahmodia canal alexandria egypt this experiment was carried out in 500 ml of wastewater from viable cell count the optimum conditions were obtained for e faecalis 0 1 mg ml 1 and e coli 0 6 mg ml 1 at 10 min the application was accomplished by two

count were then calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization fig 1 represents the ft ir spectra of gqds fa dlh and gqds gem fa dlh the peaks appearing in fig 1a for gqds at 3495 2876 1717 1656 and 1165 1034 are due to hydroxyl group oh ch co cc and c o respectively 69 in fig 1b the peak at 3339 cm 1 was generated due to the oh in the hydroxide like layers or intercalated water molecules while the peak at 1636 cm 1 was formed by the bending of interlayer and adsorbed water molecules the peak at 702 cm 1 is due the stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups in fig 1c a broad peak at 3367 cm 1 is assigned to the oh stretching mode of hydroxyl group the strong absorption peaks at 1569 and 1356 cm 1 are ascribed to the asymmetric and symmetric coo group in gem and or gqds anions respectively the band of carboxylate group at 1717 cm 1 was shifted to a lower frequency 1569 cm 1 due to the interaction between gem gqds and fa dlh layers when compared with the pure gqds or gem in addition two bands at 1037 and 613 cm 1 could be related to the metal layers o mo of the host material the outlined results confirm that gem and gqds has been intercalated into the interlayer space of fa dlh as illustrated in scheme 1 thus the surface modification of fa dlh with hydrophilic functional groups carboxyl and amino is expected to enhance the adsorption efficiency for removal of hazardous pollutants from contaminated water as 4na and pb ii fig 2a shows the surface morphology of gqds gem fa dlh by using sem the nanocomposite was tended to coagulate and randomly disseminate with average particles size 20 5 nm the structural morphology of gqds and gqds gem fa dlh was further confirmed by hr tem fig 2b and c in fig 2b the hr tem of gqds exhibited a typically spherical shaped structure the average size of gqds was found 6 5 nm to confirm its quantum dots size the edx image of gqds gem fa dlh is illustrated in fig 3a to refer to the presence of elemental composition including c n o fe and al of the assembled gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite the c n and o peaks were evidently dispersed in fa dlh nanosheets the atom were characterized to correspond to 51 34 c 2 21 n 40 34 o 5 69 fe and 0 42 al in the assembled gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite the tga and dta results of assembled gqds gem fa dlh are presented in fig 3b the tga diagram of assembled gqds gem fa dlh showed a weight loss with temperature elevation due to the loss of water adsorbed molecules and interlayer adsorbed water from the surface in dta the endothermic peak around 100 c indicates that water on the surface was evaporated this peak refer to a mass loss 13 6 from gqds gem fa dlh at 35 1 141 0 c the strong exothermic peak between 213 7 and 407 6 c is due to loss of interlayer water and dehydroxylation of gqds gem fa dlh in this range the weight loss of gqds gem fa dlh was found 2 7 in addition an exothermic characteristic peak of fe2o3 was observed at 545 2 c while the observed exothermic peak at 635 2 c is ascribed to phase change from fe3o4 to α fe3o4 in the assembled gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite 70 71 above 380 1 c and up to 698 4 c the weight loss was reached to 11 4 the powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns of gqds fa dlh and gqds gem fa dlh are shown in fig 4 the xrd pattern of gqds exhibited a characteristic peak of pristine graphite at 2θ 24 60o as shown in fig 4a the xrd peaks fig 4b of fa dlh exhibited several peaks at 2θ 15 12 26 91 32 92 35 05 38 89 due to 101 003 203 221 planes with 15 58 crytallinity degree to confirms the formation of alooh and feooh in the composite according to jcpds card no 21 1307 and 34 1266 respectively 72 the diffraction angles of gqds gem fa dlh at 2θ 14 89 24 10 29 78 34 62 43 58 61 98 63 80 74 59 are corresponding to 101 112 003 301 223 005 334 621 to approve the tetragonal phase the degree of crystallinity of gqds gem fa dlh is 10 40 and this means that the overall crystallinity was decreased after binding of gem and gqds with fa dlh after intercalation of gem and gqds in fa dlh the typical plane d003 3 32 nm of fa dlh was shifted to a higher angle at 2θ 29 78 d003 3 69 nm with significant increase of 0 37 nm in the d spacing the enlargement of interlayer distance in gqds gem fa dlh is mainly attributed to a direct binding of fa dlh with gqds and gem the surface area and porosity of gqds gem fa dlh were investigated by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms the measured bet surface area of assembled gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite was 20 05 m2 g 1 the total pore volume and mean pore diameter were 0 029 cm3 g 1 and 5 77 nm respectively according to iupac classification 73 gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite was found to refer to a type iv physisorption isotherm and h3 hysteresis shape fig 5 this structure is dependent on the formation of assembled gqds gem fa dlh network by capillary condensation and complex characteristics incorporated into gqds gem and fa dlh 73 3 2 adsorptive removal studies of 4na and pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite 3 2 1 influence of ph on the adsorption of 4na and pb ii the adsorption process can be influenced by the presence of various ph conditions of the interaction solution by changing ph the binding sites are expected to be controlled and also affected by the loaded charges on the sorbent surface consequently this influences the interaction or binding process between sorbent and sorbate 74 76 fig 6a presents the effect of ph values 1 0 7 0 on the removal efficiency of pb ii and 4na pollutants onto gqds gem fa dlh the maximum removal value were established as 90 7 and 99 1 at ph 2 and 7 for 4na and pb ii respectively three forms of 4na exist at different phs i positively charged form at ph 1 0 ii neutral molecules and few of positively charged ions at ph 1 0 3 0 iii neutral molecules at ph 3 0 77 the phpzc of gqds gem fa dlh in this experiment was detected as 8 91 fig 6b to predict that the gqds gem fa dlh surface would be positively or protonated below this point so the adsorption process may involve other forces such as van der waals hydrogen bond electron donor acceptor and π π interaction 78 at low phs the nitro group was protonated no2h and therefore 4na interacted with gqds gem fa dlh through intermolecular h bonding 79 in addition the adsorption process was also enhanced in an acidic medium to favor direct interact between amino group on 4na and hydroxyl group onto gqds gem fa dlh surface by the creation of acid base complex 80 moreover the net charge on gqds gem fa dlh surface was positive while the 4na was negative induced by the mesomeric effect caused by the interaction of the lone pair of electron in amine group aromatic ring so the interaction of gqds gem fa dlh might lead to an electrostatic force with negatively resonated aromatic ring 39 in the case of pb ii removal by gqds gem fa dlh several active functional groups as nh2 cooh and oh are expected to be responsible for regulation of the pb ii adsorption process the pb ii removal were increased with raising ph and referred to the supreme at ph 7 0 99 1 at low phs the functional groups onto gqds gem fa dlh were protonated to form positively charged groups to create repulsive forces with pb ii ions however the working functional groups onto gqds gem fa dlh surface were found to strongly interact and bind with pb ii ions through complex formation and ion exchange mechanisms at ph 5 7 to generate higher removal percentages moreover pb ii ion has low charge density and therefore it behaves as a soft acid to favor strong reactions with soft bases 1 8 naphthyridine in gem and form covalent bonds on the surface of gqds gem fa dlh 81 3 2 2 the mass effect of gqds gem fa dlh on removal of 4na and pb ii the dosage impact of gqds gem fa dlh on the uptake of 4na and pb ii fig 6c and the removal values of these two pollutants were dramatically increased from 67 5 to 90 7 and 74 8 to 98 8 respectively upon the mass increase of gqds gem fa dlh from 1 0 to 10 0 mg besides the removal values of 4na were 67 5 68 8 78 6 79 8 83 2 87 3 and 90 7 using 1 2 4 5 6 8 and 10 mg of gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite respectively similarly pb ii was reached to 74 8 84 5 86 7 90 0 91 2 96 9 and 98 8 removal by using 1 2 4 5 6 8 and 10 mg of gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite respectively accordingly the outlined results are mainly referring to a great numbers of active sites on the surface of investigated gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite upon increasing the dosage that possesses 74 3 2 3 concentration effect of 4na and pb ii and adsorption isotherms the change in uptakes of 4na and pb ii are generally changed according to the alteration in concentration of pollutants fig 6d reveals the impact of initial concentrations of 4na and pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh the uptakes of 4na and pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh were rapidly enhanced with the increased concentrations of 4na and pb ii to attain the equilibrium at this point almost all active sites on the gqds gem fa dlh surface were occupied by 4na or pb ii and then the uptakes became optimal the maximum established qe values of gqds gem fa dlh for 4na and pb ii were 51 2 and 80 1 mg l 1 respectively in this respect the langmuir d r temkin and freundlich nonlinear models were modeled to evaluate the adsorption mechanisms of 4na or pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh the langmuir model was established to describe a homogeneous mechanism and monolayer process in dynamic equilibrium the freundlich model was designed to describe the formation of nonuniform multilayer figuration during the adsorption process the d r model was also set as a heterogeneous mechanism onto the surface of the adsorbent 81 the temkin model was mainly dependent on the temperature by neglecting the amount of sorbent and sorbate during the sorption process 82 fig 7a and b are the nonlinear isotherm models for removal of 4na and pb ii by gqds gem fa dlh respectively the computed parameters and constants are listed in table 3 and according to the high r2 the data of langmuir was figured out to fit best rather than the other three models the theoretical qmax of 4na and pb ii were 56 6 and 85 1 mg g 1 respectively which are extremely close to the maximum capacity of experimental qe these data confirm that the removal of 4na and pb ii by gqds gem fa dlh were recognized to proceed via monolayer sorption processes in the d r model the values of qmax were 47 2 and 70 9 mg g 1 for 4na and pb ii respectively in addition the calculated e values were 0 016 and 0 025 kj mol 1 for 4na and pb ii respectively to refer to physisorption process e 8 kj mol 1 the calculated 1 nf values from the freundlich model were 0 33 and 0 37 between 0 0 and 1 0 for removal of 4na and pb ii respectively to indicate favorable adsorption of 4 n and pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh 81 according to the temkin model the nonlinear r2 values were 0 9647 and 0 9312 for 4na and pb ii respectively furthermore the rl could be deliberated from the langmuir isotherm to describe and classify the sorption process the reaction is i irreversible at rl 0 ii linear at rl 1 iii favorable at 0 rl 1 and iv unfavorable at rl 1 the range of rl values were 0 034 0 263 and 0 019 0 164 for 4na and pb ii respectively according to the computed rl values between 0 and 1 for 4na and pb ii pollutants the sorption processes of the two pollutants onto gqds gem fa dlh were favorable 3 2 4 time effect on removal of 4na and pb ii and kinetics study fig 7c illustrates the change in removal values of 4na and pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh versus time in the time range from 1 to 10 min removal of pb ii was increased rapidly from 87 9 to 97 9 to confirm that sufficient active sites on the surface of gqds gem fa dlh were available to interact and bind with 4na and pb ii after 10 min the removal of both pollutants declined due to the decrease in number of active sites after a long time periods on the other side the adsorption of 4na was gradually increased with time to reach to the equilibrium at 15 min adsorption kinetics is affected by different variables like the rate of diffusion and chemical adsorption reaction the kinetic models were then studied by elovich pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion 74 the pseudo first order is employed to depict the adsorption rate controlled by the surface of the adsorbent materials the pseudo second order is utilized to find out the mechanism of adsorption which governs the rate of adsorption for the interaction between sorbent and active sites of adsorbent 81 table 4 shows the fitting parameters for adsorption of 4na and pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh the r2 of pseudo second order 4na 0 999 and pb ii 0 999 for both pollutants are greater than the other three models the qcal values 4na 18 2 mg g 1 and pb ii 9 9 mg g 1 are close to the experimental ones this confirms that the results are excellent to describe the fitting with the pseudo second order so the rate determining step rds can be interpreted as chemisorption reaction that may be interpreted on the basis of electron sharing ion exchange and or complexation mechanism between 4na and pb ii with the active sites on the gqds gem fa dlh surface 3 2 5 influence of co existing species on 4na and pb ii adsorption onto gqds gem fa dlh in this part the experiments were investigated to follow up the impact of co existing salts at initial 4na and pb ii concentrations on the adsorption process onto gqds gem fa dlh table 5 compiles the removal of 4na and pb ii with without salts addition naso4 kcl nh4cl cacl2 and mgso4 the removal of 4na was found to slightly increase while removal of pb ii was decreased in the presence of these salts as compared to their percentages without salts for 4na the salts were dissociated and hydrated with water and thus caused a decline order in water solvation of 4na so the presence of salts improved the 4na hydrophobic which was beneficial for adsorption onto gqds gem fa dlh 82 83 in the case of pb ii the reported results are mainly due to the small size of salt ions compared to lead ii ion that increased the competition for adsorption on gqds gem fa dlh 3 2 6 temperature influence and thermodynamic parameters in this factor the removal of 4na and pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh were slightly increased with elevating the temperature from 298 to 348 k in addition the removal increased from 90 6 to 93 9 and 98 9 to 99 3 for 4na and pb ii respectively in table 6 the spontaneity of 4na and pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh were examined by computation of δgo which appeared with negative values 84 the values of δgo were negatively changed from 5 64 to 7 92 kj mol 1 for 4na and from 10 93 to 14 33 kj mol 1 for pb ii when the temperatures changed from 298 to 348 k these results confirm the spontaneity of adsorption onto gqds gem fa dlh moreover the δho values were assigned with positive sign as 7 84 4na and 9 31 pb ii kj mol 1 indicating that the adsorption processes were endothermic the δso value for 4na was found 44 33 j k 1 mol 1 and for pb ii was identified 66 48 k 1 mol 1 to indicate that more randomness and adsorption affinity of gqds gem fa dlh toward 4na and pb ii pollutants 74 3 2 7 application of gqds gem fa dlh in 4na and pb ii removal from water samples three types of water were applied to investigate removal of pb ii and 4na from tap water sea water and wastewater samples this experiment was accomplished by mixing 100 mg of gqds gem fa dlh into 500 ml of water that was spiked with 4na 10 0 mg l 1 in ph 2 0 or pb ii 1 0 mg l 1 in ph 6 0 and the mixtures were automatically shaken for 30 min for wastewater the removal percentages were 99 1 and 99 9 using 4na and pb ii respectively the removal percentages were 93 7 and 94 6 for 4na and pb ii from sea water while 98 8 and 100 for 4na and pb ii from tap water respectively thus the assembled gqds gem fa dlh proved excellent ability as a new nanocomposite for the elimination of 4na and pb ii as examples of organic and inorganic pollutants respectively from water 3 2 8 reusability of gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite reusability is known as another major and important parameter for the best visualization of the sorption process and judging the performance of gqds gem fa dlh as an efficient regenerable nanocomposite in water treatment hydrochloric acid was exploited as an excellent reagent to desorb and elute 4na and pb ii pollutants from the surface of gqds gem fa dlh without distorting the gqds gem fa dlh structure fig 7d shows five successive cycles for regeneration of gqds gem fa dlh from 4na and pb ii pollutants the percentage values r 90 7 90 5 82 79 9 and 75 2 were identified for 4na while pb ii were 98 8 98 6 96 2 94 3 and 90 1 by using 1st 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th cycles respectively it is evident that insignificant change in the removal percentages of both 4na and pb ii in the first two cycles however at the 5th cycle the r was declined by 15 5 and 8 7 to reach 75 2 and 90 1 by 4na and pb ii respectively thus gqds gem fa dlh can be recycled numerous times without significantly influence its adsorption proficiencies 3 3 removal killing study of e faecalis and e coli by the action of gqds gem fa dlh 3 3 1 time removal e faecalis and e coli the antibacterial activity is focused on the relation between time and concentrations and their contribution on the removal killing of bacteria therefore time killing and concentration must be investigated and optimized to evaluate the study of antibacterial activity 85 the removal percentages of e faecalis and e coli fig 8a were gradually increased to reach to the maximum at 10 min the removal percentages of e faecalis and e coli were characterized as 60 9 and 59 4 respectively such results suggest that gqds gem fa dlh is behaving as an active material against both e faecalis and e coli at a short time after 10 min the rate of bacterial removal was declined due to the developed resistance mechanism by the bacterial population 86 in addition the bacteria showed certain ability to develop inherited resistance toward gqds gem fa dlh antibacterial that is related to physiological reasons therefore the removal properties of the two organisms are taken into consideration in the following application section 3 3 2 mass of gqds gem fa dlh for bacteria removal killing fig 8b shows the dosage impact of gqds gem fa dlh on the removal percentages of e faecalis and e coli the maximum e faecalis removal was obtained by using 1 0 mg per 10 ml while e coli reached the maximum removal upon using 6 mg per 10 ml as the removal were identified by 91 3 and 82 9 for e faecalis and e coli respectively this trend is related to the gram positive e faecalis which produces a higher negative charge on the cell surface than gram negative e coli 87 88 so positively charged surface of gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite is expected to attract the negatively charged bacterial cell surface via electrostatic attraction as a consequence the balance of charge on the surface causes the cell to seriously distort and bacteria to kill after the optimum values the removal of bacteria were gradually decreased these results promote that the high dosage of gqds gem fa dlh would not remove e faecalis and e coli better than the lower dosage but the optimum dosage is the most significant one furthermore at high concentrations of gqds gem fa dlh bacteria may start to regrowth 89 3 3 3 mic and mbc determination the mic and mbc of gqds gem fa dlh antibacterial against e faecalis and e coli were also examined it is evident in table 7 that the behaviors of e faecalis and e coli are different both tests were investigated at 10 30 50 100 200 400 500 600 800 and 1000 μg ml 1 the bacterial growth was detected by turbidity while transparency was used to indicate no growth according to fig 9 e coli has become more visible than e faecalis that indicates no bacteria growth the mic of e coli was related to 400 μg ml while mbc was 600 μg ml 1 the inhibition effect of gqds gem fa dlh might be referred to possible diffusion into e coli membrane and interacting with intracellular organelles to destroy proteins and or dna of the cell membrane 89 on the other hand the mic of e faecalis was found greater than 1000 μg ml 1 and mbc could not be detected in the viable count method removal of e faecalis occured at a concentration lower than mic subinhibitory concentrations the population cells were more susceptible to the antibacterial agent than the mic as described for total population 89 in this case the mic may alter as a role of inoculum size in addition e faecalis can be characterized as intrinsic resistance 90 finally these results confirm that gqds gem fa dlh exhibited a bactericidal effect against gram positive and gram negative 3 3 4 removal of e faecalis and e coli from wastewater by gqds gem fa dlh several water samples were collected from el siouf intake and mahmodia canal alexandria egypt as sources of wastewater based on the viable cell count the detected optimum conditions for e faecalis 0 1 mg ml 1 and e coli 0 6 mg ml 1 at 10 min the removal study in this section was applied via two conditions i 500 ml of sample was combined with 50 mg of gqds gem fa dlh and ii 500 ml of sample was emerged with 300 mg under 10 min shaking and then the removal of total plate count was calculated under optimum conditions of e faecalis 50 mg 500 ml the removal was 93 e faecalis and 36 e coli while the total plate count was 80 another specified condition of e coli was applied as declined results to 68 for e faecalis and 30 for the total plate count while the result was slightly increased for e coli to 50 according to the outlined results the first condition was preferred for the purification of water from bacteria it should be noted that gqds gem fa dlh exhibited a superiority effects on gram negative and gram positive bacteria in wastewater 4 conclusion a novel gqds gem fa dlh was prepared as a unique specific multitask nanocomposite for various pollutants removal from water including organic inorganic and gram positive and gram negative bacteria e faecalis and e coli the nanocomposite was fabricated from gqds using sustainable low cost precursor of mango peels and coupled with feal double layered hydroxide and gemifloxacin antibiotic the measured bet surface area of gqds gem fa dlh was 20 05 m2 g 1 while 0 029 cm3 g 1 and 5 77 nm were identified for total pore volume and mean pore diameter respectively the maximum removal of 4na and pb ii were established as 90 7 ph 2 0 and 98 8 ph 6 0 respectively the adsorption isotherm and kinetics of 4na and pb ii were suitably described by langmuir and pseudo second order models the thermodynamic parameter confirmed that the adsorption processes of 4na and pb ii onto gqds gem fa dlh were endothermic regeneration and reusability of gqds gem fa dlh were found highly acceptable after five adsorption desorption cycles furthermore bacterial removal from wastewater by the action of gqds gem fa dlh was also evaluated against e faecalis and e coli and the results referred to 93 and 36 respectively while the total plate count was 80 the outlined results in this study give good evidences for the innovative and effectivness of this modified gqds for enhancing pollutants removal prospects of organic 4na inorganic pb ii as well as gram positive and gram negative bacteria from wastewater therefore the assembled and investigated gqds gem fa dlh nanocomposite can be categorized as a low cost sustainable material and easy reusable for complete water purification and must be regarded as a general and talented material for purification of water resources containing multi pollutants finally this study is expected to open up new prospects for manufacturing new nanocomposites based gqds to deal with different pollutants viruses and bacteria

13099,this research explores the feasibility of using an algal photo bioreactor as an integrated algal bacterial treatment system combined with a dissolved air flotation daf system for the deduction of cod bod5 tss tn and tp from primary treated wastewater ptw isolated algae species of anomoeoneis scenedesmus anabaena and spirulina at fixed hydraulic retention time hrt of 16 h were used to

c light intensity of 90 μmol m 2s 1 and 100 rpm mixing rate a scaled up pilot plant treatment system was designed constructed and operated to evaluate the system performance to treat 0 1 l min of primary treated wastewater disposed of zenin wwtp giza egypt the design criteria of the algal photo bioreactor were acquired from the batch investigations the plant was operated for 10 continuous days and the analytical analysis was performed twice a day at a fixed time the daf system was used to isolate the infiltrated algae from the system for cultivation and reuse purposes the achieved results revealed the superior cod bod5 tss tn and tp removal percent reached in average 56 4 61 59 2 48 3 and 51 7 at 12 pm and 49 7 54 9 52 4 39 and 40 57 at 12 am respectively all data gained from experimental studies demonstrated the efficiency of using algal photo bioreactor combined with daf system as an effective wastewater treatment technique graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biological treatment photo bioreactor daf nutrient removal low cost treatment 1 introduction growing population and increased demands for food shelter and cloth resulted in rapid industrialization freshwater reservoirs are facing a shortage owing to the intensive utilization by agriculture industries homes transportation etc 1 2 similarly the disposal of the untreated wastewater back into freshwater bodies further escalates the sensitivity of the water related issues hence wastewater and poor sanitation are considered serious problems that can have an adverse impact on human health these wastewaters mostly contain heavy metals herbicides toxic organic compounds pharmaceuticals as well as a dangerous mixture of pathogenic microorganisms 3 4 moreover the excessive range of ammonia which inflows mostly from agricultural industrial and domestic wastes into water bodies also cause many environmental problems such as aquatic hypoxia and eutrophication 5 6 the absence of an effective treatment process exposes individuals to potential health risks therefore treatment of these wastewaters is essential before their disposal into water reservoirs to meet the discharge regulations as well so far numerous approaches have been used for wastewater treatment such as coagulation 7 8 adsorption 9 10 electrocoagulation 11 photocatalysis 12 13 etc similarity the biological wastewater treatment bwt is one of the most frequent and essential treatment techniques for municipal and industrial wastewaters 14 15 it can remove different contaminants and oxidize a variety of organic molecules turning them into stable chemicals and biomass that can be isolated from water 16 17 broadly speaking bwt technologies can be classified into three types based on the demand for o2 for the breakdown of organic matter viz aerobic anaerobic and anoxic techniques 18 there are countless variations for the bwt based on aerobic anaerobic anoxic or a combination of aerobic and anaerobic technologies 19 amongst them microalgae based wastewater treatment systems have gained attention these days due to many advantages such as low cost low energy consumption green environmental impact and sustainability 20 the photosynthetic mechanism allows the microalgae to grow quickly and reproduce at a high rate on the other side microalgae are capable of accumulating toxic compounds and heavy metals into their biomass 21 nitrification and denitrification are the main pathways for nutrient removal in microalgae based systems 22 23 scenedesmus spirulina and anomoeoneis algal species have been observed to exhibit rapid growth rates and great resistance to inhospitable environments therefore current research trends focus on the use of these species for wwt in microalgae based systems 24 25 various reports have been published already for the use of microalgae based wwt methods a brief and latest review is presented below for a better understanding of the current trends in the field many reports on algal gel envelops 26 nitrification supported by photo oxygenation 27 the effects of ph control 28 algal biofilms 28 algal bacterial processes 29 the impact of illumination 29 micro algal membrane bioreactors 30 cost analysis and scale up studies 31 modulation of aeration and blue light 32 flat plate algal bioreactor design 33 etc are published so far a detailed study of the literature shows that there are several growth conditions that affect the algae growth rate such as the ph temperature mixing speed light intensity etc which must be considered while designing any algal based treatment plant 34 most microorganisms can live in a ph range of 6 to 8 however a high ph of 9 to 11 can undesirably impact the removal rates 35 even though the high ph values help for the sterilization of pathogens it likewise diminishes the effectiveness of different toxins for example nutrients besides the concentrated algal growth an increase in the ph leads to phosphate precipitation and ammonia stripping 36 the temperature is another important factor since microalgae grow best in temperatures ranging from 15 to 30 c higher and lower temperatures may cause frustrating microbial development and low metabolic energy respectively 37 appropriate mixing can influence microalgal development in numerous imperative ways it gives the microalgal cells continuous contact with the light subsequently expanding the accessible light usage productivity furthermore it can enhance the contact between the algal cells and contaminants and limit nutritional gradients in the cultivation medium and can additionally help the co2 exchange and o2 discharge into the atmosphere 38 because photosynthesis is fuelled by light light is also a crucial aspect that impacts algal development the rate of algal biomass generation with 24 h light 9 38 0 1 g m2 d was 1 87 g m2 d higher than that of 12 12 l d light because of the characteristic determination and long haul adjustment a standout amongst the most vital parameter for photo bioreactor is the proportion of surface lit up to the volume of the reactor s v 39 one of the drawbacks of wwt with algae is harvesting the algae from the effluents 40 a comparative study of various flocculation methods is presented 41 the most well known collecting system is microalgal flocculation by gravity because of the large volumes treated and the low estimation of the biomass produced 42 it has been exhibited that this methodology is not generally effective for developing chlorella and scenedesmus species quickly in a little territory floatation is a common separation process used for micro organisms and algae separation or harvesting flotation has demonstrated significant potential due to the high throughput and efficiency of contemporary equipment presently available 43 the dissolved air floatation daf technique is by far the most frequently utilized flotation technology for industrial wastewater treatment it is recognized as a method of separating particles such as suspended organic solids dissolved oils algae volatile organic compounds and humic acid the idea of the algal bacterial consortium has demonstrated a guarantee as a designed engineered system in wwt several experiments have been conducted to test photo bioreactors with synthetic wastewater but applicable studies are yet to be conducted moreover a few investigations have been conducted on the viability of using such a hybrid algal photo bioreactor daf treatment system for primary wwt this study aims to investigate the effects of the operational conditions such as ph temperature mixing rate and light intensity on the removal of cod bod5 tss tn and tp from primary treated wastewater ptww moreover to examine the design concept of a pilot scale algal photo bioreactor combined with a daf system in treating real ptww disposed of a pre existing wwtp under continuous flow circumstances 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection and characterization of samples in this research the ptww samples were taken from zenin wwtp egypt this wwtp is a huge sewage station that produces about 330 000 m3 d however it can reach a maximum capacity of 429 000 m3 d of polluted effluents zenein wwtp is composed of three identical units each unit consists of an inlet chamber screens grit removal primary sedimentation tank roughing filter and final sedimentation tank in addition to the inlet chamber screens and grit removal as the first three common parts for the three units after the final sedimentation tank samples were taken daily the average pollutant concentrations in accordance with the egyptian regulatory criteria for drainage into sewage systems and municipal drains are reported in table 1 2 2 microalgae culture and batch studies in this study a consortium of anomoeoneis scenedesmus anabaena and spirulina algae species were isolated consistently with the methodology described by smith et al 28 the experiments were set up by adding 25 ml of each microalga previously pre cultured using a 1000 ml flask the effect of operational conditions ph temperature light intensity and mixing rate was investigated for cod bod5 tss tn and tp elimination from ptww by the isolated algae species the optimum operating parameters were explored at fixed hrt of 16 h ph 3 5 7 9 and 11 temperature 10 20 25 30 and 40 c light intensity 50 75 90 125 and 150 μmol m 2s 1 and mixing rate 50 100 150 and 200 rpm 2 3 calculations the removal efficiency for all investigated pollutants was considered by eq 1 1 r c i c f c i 100 where ci and cf are the concentrations initial and after treatment in mg l respectively 2 4 analytical analysis the concentrations of cod bod5 tss tn and tp were determined in the tested samples the ph was measured with a ph oxi 340 i wtw 340i 05 germany and the cod and tss were measured with a spectrophotometer hach dr 2000 all tests were performed three times and findings with standard deviations larger than 0 1 mg l were discarded the tn was determined using a total nitrogen analyzer hach ez7700 and tp was analyzed using the ascorbic acid method 44 2 5 pilot scale studies 2 5 1 design a pilot study for the treatment system algal photo bioreactor and daf was designed for continuous feed operation to monitor system performance regularly 10 days 24 h the treatment capacity of the pilot scale treatment plant was 96 l fig 1 represents an illustration of the designed dimensional pilot plant as well as some illustrative photos of the treatment units the batch experiments were used to develop the design criteria for the algal photo bioreactor 90 μmol m 2s 1 light intensity and 100 mixing rate and 16 h hrt tank volumes numbers and dimensions are determinate using eqs 2 and 3 and summarized in table 2 2 q v 60 t where q is the wastewater influent l min v is the tank volume m3 and t is the reaction time hr 3 a v d where a is the tank s area cm2 and d is the tank s depth cm 2 5 2 set up the pilot plant was designed to treat 0 1 l min of primary treated wastewater disposed of zenin wwtp egypt using a consortium of anomoeoneis scenedesmus anabaena and spirulina algae species of about 4 5 l each species the system was operated for 10 continuous days with two times analyses all treatment tanks were built of polycarbonate including a 250 l tank for ptww storage algal photo bioreactor 100l with an overhead stirrer 100 rpm and daf 60 l with an air pump as illustrated in fig 1 the algal photo bioreactor was supplied by gravity through the storage tank with primary treated effluent to achieve the 16 h hrt in the reactor control taps were utilized to adjust the influent flow rate to 0 1 l min then the discharge from the algal reactor runs to the daf system which isolates and pushes the algal bacterial biomass to the surface the separated biomass is manually recycled back to the algal reactor using a manual skimmer the system was placed in a shaded place to avoid exposure to direct sunlight light intensity and temperature were measured several times throughout the day to match the optimized results of the batch studies the light intensity was controlled at about 90 μmol m 2s 1 thru the day depending on indirect sunshine and compact fluorescent lamps fig 1 a photocell was connected to the lamps to automatically turn them on at night a quantum light meter was used to measure the light intensity however the temperature measurements were a little bit different than the recommended value 25 c from batch studies the temperature measurements were 23 c on average during the day and 17 c on average at night during the whole continuous feed studies fig 1 also depicts the algal bacterial interactions within the photo bioreactor unit during photosynthesis microalgae provide the oxygen o2 required by aerobic bacteria to biodegrade organic contaminants into carbon dioxide co2 and water the co2 is subsequently utilized as a nutrient by the microalgae to summarise microalgae can provide photosynthetic oxygenation for wastewater treatment by providing o2 to bacteria which use o2 as an electron acceptor to breakdown the organic matter furthermore ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob can act as nitrifiers and oxidize ammonium to nitrate the heterotrophic bacteria can then act as a denitrifier breaking nitrate no3 apart to acquire o2 the nitrate is next reduced to nitrous oxide n2o and then to nitrogen gas n2 2 5 3 analysis program samples were collected 2 times a day at 12 am 12 pm from the pilot plant s intake and outflow to provide a thorough picture of the system s performance during the day the obtained samples were kept at 4 c till analysis the testing parameters comprised cod bod5 tss tn tp and ph all analyses were carried out in accordance with the standard method 27 3 results and discussion this part was divided into two parts first part discussed the application in batch where it investigates the effect of experimental parameters such as ph temperature light intensity and mixing rate while the second part investigates the appraisal of the included pilot plant in continuous feed conditions 3 1 batch experimental work 3 1 1 effect of ph the influence of ph was analyzed for the optimal removal of cod bod5 tss tn and tp from ptww fig 2 shows the changed rates of deduction for all considered parameters at diverse ph values 3 5 7 9 and 11 the other conditions such as temperature light intensity and stirring rate were retained constant at 25 c 90 μmol m 2s 1 and 100 rpm separately the removal rates for all the contaminants were found to be low at ph 5 however all removal rates increased noticeably as the ph increased until the optimum ph of 7 is obtained achieving a significant deduction rates of cod bod5 tss tn and tp with values of 50 7 52 8 49 8 59 1 and 56 8 respectively after a further increase of ph ph 7 there was a substantial reduction in all the removal rates the findings are consistent with previous research 13 32 in which a similar ph trend spanning from 7 0 to 9 0 offered favourable circumstances for the increased cell quantity and rapid growth rate typically microalgae cultures produce a progressive rise of the ph conditions to the final growth stage according to the results in 33 ph 8 2 was reported effective for fast nitrate absorption and virtually all of the nitrate taken up was released as ammonia under this condition in the presence of co2 this could explain the abrupt rise in alkalinity at a later stage of algal growth 33 the final ph of the treated wastewater was 8 for all applied runs 3 1 2 effect of temperature the temperature impact was also investigated for the most effective removal of cod bod5 tss tn and tp by the algal photo bioreactor system at diverse ranges 10 20 25 30 and 40 c fig 3 shows the removal rates at various temperatures while all other contributing parameters are held constant ph 7 90 light intensity of 90 μmol m 2s 1 and 100 rpm mixing rate it was discovered that the removals of all the examined contaminants increased with increasing temperature reaching an optimum at 25 c the operative temperature achieving the highest removal rates was 25 c recording removals of 57 6 58 4 59 1 63 and 60 4 for cod bod5 tss tn and tp separately in another study 34 microalgae were cultured under five levels of temperatures from 25 c to 33 c the microalgae cells had the highest rate of multiplication according to the findings at a temperature of 27 31 c in another research 34 microalgae were grown at five different temperatures ranging from 25 c to 33 c the microalgae cells had the highest rate of multiplication at temperatures ranging from 27 to 31 c 3 1 3 effect of light intensity the relation between cod bod5 tss tn and tp removal rates and different light intensities 50 75 90 125 and 150 μmol m 2s 1 is shown in fig 4 at light intensities 90 μmol m 2s 1 no significant change was observed for all studied contaminants however at 90 μmol m 2s 1 light intensity the rate of elimination was noticeably increased for the cod bod5 tss tn and tp reaching 52 8 54 7 55 8 52 2 and 55 4 separately a minor reduction was observed for all removals at light intensity 90 μmol m 2s 1 kitaya et al 2005 34 evaluated the cultivation of microalgae under six levels of photosynthetic photon flux from 20 to 200 μ mol m 2 s 1 the findings revealed that microalgae cells have the utmost rate of multiplication at a light flux of 100 μ mol m 2 s 1 3 1 4 effect of mixing rate fig 5 demonstrates the correlation between cod bod5 tss tn and tp removals and varied stirring rates 50 100 150 and 200 rpm at constant ph 7 room temperature and 90 μmol m 2s 1 light intensity at a stirring rate 100 rpm all removal rates were found to be poor however a considerable improvement was noticed for the deduction of cod bod5 tss tn and tp reaching 54 1 55 3 52 1 50 and 54 1 respectively at 100 rpm stirring rate it could be owing to the improved interaction between the contaminants molecules and algae which upgrades the liquid solid mass transfer at 100 rpm stirring rate a minor decrease was observed for all studied contaminants removal rates after stirring more than 100 rpm this may be affected by the electrostatic forces interruption at high stirring rates 29 3 2 continuous feed experimental work scaling up research was conducted on a photo bioreactor combined with daf pilot scale treatment system for treating wastewater disposed of zenin wwtp egypt results from the previous part of the batch experiments were used to select the design criteria for the algal photo bioreactor where ph 7 light intensity of 90 μmol m 2s 1 100 mixing rate and 16 h hrt were found as optimal conditions in the batch experiments the temperature was slightly different from the recommended value 25 c from batch studies with an average temperature of 23 c during the day and 17 c at night during the continuous feed trials the experiment lasted for a total of 10 days in continuous operation the results are shown in fig 6 the influent concentrations were 310 mg l 685 mg l 288 mg l 21 mg l and 8 mg l while the average effluent concentrations were 146 4 mg l 275 5 mg l 160 8 mg l 9 9 mg l and 4 2 mg l respectively based on these findings it was determined that the higher cod bod5 tss tn and tp removal efficiency are in the range of 56 4 61 59 2 48 3 and 51 7 respectively at 12 pm as shown in fig 3 a where their removal efficiency are 49 7 54 9 52 4 39 and 40 57 respectively at 12 am as shown in fig 6 b first this process has shown efficient removal for all pollutants studied in this research which means that this process can be a promising solution for the water process another remark that can be noted the slight decrease for all contaminants removal rates between day 12 pm and night 12 am this decrease was attributed to the temperature difference between day and night 23 to 17 c this effect is already discussed in the batch experiment 3 3 comparison between various combined treatment processes it is necessary to compare our pilot scale technique to earlier studies to demonstrate its benefits table 3 covers a variety of interesting studies on hybrid technology s performance in wastewater treatment under different process and operating settings moreover the operating conditions investigated in this research were included and compared to the other stated treatment approaches first all listed combined treatment systems are batch systems which means they need to stop in each operation that makes them less operational on the industrial scale as it can cause waste of time and more cost however our continuous process stays for days in an efficient removal with continuous processing mood moreover our proposed pilot scale treatment system verified significant removal rates not far compared to other listed combined systems even it is continuously for 10 days this can demonstrate the importance and the advantage of continuous feed processes in water treatment applications it s true that our previous treatment process has more efficient removal ability but it has additional quadrilateral treatment coagulation flocculation adsorption and filtration where algal photo bioreactor does not require any additional tertiary treatment the tertiary treatment process could be only required if the treated effluent is released to municipal drains and the probability of this happening in egypt does not exceed 5 of the total sewage plants 4 conclusion within the framework of this study an algal photo bioreactor combined with a dissolved air flotation system daf was used for the removal of cod bod5 tss tn and tp from primary treated wastewater the optimum operating conditions for the algal photo bioreactor were determined through batch experiments which are ph 7 temperature 25 c light intensity 90 μmol m 2s 1 and mixing rate 100 rpm those optimal conditions were used in a scaled up pilot plant treatment system to treat primary treated wastewater from zenin wwtp egypt the operation has shown significant results where cod bod5 tss tn and tp have been removal with efficiencies of 56 4 61 59 2 48 3 and 51 7 respectively these findings have been compared with previous studies these findings proved the efficacy of algal bacterial integrated treatment systems combined with daf as a wastewater treatment technology that does not require any additional tertiary treatment to release the effluent to sewer systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

phosphate precipitation and ammonia stripping 36 the temperature is another important factor since microalgae grow best in temperatures ranging from 15 to 30 c higher and lower temperatures may cause frustrating microbial development and low metabolic energy respectively 37 appropriate mixing can influence microalgal development in numerous imperative ways it gives the microalgal cells continuous contact with the light subsequently expanding the accessible light usage productivity furthermore it can enhance the contact between the algal cells and contaminants and limit nutritional gradients in the cultivation medium and can additionally help the co2 exchange and o2 discharge into the atmosphere 38 because photosynthesis is fuelled by light light is also a crucial aspect that impacts algal development the rate of algal biomass generation with 24 h light 9 38 0 1 g m2 d was 1 87 g m2 d higher than that of 12 12 l d light because of the characteristic determination and long haul adjustment a standout amongst the most vital parameter for photo bioreactor is the proportion of surface lit up to the volume of the reactor s v 39 one of the drawbacks of wwt with algae is harvesting the algae from the effluents 40 a comparative study of various flocculation methods is presented 41 the most well known collecting system is microalgal flocculation by gravity because of the large volumes treated and the low estimation of the biomass produced 42 it has been exhibited that this methodology is not generally effective for developing chlorella and scenedesmus species quickly in a little territory floatation is a common separation process used for micro organisms and algae separation or harvesting flotation has demonstrated significant potential due to the high throughput and efficiency of contemporary equipment presently available 43 the dissolved air floatation daf technique is by far the most frequently utilized flotation technology for industrial wastewater treatment it is recognized as a method of separating particles such as suspended organic solids dissolved oils algae volatile organic compounds and humic acid the idea of the algal bacterial consortium has demonstrated a guarantee as a designed engineered system in wwt several experiments have been conducted to test photo bioreactors with synthetic wastewater but applicable studies are yet to be conducted moreover a few investigations have been conducted on the viability of using such a hybrid algal photo bioreactor daf treatment system for primary wwt this study aims to investigate the effects of the operational conditions such as ph temperature mixing rate and light intensity on the removal of cod bod5 tss tn and tp from primary treated wastewater ptww moreover to examine the design concept of a pilot scale algal photo bioreactor combined with a daf system in treating real ptww disposed of a pre existing wwtp under continuous flow circumstances 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection and characterization of samples in this research the ptww samples were taken from zenin wwtp egypt this wwtp is a huge sewage station that produces about 330 000 m3 d however it can reach a maximum capacity of 429 000 m3 d of polluted effluents zenein wwtp is composed of three identical units each unit consists of an inlet chamber screens grit removal primary sedimentation tank roughing filter and final sedimentation tank in addition to the inlet chamber screens and grit removal as the first three common parts for the three units after the final sedimentation tank samples were taken daily the average pollutant concentrations in accordance with the egyptian regulatory criteria for drainage into sewage systems and municipal drains are reported in table 1 2 2 microalgae culture and batch studies in this study a consortium of anomoeoneis scenedesmus anabaena and spirulina algae species were isolated consistently with the methodology described by smith et al 28 the experiments were set up by adding 25 ml of each microalga previously pre cultured using a 1000 ml flask the effect of operational conditions ph temperature light intensity and mixing rate was investigated for cod bod5 tss tn and tp elimination from ptww by the isolated algae species the optimum operating parameters were explored at fixed hrt of 16 h ph 3 5 7 9 and 11 temperature 10 20 25 30 and 40 c light intensity 50 75 90 125 and 150 μmol m 2s 1 and mixing rate 50 100 150 and 200 rpm 2 3 calculations the removal efficiency for all investigated pollutants was considered by eq 1 1 r c i c f c i 100 where ci and cf are the concentrations initial and after treatment in mg l respectively 2 4 analytical analysis the concentrations of cod bod5 tss tn and tp were determined in the tested samples the ph was measured with a ph oxi 340 i wtw 340i 05 germany and the cod and tss were measured with a spectrophotometer hach dr 2000 all tests were performed three times and findings with standard deviations larger than 0 1 mg l were discarded the tn was determined using a total nitrogen analyzer hach ez7700 and tp was analyzed using the ascorbic acid method 44 2 5 pilot scale studies 2 5 1 design a pilot study for the treatment system algal photo bioreactor and daf was designed for continuous feed operation to monitor system performance regularly 10 days 24 h the treatment capacity of the pilot scale treatment plant was 96 l fig 1 represents an illustration of the designed dimensional pilot plant as well as some illustrative photos of the treatment units the batch experiments were used to develop the design criteria for the algal photo bioreactor 90 μmol m 2s 1 light intensity and 100 mixing rate and 16 h hrt tank volumes numbers and dimensions are determinate using eqs 2 and 3 and summarized in table 2 2 q v 60 t where q is the wastewater influent l min v is the tank volume m3 and t is the reaction time hr 3 a v d where a is the tank s area cm2 and d is the tank s depth cm 2 5 2 set up the pilot plant was designed to treat 0 1 l min of primary treated wastewater disposed of zenin wwtp egypt using a consortium of anomoeoneis scenedesmus anabaena and spirulina algae species of about 4 5 l each species the system was operated for 10 continuous days with two times analyses all treatment tanks were built of polycarbonate including a 250 l tank for ptww storage algal photo bioreactor 100l with an overhead stirrer 100 rpm and daf 60 l with an air pump as illustrated in fig 1 the algal photo bioreactor was supplied by gravity through the storage tank with primary treated effluent to achieve the 16 h hrt in the reactor control taps were utilized to adjust the influent flow rate to 0 1 l min then the discharge from the algal reactor runs to the daf system which isolates and pushes the algal bacterial biomass to the surface the separated biomass is manually recycled back to the algal reactor using a manual skimmer the system was placed in a shaded place to avoid exposure to direct sunlight light intensity and temperature were measured several times throughout the day to match the optimized results of the batch studies the light intensity was controlled at about 90 μmol m 2s 1 thru the day depending on indirect sunshine and compact fluorescent lamps fig 1 a photocell was connected to the lamps to automatically turn them on at night a quantum light meter was used to measure the light intensity however the temperature measurements were a little bit different than the recommended value 25 c from batch studies the temperature measurements were 23 c on average during the day and 17 c on average at night during the whole continuous feed studies fig 1 also depicts the algal bacterial interactions within the photo bioreactor unit during photosynthesis microalgae provide the oxygen o2 required by aerobic bacteria to biodegrade organic contaminants into carbon dioxide co2 and water the co2 is subsequently utilized as a nutrient by the microalgae to summarise microalgae can provide photosynthetic oxygenation for wastewater treatment by providing o2 to bacteria which use o2 as an electron acceptor to breakdown the organic matter furthermore ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob can act as nitrifiers and oxidize ammonium to nitrate the heterotrophic bacteria can then act as a denitrifier breaking nitrate no3 apart to acquire o2 the nitrate is next reduced to nitrous oxide n2o and then to nitrogen gas n2 2 5 3 analysis program samples were collected 2 times a day at 12 am 12 pm from the pilot plant s intake and outflow to provide a thorough picture of the system s performance during the day the obtained samples were kept at 4 c till analysis the testing parameters comprised cod bod5 tss tn tp and ph all analyses were carried out in accordance with the standard method 27 3 results and discussion this part was divided into two parts first part discussed the application in batch where it investigates the effect of experimental parameters such as ph temperature light intensity and mixing rate while the second part investigates the appraisal of the included pilot plant in continuous feed conditions 3 1 batch experimental work 3 1 1 effect of ph the influence of ph was analyzed for the optimal removal of cod bod5 tss tn and tp from ptww fig 2 shows the changed rates of deduction for all considered parameters at diverse ph values 3 5 7 9 and 11 the other conditions such as temperature light intensity and stirring rate were retained constant at 25 c 90 μmol m 2s 1 and 100 rpm separately the removal rates for all the contaminants were found to be low at ph 5 however all removal rates increased noticeably as the ph increased until the optimum ph of 7 is obtained achieving a significant deduction rates of cod bod5 tss tn and tp with values of 50 7 52 8 49 8 59 1 and 56 8 respectively after a further increase of ph ph 7 there was a substantial reduction in all the removal rates the findings are consistent with previous research 13 32 in which a similar ph trend spanning from 7 0 to 9 0 offered favourable circumstances for the increased cell quantity and rapid growth rate typically microalgae cultures produce a progressive rise of the ph conditions to the final growth stage according to the results in 33 ph 8 2 was reported effective for fast nitrate absorption and virtually all of the nitrate taken up was released as ammonia under this condition in the presence of co2 this could explain the abrupt rise in alkalinity at a later stage of algal growth 33 the final ph of the treated wastewater was 8 for all applied runs 3 1 2 effect of temperature the temperature impact was also investigated for the most effective removal of cod bod5 tss tn and tp by the algal photo bioreactor system at diverse ranges 10 20 25 30 and 40 c fig 3 shows the removal rates at various temperatures while all other contributing parameters are held constant ph 7 90 light intensity of 90 μmol m 2s 1 and 100 rpm mixing rate it was discovered that the removals of all the examined contaminants increased with increasing temperature reaching an optimum at 25 c the operative temperature achieving the highest removal rates was 25 c recording removals of 57 6 58 4 59 1 63 and 60 4 for cod bod5 tss tn and tp separately in another study 34 microalgae were cultured under five levels of temperatures from 25 c to 33 c the microalgae cells had the highest rate of multiplication according to the findings at a temperature of 27 31 c in another research 34 microalgae were grown at five different temperatures ranging from 25 c to 33 c the microalgae cells had the highest rate of multiplication at temperatures ranging from 27 to 31 c 3 1 3 effect of light intensity the relation between cod bod5 tss tn and tp removal rates and different light intensities 50 75 90 125 and 150 μmol m 2s 1 is shown in fig 4 at light intensities 90 μmol m 2s 1 no significant change was observed for all studied contaminants however at 90 μmol m 2s 1 light intensity the rate of elimination was noticeably increased for the cod bod5 tss tn and tp reaching 52 8 54 7 55 8 52 2 and 55 4 separately a minor reduction was observed for all removals at light intensity 90 μmol m 2s 1 kitaya et al 2005 34 evaluated the cultivation of microalgae under six levels of photosynthetic photon flux from 20 to 200 μ mol m 2 s 1 the findings revealed that microalgae cells have the utmost rate of multiplication at a light flux of 100 μ mol m 2 s 1 3 1 4 effect of mixing rate fig 5 demonstrates the correlation between cod bod5 tss tn and tp removals and varied stirring rates 50 100 150 and 200 rpm at constant ph 7 room temperature and 90 μmol m 2s 1 light intensity at a stirring rate 100 rpm all removal rates were found to be poor however a considerable improvement was noticed for the deduction of cod bod5 tss tn and tp reaching 54 1 55 3 52 1 50 and 54 1 respectively at 100 rpm stirring rate it could be owing to the improved interaction between the contaminants molecules and algae which upgrades the liquid solid mass transfer at 100 rpm stirring rate a minor decrease was observed for all studied contaminants removal rates after stirring more than 100 rpm this may be affected by the electrostatic forces interruption at high stirring rates 29 3 2 continuous feed experimental work scaling up research was conducted on a photo bioreactor combined with daf pilot scale treatment system for treating wastewater disposed of zenin wwtp egypt results from the previous part of the batch experiments were used to select the design criteria for the algal photo bioreactor where ph 7 light intensity of 90 μmol m 2s 1 100 mixing rate and 16 h hrt were found as optimal conditions in the batch experiments the temperature was slightly different from the recommended value 25 c from batch studies with an average temperature of 23 c during the day and 17 c at night during the continuous feed trials the experiment lasted for a total of 10 days in continuous operation the results are shown in fig 6 the influent concentrations were 310 mg l 685 mg l 288 mg l 21 mg l and 8 mg l while the average effluent concentrations were 146 4 mg l 275 5 mg l 160 8 mg l 9 9 mg l and 4 2 mg l respectively based on these findings it was determined that the higher cod bod5 tss tn and tp removal efficiency are in the range of 56 4 61 59 2 48 3 and 51 7 respectively at 12 pm as shown in fig 3 a where their removal efficiency are 49 7 54 9 52 4 39 and 40 57 respectively at 12 am as shown in fig 6 b first this process has shown efficient removal for all pollutants studied in this research which means that this process can be a promising solution for the water process another remark that can be noted the slight decrease for all contaminants removal rates between day 12 pm and night 12 am this decrease was attributed to the temperature difference between day and night 23 to 17 c this effect is already discussed in the batch experiment 3 3 comparison between various combined treatment processes it is necessary to compare our pilot scale technique to earlier studies to demonstrate its benefits table 3 covers a variety of interesting studies on hybrid technology s performance in wastewater treatment under different process and operating settings moreover the operating conditions investigated in this research were included and compared to the other stated treatment approaches first all listed combined treatment systems are batch systems which means they need to stop in each operation that makes them less operational on the industrial scale as it can cause waste of time and more cost however our continuous process stays for days in an efficient removal with continuous processing mood moreover our proposed pilot scale treatment system verified significant removal rates not far compared to other listed combined systems even it is continuously for 10 days this can demonstrate the importance and the advantage of continuous feed processes in water treatment applications it s true that our previous treatment process has more efficient removal ability but it has additional quadrilateral treatment coagulation flocculation adsorption and filtration where algal photo bioreactor does not require any additional tertiary treatment the tertiary treatment process could be only required if the treated effluent is released to municipal drains and the probability of this happening in egypt does not exceed 5 of the total sewage plants 4 conclusion within the framework of this study an algal photo bioreactor combined with a dissolved air flotation system daf was used for the removal of cod bod5 tss tn and tp from primary treated wastewater the optimum operating conditions for the algal photo bioreactor were determined through batch experiments which are ph 7 temperature 25 c light intensity 90 μmol m 2s 1 and mixing rate 100 rpm those optimal conditions were used in a scaled up pilot plant treatment system to treat primary treated wastewater from zenin wwtp egypt the operation has shown significant results where cod bod5 tss tn and tp have been removal with efficiencies of 56 4 61 59 2 48 3 and 51 7 respectively these findings have been compared with previous studies these findings proved the efficacy of algal bacterial integrated treatment systems combined with daf as a wastewater treatment technology that does not require any additional tertiary treatment to release the effluent to sewer systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
