21070,the conventional practice of retrieving the whole length of deepwater drilling riser during imminent typhoon is tedious time consuming and has huge risk of untimely evacuation of personnel and facilities for safety a proposed operational solution is one which has the drilling riser disconnectable near surface while the longer section is left tensioned by buoyancy can bc in freestanding mode this prompts the need to investigate the survivability of drilling riser when disconnected in freestanding mode and reuse for continued drilling operation after typhoon in this paper a mathematical model is presented to analyze the mechanical behavior of drilling riser freestanding mode drfm finite difference method with derived end point formula to reduce imaginary nodes was used to obtain the solution bc upthrust ratio required to support the drfm weight and maintain its response while keeping stress and lower flex joint angle within allowable limits has been figured out to determine survivability threshold for drfm in extreme sea current condition bc effect shows potential region for drfm failure accuracy of the threshold condition was verified with numerical simulation in abaqus threshold conditions for various bc positions were established influence of current loadings and riser thicknesses on the threshold condition have also been investigated keywords survivability study drilling riser freestanding mode buoyancy can threshold abaqus 1 introduction the frequent hurricane or typhoon in gulf of mexico south china sea and other susceptible deepwater environments to such an emergency which disrupts drilling operations and endangers offshore facilities have given much attention to drilling risers to be designed for disconnection near the surface this is because the retrieving process of the whole length of the drilling riser is tedious and might not even finish in time as to avert possible dangers concern thus a freestanding drilling riser fsdr system has been proposed in which the drilling riser is disconnectable closer to the surface with a small part being removed from the top while the longer section part of the riser is left tensioned by the buoyancy can bc in freestanding mode after the harsh environmental condition is over reconnection of few hundreds of meters rather than over a thousand of meters of riser joints will be needed to continue normal drilling the concept and system have been put forward to provide a solution for the disadvantages of retrieving the whole length of drilling riser in the advance of a typhoon environment kogure et al 1998 the instructions of the operational procedure for a near surface disconnectable drilling riser bye et al 2000 lim et al 2008 and the feasibility study on the modification of a drilling riser in a conventional connected mode to freestanding mode nguyen et al 2006 have been described the challenges addressed with proffered solution to ensure safety in drilling xu et al 2013 and a field trial of freestanding drilling riser system guo et al 2015 have been introduced in addition the dynamic analysis model for a riser system in different operation modes to calculate the weak points and the safe operation window of the riser in typhoon has been presented liu et al 2017 the effect of typhoon generated swell on fsdr has been studied through finite element analysis yong et al 2018 the parametric study has been carried out to understand the fsdr response under typhoon condition xu et al 2019 the mechanical characteristics and operating envelope of fsdr has been studied wang and gao 2020 and an operational method has been proposed for safe and quick retrieval of drilling risers in freestanding mode abimbola et al 2020 gudmann et al 1998 norheim 2003 moutrey and lim 2006 chen et al 2008 kang et al 2012 zhen et al 2019 wu et al 2019 zhen et al 2020 have all published works on risers supported by bc or artificial buoyant seabed abs but not on the survivability of drilling riser disconnected in freestanding mode as presented in this paper prior to the evolution of fsdr system there have been published literatures on mechanical behavior of risers ranging from general marine risers to freestanding hybrid riser fshr static and dynamic analysis of risers under various conditions mathematical models and numerical simulations have been put forward regarding the study of risers sattamini and ferranti 1993 dai et al 2009 ju 2011 wang 2014 as the offshore exploration of oil and gas moves from shallow to deep water the riser length increases which in turn poses greater challenges in understanding the mechanical behavior of riser because the riser becomes more vulnerable to sea current and waves forces fshr concept was introduced to minimize waves and strong surface current effects on riser tellier and thethi 2009 although fshr is used in production it is also supported by bc or abs and the literature on it is worth reviewing for the work presented in this paper other researchers in the likes of song et al 2010 kang et al 2011 qin et al 2011 zhou et al 2016 kim et al 2018 kim et al 2019 have all carried out different studies on fshr such as the engineering design and analysis of fshr fshr global motion fatigue analysis sensitivity analysis and optimization of fshr system mechanical behavior of fshr limit using numerical and experimental methods optimal configuration of fshr under the influence of bc uplift force and comprehensive study of the stability of hybrid risers most works on marine risers focused on its mechanical behavior in a connected mode hang off mode or during installation and the relatively few works on freestanding riser are largely based on fshr which is for production but not drfm moreover due to the differences in system configuration and working condition the mechanical behavior of fshr and drfm differs significantly which makes it necessary to study the drfm therefore this paper puts forward a new concept of survivability study of drilling riser in freestanding mode it investigates the survivability of a drilling riser when disconnected in freestanding mode and establishes a threshold condition for various bc positions to bring about the safety of the drilling risers in severe environmental conditions it presents a static mathematical model which accounts for the bc diameter as well as current loadings and riser thicknesses as the fsdr system is nascent this paper provides valuable reference for further study on the deployment of fsdr technology and drfm in deep and ultra deepwater the survivability threshold condition established is a very useful quick check prior to numerical simulation numerical simulation was carried out to validate the theoretical results and the influences of current loadings under different surface velocities and riser thickness on the threshold established for drfm are also investigated 2 mathematical formulation fig 1 a depicts a fsdr system in connected mode during drilling operation which is disconnectable at the near surface disconnection package nsdp in the connected mode the buoyancy can bc is kept inactive as the drilling riser is tensioned by tensioners attached to the drilling vessel or platform the fsdr system can avoid the need to recover the whole length of riser system in the event of an approaching severe weather by retrieving only a short section of the riser thus reducing time spent pulling the riser and preparation time for evacuation the procedure for disconnection is summarized as follows the drilling riser is circulated with sea water to replace the drilling mud retrieval of all the drill pipes in riser is carried out and in the process the tensioning force of the top tensioner is reduced air is injected into the bc through the control lines and injection ports on the nsdp to make the bc provide the upthrust that is needed to support the drilling riser freestanding mode drfm then the short upper riser joints above the nsdp is separated from the longer lower riser joints and the former is recovered while the latter is left in freestanding mode as shown in fig 1 b the freestanding mode of drfm as illustrated in fig 1 b can be divided into three sections nsdp bc and a lower section of the drilling riser the lower section of the drilling riser which is just a conventional drilling riser section is below the bc the bc is skidded onto the lower section of the drilling riser nguyen 2006 the nsdp which consists of two sections lower and upper section is the interface component bridging the upper and lower riser sections when disconnected the upper section of nsdp is retrieved with the upper riser section and the lower section of nsdp remains with the lower riser section which is drfm the drfm which is slender long and fully submerged is subjected to an axial tension force from both the upthrust upward force generated by the bc and its apparent weight in water and lateral force generated by sea current as shown in the analysis model in fig 2 the connection point of the riser bottom and the lower marine riser package lmrp system is taken as the origin of the coordinate and the positive direction of vertical axis is opposite to gravity direction while the direction of horizontal axis is in line with lateral current force the following assumptions were made in establishing a governing equation for the drfm the drfm is regarded as a two segment riser comprising the top shorter section covered by bc which assumes the external diameter of bc and the bottom longer section retaining the external diameter of the riser each section of drfm is homogeneous isotropic and linearly elastic steel pipe with constant cross section there is no bending stiffener in the drfm just below the bc and also there is no flex joint in the nsdp thus the bending stiffness is considered constant along the drfm pipe the top of the drfm is below the sea surface at a point where it is free of strong surface waves hence the surface waves effect is neglected the whole length of drfm is subjected to lateral force generated by current only since there is no vessel motion and surface waves effect is negligible the lateral deformation or displacement of the drfm is small compared to the long length of the riser hence euler bernoulli theory is applicable for the riser s bending the top section of drfm is regarded as a free end and the bottom which is constrained by a system of lmrp blowout preventer and wellhead is regarded as a hinge constraint with these assumptions the equation that describes the lateral deformation of a differential element of the drfm which is similar to that of riser in connected mode can be expressed as 1 e i d 4 v d x 4 t e x d 2 v d x 2 w a d v d x f v x where v x the solution of eq 1 is the lateral displacement of the drfm x is the coordinate point along the drfm ei is the drfm bending stiffness t e x is the drfm effective tension force distribution along the x axis w a is the apparent weight of drfm in sea water per unit length f v x is the lateral current force distribution along the x axis the first term and the last term on the left hand side of eq 1 describes the bending of the drfm according to the euler bernoulli theory and the apparent weight of drfm respectively the apparent weight w a of drfm is obtained by adding the weight of drfm in air to the difference between the weight of internal fluid and the weight of external fluid and is given by eq 2 2 w a m r g a i ρ i g a e ρ e g where m r is the mass per unit length of drfm plus its additional mass from materials such as choke and kill lines g is the acceleration due to gravity a i and a e are the internal and external areas of drfm cross section respectively ρ i and ρ e are the densities of internal and external fluids respectively both are sea water for drfm the second term of eq 1 takes care of the effective axial tension in the drfm due to its own submerged weight and bc upthrust the effective tension t e x is calculated from 3 t e x b t o p w a l x where b top is the bc upthrust also referred to as the drfm top tension t top l is the length of drfm the term on the right hand side of eq 1 is the external lateral current loading per unit length exerted on the drfm the current force is calculated by 4 f v x 1 2 ρ w c d d e u c u c where c d is the drag force coefficient d e is the external diameter of drfm u c is the current velocity the bottom of the drfm is not at the sea bed hence the equation for calculating the sea current velocity at a certain depth from the sea surface is adjusted and given by eq 5 5 u c x u c t x l b m d 1 7 u c w x l b m d where u ct is the velocity of tide driven current u cw is the velocity of wind driven current d is the water depth and l bm is the distance from bottom of drfm to mud line 2 1 current profiles the drilling riser freestanding mode drfm is not under the influence of drilling vessel or platform motion and its top is at the depth below the water surface where the surface waves effect is negligible moreover the wave parameters barely affect the deformation of the riser mao et al 2016 thus the main lateral force on the drfm is generated by sea current the current velocity for the deepwater environment is obtained using its sea surface wind and tide velocity values given in table 2 in section 3 1 from eq 5 and the current force on the drfm is obtained from eq 4 the current velocity profiles generated are shown in fig 3 and under the extreme current condition of 2 14 m s surface velocity profile the mechanical behavior of drfm was analyzed the behavior of the drfm under different current velocities are also discussed in subsection 4 4 1 2 2 boundary conditions as described in section 2 the bottom of the drfm is connected to lmrp bop system and wellhead on the sea bed through a flex joint and it is regarded as a hinge constraint this type of end constraint prevents translational movement of the bottom end of the riser but not the rotational movement since the bending stiffness of the joint is not zero thus the lower boundary conditions are given as 6 v x x 0 0 e i d 2 v x d x 2 x 0 k b θ b where k b and θ b are the rotational stiffness of the lower flex joint and the inclination angle at the bottom of the drfm respectively unlike in the connected mode the top section of the drfm is a free end this type of end constraint prevents bending movement and since the top section is vulnerable to lateral current force the shear force is equal to the current force at the top end thus the upper boundary conditions can be expressed as 7 e i d 2 v x d x 2 x l 0 e i d 3 v x d x 3 x l f v t x where f vt x is the lateral current force at the top end x is the coordinate point along the drfm x 0 and x l are the bottom end and the top end of the drfm respectively 2 3 buoyancy can length and diameter determination as shown in subsection 4 1 3 the effect of buoyancy can bc diameter is significant and hence cannot be neglected in analyzing the mechanical behavior of drfm the bc effect is accounted for by treating the drfm as a two segment consisting of the top short section covered by bc which uses the external diameter of the bc and the bottom longer section retaining the external diameter of the riser the outer dimensions of the bc can be obtained as follows the bc weight ratio eq 8 which is the ratio of bc dry weight w dry to weight of displaced water w dw is set to 0 3 as it was determined from the experiment conducted by kang et al 2012 the bc upthrust b top in terms of bc dry weight and weight of displaced water can be expressed by eq 9 eliminating the bc dry weight w dry by equating eqs 8 and 9 and substituting for the weight of displaced water eq 10 gives eq 11 which is the bc upthrust equation in terms of bc length and diameter with a specific l d length to diameter ratio the bc length and diameter can be determined from eq 11 8 w d r y w d w 0 3 9 b t o p w d w w d r y the weight of displaced water is calculated from 10 w d w ρ w g π 4 d b c 2 l b c where l bc and d bc are the buoyancy can length and diameter respectively 11 b t o p 0 7 ρ w g π 4 d b c 2 l b c 3 numerical solution 3 1 lateral displacement response analytical solution of the differential equation eq 1 does not exist since the effective tension t e x varies along the length of the drilling riser freestanding mode drfm hence it is solved numerically a finite difference fd numerical method is used to obtain the solution the fd solution method requires the transformation of the differential equation into a linear algebraic equation by substituting the approximated derivatives with appropriate fd algebraic expressions the first step involved in the implementation of fd numerical solution method is to divide the drfm length into a series of nodes as shown in fig 4 by choosing a step size representing the length of a node for a uniform step size which is usually necessary for fd numerical solution method the total number of nodes on the drfm can be determined from 12 n l h where n is the total number of nodes of the drfm length l is the length of drfm h is the step size the first nodal point x 0 0 is at the bottom of the drfm and the last node x n l is at the top of the drfm the distance of other nodal points along the drfm length can be evaluated from 13 x i x 0 i h f o r i 1 2 3 n 1 another set of nodes referred to as fictitious or imaginary nodes are needed at both ends of the riser to obtain fd solution to eq 1 the creation of these nodes is necessary so as to approximate the fourth order derivatives of the nodes closest to the boundary precisely the nodes 2 and n 1 at the bottom and the top of the drfm respectively thus the fictitious nodes 1 and n 1 are set at the drfm bottom and top respectively after the division of the drfm length into a series of nodes and the creation of fictitious nodes the fd approximations can now be written for the derivatives of the equation at each node which then transforms the differential equation into a set of simultaneous algebraic equations that can be solved by using either direct technique of gaussian elimination with partial pivoting or iterative technique of jacobi s method or gauss seidel s method for all internal nodes denoted by i centered fd expressions for the first second and fourth derivatives in eq 1 are expressed as follows 14 d v i d x v i 1 v i 1 2 h θ i 15 d 2 v i d x 2 v i 1 2 v i v i 1 h 2 16 d 4 v i d x 4 v i 2 4 v i 1 6 v i 4 v i 1 v i 2 h 4 therefore with reference to the procedures discussed for the application of fd method in solving the present problem the transformed algebraic expression for eq 1 is given as 17 e i v i 2 4 v i 1 6 v i 4 v i 1 v i 2 h 4 t e i v i 1 2 v i v i 1 h 2 w a v i 1 v i 1 2 h f i where t ei and f i are the effective tension and the lateral force at any node i and they are given by eqs 18 and 19 respectively 18 t e i t e x x i h b t o p w a l i h 19 f i f v x x i h 1 2 ρ c d d o u c t i h l b m d 1 7 u c w i h l b m d u c t i h l b m d 1 7 u c w i h l b m d h eq 17 can be written for each of the n 2 interior nodes of the drfm which results in a set of n 2 linear algebraic equations the solution value of the boundary node v 0 0 at the bottom of drfm is already specified in the lower boundary condition but the values of the boundary node n at the top and the fictitious nodes 1 and n 1 are unknown together with n 2 unknowns from the interior nodal equations thereby resulting in a total number of n 1 unknowns to be determined thus an additional three equations are needed to complement the n 2 equations from interior nodes to make the number of equations the same as the number of unknowns the three equations are obtained from the boundary conditions when they are discretized the discretized forms of the boundary conditions are written as follows for the lower boundary conditions eq 6 the bottom inclination angle θ b in the moment equation part is approximated using the centered fd expression for first derivative and by rearranging the terms the moment equation part is expressed as 20 v 1 2 e i k b h 2 e i k b h v 0 4 e i 2 e i k b h v 1 0 for the upper boundary conditions eq 7 the moment equation part having replaced the derivatives with fd expressions is given by 21 v n 1 2 v n v n 1 0 the shear force part of the upper boundary conditions is of third derivative replacing the third derivative with a centered fd approximation would require a creation of another imaginary node at the top of drfm introducing more imaginary nodes could make the solution relatively less accurate to avoid this an endpoint fd formula was derived using the four nodes n 2 n 1 n and n 1 to approximate the shear force equation and this gives 22 e i d 3 v d x 3 e i 3 v n v n 1 3 v n 1 v n 2 h 3 f n which when rearranging yields 23 v n 2 3 v n 1 3 v n v n 1 h 3 e i f n now with n 2 equations for interior nodes and the three additional eqs 20 21 and 23 the problem reduces to solving n 1 simultaneous linear algebraic equations for n 1 unknowns which can be written in the form 24 a v b w h e r e a 1 2 e i k b h 2 e i k b h 4 e i 2 e i k b h 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 e i h 4 4 e i h 4 t 1 h 2 w a 2 h 6 e i h 4 2 t 1 h 2 4 e i h 4 t 1 h 2 w a 2 h e i h 4 0 0 0

0 0 1 3 3 1 v v 1 v 0 v 1 v n 1 v n v n 1 b 0 0 f 1 f n 1 h 3 e i f n v n 1 with a uniform step size or nodal length of h 1 m for a drfm length of 1286 m when the bc or the top of drfm is 200 m below sea surface there is a total number of 1288 nodes interior nodes only 1284 interior nodes and boundary nodes 1286 interior nodes boundary nodes and fictitious nodes 1288 the displacement response or solution at the bottom end of drfm is already known thus a linear system of 1287 equations comprising 1284 internal nodal equations and 3 nodal equations from the boundary conditions are to be solved tables 1 and 2 provide the values of riser parameters and sea current data at extreme condition respectively used in the riser model by employing the calculation parameters as provided in these tables the coefficient matrix a and the corresponding b values of the matrix form eq 24 can be computed for the solution of the drfm displacement response because of the large size of the linear system equations a matlab script was written to solve the equations system the solution of the equation systems gives the lateral displacement response of drfm at each node 3 2 lower flex joint angle and stress response the calculation of the inclination angle of drfm depends on lateral displacement values obtained as a solution to eq 1 thus having obtained the solution to eq 1 which is the lateral displacement of drfm at each node the inclination angle θ i of the drfm at each node can be determined from 25 θ i d v i d x v i 1 v i 1 2 h where h is the nodal length the value of θ i at the bottom of the drfm is the lower flex joint angle the stress in the drfm expressed as von mises stress is induced by a combination of effective tension along the drfm internal and external pressures on drfm and the bending moment in which drfm is subject to the effective tension induces effective axial stress the internal and external pressures induce circumferential stress and radial stress and the bending moment induces bending stress like the inclination angle calculation of bending moment also depends on lateral displacement solution of eq 1 the bending moment m i of the drfm at each node can be determined from 26 m i e i d 2 v i d x 2 e i v i 1 2 v i v i 1 h 2 where ei is the bending stiffness of the drfm h is the nodal length the bending stress σ bi at every nodal point on the drfm can be determined from 27 σ b i m i r m w i e i v i 1 2 v i v i 1 h 2 r m w i where m i is the bending moment i is the moment of inertia r mw is the radius of the mid wall of the drfm the radius of the mid wall is determined from 28 r m w r i 0 5 r e r i where r e and r i are the external and internal radii of drfm respectively since bending stress is a component necessary in obtaining the von mises stress of drfm and bending stress is obtained from bending moment whose determination depends on lateral displacement values it thus implies that the calculation of von mises stress along drfm also depends on the lateral displacement solution to eq 1 the von mises stress σ vmi at every nodal point on the drfm can be determined from 29 σ v m i 1 2 σ t e i σ b i σ c i 2 σ c i σ r i 2 σ r i σ t e i σ b i 2 where σ bi is the bending stress σ tei σ ci and σ ri are the effective axial stress circumferential stress and radial stress of drfm at every nodal point which are computed by eqs 30 32 respectively 30 σ t e i t e i a e a i 31 σ c i p i a i p e a e a e a i p i p e a i a e a e a i a r m w 32 σ r i p i a i p e a e a e a i p i p e a i a e a e a i a r m w where p i is the internal fluid pressure p e is the external fluid pressure a i a e and a rmw are the internal external and mid wall areas of drfm respectively 4 results and discussions 4 1 numerical analysis results this section presents the analysis interpretation and discussions of lateral displacement the lower flex rotations and the stress behavior of drilling riser freestanding mode drfm obtained from the finite difference solution of eq 1 making use of the displacement response and within the allowable limits of lower flex joint angle and stress behavior to show the influence of bc diameter discussed in subsection 4 1 3 and to establish a threshold condition for the survivability of drfm during extreme sea current of typhoon condition 4 1 1 threshold condition for bc position of 100m for a bc position or depth of 100 m below the sea surface in other words a riser length of 100 m is removed from the top of fsdr system in connected mode in establishing a threshold condition for survivability the deformation and stress analysis of drfm was carried out fig 5 a and b and 5 c show the variations of drfm lateral deformation with buoyancy can upthrust ratio bcur the variations of drfm von mises stress with bcur and the variations of drfm inclination angle with bcur respectively the amount of upthrust designated as bcur 1 upthrust value is equal to the weight of drfm which is needed to just support the drfm weight gave a maximum displacement of 112 59 m von mises stress of 218 0 mpa and lower flex joint angle of 9 0170 in establishing a threshold condition amount of upthrust expressed as bcur that must not be exceeded and feasible maximum lateral displacement while keeping the drfm stress and lower flex joint angle within allowable limits an upthrust which will not only support the drfm weight but also control its response should be desired thus a value higher than bcur 1 0 was used with bcur 1 5 that is a buoyancy can upthrust of 50 greater than the drfm weight drfm maximum displacement von mises stress and lower flex joint angle are 29 83 m 255 5 mpa and 3 3870 respectively in as much as the von mises stress is within the allowable stress limit of the drfm a further control could still be desired with bcur 2 5 drfm maximum displacement is 12 82 m while von mises stress 367 1 mpa and lower flex joint angle 1 7240 are within the allowable limits however with bcur greater than 2 5 von mises stress is 379 2 mpa a value which exceeds the allowable stress limit of 369 8 mpa for the riser this means that an attempt to further reduce drfm lateral displacement and lower flex joint angle by increasing bcur above 2 5 would place the drfm in danger of failure thus the threshold condition for bc position of 100 m gives a feasible maximum lateral displacement of 12 82 m buoyancy can upthrust ratio of 2 5 lower flex joint angle of 1 7240 and von mises stress of 367 1 mpa 4 1 2 threshold condition for various bc positions in the event of an imminent threat of typhoon both the urgent evacuation for safety and leaving the drilling riser in a safe freestanding mode are of great concerns and should be achieved thus the analysis as described in subsection 4 1 1 was carried out for various bc positions of 150 200 250 and 300 m and in each case a corresponding threshold condition was established each of fig 6 9 illustrate the lateral displacement von mises stress and inclination angle along the drfm for each case of the bc positions the threshold conditions for all the cases are presented in table 3 the analysis results thus present the offshore personnel on site with a choice of for instance a 250 m riser length removal threshold condition or a 100 m riser length removal threshold condition depending on how urgent the situation is as the time required to remove a 250 m length could be at least twice of the 100 m length removal 4 1 3 analysis of the effect of buoyancy can this section presents the effect of bc diameter in the analysis of drfm first by ignoring the effect of bc diameter as shown in fig 10 a and fig 11 a bcur 2 7 that is buoyancy can upthrust is 2 7 times the weight of drfm gives a feasible maximum lateral deformation or displacement control of 10 92 m for the riser stress to be kept within the allowable limit in order to consider the effect of bc diameter bc size was determined as described in subsection 2 3 using the bcur 2 7 obtained for the case of ignoring bc effect taking the length to diameter l d ratio of bc in the range 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 and 5 0 l d 5 0 gives the least bending moment and von mises stress as shown in fig 12 a and fig 12 b respectively thus using the l d 5 0 the bc actual length and diameter were obtained as 34 73 m and 6 95 m figs 10 b and fig 11 b show the von mises stress and lateral displacement respectively for the drfm when the effect of bc diameter is taken into consideration there is a sharp increase in von mises stress at the bc bottom on the drfm due to a relatively large diameter of bc compared to the riser outer diameter moreover it was observed that the actual feasible drfm lateral displacement control that can be achieved is 12 82 m and the bcur 2 5 unlike the case of ignoring bc diameter effect which gives 10 92 m and a bcur of 2 7 while keeping the stress and lower flex joint angle within allowable limits 4 2 numerical simulation results numerical simulation was carried out to validate the theoretical results of the threshold conditions established for the survivability of drfm the drfm tensioned by bc was simulated with the riser properties and the environmental conditions as given in tables 1 and 2 respectively in abaqus software of the version dassault systemes abaqus 6 14 5 fig 13 conveys information that shows how current force is applied to drfm the reference points rp are synonymous to the nodal points in the discretization of drfm shown in fig 4 under theoretical method through the rp created the lateral current force is applied to drfm at those points the simulation results for all the bc positions are generated and compared with the theoretical results in section 4 3 but only the simulation images for a bc position of 300 m are presented in this section 4 2 1 lateral displacement of drilling riser freestanding mode fig 14 shows the whole length of the drilling riser drfm tensioned by the bc in undeformed state fig 15 is a contour plot which shows the lateral displacement of drfm from its original position undeformed state from the contour plot it can be seen that the top region of the drfm is the most deflected region this conforms to the theoretical results as well table 4 gives the comparison between the theoretical and simulation results for a bc position of 300 m the simulation result for drfm maximum lateral displacement is 6 35 m the simulation result value agrees well with the theoretical result of 6 44 m with a negligible error of 0 09 m and being exactly the same as the theoretical result when rounded off to one decimal place 4 2 2 von mises stress distribution the von mises stress distribution of drfm is given by contour plot of fig 16 there is a sharp increase in von mises stress at the bc bottom on the drfm due to a relatively large diameter of bc compared to the outer diameter of the drfm the maximum stress on the drfm occurs at this region this result is consistent with that observed for theoretical method table 4 gives the comparison between the theoretical and simulation results for a bc position of 300 m the simulated result for drfm maximum von mises stress value is 362 9 mpa a value of only 0 14 error from the theoretical value of 363 4 mpa 4 3 comparison between numerical results and simulation results the simulation result values of lateral displacement von mises stress and inclination angles of the drfm for each of the bc positions are extracted and compared with the theoretical results the comparison results of the threshold conditions maximum lateral displacement maximum von mises stress lower flex joint angle and bcur for bc position of 100 150 200 250 and 300 m are given in table 4 fig 17 and fig 18 show the comparison when the entire values rather than threshold condition values of a parameter are considered in each of the bc position case for all the parameters the error between the theoretical results and the numerical simulation results is less than 2 signifying a good consistency between the two methods hence the threshold conditions established for survivability of drfm are reliable 4 4 influence of various current loading and riser thicknesses on threshold condition 4 4 1 effect of current the effect of current loading was investigated with different surface current velocities 1 51 2 14 2 84 and 3 54 m s the variations obtained with drilling riser freestanding mode drfm lateral displacement von mises stress and inclination angle are shown in fig 19 a and b and 19 c respectively it can be concluded that with an increase in current surface velocity the lateral displacement and the lower flex joint angles of drfm increase significantly while the von mises stresses has a significant increase only at the region near the top of the drfm due to the bc diameter effect considering the case for a bc of 100 m an increase in current velocity from 2 14 to 2 84 m s significantly increases the threshold condition parameters lateral displacement from 12 82 to 23 08 m von mises stress from 367 1 to 394 4 mpa exceeding the allowable limit and lower flex joint angle from 1 724 to 3 0930 hence ascertaining the extreme current condition of a deepwater environment is very important in order to establish the threshold condition for the survivability of drfm 4 4 2 effect of riser thickness the effect of riser thickness has been investigated on the threshold condition of drfm and the results for a bc of 100 m are shown in fig 20 a and b and 20 c an increase in thickness from 15 875 to 19 844 mm decreases the threshold condition parameters lateral displacement from 12 82 to 10 81 m von mises stress from 367 1 to 345 9 mpa and lower flex joint angle from 1 724 to 1 4450 on the other hand a decrease in thickness from 15 875 to 11 906 mm increases the threshold condition parameters lateral displacement from 12 82 to 15 78 m von mises stress from 367 1 to 401 4 mpa and lower flex joint angle from 1 724 to 2 1360 it is thus concluded that while the increase in thickness poses no danger to survivability of drfm decrease in riser thickness does because the von mises stress exceeds the allowable limit 5 conclusions retrieving the whole length of deepwater drilling riser in the event of an imminent typhoon is not only tedious and time consuming but also has a huge risk of untimely evacuation of personnel and facilities for safety this paper analyzes the mechanical behavior of drilling riser freestanding mode drfm for its survivability under extreme sea current of typhoon condition the results obtained from the theoretical method have been validated with those predicted from the numerical simulation in abaqus 6 14 5 in the light of the observations made from this study the following conclusions can be drawn the buoyancy can bc diameter has a significant influence on the drfm behavior a sharp significant increase in von mises stress observed on the drfm at the bottom of bc as a result of relatively large bc diameter is identified as a potential region for drfm failure the survivability threshold condition for bc position of 100 m gives a feasible maximum lateral displacement of 12 82 m buoyancy can upthrust ratio of 2 5 lower flex joint angle of 1 7240 and von mises stress of 367 1 mpa a lateral displacement control which is lower than 12 82 m cannot be achieved by increasing the bcur however such a control can be made by increasing the riser thickness while the von mises stress and lower flex joint angles are still within acceptable limits selection of any bc position from 100 m is possible to ensure survivability of the drilling riser anticipated to be in freestanding mode provided that its threshold condition is adhered to accuracy of the threshold condition has been verified with numerical simulation in abaqus in each of the bc position case for all the parameters the error between the theoretical results and the numerical simulation results is less than 2 signifying a good consistency between the two methods credit authorship contribution statement fatai akorede abimbola conceptualization methodology software writing

21070,the conventional practice of retrieving the whole length of deepwater drilling riser during imminent typhoon is tedious time consuming and has huge risk of untimely evacuation of personnel and facilities for safety a proposed operational solution is one which has the drilling riser disconnectable near surface while the longer section is left tensioned by buoyancy can bc in freestanding mode this prompts the need to investigate the survivability of drilling riser when disconnected in freestanding mode and reuse for continued drilling operation after typhoon in this paper a mathematical model is presented to analyze the mechanical behavior of drilling riser freestanding mode drfm finite difference method with derived end point formula to reduce imaginary nodes was used to obtain the solution bc upthrust ratio required to support the drfm weight and maintain its response while keeping stress and lower flex joint angle within allowable limits has been figured out to determine survivability threshold for drfm in extreme sea current condition bc effect shows potential region for drfm failure accuracy of the threshold condition was verified with numerical simulation in abaqus threshold conditions for various bc positions were established influence of current loadings and riser thicknesses on the threshold condition have also been investigated keywords survivability study drilling riser freestanding mode buoyancy can threshold abaqus 1 introduction the frequent hurricane or typhoon in gulf of mexico south china sea and other susceptible deepwater environments to such an emergency which disrupts drilling operations and endangers offshore facilities have given much attention to drilling risers to be designed for disconnection near the surface this is because the retrieving process of the whole length of the drilling riser is tedious and might not even finish in time as to avert possible dangers concern thus a freestanding drilling riser fsdr system has been proposed in which the drilling riser is disconnectable closer to the surface with a small part being removed from the top while the longer section part of the riser is left tensioned by the buoyancy can bc in freestanding mode after the harsh environmental condition is over reconnection of few hundreds of meters rather than over a thousand of meters of riser joints will be needed to continue normal drilling the concept and system have been put forward to provide a solution for the disadvantages of retrieving the whole length of drilling riser in the advance of a typhoon environment kogure et al 1998 the instructions of the operational procedure for a near surface disconnectable drilling riser bye et al 2000 lim et al 2008 and the feasibility study on the modification of a drilling riser in a conventional connected mode to freestanding mode nguyen et al 2006 have been described the challenges addressed with proffered solution to ensure safety in drilling xu et al 2013 and a field trial of freestanding drilling riser system guo et al 2015 have been introduced in addition the dynamic analysis model for a riser system in different operation modes to calculate the weak points and the safe operation window of the riser in typhoon has been presented liu et al 2017 the effect of typhoon generated swell on fsdr has been studied through finite element analysis yong et al 2018 the parametric study has been carried out to understand the fsdr response under typhoon condition xu et al 2019 the mechanical characteristics and operating envelope of fsdr has been studied wang and gao 2020 and an operational method has been proposed for safe and quick retrieval of drilling risers in freestanding mode abimbola et al 2020 gudmann et al 1998 norheim 2003 moutrey and lim 2006 chen et al 2008 kang et al 2012 zhen et al 2019 wu et al 2019 zhen et al 2020 have all published works on risers supported by bc or artificial buoyant seabed abs but not on the survivability of drilling riser disconnected in freestanding mode as presented in this paper prior to the evolution of fsdr system there have been published literatures on mechanical behavior of risers ranging from general marine risers to freestanding hybrid riser fshr static and dynamic analysis of risers under various conditions mathematical models and numerical simulations have been put forward regarding the study of risers sattamini and ferranti 1993 dai et al 2009 ju 2011 wang 2014 as the offshore exploration of oil and gas moves from shallow to deep water the riser length increases which in turn poses greater challenges in understanding the mechanical behavior of riser because the riser becomes more vulnerable to sea current and waves forces fshr concept was introduced to minimize waves and strong surface current effects on riser tellier and thethi 2009 although fshr is used in production it is also supported by bc or abs and the literature on it is worth reviewing for the work presented in this paper other researchers in the likes of song et al 2010 kang et al 2011 qin et al 2011 zhou et al 2016 kim et al 2018 kim et al 2019 have all carried out different studies on fshr such as the engineering design and analysis of fshr fshr global motion fatigue analysis sensitivity analysis and optimization of fshr system mechanical behavior of fshr limit using numerical and experimental methods optimal configuration of fshr under the influence of bc uplift force and comprehensive study of the stability of hybrid risers most works on marine risers focused on its mechanical behavior in a connected mode hang off mode or during installation and the relatively few works on freestanding riser are largely based on fshr which is for production but not drfm moreover due to the differences in system configuration and working condition the mechanical behavior of fshr and drfm differs significantly which makes it necessary to study the drfm therefore this paper puts forward a new concept of survivability study of drilling riser in freestanding mode it investigates the survivability of a drilling riser when disconnected in freestanding mode and establishes a threshold condition for various bc positions to bring about the safety of the drilling risers in severe environmental conditions it presents a static mathematical model which accounts for the bc diameter as well as current loadings and riser thicknesses as the fsdr system is nascent this paper provides valuable reference for further study on the deployment of fsdr technology and drfm in deep and ultra deepwater the survivability threshold condition established is a very useful quick check prior to numerical simulation numerical simulation was carried out to validate the theoretical results and the influences of current loadings under different surface velocities and riser thickness on the threshold established for drfm are also investigated 2 mathematical formulation fig 1 a depicts a fsdr system in connected mode during drilling operation which is disconnectable at the near surface disconnection package nsdp in the connected mode the buoyancy can bc is kept inactive as the drilling riser is tensioned by tensioners attached to the drilling vessel or platform the fsdr system can avoid the need to recover the whole length of riser system in the event of an approaching severe weather by retrieving only a short section of the riser thus reducing time spent pulling the riser and preparation time for evacuation the procedure for disconnection is summarized as follows the drilling riser is circulated with sea water to replace the drilling mud retrieval of all the drill pipes in riser is carried out and in the process the tensioning force of the top tensioner is reduced air is injected into the bc through the control lines and injection ports on the nsdp to make the bc provide the upthrust that is needed to support the drilling riser freestanding mode drfm then the short upper riser joints above the nsdp is separated from the longer lower riser joints and the former is recovered while the latter is left in freestanding mode as shown in fig 1 b the freestanding mode of drfm as illustrated in fig 1 b can be divided into three sections nsdp bc and a lower section of the drilling riser the lower section of the drilling riser which is just a conventional drilling riser section is below the bc the bc is skidded onto the lower section of the drilling riser nguyen 2006 the nsdp which consists of two sections lower and upper section is the interface component bridging the upper and lower riser sections when disconnected the upper section of nsdp is retrieved with the upper riser section and the lower section of nsdp remains with the lower riser section which is drfm the drfm which is slender long and fully submerged is subjected to an axial tension force from both the upthrust upward force generated by the bc and its apparent weight in water and lateral force generated by sea current as shown in the analysis model in fig 2 the connection point of the riser bottom and the lower marine riser package lmrp system is taken as the origin of the coordinate and the positive direction of vertical axis is opposite to gravity direction while the direction of horizontal axis is in line with lateral current force the following assumptions were made in establishing a governing equation for the drfm the drfm is regarded as a two segment riser comprising the top shorter section covered by bc which assumes the external diameter of bc and the bottom longer section retaining the external diameter of the riser each section of drfm is homogeneous isotropic and linearly elastic steel pipe with constant cross section there is no bending stiffener in the drfm just below the bc and also there is no flex joint in the nsdp thus the bending stiffness is considered constant along the drfm pipe the top of the drfm is below the sea surface at a point where it is free of strong surface waves hence the surface waves effect is neglected the whole length of drfm is subjected to lateral force generated by current only since there is no vessel motion and surface waves effect is negligible the lateral deformation or displacement of the drfm is small compared to the long length of the riser hence euler bernoulli theory is applicable for the riser s bending the top section of drfm is regarded as a free end and the bottom which is constrained by a system of lmrp blowout preventer and wellhead is regarded as a hinge constraint with these assumptions the equation that describes the lateral deformation of a differential element of the drfm which is similar to that of riser in connected mode can be expressed as 1 e i d 4 v d x 4 t e x d 2 v d x 2 w a d v d x f v x where v x the solution of eq 1 is the lateral displacement of the drfm x is the coordinate point along the drfm ei is the drfm bending stiffness t e x is the drfm effective tension force distribution along the x axis w a is the apparent weight of drfm in sea water per unit length f v x is the lateral current force distribution along the x axis the first term and the last term on the left hand side of eq 1 describes the bending of the drfm according to the euler bernoulli theory and the apparent weight of drfm respectively the apparent weight w a of drfm is obtained by adding the weight of drfm in air to the difference between the weight of internal fluid and the weight of external fluid and is given by eq 2 2 w a m r g a i ρ i g a e ρ e g where m r is the mass per unit length of drfm plus its additional mass from materials such as choke and kill lines g is the acceleration due to gravity a i and a e are the internal and external areas of drfm cross section respectively ρ i and ρ e are the densities of internal and external fluids respectively both are sea water for drfm the second term of eq 1 takes care of the effective axial tension in the drfm due to its own submerged weight and bc upthrust the effective tension t e x is calculated from 3 t e x b t o p w a l x where b top is the bc upthrust also referred to as the drfm top tension t top l is the length of drfm the term on the right hand side of eq 1 is the external lateral current loading per unit length exerted on the drfm the current force is calculated by 4 f v x 1 2 ρ w c d d e u c u c where c d is the drag force coefficient d e is the external diameter of drfm u c is the current velocity the bottom of the drfm is not at the sea bed hence the equation for calculating the sea current velocity at a certain depth from the sea surface is adjusted and given by eq 5 5 u c x u c t x l b m d 1 7 u c w x l b m d where u ct is the velocity of tide driven current u cw is the velocity of wind driven current d is the water depth and l bm is the distance from bottom of drfm to mud line 2 1 current profiles the drilling riser freestanding mode drfm is not under the influence of drilling vessel or platform motion and its top is at the depth below the water surface where the surface waves effect is negligible moreover the wave parameters barely affect the deformation of the riser mao et al 2016 thus the main lateral force on the drfm is generated by sea current the current velocity for the deepwater environment is obtained using its sea surface wind and tide velocity values given in table 2 in section 3 1 from eq 5 and the current force on the drfm is obtained from eq 4 the current velocity profiles generated are shown in fig 3 and under the extreme current condition of 2 14 m s surface velocity profile the mechanical behavior of drfm was analyzed the behavior of the drfm under different current velocities are also discussed in subsection 4 4 1 2 2 boundary conditions as described in section 2 the bottom of the drfm is connected to lmrp bop system and wellhead on the sea bed through a flex joint and it is regarded as a hinge constraint this type of end constraint prevents translational movement of the bottom end of the riser but not the rotational movement since the bending stiffness of the joint is not zero thus the lower boundary conditions are given as 6 v x x 0 0 e i d 2 v x d x 2 x 0 k b θ b where k b and θ b are the rotational stiffness of the lower flex joint and the inclination angle at the bottom of the drfm respectively unlike in the connected mode the top section of the drfm is a free end this type of end constraint prevents bending movement and since the top section is vulnerable to lateral current force the shear force is equal to the current force at the top end thus the upper boundary conditions can be expressed as 7 e i d 2 v x d x 2 x l 0 e i d 3 v x d x 3 x l f v t x where f vt x is the lateral current force at the top end x is the coordinate point along the drfm x 0 and x l are the bottom end and the top end of the drfm respectively 2 3 buoyancy can length and diameter determination as shown in subsection 4 1 3 the effect of buoyancy can bc diameter is significant and hence cannot be neglected in analyzing the mechanical behavior of drfm the bc effect is accounted for by treating the drfm as a two segment consisting of the top short section covered by bc which uses the external diameter of the bc and the bottom longer section retaining the external diameter of the riser the outer dimensions of the bc can be obtained as follows the bc weight ratio eq 8 which is the ratio of bc dry weight w dry to weight of displaced water w dw is set to 0 3 as it was determined from the experiment conducted by kang et al 2012 the bc upthrust b top in terms of bc dry weight and weight of displaced water can be expressed by eq 9 eliminating the bc dry weight w dry by equating eqs 8 and 9 and substituting for the weight of displaced water eq 10 gives eq 11 which is the bc upthrust equation in terms of bc length and diameter with a specific l d length to diameter ratio the bc length and diameter can be determined from eq 11 8 w d r y w d w 0 3 9 b t o p w d w w d r y the weight of displaced water is calculated from 10 w d w ρ w g π 4 d b c 2 l b c where l bc and d bc are the buoyancy can length and diameter respectively 11 b t o p 0 7 ρ w g π 4 d b c 2 l b c 3 numerical solution 3 1 lateral displacement response analytical solution of the differential equation eq 1 does not exist since the effective tension t e x varies along the length of the drilling riser freestanding mode drfm hence it is solved numerically a finite difference fd numerical method is used to obtain the solution the fd solution method requires the transformation of the differential equation into a linear algebraic equation by substituting the approximated derivatives with appropriate fd algebraic expressions the first step involved in the implementation of fd numerical solution method is to divide the drfm length into a series of nodes as shown in fig 4 by choosing a step size representing the length of a node for a uniform step size which is usually necessary for fd numerical solution method the total number of nodes on the drfm can be determined from 12 n l h where n is the total number of nodes of the drfm length l is the length of drfm h is the step size the first nodal point x 0 0 is at the bottom of the drfm and the last node x n l is at the top of the drfm the distance of other nodal points along the drfm length can be evaluated from 13 x i x 0 i h f o r i 1 2 3 n 1 another set of nodes referred to as fictitious or imaginary nodes are needed at both ends of the riser to obtain fd solution to eq 1 the creation of these nodes is necessary so as to approximate the fourth order derivatives of the nodes closest to the boundary precisely the nodes 2 and n 1 at the bottom and the top of the drfm respectively thus the fictitious nodes 1 and n 1 are set at the drfm bottom and top respectively after the division of the drfm length into a series of nodes and the creation of fictitious nodes the fd approximations can now be written for the derivatives of the equation at each node which then transforms the differential equation into a set of simultaneous algebraic equations that can be solved by using either direct technique of gaussian elimination with partial pivoting or iterative technique of jacobi s method or gauss seidel s method for all internal nodes denoted by i centered fd expressions for the first second and fourth derivatives in eq 1 are expressed as follows 14 d v i d x v i 1 v i 1 2 h θ i 15 d 2 v i d x 2 v i 1 2 v i v i 1 h 2 16 d 4 v i d x 4 v i 2 4 v i 1 6 v i 4 v i 1 v i 2 h 4 therefore with reference to the procedures discussed for the application of fd method in solving the present problem the transformed algebraic expression for eq 1 is given as 17 e i v i 2 4 v i 1 6 v i 4 v i 1 v i 2 h 4 t e i v i 1 2 v i v i 1 h 2 w a v i 1 v i 1 2 h f i where t ei and f i are the effective tension and the lateral force at any node i and they are given by eqs 18 and 19 respectively 18 t e i t e x x i h b t o p w a l i h 19 f i f v x x i h 1 2 ρ c d d o u c t i h l b m d 1 7 u c w i h l b m d u c t i h l b m d 1 7 u c w i h l b m d h eq 17 can be written for each of the n 2 interior nodes of the drfm which results in a set of n 2 linear algebraic equations the solution value of the boundary node v 0 0 at the bottom of drfm is already specified in the lower boundary condition but the values of the boundary node n at the top and the fictitious nodes 1 and n 1 are unknown together with n 2 unknowns from the interior nodal equations thereby resulting in a total number of n 1 unknowns to be determined thus an additional three equations are needed to complement the n 2 equations from interior nodes to make the number of equations the same as the number of unknowns the three equations are obtained from the boundary conditions when they are discretized the discretized forms of the boundary conditions are written as follows for the lower boundary conditions eq 6 the bottom inclination angle θ b in the moment equation part is approximated using the centered fd expression for first derivative and by rearranging the terms the moment equation part is expressed as 20 v 1 2 e i k b h 2 e i k b h v 0 4 e i 2 e i k b h v 1 0 for the upper boundary conditions eq 7 the moment equation part having replaced the derivatives with fd expressions is given by 21 v n 1 2 v n v n 1 0 the shear force part of the upper boundary conditions is of third derivative replacing the third derivative with a centered fd approximation would require a creation of another imaginary node at the top of drfm introducing more imaginary nodes could make the solution relatively less accurate to avoid this an endpoint fd formula was derived using the four nodes n 2 n 1 n and n 1 to approximate the shear force equation and this gives 22 e i d 3 v d x 3 e i 3 v n v n 1 3 v n 1 v n 2 h 3 f n which when rearranging yields 23 v n 2 3 v n 1 3 v n v n 1 h 3 e i f n now with n 2 equations for interior nodes and the three additional eqs 20 21 and 23 the problem reduces to solving n 1 simultaneous linear algebraic equations for n 1 unknowns which can be written in the form 24 a v b w h e r e a 1 2 e i k b h 2 e i k b h 4 e i 2 e i k b h 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 e i h 4 4 e i h 4 t 1 h 2 w a 2 h 6 e i h 4 2 t 1 h 2 4 e i h 4 t 1 h 2 w a 2 h e i h 4 0 0 0

sea surface there is a total number of 1288 nodes interior nodes only 1284 interior nodes and boundary nodes 1286 interior nodes boundary nodes and fictitious nodes 1288 the displacement response or solution at the bottom end of drfm is already known thus a linear system of 1287 equations comprising 1284 internal nodal equations and 3 nodal equations from the boundary conditions are to be solved tables 1 and 2 provide the values of riser parameters and sea current data at extreme condition respectively used in the riser model by employing the calculation parameters as provided in these tables the coefficient matrix a and the corresponding b values of the matrix form eq 24 can be computed for the solution of the drfm displacement response because of the large size of the linear system equations a matlab script was written to solve the equations system the solution of the equation systems gives the lateral displacement response of drfm at each node 3 2 lower flex joint angle and stress response the calculation of the inclination angle of drfm depends on lateral displacement values obtained as a solution to eq 1 thus having obtained the solution to eq 1 which is the lateral displacement of drfm at each node the inclination angle θ i of the drfm at each node can be determined from 25 θ i d v i d x v i 1 v i 1 2 h where h is the nodal length the value of θ i at the bottom of the drfm is the lower flex joint angle the stress in the drfm expressed as von mises stress is induced by a combination of effective tension along the drfm internal and external pressures on drfm and the bending moment in which drfm is subject to the effective tension induces effective axial stress the internal and external pressures induce circumferential stress and radial stress and the bending moment induces bending stress like the inclination angle calculation of bending moment also depends on lateral displacement solution of eq 1 the bending moment m i of the drfm at each node can be determined from 26 m i e i d 2 v i d x 2 e i v i 1 2 v i v i 1 h 2 where ei is the bending stiffness of the drfm h is the nodal length the bending stress σ bi at every nodal point on the drfm can be determined from 27 σ b i m i r m w i e i v i 1 2 v i v i 1 h 2 r m w i where m i is the bending moment i is the moment of inertia r mw is the radius of the mid wall of the drfm the radius of the mid wall is determined from 28 r m w r i 0 5 r e r i where r e and r i are the external and internal radii of drfm respectively since bending stress is a component necessary in obtaining the von mises stress of drfm and bending stress is obtained from bending moment whose determination depends on lateral displacement values it thus implies that the calculation of von mises stress along drfm also depends on the lateral displacement solution to eq 1 the von mises stress σ vmi at every nodal point on the drfm can be determined from 29 σ v m i 1 2 σ t e i σ b i σ c i 2 σ c i σ r i 2 σ r i σ t e i σ b i 2 where σ bi is the bending stress σ tei σ ci and σ ri are the effective axial stress circumferential stress and radial stress of drfm at every nodal point which are computed by eqs 30 32 respectively 30 σ t e i t e i a e a i 31 σ c i p i a i p e a e a e a i p i p e a i a e a e a i a r m w 32 σ r i p i a i p e a e a e a i p i p e a i a e a e a i a r m w where p i is the internal fluid pressure p e is the external fluid pressure a i a e and a rmw are the internal external and mid wall areas of drfm respectively 4 results and discussions 4 1 numerical analysis results this section presents the analysis interpretation and discussions of lateral displacement the lower flex rotations and the stress behavior of drilling riser freestanding mode drfm obtained from the finite difference solution of eq 1 making use of the displacement response and within the allowable limits of lower flex joint angle and stress behavior to show the influence of bc diameter discussed in subsection 4 1 3 and to establish a threshold condition for the survivability of drfm during extreme sea current of typhoon condition 4 1 1 threshold condition for bc position of 100m for a bc position or depth of 100 m below the sea surface in other words a riser length of 100 m is removed from the top of fsdr system in connected mode in establishing a threshold condition for survivability the deformation and stress analysis of drfm was carried out fig 5 a and b and 5 c show the variations of drfm lateral deformation with buoyancy can upthrust ratio bcur the variations of drfm von mises stress with bcur and the variations of drfm inclination angle with bcur respectively the amount of upthrust designated as bcur 1 upthrust value is equal to the weight of drfm which is needed to just support the drfm weight gave a maximum displacement of 112 59 m von mises stress of 218 0 mpa and lower flex joint angle of 9 0170 in establishing a threshold condition amount of upthrust expressed as bcur that must not be exceeded and feasible maximum lateral displacement while keeping the drfm stress and lower flex joint angle within allowable limits an upthrust which will not only support the drfm weight but also control its response should be desired thus a value higher than bcur 1 0 was used with bcur 1 5 that is a buoyancy can upthrust of 50 greater than the drfm weight drfm maximum displacement von mises stress and lower flex joint angle are 29 83 m 255 5 mpa and 3 3870 respectively in as much as the von mises stress is within the allowable stress limit of the drfm a further control could still be desired with bcur 2 5 drfm maximum displacement is 12 82 m while von mises stress 367 1 mpa and lower flex joint angle 1 7240 are within the allowable limits however with bcur greater than 2 5 von mises stress is 379 2 mpa a value which exceeds the allowable stress limit of 369 8 mpa for the riser this means that an attempt to further reduce drfm lateral displacement and lower flex joint angle by increasing bcur above 2 5 would place the drfm in danger of failure thus the threshold condition for bc position of 100 m gives a feasible maximum lateral displacement of 12 82 m buoyancy can upthrust ratio of 2 5 lower flex joint angle of 1 7240 and von mises stress of 367 1 mpa 4 1 2 threshold condition for various bc positions in the event of an imminent threat of typhoon both the urgent evacuation for safety and leaving the drilling riser in a safe freestanding mode are of great concerns and should be achieved thus the analysis as described in subsection 4 1 1 was carried out for various bc positions of 150 200 250 and 300 m and in each case a corresponding threshold condition was established each of fig 6 9 illustrate the lateral displacement von mises stress and inclination angle along the drfm for each case of the bc positions the threshold conditions for all the cases are presented in table 3 the analysis results thus present the offshore personnel on site with a choice of for instance a 250 m riser length removal threshold condition or a 100 m riser length removal threshold condition depending on how urgent the situation is as the time required to remove a 250 m length could be at least twice of the 100 m length removal 4 1 3 analysis of the effect of buoyancy can this section presents the effect of bc diameter in the analysis of drfm first by ignoring the effect of bc diameter as shown in fig 10 a and fig 11 a bcur 2 7 that is buoyancy can upthrust is 2 7 times the weight of drfm gives a feasible maximum lateral deformation or displacement control of 10 92 m for the riser stress to be kept within the allowable limit in order to consider the effect of bc diameter bc size was determined as described in subsection 2 3 using the bcur 2 7 obtained for the case of ignoring bc effect taking the length to diameter l d ratio of bc in the range 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 and 5 0 l d 5 0 gives the least bending moment and von mises stress as shown in fig 12 a and fig 12 b respectively thus using the l d 5 0 the bc actual length and diameter were obtained as 34 73 m and 6 95 m figs 10 b and fig 11 b show the von mises stress and lateral displacement respectively for the drfm when the effect of bc diameter is taken into consideration there is a sharp increase in von mises stress at the bc bottom on the drfm due to a relatively large diameter of bc compared to the riser outer diameter moreover it was observed that the actual feasible drfm lateral displacement control that can be achieved is 12 82 m and the bcur 2 5 unlike the case of ignoring bc diameter effect which gives 10 92 m and a bcur of 2 7 while keeping the stress and lower flex joint angle within allowable limits 4 2 numerical simulation results numerical simulation was carried out to validate the theoretical results of the threshold conditions established for the survivability of drfm the drfm tensioned by bc was simulated with the riser properties and the environmental conditions as given in tables 1 and 2 respectively in abaqus software of the version dassault systemes abaqus 6 14 5 fig 13 conveys information that shows how current force is applied to drfm the reference points rp are synonymous to the nodal points in the discretization of drfm shown in fig 4 under theoretical method through the rp created the lateral current force is applied to drfm at those points the simulation results for all the bc positions are generated and compared with the theoretical results in section 4 3 but only the simulation images for a bc position of 300 m are presented in this section 4 2 1 lateral displacement of drilling riser freestanding mode fig 14 shows the whole length of the drilling riser drfm tensioned by the bc in undeformed state fig 15 is a contour plot which shows the lateral displacement of drfm from its original position undeformed state from the contour plot it can be seen that the top region of the drfm is the most deflected region this conforms to the theoretical results as well table 4 gives the comparison between the theoretical and simulation results for a bc position of 300 m the simulation result for drfm maximum lateral displacement is 6 35 m the simulation result value agrees well with the theoretical result of 6 44 m with a negligible error of 0 09 m and being exactly the same as the theoretical result when rounded off to one decimal place 4 2 2 von mises stress distribution the von mises stress distribution of drfm is given by contour plot of fig 16 there is a sharp increase in von mises stress at the bc bottom on the drfm due to a relatively large diameter of bc compared to the outer diameter of the drfm the maximum stress on the drfm occurs at this region this result is consistent with that observed for theoretical method table 4 gives the comparison between the theoretical and simulation results for a bc position of 300 m the simulated result for drfm maximum von mises stress value is 362 9 mpa a value of only 0 14 error from the theoretical value of 363 4 mpa 4 3 comparison between numerical results and simulation results the simulation result values of lateral displacement von mises stress and inclination angles of the drfm for each of the bc positions are extracted and compared with the theoretical results the comparison results of the threshold conditions maximum lateral displacement maximum von mises stress lower flex joint angle and bcur for bc position of 100 150 200 250 and 300 m are given in table 4 fig 17 and fig 18 show the comparison when the entire values rather than threshold condition values of a parameter are considered in each of the bc position case for all the parameters the error between the theoretical results and the numerical simulation results is less than 2 signifying a good consistency between the two methods hence the threshold conditions established for survivability of drfm are reliable 4 4 influence of various current loading and riser thicknesses on threshold condition 4 4 1 effect of current the effect of current loading was investigated with different surface current velocities 1 51 2 14 2 84 and 3 54 m s the variations obtained with drilling riser freestanding mode drfm lateral displacement von mises stress and inclination angle are shown in fig 19 a and b and 19 c respectively it can be concluded that with an increase in current surface velocity the lateral displacement and the lower flex joint angles of drfm increase significantly while the von mises stresses has a significant increase only at the region near the top of the drfm due to the bc diameter effect considering the case for a bc of 100 m an increase in current velocity from 2 14 to 2 84 m s significantly increases the threshold condition parameters lateral displacement from 12 82 to 23 08 m von mises stress from 367 1 to 394 4 mpa exceeding the allowable limit and lower flex joint angle from 1 724 to 3 0930 hence ascertaining the extreme current condition of a deepwater environment is very important in order to establish the threshold condition for the survivability of drfm 4 4 2 effect of riser thickness the effect of riser thickness has been investigated on the threshold condition of drfm and the results for a bc of 100 m are shown in fig 20 a and b and 20 c an increase in thickness from 15 875 to 19 844 mm decreases the threshold condition parameters lateral displacement from 12 82 to 10 81 m von mises stress from 367 1 to 345 9 mpa and lower flex joint angle from 1 724 to 1 4450 on the other hand a decrease in thickness from 15 875 to 11 906 mm increases the threshold condition parameters lateral displacement from 12 82 to 15 78 m von mises stress from 367 1 to 401 4 mpa and lower flex joint angle from 1 724 to 2 1360 it is thus concluded that while the increase in thickness poses no danger to survivability of drfm decrease in riser thickness does because the von mises stress exceeds the allowable limit 5 conclusions retrieving the whole length of deepwater drilling riser in the event of an imminent typhoon is not only tedious and time consuming but also has a huge risk of untimely evacuation of personnel and facilities for safety this paper analyzes the mechanical behavior of drilling riser freestanding mode drfm for its survivability under extreme sea current of typhoon condition the results obtained from the theoretical method have been validated with those predicted from the numerical simulation in abaqus 6 14 5 in the light of the observations made from this study the following conclusions can be drawn the buoyancy can bc diameter has a significant influence on the drfm behavior a sharp significant increase in von mises stress observed on the drfm at the bottom of bc as a result of relatively large bc diameter is identified as a potential region for drfm failure the survivability threshold condition for bc position of 100 m gives a feasible maximum lateral displacement of 12 82 m buoyancy can upthrust ratio of 2 5 lower flex joint angle of 1 7240 and von mises stress of 367 1 mpa a lateral displacement control which is lower than 12 82 m cannot be achieved by increasing the bcur however such a control can be made by increasing the riser thickness while the von mises stress and lower flex joint angles are still within acceptable limits selection of any bc position from 100 m is possible to ensure survivability of the drilling riser anticipated to be in freestanding mode provided that its threshold condition is adhered to accuracy of the threshold condition has been verified with numerical simulation in abaqus in each of the bc position case for all the parameters the error between the theoretical results and the numerical simulation results is less than 2 signifying a good consistency between the two methods credit authorship contribution statement fatai akorede abimbola conceptualization methodology software writing

21071,drag embedment plate anchors drag anchors play an important role in deepwater mooring systems of various offshore applications attributed mainly to their large capacity weight ratio however there are still challenges in accurately determining the trajectory and the final embedment position of the anchor in the seabed under the installation drag force especially when the seabed encounters

layered soils based on rational mechanical and analytical models the layered soils are composed of different cohesive and cohesionless layers with various soil strengths the effect of anchor lines in layered soils is coupled in analyzing the anchor behavior by fully describing the complicated soil resistance to the anchor at the interface of adjacent layers and in layered soils the theoretical model is able to analyze the anchor behavior in three layered soils with two interfaces covering general cases of layered soils for drag anchor installation comparative studies confirm the efficiency

deepwater mooring systems for various offshore applications however great challenges still exist in both installation and analyses for drag anchors due to their special installation way which depends on the anchor handling vessel ahv to provide and the installation line to transmit the drag force guiding the anchor to gradually penetrate into the target position in the seabed during this process the anchor may present comprehensive behaviors including keying pulling out and diving and resultantly form a long trajectory in the seabed attributed to the variety and complexity of seabed conditions it still remains a difficulty to accurately predict the whole trajectory even the final embedment position both depth and orientation of the anchor from both the engineering and academic aspects it is interesting and valuable to further study this challenging topic earlier studies focusing on the trajectory of drag anchors include experiments dunnavant and kwan 1993 neubecker and randolph 1994 1996a 1996b foxton 1997 dahlberg and strom 1999 o neill et al 1999 ruinen and degenkamp 1999a 1999b o neill and randolph 2001 aubeny et al 2010 liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 numerical modeling rowe and davis 1982 o neill et al 2003 zhao and liu 2016 2018 and theoretical methods compared to experimental and numerical methods the theoretical way is easy in usage quick to get results and least to cost and can be categorized generally as three kinds i e the plastic limit analysis bransby and o neill 1999 aubeny and chi 2010 2014 wang et al 2014 cong et al 2017 wu et al 2020 the limit equilibrium method stewart 1992 neubecker and randolph 1996b 1996c ruinen 2004 zhang et al 2015 peng and liu 2019 and the kinematic model liu 2012 liu et al 2012a 2013a recently the comprehensive behaviors of drag anchors in both clay and sand were systematically investigated by peng and liu 2019 although this method generally belongs to the limit equilibrium method the key in this method is that the comprehensive anchor behaviors were clearly classified as three kinds keying pulling out and diving by which the kinematic properties including the trajectory and the mechanical properties such as the bearing capacity of the anchor can be well analyzed however except very few ones the existing theoretical methods only solved the anchor trajectory in a single soil layer in other words these methods could not analyze the problem of layered soils relevant studies in layered soils are extremely rare based on the work in cohesive and cohesionless soils neubecker and randolph 1996a 1996b 1996c an analytical method was proposed by o neill et al 1999 to solve the trajectory of drag anchors in layered soils however this method is only applicable to a specific case of layered soils i e layered soils composed of two layers with the upper cohesive layer and the lower cohesionless layer centrifuge model tests were also conducted by o neill et al 1999 to investigate the trajectory of drag anchors in soils with two layers including the upper cohesive layer and the lower cohesionless layer the penetration of drag anchors in clay was theoretically studied by ruinen 2004 with the limit equilibrium method in which the effects of different shear strengths of cohesive layers were analyzed however there was no evidence to show that this study could deal with the complicated anchor behaviors at the interface of adjacent layers and in layered soils the review above indicates that there are sufficient studies on the behavior of drag anchors in a single soil layer while lacking seriously the studies in layered soils in the present work the earlier study by peng and liu 2019 on the behavior of drag anchors in a single soil layer is extended to layered soils with both cohesive and cohesionless layers the layered soils with arbitrary i layers i denotes the number of soil layers are composed of different cohesive and cohesionless layers with various soil strengths the effect of anchor lines in layered soils is coupled in analyzing the anchor behavior considering the anchor size and the soil layers generally in practice possible profiles of layered soils that the anchor penetrates the number of interfaces simultaneously including one or two interfaces are considered to construct the theoretical model in which the interface between adjacent layers is considered to be horizontal comparative studies are then performed to examine the efficiency and veracity of the developed model in analyzing the anchor behavior in layered soils finally being an application various cases are designed and investigated by the theoretical model to acquire further knowledge of the anchor behavior in layered soils 2 mechanical model the comprehensive behaviors of drag anchors including keying pulling out and diving were defined and analyzed by peng and liu 2019 in a single soil layer through the combination of these behaviors the anchor would present complicated performance in the seabed in this section these concepts are adopted to develop the mechanical model functioning as the basis of the theoretical model for analyzing the anchor behavior in layered soils 2 1 forces on the anchor the mechanical model for the three kinds of behaviors of drag anchors is illustrated in fig 1 fig 1 a presents the mechanical model for

according to the force equilibrium in fig 1 the drag force t a under diving of the anchor can be obtained as 1 1 t a 1 cos θ a θ m f b f s w sin θ o θ m the drag force t a under pulling out of the anchor can be obtained as 1 2 t a 1 cos θ a θ m p f b f s w sin θ o θ m p the drag force t a under keying of the anchor can be obtained by taking the moment of forces to the fluke rear expressed by 1 3 t a 1 l c sin θ a m b m s m w the anchor line is a key factor that influences the anchor behavior in layered soils while only the study by liu et al 2019 can efficiently solve the anchor line behavior in layered soils the work by liu et al 2019 is also suitable for complex calculations such as the iterative calculation in layered soils with the anchor line equation in layered soils with i layers liu et al 2019 the effects of the anchor line can be accommodated into the theoretical model that is 2 1 t l i e μ i θ l i sin 2 θ i sin 2 θ u i 2 z u i z i q i d z where the subscript u

appendix 3 analytical procedure according to the work by peng and liu 2019 the behaviors of drag anchors in the seabed are classified as three kinds including diving pulling out and keying and the least force principle is employed to determine the real movement state of the anchor this principle is stated as the real movement state of the anchor is always the state that needs the least drag force to overcome the soil resistance the least force principle has been successfully applied in earlier studies on different behaviors of deepwater anchors liu et al 2012b 2013b 2015 peng et al 2016 in the present work the least force principle is also employed to analyze the behaviors of drag anchors in layered soils before analyzing the three kinds of behaviors several key parameters including θ m θ m p and l k need to be determined in advance based on the least force principle the real movement direction the real direction of pulling out and the real rotational center of the anchor can be obtained by utilizing eq 1 and investigating the first derivatives of t a with θ m θ m p and l k respectively the real movement state of the anchor can then be obtained with determination of the minimum values of t a corresponding to the three kinds of behaviors the corresponding minimum values of t a can be obtained at several special points as listed in table 1 for drag anchors in layered soils the anchor behaviors can be analyzed and the anchor trajectory can be solved following the steps below a determine the actual position of the anchor in layered soils b express eq 1 in detail including the forces and moments c according to table 1 analyze the first derivatives corresponding to diving pulling out and keying respectively and obtain types 2 and 3 of the special points d according to eq 1 obtain t a m i n the minimum value of t a through calculating and comparing the values of t a corresponding to the three behaviors at types 1 3 of the special points then the real movement state corresponding to t a m i n can be obtained e update the position of the anchor with corresponding increments of distance and angle which adopt l f 50 and θ s 300 respectively in the present study according to eq 2 which is the equation for the anchor line in layered soils update the angle θ a h f repeat the steps a e to advance the anchor in layered soils once the anchor reaches the pre set embedment depth in the seabed end the procedure and extract the anchor trajectory in layered soils 4 comparative studies the present section is designed to examine the theoretical model and corresponding analytical procedure above at first the drag anchor embedded in layered soils of three layers composed only cohesive or cohesionless soils is analyzed to perform a degenerative study then the comparative study in a single soil layer of either cohesive or cohesionless soils is performed with model tests finally the comparative study in layered soils is carried out with centrifuge tests to examine the performance of the present model in layered soils 4 1 degenerative study two cases of cohesive or cohesionless soils with three layers of uniformly varied strengths are designed and analyzed labeled by c c c and s s s in which c and s denote the cohesive and cohesionless layers respectively the corresponding degenerated cases are labeled by c single and s single denoting the cohesive and cohesionless soils with a single layer respectively theoretically the analytical results of c c c and s s s are identical to those of c single and s single respectively the anchor adopted in the degenerative study is from the case study by murff et al 2005 the relevant anchor and calculation parameters are collected in table 2 in which the values of s u α and θ e are obtained from the work of murff et al 2005 the value of μ c is obtained with the suggestion of veritas 2000 the value of n c is determined with the formulas of liu et al 2018 the values of n q n q l δ δ l and k are obtained from the work of zhang 2011 and zhang et al 2014 and the values of γ s and b are determined based on the relevant studies murff et al 2005 liu et al 2012b peng and liu 2019 on the basis of the studies by liu et al 2019 and considering the situation that the anchor penetrates two interfaces of three adjacent layers simultaneously the thickness ratio of soil layers t 2 t 1 is determined as 0 5 3 in which t 1 is 3m i e 2 l f the degenerative results are illustrated in fig 4 which demonstrates that the cases of c c c and s s s can be perfectly degenerated to the corresponding single layer cases i e c single and s single respectively 4 2 comparative study in a single soil layer 4 2 1 comparison with model tests by o neill and randolph 2001 in cohesive soils this study is designed to examine the validity of the present model in a degenerate way for predicting the anchor trajectories in layered cohesive soils centrifuge model tests were conducted by o neill and randolph 2001 to study the anchor trajectories in cohesive soils and the scale to the prototype of anchors was 1 160 the anchor was initially embedded at the soil depth of 1 984m the relevant anchor and calculation parameters are collected in table 3 in which the values of n c s u θ e and b are obtained from the work of o neill and randolph 2001 and the value of α is obtained from the work of murff et al 2005 fig 5 illustrates the comparative results in which the incremental simulation results by o neill and randolph 2001 are also provided it is observed from fig 5 that there is a good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the test results for the cases of α 0 3 with the mean relative errors of 5 6 for θ s 32 and 6 1 for θ s 50 it is also noticed that for the case of θ s 50 and α 0 5 the theoretical prediction agrees well with the incremental simulation result 4 2 2 comparison with model tests by zhang 2011 in cohesionless soils this study is designed to examine the validity of the present model in a degenerate way for predicting the anchor trajectories in layered cohesionless soils model tests in cohesionless soils were conducted by zhang 2011 and the trajectories of drag anchors were captured the model anchors used in the tests included the anchors with rectangular and wedge shaped fluke sections the relevant anchor and calculation parameters are collected in table 4 in which the values of n q n q l δ δ l k γ b and θ e are all obtained from the work of zhang 2011 and zhang et al 2014 fig 6 illustrates the comparative results as observed from fig 6 the predictions from the present model agree well with the test results for the anchors with a rectangular fluke section the mean relative errors are 9 9 for θ s 29 5 and 6 2 for θ s 33 3 for the anchors with a wedge shaped fluke section the mean relative errors are 6 9 for θ s 27 8 and 5 2 for θ s 32 2 4 3 comparative study in layered soils the trajectories of drag anchors in layered soils were studied with centrifuge model tests by o neill et al 1999 the layered soils in the tests were composed of two layers i e the upper cohesive layer and the lower cohesionless layer the scale of the model anchor to the prototype is 1 160 the relevant anchor and calculation parameters are collected in table 5 in which the values of n c s u δ γ c γ s b θ e and t 1 are obtained from the work of o neill et al 1999 the value of μ c is obtained with the suggestion of veritas 2000 and the values of α k n q n q l and δ l are obtained from the work of zhang 2011 zhang et al 2014 and peng and liu 2019 fig 7 illustrates the comparative results as observed in fig 7 the comparison between theoretical predictions and test results is generally good for the shackle and the fluke tip in test 1 the mean relative errors of the whole trajectory are 13 7 and 10 9 respectively for the shackle and the fluke tip in test 2 the mean relative errors of the whole trajectory are 5 7 and 15 4 respectively the difference is notable between the trajectories from the prediction and the test especially for the fluke tip despite the possible measurement error the major reason causing the difference may be that the values of the input parameters including μ c α k n q n q l and δ l are not accurately determined 5 applications as stated in the earlier section the behavior of drag anchors in layered soils is more complicated than that in a single soil layer earlier studies focused on the anchor behavior in a single soil layer while the knowledge of the anchor behavior in layered soils is seriously insufficient especially for the layered soils with both cohesive and cohesionless layers hence this section is specifically designed to further explore the anchor behavior in layered soils by applying the present theoretical model 5 1 conditions for applications in the present study the most complex combinations of soil layers are taken as representatives i e soils with cohesive and cohesionless layers alternately presented three soil layers are assumed including both c s c and s c s as defined in section 4 1 the anchor used in the present study is consistent with that in section 4 1 whose parameters can be found in table 2 different possible cases for c s c and s c s are designed and presented in tables 6 and 7 for c s c case 1 represents the case that the anchor fails to completely penetrate through the first soil layer case 2 represents the case that the anchor fails to completely penetrate through the second soil layer and case 3 represents the case that the anchor completely penetrates through the whole three soil layers for s c s case 1 represents the case that the anchor fails to completely penetrate through the second soil layer and case 2 represents the case that the anchor completely penetrates through the whole three soil layers the values of parameters in tables 6 and 7 are determined based on the literature review in which t 2 t 1 denotes the thickness ratio of soil layers and γ s γ c denotes the submerged soil weight ratio of the cohesionless layer to the cohesive layer based on relevant studies hossain and randolph 2009 liu et al 2012b tho et al 2014 the values of γ s γ c and k are obtained as 0 39 1 57 and 1 2 kpa m respectively according to relevant studies houlsby and byrne 2005 murff et al 2005 peng and liu 2019 the ranges of α and b are 0 2 0 8 and 0 03 0 07m respectively the range of δ is 15 35 according to the studies kulhawy et al 1983 api 2002 lehane et al 2005 the range of μ c is 0 1 0 8 according to the studies neubecker and randolph 1995 veritas 2000 zhang et al 2014 based on the studies by liu et al 2019 and considering the case that the anchor penetrates two interfaces of three adjacent layers at the same time the value of t 2 t 1 is determined and varies in the range 0 5 3 1 3 in which t 1 is 3m i e 2 l f based on relevant studies grote 1993 thorne 1998 o neill et al 2003 andersen et al 2008 peng and liu 2019 n c 7 6 11 87 n q 5 40 and k 0 8 2 hence considering the situations of cases 1 3 to present the values of different parameters are determined i e the average values of the corresponding investigated ranges as listed in tables 6 and 7 5 2 results and discussion utilizing the present model the anchor trajectories corresponding to different cases of c s c and s c s are analyzed and presented in figs 8 and 9 respectively in which x t i p and z t i p denote the horizontal displacement and the embedment depth of the fluke tip respectively as observed from figs 8 and 9 given different values of parameters the anchor would present three kinds of trajectories in c s c and two kinds of trajectories in s c s in c s c key parameters that influence the anchor penetration are n c n q and k in general with increasing value of n c and decreasing values of n q and k the anchor tends to penetrate into the soil from the first layer to the third layer this phenomenon reflects the effect of soil resistance to the anchor penetration and smooth variation of soil resistance in adjacent cohesive and cohesionless layers is beneficial for the anchor penetration in layered soils in s c s the parameters that influence the anchor penetration are n c n q k and t 2 t 1 in general with increasing value of n c and decreasing values of n q k and t 2 t 1 the anchor tends to penetrate through the whole three soil layers specifically if the value of t 2 t 1 decreases the variation of soil resistance becomes smaller between cohesive and cohesionless layers this is helpful to the anchor penetration basically the effect of soil resistance in s c s on the anchor trajectory corresponds with that in c s c the present study indicates that in the layered soils of both c s c and s c s the anchor may penetrate through the whole layers or fail to completely penetrate the soil layer but move along the interface of adjacent layers what would happen depends basically on the soil resistance to the anchor in adjacent soil layers which reflects the anchor soil interaction and is primarily described by the total end bearing and the total shear force of the anchor in the present model generally the anchor is able to penetrate through the interface from stiffer soil to softer soil such as the cases in s c s from sand to clay and case 3 in c s c from sand to clay while the anchor will probably fail to penetrate through the interface from softer soil to stiffer soil but move along the interface such as cases 1 and 2 in c s c from clay to sand and case 1 in s c s from clay to sand however if the variation of soil resistance to the anchor in adjacent layers is smooth enough the anchor may penetrate through the interface from softer soil to stiffer soil like case 3 in c s c from clay to sand and case 2 in s c s from clay to sand although a qualitative knowledge can be obtained from the present study for a specific problem in layered soils a quantitative study needs to be performed by utilizing the developed theoretical model to capture the whole trajectory of the anchor in layered soils 6 concluding remarks in the present work a theoretical model is developed for drag anchors that is capable of analyzing the anchor behavior in layered soils by fully describing the complicated soil resistance to the anchor at the interface of adjacent layers and in layered soils the present model is able to analyze the anchor behavior simultaneously in three layered soils with two interfaces covering general cases of layered soils for drag anchor installation comparative studies confirm the efficiency and veracity of the theoretical model utilizing the present model various cases are designed and analyzed in order to acquire further knowledge of the anchor behavior in layered soils a general knowledge can be obtained from the application study i e in the layered soils of both c s c and s c s the anchor may penetrate through the whole layers or fail to completely penetrate the soil layer but move along the interface of adjacent layers usually the anchor is able to penetrate through the interface from stiffer soil to softer soil while the anchor will probably fail to penetrate through the interface from softer soil to stiffer soil but only move along the interface if the variation of soil resistance to the anchor in adjacent layers is smooth enough the anchor may penetrate through the interface from softer soil to stiffer soil the present study explores the complexity and variety of the anchor behavior in layered soils actually the soil resistance to the anchor at the interface of adjacent layers and in layered soils is the fundamental factor that determines the anchor behavior which is influenced by many parameters such as n c n q k and t 2 t 1 and needs to be calculated correctly to obtain quantitative results such as the anchor trajectory for a specific problem in layered soils a detailed rational analysis is expected which can be implemented through the

21071,drag embedment plate anchors drag anchors play an important role in deepwater mooring systems of various offshore applications attributed mainly to their large capacity weight ratio however there are still challenges in accurately determining the trajectory and the final embedment position of the anchor in the seabed under the installation drag force especially when the seabed encounters

deepwater mooring systems for various offshore applications however great challenges still exist in both installation and analyses for drag anchors due to their special installation way which depends on the anchor handling vessel ahv to provide and the installation line to transmit the drag force guiding the anchor to gradually penetrate into the target position in the seabed during this process the anchor may present comprehensive behaviors including keying pulling out and diving and resultantly form a long trajectory in the seabed attributed to the variety and complexity of seabed conditions it still remains a difficulty to accurately predict the whole trajectory even the final embedment position both depth and orientation of the anchor from both the engineering and academic aspects it is interesting and valuable to further study this challenging topic earlier studies focusing on the trajectory of drag anchors include experiments dunnavant and kwan 1993 neubecker and randolph 1994 1996a 1996b foxton 1997 dahlberg and strom 1999 o neill et al 1999 ruinen and degenkamp 1999a 1999b o neill and randolph 2001 aubeny et al 2010 liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 numerical modeling rowe and davis 1982 o neill et al 2003 zhao and liu 2016 2018 and theoretical methods compared to experimental and numerical methods the theoretical way is easy in usage quick to get results and least to cost and can be categorized generally as three kinds i e the plastic limit analysis bransby and o neill 1999 aubeny and chi 2010 2014 wang et al 2014 cong et al 2017 wu et al 2020 the limit equilibrium method stewart 1992 neubecker and randolph 1996b 1996c ruinen 2004 zhang et al 2015 peng and liu 2019 and the kinematic model liu 2012 liu et al 2012a 2013a recently the comprehensive behaviors of drag anchors in both clay and sand were systematically investigated by peng and liu 2019 although this method generally belongs to the limit equilibrium method the key in this method is that the comprehensive anchor behaviors were clearly classified as three kinds keying pulling out and diving by which the kinematic properties including the trajectory and the mechanical properties such as the bearing capacity of the anchor can be well analyzed however except very few ones the existing theoretical methods only solved the anchor trajectory in a single soil layer in other words these methods could not analyze the problem of layered soils relevant studies in layered soils are extremely rare based on the work in cohesive and cohesionless soils neubecker and randolph 1996a 1996b 1996c an analytical method was proposed by o neill et al 1999 to solve the trajectory of drag anchors in layered soils however this method is only applicable to a specific case of layered soils i e layered soils composed of two layers with the upper cohesive layer and the lower cohesionless layer centrifuge model tests were also conducted by o neill et al 1999 to investigate the trajectory of drag anchors in soils with two layers including the upper cohesive layer and the lower cohesionless layer the penetration of drag anchors in clay was theoretically studied by ruinen 2004 with the limit equilibrium method in which the effects of different shear strengths of cohesive layers were analyzed however there was no evidence to show that this study could deal with the complicated anchor behaviors at the interface of adjacent layers and in layered soils the review above indicates that there are sufficient studies on the behavior of drag anchors in a single soil layer while lacking seriously the studies in layered soils in the present work the earlier study by peng and liu 2019 on the behavior of drag anchors in a single soil layer is extended to layered soils with both cohesive and cohesionless layers the layered soils with arbitrary i layers i denotes the number of soil layers are composed of different cohesive and cohesionless layers with various soil strengths the effect of anchor lines in layered soils is coupled in analyzing the anchor behavior considering the anchor size and the soil layers generally in practice possible profiles of layered soils that the anchor penetrates the number of interfaces simultaneously including one or two interfaces are considered to construct the theoretical model in which the interface between adjacent layers is considered to be horizontal comparative studies are then performed to examine the efficiency and veracity of the developed model in analyzing the anchor behavior in layered soils finally being an application various cases are designed and investigated by the theoretical model to acquire further knowledge of the anchor behavior in layered soils 2 mechanical model the comprehensive behaviors of drag anchors including keying pulling out and diving were defined and analyzed by peng and liu 2019 in a single soil layer through the combination of these behaviors the anchor would present complicated performance in the seabed in this section these concepts are adopted to develop the mechanical model functioning as the basis of the theoretical model for analyzing the anchor behavior in layered soils 2 1 forces on the anchor the mechanical model for the three kinds of behaviors of drag anchors is illustrated in fig 1 fig 1 a presents the mechanical model for

according to the force equilibrium in fig 1 the drag force t a under diving of the anchor can be obtained as 1 1 t a 1 cos θ a θ m f b f s w sin θ o θ m the drag force t a under pulling out of the anchor can be obtained as 1 2 t a 1 cos θ a θ m p f b f s w sin θ o θ m p the drag force t a under keying of the anchor can be obtained by taking the moment of forces to the fluke rear expressed by 1 3 t a 1 l c sin θ a m b m s m w the anchor line is a key factor that influences the anchor behavior in layered soils while only the study by liu et al 2019 can efficiently solve the anchor line behavior in layered soils the work by liu et al 2019 is also suitable for complex calculations such as the iterative calculation in layered soils with the anchor line equation in layered soils with i

appendix 3 analytical procedure according to the work by peng and liu 2019 the behaviors of drag anchors in the seabed are classified as three kinds including diving pulling out and keying and the least force principle is employed to determine the real movement state of the anchor this principle is stated as the real movement state of the anchor is always the state that needs the least drag force to overcome the soil resistance the least force principle has been successfully applied in earlier studies on different behaviors of deepwater anchors liu et al 2012b 2013b 2015 peng et al 2016 in the present work the least force principle is also employed to analyze the behaviors of drag anchors in layered soils before analyzing the three kinds of behaviors several key parameters including θ m θ m p and l k need to be determined in advance based on the least force principle the real movement direction the real direction of pulling out and the real rotational center of the anchor can be obtained by utilizing eq 1 and investigating the first derivatives of t a with θ m θ m p and l k respectively the real movement state of the anchor can then be obtained with determination of the minimum values of t a corresponding to the three kinds of behaviors the corresponding minimum values of t a can be obtained at several special points as listed in table 1 for drag anchors in layered soils the anchor behaviors can be analyzed and the anchor trajectory can be solved following the steps below a determine the actual position of the anchor in layered soils b express eq 1 in detail including the forces and moments c according to table 1 analyze the first derivatives corresponding to diving pulling out and keying respectively and obtain types 2 and 3 of the special points d according to eq 1 obtain t a m i n the minimum value of t a through calculating and comparing the values of t a corresponding to the three behaviors at types 1 3 of the special points then the real movement state corresponding to t a m i n can be obtained e update the position of the anchor with corresponding increments of distance and angle which adopt l f 50 and θ s 300 respectively in the present study according to eq 2 which is the equation for the anchor line in layered soils update the angle θ a h f repeat the steps a e to advance the anchor in layered soils once the anchor reaches the pre set embedment depth in the seabed end the procedure and extract the anchor trajectory in layered soils 4 comparative studies the present section is designed to examine the theoretical model and corresponding analytical procedure above at first the drag anchor embedded in layered soils of three layers composed only cohesive or cohesionless soils is analyzed to perform a degenerative study then the comparative study in a single soil layer of either cohesive or cohesionless soils is performed with model tests finally the comparative study in layered soils is carried out with centrifuge tests to examine the performance of the present model in layered soils 4 1 degenerative study two cases of cohesive or cohesionless soils with three layers of uniformly varied strengths are designed and analyzed labeled by c c c and s s s in which c and s denote the cohesive and cohesionless layers respectively the corresponding degenerated cases are labeled by c single and s single denoting the cohesive and cohesionless soils with a single layer respectively theoretically the analytical results of c c c and s s s are identical to those of c single and s single respectively the anchor adopted in the degenerative study is from the case study by murff et al 2005 the relevant anchor and calculation parameters are collected in table 2 in which the values of s u α and θ e are obtained from the work of murff et al 2005 the value of μ c is obtained with the suggestion of veritas 2000 the value of n c is determined with the formulas of liu et al 2018 the values of n q n q l δ δ l and k are obtained from the work of zhang 2011 and zhang et al 2014 and the values of γ s and b are determined based on the relevant studies murff et al 2005 liu et al 2012b peng and liu 2019 on the basis of the studies by liu et al 2019 and considering the situation that the anchor penetrates two interfaces of three adjacent layers simultaneously the thickness ratio of soil layers t 2 t 1 is determined as 0 5 3 in which t 1 is 3m i e 2 l f the degenerative results are illustrated in fig 4 which demonstrates that the cases of c c c and s s s can be perfectly degenerated to the corresponding single layer cases i e c single and s single respectively 4 2 comparative study in a single soil layer 4 2 1 comparison with model tests by o neill and randolph 2001 in cohesive soils this study is designed to examine the validity of the present model in a degenerate way for predicting the anchor trajectories in layered cohesive soils centrifuge model tests were conducted by o neill and randolph 2001 to study the anchor trajectories in cohesive soils and the scale to the prototype of anchors was 1 160 the anchor was initially embedded at the soil depth of 1 984m the relevant anchor and calculation parameters are collected in table 3 in which the values of n c s u θ e and b are obtained from the work of o neill and randolph 2001 and the value of α is obtained from the work of murff et al 2005 fig 5 illustrates the comparative results in which the incremental simulation results by o neill and randolph 2001 are also provided it is observed from fig 5 that there is a good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the test results for the cases of α 0 3 with the mean relative errors of 5 6 for θ s 32 and 6 1 for θ s 50 it is also noticed that for the case of θ s 50 and α 0 5 the theoretical prediction agrees well with the incremental simulation result 4 2 2 comparison with model tests by zhang 2011 in cohesionless soils this study is designed to examine the validity of the present model in a degenerate way for predicting the anchor trajectories in layered cohesionless soils model tests in cohesionless soils were conducted by zhang 2011 and the trajectories of drag anchors were captured the model anchors used in the tests included the anchors with rectangular and wedge shaped fluke sections the relevant anchor and calculation parameters are collected in table 4 in which the values of n q n q l δ δ l k γ b and θ e are all obtained from the work of zhang 2011 and zhang et al 2014 fig 6 illustrates the comparative results as observed from fig 6 the predictions from the present model agree well with the test results for the anchors with a rectangular fluke section the mean relative errors are 9 9 for θ s 29 5 and 6 2 for θ s 33 3 for the anchors with a wedge shaped fluke section the mean relative errors are 6 9 for θ s 27 8 and 5 2 for θ s 32 2 4 3 comparative study in layered soils the trajectories of drag anchors in layered soils were studied with centrifuge model tests by o neill et al 1999 the layered soils in the tests were composed of two layers i e the upper cohesive layer and the lower cohesionless layer the scale of the model anchor to the prototype is 1 160 the relevant anchor and calculation parameters are collected in table 5 in which the values of n c s u δ γ c γ s b θ e and t 1 are obtained from the work of o neill et al 1999 the value of μ c is obtained with the suggestion of veritas 2000 and the values of α k n q n q l and δ l are obtained from the work of zhang 2011 zhang et al 2014 and peng and liu 2019 fig 7 illustrates the comparative results as observed in fig 7 the comparison between theoretical predictions and test results is generally good for the shackle and the fluke tip in test 1 the mean relative errors of the whole trajectory are 13 7 and 10 9 respectively for the shackle and the fluke tip in test 2 the mean relative errors of the whole trajectory are 5 7 and 15 4 respectively the difference is notable between the trajectories from the prediction and the test especially for the fluke tip despite the possible measurement error the major reason causing the difference may be that the values of the input parameters including μ c α k n q n q l and δ l are not accurately determined 5 applications as stated in the earlier section the behavior of drag anchors in layered soils is more complicated than that in a single soil layer earlier studies focused on the anchor behavior in a single soil layer while the knowledge of the anchor behavior in layered soils is seriously insufficient especially for the layered soils with both cohesive and cohesionless layers hence this section is specifically designed to further explore the anchor behavior in layered soils by applying the present theoretical model 5 1 conditions for applications in the present study the most complex combinations of soil layers are taken as representatives i e soils with cohesive and cohesionless layers alternately presented three soil layers are assumed including both c s c and s c s as defined in section 4 1 the anchor used in the present study is consistent with that in section 4 1 whose parameters can be found in table 2 different possible cases for c s c and s c s are designed and presented in tables 6 and 7 for c s c case 1 represents the case that the anchor fails to completely penetrate through the first soil layer case 2 represents the case that the anchor fails to completely penetrate through the second soil layer and case 3 represents the case that the anchor completely penetrates through the whole three soil layers for s c s case 1 represents the case that the anchor fails to completely penetrate through the second soil layer and case 2 represents the case that the anchor completely penetrates through the whole three soil layers the values of parameters in tables 6 and 7 are determined based on the literature review in which t 2 t 1 denotes the thickness ratio of soil layers and γ s γ c denotes the submerged soil weight ratio of the cohesionless layer to the cohesive layer based on relevant studies hossain and randolph 2009 liu et al 2012b tho et al 2014 the values of γ s γ c and k are obtained as 0 39 1 57 and 1 2 kpa m respectively according to relevant studies houlsby and byrne 2005 murff et al 2005 peng and liu 2019 the ranges of α and b are 0 2 0 8 and 0 03 0 07m respectively the range of δ is 15 35 according to the studies kulhawy et al 1983 api 2002 lehane et al 2005 the range of μ c is 0 1 0 8 according to the studies neubecker and randolph 1995 veritas 2000 zhang et al 2014 based on the studies by liu et al 2019 and considering the case that the anchor penetrates two interfaces of three adjacent layers at the same time the value of t 2 t 1 is determined and varies in the range 0 5 3 1 3 in which t 1 is 3m i e 2 l f based on relevant studies grote 1993 thorne 1998 o neill et al 2003 andersen et al 2008 peng and liu 2019 n c 7 6 11 87 n q 5 40 and k 0 8 2 hence considering the situations of cases 1 3 to present the values of different parameters are determined i e the average values of the corresponding investigated ranges as listed in tables 6 and 7 5 2 results and discussion utilizing the present model the anchor trajectories corresponding to different cases of c s c and s c s are analyzed and presented in figs 8 and 9 respectively in which x t i p and z t i p denote the horizontal displacement and the embedment depth of the fluke tip respectively as observed from figs 8 and 9 given different values of parameters the anchor would present three kinds of trajectories in c s c and two kinds of trajectories in s c s in c s c key parameters that influence the anchor penetration are n c n q and k in general with increasing value of n c and decreasing values of n q and k the anchor tends to penetrate into the soil from the first layer to the third layer this phenomenon reflects the effect of soil resistance to the anchor penetration and smooth variation of soil resistance in adjacent cohesive and cohesionless layers is beneficial for the anchor penetration in layered soils in s c s the parameters that influence the anchor penetration are n c n q k and t 2 t 1 in general with increasing value of n c and decreasing values of n q k and t 2 t 1 the anchor tends to penetrate through the whole three soil layers specifically if the value of t 2 t 1 decreases the variation of soil resistance becomes smaller between cohesive and cohesionless layers this is helpful to the anchor penetration basically the effect of soil resistance in s c s on the anchor trajectory corresponds with that in c s c the present study indicates that in the layered soils of both c s c and s c s the anchor may penetrate through the whole layers or fail to completely penetrate the soil layer but move along the interface of adjacent layers what would happen depends basically on the soil resistance to the anchor in adjacent soil layers which reflects the anchor soil interaction and is primarily described by the total end bearing and the total shear force of the anchor in the present model generally the anchor is able to penetrate through the interface from stiffer soil to softer soil such as the cases in s c s from sand to clay and case 3 in c s c from sand to clay while the anchor will probably fail to penetrate through the interface from softer soil to stiffer soil but move along the interface such as cases 1 and 2 in c s c from clay to sand and case 1 in s c s from clay to sand however if the variation of soil resistance to the anchor in adjacent layers is smooth enough the anchor may penetrate through the interface from softer soil to stiffer soil like case 3 in c s c from clay to sand and case 2 in s c s from clay to sand although a qualitative knowledge can be obtained from the present study for a specific problem in layered soils a quantitative study needs to be performed by utilizing the developed theoretical model to capture the whole trajectory of the anchor in layered soils 6 concluding remarks in the present work a theoretical model is developed for drag anchors that is capable of analyzing the anchor behavior in layered soils by fully describing the complicated soil resistance to the anchor at the interface of adjacent layers and in layered soils the present model is able to analyze the anchor behavior simultaneously in three layered soils with two interfaces covering general cases of layered soils for drag anchor installation comparative studies confirm the efficiency and veracity of the theoretical model utilizing the present model various cases are designed and analyzed in order to acquire further knowledge of the anchor behavior in layered soils a general knowledge can be obtained from the application study i e in the layered soils of both c s c and s c s the anchor may penetrate through the whole layers or fail to completely penetrate the soil layer but move along the interface of adjacent layers usually the anchor is able to penetrate through the interface from stiffer soil to softer soil while the anchor will probably fail to penetrate through the interface from softer soil to stiffer soil but only move along the interface if the variation of soil resistance to the anchor in adjacent layers is smooth enough the anchor may penetrate through the interface from softer soil to stiffer soil the present study explores the complexity and variety of the anchor behavior in layered soils actually the soil resistance to the anchor at the interface of adjacent layers and in layered soils is the fundamental factor that determines the anchor behavior which is influenced by many parameters such as n c n q k and t 2 t 1 and needs to be calculated correctly to obtain quantitative results such as the anchor trajectory for a specific problem in layered soils a detailed rational analysis is expected which can be implemented through the

experiments are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the system and the effectiveness of the numerical model a circular motion in irregular waves is studied at the end and the issues of the system are discussed accordingly keywords multiple linked ship towing system triangular tension leg platform course stability seakeeping theory maneuvering theory simmechanics 1 introduction the oceans are huge energy reservoir and many countries have launched their national marine power projects for decarbonization pelc and fujita 2002 khan et al 2017 melikoglu 2018 nguyen and dong 2019 although today most of the marine power projects are very near from the shore the huge potential of the oceans may bring marine power further into the sea in a near future lehmann et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 park and kim 2016 such deep ocean development would lead to increasingly wide deployment of offshore platforms tlps which are a kind of compliant type offshore platform generally used for offshore oil and gas industry and wind turbines natvig et al 1995 kausche et al 2018 would be extensively applied in future usually four legged tlps are used owing to their well established design and evaluation technologies in oder to reduce the cost a three legged triangular tlp was proposed and studied in chandrasekaran and jain 2002a 2002b it is reported that the three legged triangular tlp would not require complicated devices and the foundation could be placed with larger tolerances without affecting tether behavior significant savings would be obtained in main steel for both hull and deck due to fewer main element intersections and effective force distributions recently use of triangular tlps has also been proposed for developing offshore overhead power transmission system fopts hu et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 in general transportation of a tlp is associated with the use of heavy transport vessels which are high cost and their availability is limited to reduce the transportation and installation cost an approach consists of a towing process and a settling process has been proposed for a submerged triangular tlp hu et al 2020 and the overview of the towing system is shown in fig 1 the vehicle at the front of the system is applied for maneuvering the system and the vehicle at the rear side is for preventing the bodies from collision the gravity anchor is designed with build in air tanks so that it can float on the water surface during the towing process when the system is towed to the installation site water could then be poured into the air tanks to settle the anchor down to the seabed by the approach the tendons could be installed to the platform and anchor in advance at the port harbor so that the complexity of the installation would be reduced to study the multiple linked towing system in practical sea conditions maneuvering model considering the seakeeping problem is required currently two distinctive methods have been investigated to model the hydrodynamics on a maneuvering vessel in a seaway perez and fossen 2007 bailey et al 2002 fossen 2005 subramanian and beck 2015 utilize the linear convolution integral formulation cummins 1962 to account for the unsteady wave memory effects on the vessel the retardation function in the convolution integral formulation is calculated based on three dimensional potential theory so that the hydrodynamic coefficients would be of high accuracy the method is applicable for multi body system as the hydrodynamic interaction would also be estimated however the wave induced motion as reported in skejic and faltinsen 2006 would have erroneous influence on the maneuvering calculation on the other hand sutulo and soares 2006 skejic and faltinsen 2008 wicaksono and kashiwagi 2019 analyze a maneuvering ship in regular waves by performing the seakeeping and maneuvering calculations in two different time scales the maneuvering problem is solved in a constant time interval whereas the seakeeping is solved when the variation of the mean heading angle goes over some prefixed value two dimensional potential flow strip theory is used for the seakeeping calculation so that the method is applicable for slender bodies such as ships for the towing system with multiple triangular bodies in irregular waves the method would be computationally expensive and the accuracy would be insufficient in this paper a unified maneuvering and seakeeping method utilizing the advantages of the aforementioned two methods is proposed linear integral formulation is applied to account for the seakeeping problem so that the hydrodynamic interaction of the bodies could be incorporated in the analysis besides like to the concept of the two time scale method that the maneuvering is supposed to be in lower frequency region than the wave induced motion a low pass filter is applied to separate the slowly and fast velocity components for the maneuvering and seakeeping calculations by the method the maneuvering and seakeeping problems can be solved simultaneously with a same time scale and the towing system would become analyzable in addition in order to increase the accuracy of the numerical model the damping coefficients are tuned based on model test results the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the structural aspects and the properties of the towing system are firstly introduced then the numerical model and the identification method for the damping coefficients are presented after that experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the numerical model finally a circular motion under irregular waves is studied 2 structural aspects towing system for the triangular tlp proposed for fopts in hu et al 2020 is studied and the schematic view of the anchor and the platform with tower is shown in fig 2 the platform is of triangular shape with three cylindrical pontoons on the sides a lattice tower which is installed directly on the platform is applied to support power transmission lines the anchor is a gravity anchor consists of three square cylinder with built in air tanks the properties of the bodies are given in table 1 and table 2 the tlp is a submerged tlp and the platform can be self stabilized during the transportation owing to the large water plane area in order to reduce the sway and yaw motion each body is connected by towropes at its three vertices the towing points are set on the deck above the water surface for the convenience of towrope installation and removal as the tendons of the tlp are expected to be installed on the platform and anchor at port harbor before the transportation the space interval between the bodies is limited by the length of the tendons in this study the space interval is properly set as 22 m by considering the tendon length and course stability performance synthetic fiber ropes are applied as the towropes as they are more water resistant than most natural fiber ropes the towing process is expected to be performed under calm moderate sea states with a forward speed of 2 m s as the froude number is moderate say f n 0 16 the towed bodies can be classified as displacement vessels and potential theory could be applicable for computing the hydrodynamic coefficients of the bodies fossen 2011 3 mathematical model motion of the towed bodies are in six dofs and coupled with each other and therefore the mechanics are very complicated in ocean environment as the towing process would be carried out in calm moderate sea states and the froude number is moderate the following assumptions are given in this study each body is rigid hydrodynamic forces acting on the bodies are quasi steady lateral velocity component is small compared with the longitudinal velocity component for each body variation of the relative position between the bodies is small so that their hydrodynamic coupling effects are the same as their initial state the wave making effect is neglected we also assume that the forward speed is regulated as constant by the front towing vehicle in addition owing to the fact that the course stability performance of the towing system can be maintained which will be shown in section 5 the platform and anchor would be towed along the desired path without the control of rear vehicle therefore the rear vehicle is represented by a drag force f as shown in fig 3 three coordinate systems are used one set of axes which is regarded as the global coordinate system is fixed to the earth s coordinate system where x y plane coincides with the still water surface and z axis points vertically downwards another two sets of axes are fixed relative to each body s moving coordinate system aligned with its origin at the center of the undisturbed water plane area the platform coordinate system and the anchor coordinate system indicated as o p x p y p z p and o a x a y a z a respectively are illustrated in fig 3 3 1 governing equations according to the newton s law the general formulation for a rigid body s motion can be written by fossen 2011 1 η j η v 2 m r b v c r b v v τ where v r 6 is the velocity vector expressed in the body fixed coordinate frame η r 3 s 3 the position and orientation vector expressed in global coordinate frame j the frame transformation matrix m r b the rigid body inertia matrix c r b the rigid body coriolis centripetal matrix due to

interaction between the towed bodies would not be ignored in the seakeeping calculation as the space interval between the towed bodies is relatively small compared to the size of the towed bodies the

also the quadratic transfer function qtf of second order wave loads for floating body with or without forward speed is applied for computing the added mass a i j and potential damping b i j fig 4 and fig 5 show the results of the hydrodynamic coefficients at u 2 m s the labels a i j k p b i j k p in the figures indicate the added mass damping of i body in the k dof motion caused by the p dof motion of j body in the figures only the upper triangular matrix elements are shown because the matrices are symmetric other matrix elements not shown in the figures are zero valued owing to the holes of the anchor and the platform moonpool effects are excited and resonances pumping mode and sloshing modes occur at the free surface of the holes this effects make the added mass damping change rapidly at several frequencies the pumping mode which appears in heave direction occurs when the product of the wavenumber κ and draft d is slightly less than one and the sloshing modes are corresponding approximately to standing waves inside the holes and appear in surge sway roll and pitch directions for maneuvering calculation the classical model taking account of the horizontal motion surge sway and yaw is applied due to the x z plane symmetry of the towed bodies the added mass and coriolis centripetal matrices are expressed as fossen 2011 5 a 0 1 2 6 a 11 0 0 0 0 a 22 0 a

number list of x in the towing process the horizontal motion tend to oscillate and decay to their equilibrium after perturbations as shown in section 5 in this study the added mass at these oscillating frequencies is applied for the maneuvering calculations as the forward speed is relatively small the nonlinear damping force n n v s of the maneuvering model are calculated using current

first order low pass filter 8 t 0 v s t v s t v t where t 0 is the time constant of the filter that can be properly assigned by taking account of the wave frequencies and the oscillating frequencies in this study t 0 is assigned by t 0 10 2 π s so that the oscillating period for separating v s and v f is 10 s the fast varying velocity can thus be expressed by 9 v f t v t v s t 3 2 hydrostatics

second order wave induced force wave drift force observed as non zero slowly varying components as the slowly varying force components can be compensated by the feedback control system of the towing

ω j t κ j x cos β w y sin β w γ ω e j β u ε j where γ and γ are the forward speed dependent amplitude and phase of the force rao respectively s ω the wave spectrum ω the wave frequency ω e the encounter frequency β w the wave propagation direction β β w ψ the angle between the heading and the direction of the wave κ the wave number ε the random phase angles and δ ω the constant difference between the successive frequencies the force rao coefficients under different incident angles are pre calculated by hydrostar bureau veritas 2016 and the wave excitation force is calculated by taking the step of interpolating some amplitude of the force rao of the anchor and platform under u 2 m s is illustrated in fig 6 and fig 7 the label e i j in the figures indicates the amplitude of force rao in j dof of i body i 1 stands for the anchor and i 2 stands for the platform 3 4 towing force other than the steel wire ropes or chains the tension elongation relationship of synthetic fiber ropes are generally nonlinear and exhibit viscoelasticity and viscoplasticity liu et al 2014 as the effect on dynamic stiffness such as the hysteresis loop under cyclic loading can be ignored for small strain amplitude casey et al 2002 static tension elongation model is applied in this study the normalized stiffness k r of the towropes is expressed as wibner et al 2003 12 k r ea mbl α β l m where ea is the stiffness mbl is the minimum breaking load l m is the mean load mbl and α and β are the coefficients related to the material and structure of fiber ropes the stiffness coefficient k s can be calculated by 13 k s k r mbl d m where d m the nominal length of the towrope the towing force can thus be given by 14 τ m 0 if l m d m k s l m d m if l m d m where l m is the real distance between the towing points of the rope it is noteworthy that the towing force is generated only when the towrope is strained 3 5 simulation environment for numerical model as the multiple towropes between the towed bodies increase the complexity of the towing system a multi body simulation environment for 3d mechanical systems simmechanicstm renamed by simscape multibody mathworks 2020c is used to model the towing system to authentically study the behavior of the system by the software a multi body system can be handled using blocks to represent bodies joints constraints force elements and sensors the system is assembled by simply connecting the ports of the blocks and the equations of motion for the complete mechanical system can be solved efficiently the software also provides user defined function supporting matlab c c and fortran for special requirement the schematic block diagram of the proposed towing system in the software is shown in fig 8 the anchor platform with tower front towing points are represented by solid blocks the coordinate transform blocks and 6 dof joints are applied to set the initial position of the towed bodies the rigid body forces in the left hand side of motion equation 3 can be solved inherently by the software the pull force representing the rear towing vehicle is implemented by an external force block as shown at the left top corner of the figure the towrope model is shown in the dot dashed box in fig 8 a transform sensor block is applied to measure the distance between the two towing points of the towrope and the towing force 14 is calculated by a user defined function block and an internal force block in addition the hydrodynamics including the seakeeping and maneuvering terms the damping terms the restoring force and the wave excitation force are implemented by user defined function blocks the maneuvering path of the towing system can be defined by setting the trajectory of the front towing point via a cartesian joint the mechanical and simulation parameters such as the gravitational acceleration and the time step used to compute numerical partial derivatives can be set in the mechanism configuration block it is noteworthy that other toolboxes provided by mathworks such as the control system toolbox mathworks 2020a and navigation toolbox mathworks 2020b can be applied together with the simmechanics therefore other research topics about the towing system such as controller design for the towing vehicles and path following control of the towing system can be effectively studied in the simulation environment 4 current and damping coefficients 4 1 current coefficients the current coefficients are determined via experiments by using 1 30 experimental models in a water tunnel with length 4 0 m width 1 5 m and depth 1 0 m and the setup is shown in fig 9 a six components strain gauge is applied to measure the hydro load on the models in the experiments the angle of attack is adjusted to vary from 0 deg to 60 deg with a step size of 5 deg current coefficients are then calculated from the drag force lift force and moment on the models and the results are shown by the mark in fig 10 for numerical implementation the 4th order polynomials are applied to fit the experimental results during the fitting following constraint conditions 15 c x 0 0 c x 60 0 16 c y 0 0 c y 60 0 17 c n 0 0 c n 60 0 are considered since the drag force is symmetric at γ 0 deg and γ 60 deg whereas the lift force and moment would be zero at γ 0 deg and γ 60 deg the resulted coefficients for numerical model are shown by the solid lines in fig 10 4 2 damping coefficients the damping coefficients d and d q are determined based on the free decay experiments course stability experiments and wave response experiments in this section the methods for determining the damping coefficients are presented in free decay response the motion of a body in i th i 3 4 5 motion dof could be expressed by 18 m r b i a i ω n v m i b i ω n d i v m i d q i v m i v m i g i 0 where a ω n and b ω n are the added mass and potential damping of the model at its natural frequency ω n respectively v m is the measured velocity in the experiments and x i denotes the i th element of x or the i i element of x if x is a matrix the least square curve fitting method dalzell 1976 is applied to calculate the damping coefficients in heave roll and pitch dofs and the nondimensionalized results are assigned as follows 19 d 3 4 5 7 23 e 2 0 0 0 1 49 e 2 0 0 0 3 91 e 2 d q 3 4 5 1 30 e 1 0 0 0 2 62 e 2 0 0 0 3 59 e 2 for anchor 20 d 3 4 5

pitch are calculated by d i d i ρ d k ω n k 0 for i 3 and k 2 for i 4 5 and d q i d q i ρ d p p 1 for i 3 and p 2 for i 4 5 the coupled damping terms of the motion dofs the non diagonal elements of d 3 4 5 and d q 3 4 5 are assigned as zero in this study the damping coefficients in sway and yaw dofs are obtained based on the course stability experiments in water tunnel tests and the schematic view of the experiments is shown in fig 11 the motion equation can be expressed by 21 m r b a 0 2 6 v n n n 2 6 c r b c a d 2 6 v n d q 2 6 v n v n τ m 2 6 where v n v r t is the measured velocity in sway and yaw dofs expressed in the body fixed frame in small motion the force τ m 2 6 in 21 can be written as 22 τ 2 6 f 0 θ 2 θ 1 f 0 l c θ 2 θ 1 where θ 1 and θ 2 are the rope angle and yaw angle of the experimental model respectively l c is the distance between the center of mass and the front towing point of the model and f 0 1 2 ρ l d c x 0 u 2 is the drag force the coefficients d 2 6 and d q 2 6 could be identified by least square method and the nondimensionalized results are given by 23 d 2 6 1 07 e 2 3 02 e 3 3 02 e 3 1 64 e 1 d q 2 6 1 20 e 3 4 37 e 3 4 37 e 3 6 30 e 1 for anchor 24 d 2 6

p 1 for i 2 and p 2 for i 6 and the coupled damping terms d 2 6 and d q 2 6 are normalized according to d 2 6 d 2 6 ρ u and d q 2 6 d q 2 6 ρ d it is noteworthy that the oscillating frequencies in course stability study are in lower frequency region than wave frequencies so that the measured velocity v n can be regarded as the slowly varying velocity v s if this is not the case the effects of the low pass filter 8 should be taken into account when determining the coefficients in 23 and 24 in 21 besides the damping coefficients in surge dof are tuned according to the wave response experiments to let the surge motion in simulation be close to the experiments and the results are given as follows 25 d 1 3 30 e 3 d q 1 6 00 e 3 for anchor 26 d 1 7 66 e 2 d q 1 8 60 e 3 for platform where d 1 d 1 ρ u l 1 and d q 1 d q 1 ρ d 1 the coupled damping terms between the surge and other motion dofs are set as zero 5 experiments and numerical study experiments and simulation on the course stability free decay response and wave response are performed the 1 30 model used for measuring the current coefficients as shown in fig 9 are applied for studying the course stability performance in addition a 1 10 model is developed for studying the free decay and wave response in a water tank with length 65 m width 5 m and depth 7 m the model and sensing system are shown in fig 12 the towropes are chosen as the polyester ropes with a diameter of 4 mm for this kind of towropes the parameters α and β in 12 could be approximated by α 17 and β 0 2 respectively according to the study in liu et al 2014 besides the mean towing load l m is estimated as l m 5 mbl and l m 2 mbl for the front towrope and the middle towropes respectively by static force analysis hence the coefficient k s is estimated to be 2 16 kn m for the front towrope and 2 10 kn m for the middle towropes for the numerical model the towrope stiffness is assigned by reference to the experimental towrope according to froude scaling rule 5 1 course stability course stability is vital for ship towing system since it is related to the feasibility and the reliability of the system under practical ocean situations a towing system with high course stability performance can significantly reduce the ship control complexity and reduce the deviation of the ship heading from its desired path fitriadhy et al 2013 in the experiments the initial position of the bodies is set a little away from the equilibrium position by external force the force is then removed to let them move freely on the water surface the course stability performance can be evaluated by studying the decay of their yaw motion and the results are shown in fig 13 the course stability can be maintained for the single towing system as both the platform and anchor can finally stay steadily at their equilibrium position after several oscillations the platform has better course stability performance than the anchor since the oscillating could be dampened more rapidly the experimental results are applied to calculate the damping coefficients in sway a yaw dofs that explained in section 4 2 simulation is then performed in comparison with the experiments and the results are shown as the dotted line in fig 13 it can be obtained that the characteristics of the motion such as the oscillating frequencies and the decay ratio could be properly reproduced by the numerical model 5 2 free decay response by free decay experiments some important properties of the floating bodies such as the natural frequencies and damping ratio can be evaluated the free decay experiments are carried out individually that the initial position of the bodies in heave roll and pitch dofs are set away from their equilibrium state the bodies are then let move freely on water surface the experimental results in time series are shown as the solid lines in fig 14 and fig 15 by the results the natural periods could be calculated as shown in table 3 damping coefficients in heave roll and pitch dofs can be estimated by the experimental results as explained in section 4 2 then simulation with the same conditions can be performed and the results are shown as the dotted line in figs 14 and 15 it can be obtained that the numerical results are consistent with the experimental results in most cases except the platform heave motion owing to the nonlinearity of the water plane area in vertical direction which is not taken into account by the modeling method in 10 the numerical results deviate at some level from the experimental results however as illustrated in section 5 3 the motion amplitude of the platform in heave dof is similar to the wave amplitude since the platform is of small mass therefore the water plane area varies small in practical situation and the linear model 10 would be proper for this stage of study 5 3 wave response the overview of the towing system for wave response experiments is shown in fig 16 the response of the towed bodies in moored state and towing process is studied a small boat is installed at the rear of the system for simulating the drag force on the system in the moored state the towing system is constrained within a specified area in the towing tank by connecting the experimental system to two fixed points the towropes are set to be slack by having the space interval between the bodies be smaller than the natural length of the towropes by the consideration both the drift caused by waves and the influence of the towropes on the body motion can be reduced in the towing process the front towing point is connected to the carriage and the system moves with a forward speed of u 0 6 m s the wave conditions which are setting to be in the suitability range of linear wave theory are given in table 4 the towing system under heading waves β 180 o are studied and motion response amplitude operators motion raos are applied to evaluate the body motion the results are shown by the mark in fig 17 and fig 18 the motion in sway roll and yaw dofs are not plotted in the figures since they are small under the heading waves from the experiments it can be found that the anchor motion in heave dof at ω e l g 1 2 and in pitch dof at ω e l g 1 4 and the platform motion in pitch dof at ω e l g 1 7 are relatively large compared to other cases since their natural frequencies are close to these frequencies in addition the motion amplitude of the towed bodies in the towing process are smaller than the motion in the moored state owing to the restraint caused by the towropes moreover as the center of mass of the platform is deviated away from the water plane the motion in surge dof is found to be coupled with the motion in pitch dof this is not preferred since the large motion in surge dof would cause the towropes vary their state in slack and in tight frequently which would not only reduce the life span of the towropes but also cause detriments for the whole system from the experiments it is noteworthy that the water overtopping phenomenon happens on the anchor in the towing process since the deck is of low height the towing force and the drag force make a pitching effect on the anchor and the front part of the anchor ducks into the water in waves during the towing process in simulation wave periods are set to vary from 4 s to 10 s with a step size of 0 2 s the first 30 s are treated as the transient process and the results in the thereafter 20 wave periods are applied for rao analysis the results are shown as the dot dashed line in figs 17 and 18 owing to the effects of window size and the discontinuities at the boundaries of finite time series data spectral resolution in rao analysis is limited so that the motion raos are non smooth compared to other frequency based analysis it can be found that the simulation results can be coincident with the experimental results in most cases except the platform motion in pitch dof in the moored state and the anchor motion in surge dof in the towing process as the metacentric height of the platform vary widely in waves in large pitch motion which is not taken into account in the numerical model the simulation results of the platform in pitch dof deviates some level away from the experimental results in addition the reason that the simulation results of anchor motion in surge dof mismatch the experimental results would be due to the water overtopping phenomenon happens in the towing experiments owing to the overtopping the seakeeping and maneuvering calculations applied in the numerical model cannot properly explain the experimental system as the water overtopping would also reduce the course stability performance some additional approaches such as change the location of towing points would be applicable in practical situations according to the above experimental and numerical studies the proposed numerical method in particular the low pass filter for separating the slowly and fast velocity components for maneuvering and seakeeping calculations is demonstrated to be applicable for the model in the following a circular motion in irregular waves is studied 5 4 circular motion in irregular waves to evaluate the reliability of the towing system in practical ocean conditions a clockwise circular motion with a radius of 500 m is studied the trajectory of the front towing point is shown as the solid line in fig 19 a fully developed wind generated sea state characterized by the pierson moskowitz pm spectrum fossen 2011 27 s ω a ω 5 exp b ω 4 is applied in this study the terms a and b are the parameters given by a 8 1 10 3 g 2 b 3 11 h s 2 where h s is the significant wave height set as h s 2 m the wave is set to propagate in negative x direction by the setting the towing system can be studied under waves with various incident angles the motion trajectories of the anchor and the platform are shown as the dash dotted line and the dash line in fig 19 respectively the contours in r 500 m 10 m are augmented in the figure for ease of comparison it can be found that the system can be properly towed in head sea and following sea states however the anchor behaves wildly in bow quartering sea state as the settling time of towing the anchor back on its course is much longer than the wave periods as shown in fig 13 it would be tough for the anchor to return back to its due course under bow quartering sea state therefore more study on improving the performance of anchor course stability such as to use fins at its stern would be necessary in practical conditions 6 conclusion in this study a unified seakeeping and maneuvering model was proposed to analyze a multiple linked ship towing system with triangular bodies a low pass filter was applied to separate the slowly and fast varying motion components of the bodies for maneuvering and seakeeping calculations therefore the influence of wave induced motion on the maneuvering could be reduced the hydrodynamic interaction between the bodies was taken into account in the seakeeping by linear convolution integral formulation besides damping coefficients were tuned based on experimental results so that the model would describe the physical system with high accuracy the numerical model is implemented by simmechanics and the fully coupled motion of the towing system could be evaluated the effectiveness of the model was also demonstrated by wave response experiments with and without forward speed in addition a circular motion of the towing system in irregular waves was studied using the proposed model from the study we can find that several attention should be paid for next study phase as the center of mass of the platform stays far above from the still water level the motion in surge dof is strongly coupled with the motion in pitch dof and therefore the surge motion would become large in practical situations this would cause the towropes to vary their state in slack and in tight frequently which is detrimental to the ropes and the towing system the water overtopping phenomenon on the anchor may happen during the towing process as the deck of the anchor is of low height therefore the surge motion of the anchor would be overestimated by the model it is noteworthy that the water overtopping would affect the course stability of the anchor and reduce the performance of the towing system therefore more study is required for investigate the effects of the water overtopping owing to the weak performance on course stability the anchor would behave wildly especially in bow quartering sea state this would significantly affect the control system of the front towing vehicle use of longer towropes or to attach fins at the stern of the anchor would be the options to improve its course stability performance in general the studies performed in this paper provide a fast modeling method for a multiple linked ship towing system in a seaway more studies to handle the path following control the towing system would be performed in future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research was partially supported by japan science and technology agency grant number

system are discussed accordingly keywords multiple linked ship towing system triangular tension leg platform course stability seakeeping theory maneuvering theory simmechanics 1 introduction the oceans are huge energy reservoir and many countries have launched their national marine power projects for decarbonization pelc and fujita 2002 khan et al 2017 melikoglu 2018 nguyen and dong 2019 although today most of the marine power projects are very near from the shore the huge potential of the oceans may bring marine power further into the sea in a near future lehmann et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 park and kim 2016 such deep ocean development would lead to increasingly wide deployment of offshore platforms tlps which are a kind of compliant type offshore platform generally used for offshore oil and gas industry and wind turbines natvig et al 1995 kausche et al 2018 would be extensively applied in future usually four legged tlps are used owing to their well established design and evaluation technologies in oder to reduce the cost a three legged triangular tlp was proposed and studied in chandrasekaran and jain 2002a 2002b it is reported that the three legged triangular tlp would not require complicated devices and the foundation could be placed with larger tolerances without affecting tether behavior significant savings would be obtained in main steel for both hull and deck due to fewer main element intersections and effective force distributions recently use of triangular tlps has also been proposed for developing offshore overhead power transmission system fopts hu et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 in general transportation of a tlp is associated with the use of heavy transport vessels which are high cost and their availability is limited to reduce the transportation and installation cost an approach consists of a towing process and a settling process has been proposed for a submerged triangular tlp hu et al 2020 and the overview of the towing system is shown in fig 1 the vehicle at the front of the system is applied for maneuvering the system and the vehicle at the rear side is for preventing the bodies from collision the gravity anchor is designed with build in air tanks so that it can float on the water surface during the towing process when the system is towed to the installation site water could then be poured into the air tanks to settle the anchor down to the seabed by the approach the tendons could be installed to the platform and anchor in advance at the port harbor so that the complexity of the installation would be reduced to study the multiple linked towing system in practical sea conditions maneuvering model considering the seakeeping problem is required currently two distinctive methods have been investigated to model the hydrodynamics on a maneuvering vessel in a seaway perez and fossen 2007 bailey et al 2002 fossen 2005 subramanian and beck 2015 utilize the linear convolution integral formulation cummins 1962 to account for the unsteady wave memory effects on the vessel the retardation function in the convolution integral formulation is calculated based on three dimensional potential theory so that the hydrodynamic coefficients would be of high accuracy the method is applicable for multi body system as the hydrodynamic interaction would also be estimated however the wave induced motion as reported in skejic and faltinsen 2006 would have erroneous influence on the maneuvering calculation on the other hand sutulo and soares 2006 skejic and faltinsen 2008 wicaksono and kashiwagi 2019 analyze a maneuvering ship in regular waves by performing the seakeeping and maneuvering calculations in two different time scales the maneuvering problem is solved in a constant time interval whereas the seakeeping is solved when the variation of the mean heading angle goes over some prefixed value two dimensional potential flow strip theory is used for the seakeeping calculation so that the method is applicable for slender bodies such as ships for the towing system with multiple triangular bodies in irregular waves the method would be computationally expensive and the accuracy would be insufficient in this paper a unified maneuvering and seakeeping method utilizing the advantages of the aforementioned two methods is proposed linear integral formulation is applied to account for the seakeeping problem so that the hydrodynamic interaction of the bodies could be incorporated in the analysis besides like to the concept of the two time scale method that the maneuvering is supposed to be in lower frequency region than the wave induced motion a low pass filter is applied to separate the slowly and fast velocity components for the maneuvering and seakeeping calculations by the method the maneuvering and seakeeping problems can be solved simultaneously with a same time scale and the towing system would become analyzable in addition in order to increase the accuracy of the numerical model the damping coefficients are tuned based on model test results the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the structural aspects and the properties of the towing system are firstly introduced then the numerical model and the identification method for the damping coefficients are presented after that experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the numerical model finally a circular motion under irregular waves is studied 2 structural aspects towing system for the triangular tlp proposed for fopts in hu et al 2020 is studied and the schematic view of the anchor and the platform with tower is shown in fig 2 the platform is of triangular shape with three cylindrical pontoons on the sides a lattice tower which is installed directly on the platform is applied to support power transmission lines the anchor is a gravity anchor consists of three square cylinder with built in air tanks the properties of the bodies are given in table 1 and table 2 the tlp is a submerged tlp and the platform can be self stabilized during the transportation owing to the large water plane area in order to reduce the sway and yaw motion each body is connected by towropes at its three vertices the towing points are set on the deck above the water surface for the convenience of towrope installation and removal as the tendons of the tlp are expected to be installed on the platform and anchor at port harbor before the transportation the space interval between the bodies is limited by the length of the tendons in this study the space interval is properly set as 22 m by considering the tendon length and course stability performance synthetic fiber ropes are applied as the towropes as they are more water resistant than most natural fiber ropes the towing process is expected to be performed under calm moderate sea states with a forward speed of 2 m s as the froude number is moderate say f n 0 16 the towed bodies can be classified as displacement vessels and potential theory could be applicable for computing the hydrodynamic coefficients of the bodies fossen 2011 3 mathematical model motion of the towed bodies are in six dofs and coupled with each other and therefore the mechanics are very complicated in ocean environment as the towing process would be carried out in calm moderate sea states and the froude number is moderate the following assumptions are given in this study each body is rigid hydrodynamic forces acting on the bodies are quasi steady lateral velocity component is small compared with the longitudinal velocity component for each body variation of the relative position between the bodies is small so that their hydrodynamic coupling effects are the same as their initial state the wave making effect is neglected we also assume that the forward speed is regulated as constant by the front towing vehicle in addition owing to the fact that the course stability performance of the towing system can be maintained which will be shown in section 5 the platform and anchor would be towed along the desired path without the control of rear vehicle therefore the rear vehicle is represented by a drag force f as shown in fig 3 three coordinate systems are used one set of axes which is regarded as the global coordinate system is fixed to the earth s coordinate system where x y plane coincides with the still water surface and z axis points vertically downwards another two sets of axes are fixed relative to each body s moving coordinate system aligned with its origin at the center of the undisturbed water plane area the platform coordinate system and the anchor coordinate system indicated as o p x p y p z p and o a x a y a z a respectively are illustrated in fig 3 3 1 governing equations according to the newton s law the general formulation for a rigid body s motion can be written by fossen 2011 1 η j η v 2 m r b v c r b v v τ where v r 6 is the velocity vector expressed in the body fixed coordinate frame η r 3 s

motion of j body in the figures only the upper triangular matrix elements are shown because the matrices are symmetric other matrix elements not shown in the figures are zero valued owing to the holes of the anchor and the platform moonpool effects are excited and resonances pumping mode and sloshing modes occur at the free surface of the holes this effects make the added mass damping change rapidly at several frequencies the pumping mode which appears in heave direction occurs when the product of the wavenumber κ and draft d is slightly less than one and the sloshing modes are corresponding approximately to standing waves inside the holes and appear in surge sway roll and pitch directions for maneuvering calculation the classical model taking account of the horizontal motion surge sway and yaw is applied due to the x z plane symmetry of the towed bodies the added mass and coriolis centripetal matrices are expressed as fossen 2011 5 a 0 1 2 6 a 11 0 0 0 0 a 22 0 a

number list of x in the towing process the horizontal motion tend to oscillate and decay to their equilibrium after perturbations as shown in section 5 in this study the added mass at these oscillating frequencies is applied for the maneuvering calculations as the forward speed is relatively small the nonlinear damping force n n v s of the maneuvering model are calculated using current

and yaw dofs respectively the coefficients could be obtained by water tunnel tests using experimental models as explained in section 4 the slowly varying velocity of a towed body is calculated by the first order low pass filter 8 t 0 v s t v s t v t where t 0 is the time constant of the filter that can be properly assigned by taking account of the wave frequencies and the oscillating frequencies in this study t 0 is assigned by t 0 10 2 π s so that the oscillating period for separating v s and v f is 10 s the fast varying velocity can thus be expressed by 9 v f t v t v s t 3 2 hydrostatics the hydrostatic restoring force g η is calculated by linear model expressed by 10 g η ρ g 0 0 a w p z gm t φ gm l θ 0 where ρ is the water density g the gravitational acceleration the displacement a w p the water plane area z the displacement in heave gm t and gm l the metacentric height in transverse and longitudinal direction respectively φ θ ψ the euler angles of the floating body 3 3 wave

second order wave induced force wave drift force observed as non zero slowly varying components as the slowly varying force components can be compensated by the feedback control system of the towing vehicle the second order wave load is ignored in this study the wave excitation force τ w is computed based on force response amplitude operators force rao by 11 τ w j 1 n γ ω e j β u 2 s ω j δ ω cos ω j t κ j x cos β w y sin β w γ ω e j β u ε j where γ and γ are the forward speed dependent amplitude and phase of the force rao respectively s ω the wave spectrum ω the wave frequency ω e the encounter frequency β w the wave propagation direction β β w ψ the angle between the heading and the direction of the wave κ the wave number ε the random phase angles and δ ω the constant difference between the successive frequencies the force rao coefficients under different incident angles are pre calculated by hydrostar bureau veritas 2016 and the wave excitation force is calculated by taking the step of interpolating some amplitude of the force rao of the anchor and platform under u 2 m s is illustrated in fig 6 and fig 7 the label e i j in the figures indicates the amplitude of force rao in j dof of i body i 1 stands for the anchor and i 2 stands for the platform 3 4 towing force other than the steel wire ropes or chains the tension elongation relationship of synthetic fiber ropes are generally nonlinear and exhibit viscoelasticity and viscoplasticity liu et al 2014 as the effect on dynamic stiffness such as the hysteresis loop under cyclic loading can be ignored for small strain amplitude casey et al 2002 static tension elongation model is applied in this study the normalized stiffness k r of the towropes is expressed as wibner et al 2003 12 k r ea mbl α β l m where ea is the stiffness mbl is the minimum breaking load l m is the mean load mbl and α and β are the coefficients related to the material and structure of fiber ropes the stiffness coefficient k s can be calculated by 13 k s k r mbl d m where d m the nominal length of the towrope the towing force can thus be given by 14 τ m 0 if l m d m k s l m d m if l m d m where l m is the real distance between the towing points of the rope it is noteworthy that the towing force is generated only when the towrope is strained 3 5 simulation environment for numerical model as the multiple towropes between the towed bodies increase the complexity of the towing system a multi body simulation environment for 3d mechanical systems simmechanicstm renamed by simscape multibody mathworks 2020c is used to model the towing system to authentically study the behavior of the system by the software a multi body system can be handled using blocks to represent bodies joints constraints force elements and sensors the system is assembled by simply connecting the ports of the blocks and the equations of motion for the complete mechanical system can be solved efficiently the software also provides user defined function supporting matlab c c and fortran for special requirement the schematic block diagram of the proposed towing system in the software is shown in fig 8 the anchor platform with tower front towing points are represented by solid blocks the coordinate transform blocks and 6 dof joints are applied to set the initial position of the towed bodies the rigid body forces in the left hand side of motion equation 3 can be solved inherently by the software the pull force representing the rear towing vehicle is implemented by an external force block as shown at the left top corner of the figure the towrope model is shown in the dot dashed box in fig 8 a transform sensor block is applied to measure the distance between the two towing points of the towrope and the towing force 14 is calculated by a user defined function block and an internal force block in addition the hydrodynamics including the seakeeping and maneuvering terms the damping terms the restoring force and the wave excitation force are implemented by user defined function blocks the maneuvering path of the towing system can be defined by setting the trajectory of the front towing point via a cartesian joint the mechanical and simulation parameters such as the gravitational acceleration and the time step used to compute numerical partial derivatives can be set in the mechanism configuration block it is noteworthy that other toolboxes provided by mathworks such as the control system toolbox mathworks 2020a and navigation toolbox mathworks 2020b can be applied together with the simmechanics therefore other research topics about the towing system such as controller design for the towing vehicles and path following control of the towing system can be effectively studied in the simulation environment 4 current and damping coefficients 4 1 current coefficients the current coefficients are determined via experiments by using 1 30 experimental models in a water tunnel with length 4 0 m width 1 5 m and depth 1 0 m and the setup is shown in fig 9 a six components strain gauge is applied to measure the hydro load on the models in the experiments the angle of attack is adjusted to vary from 0 deg to 60 deg with a step size of 5 deg current coefficients are then calculated from the drag force lift force and moment on the models and the results are shown by the mark in fig 10 for numerical implementation the 4th order polynomials are applied to fit the experimental results during the fitting following constraint conditions 15 c x 0 0 c x 60 0 16 c y 0 0 c y 60 0 17 c n 0 0 c n 60 0 are considered since the drag force is symmetric at γ 0 deg and γ 60 deg whereas the lift force and moment would be zero at γ 0 deg and γ 60 deg the resulted coefficients for numerical model are shown by the solid lines in fig 10 4 2 damping coefficients the damping coefficients d and d q are determined based on the free decay experiments course stability experiments and wave response experiments in this section the methods for determining the damping coefficients are presented in free decay response the motion of a body in i th i 3 4 5 motion dof could be expressed by 18 m r b i a i ω n v m i b i ω n d i v m i d q i v m i v m i g i 0 where a ω n and b ω n are the added mass and potential damping of the model at its natural frequency ω n respectively v m is the measured velocity in the experiments and x i denotes the i th element of x or the i i element of x if x is a matrix the least square curve fitting method dalzell 1976 is applied to calculate the damping coefficients in heave roll and pitch dofs and the nondimensionalized results are assigned as follows 19 d 3 4 5 7 23 e 2 0 0 0 1 49 e 2 0 0 0 3 91 e 2 d q 3 4 5 1 30 e 1 0 0 0 2 62 e 2 0 0 0 3 59 e 2 for anchor 20 d 3 4 5

pitch are calculated by d i d i ρ d k ω n k 0 for i 3 and k 2 for i 4 5 and d q i d q i ρ d p p 1 for i 3 and p 2 for i 4 5 the coupled damping terms of the motion dofs the non diagonal elements of d 3 4 5 and d q 3 4 5 are assigned as zero in this study the damping coefficients in sway and yaw dofs are obtained based on the course stability experiments in water tunnel tests and the schematic view of the experiments is shown in fig 11 the motion equation can be expressed by 21 m r b a 0 2 6 v n n n 2 6 c r b c a d 2 6 v n d q 2 6 v n v n τ m 2 6 where v n v r t is the measured velocity in sway and yaw dofs expressed in the body fixed frame in small motion the force τ m 2 6 in 21 can be written as 22 τ 2 6 f 0 θ 2 θ 1 f 0 l c θ 2 θ 1 where θ 1 and θ 2 are the rope angle and yaw angle of the experimental model respectively l c is the distance between the center of mass and the front towing point of the model and f 0 1 2 ρ l d c x 0 u 2 is the drag force the coefficients d 2 6 and d q 2 6 could be identified by least square method and the nondimensionalized results are given by 23 d 2 6 1 07 e 2 3 02 e 3 3 02 e 3 1 64 e 1 d q 2 6 1 20 e 3 4 37 e 3 4 37 e 3 6 30 e 1 for anchor 24 d 2 6

p 1 for i 2 and p 2 for i 6 and the coupled damping terms d 2 6 and d q 2 6 are normalized according to d 2 6 d 2 6 ρ u and d q 2 6 d q 2 6 ρ d it is noteworthy that the oscillating frequencies in course stability study are in lower frequency region than wave frequencies so that the measured velocity v n can be regarded as the slowly varying velocity v s if this is not the case the effects of the low pass filter 8 should be taken into account when determining the coefficients in 23 and 24 in 21 besides the damping coefficients in surge dof are tuned according to the wave response experiments to let the surge motion in simulation be close to the experiments and the results are given as follows 25 d 1 3 30 e 3 d q 1 6 00 e 3 for anchor 26 d 1 7 66 e 2 d q 1 8 60 e 3 for platform where d 1 d 1 ρ u l 1 and d q 1 d q 1 ρ d 1 the coupled damping terms between the surge and other motion dofs are set as zero 5 experiments and numerical study experiments and simulation on the course stability free decay response and wave response are performed the 1 30 model used for measuring the current coefficients as shown in fig 9 are applied for studying the course stability performance in addition a 1 10 model is developed for studying the free decay and wave response in a water tank with length 65 m width 5 m and depth 7 m the model and sensing system are shown in fig 12 the towropes are chosen as the polyester ropes with a diameter of 4 mm for this kind of towropes the parameters α and β in 12 could be approximated by α 17 and β 0 2 respectively according to the study in liu et al 2014 besides the mean towing load l m is estimated as l m 5 mbl and l m 2 mbl for the front towrope and the middle towropes respectively by static force analysis hence the coefficient k s is estimated to be 2 16 kn m for the front towrope and 2 10 kn m for the middle towropes for the numerical model the towrope stiffness is assigned by reference to the experimental towrope according to froude scaling rule 5 1 course stability course stability is vital for ship towing system since it is related to the feasibility and the reliability of the system under practical ocean situations a towing system with high course stability performance can significantly reduce the ship control complexity and reduce the deviation of the ship heading from its desired path fitriadhy et al 2013 in the experiments the initial position of the bodies is set a little away from the equilibrium position by external force the force is then removed to let them move freely on the water surface the course stability performance can be evaluated by studying the decay of their yaw motion and the results are shown in fig 13 the course stability can be maintained for the single towing system as both the platform and anchor can finally stay steadily at their equilibrium position after several oscillations the platform has better course stability performance than the anchor since the oscillating could be dampened more rapidly the experimental results are applied to calculate the damping coefficients in sway a yaw dofs that explained in section 4 2 simulation is then performed in comparison with the experiments and the results are shown as the dotted line in fig 13 it can be obtained that the characteristics of the motion such as the oscillating frequencies and the decay ratio could be properly reproduced by the numerical model 5 2 free decay response by free decay experiments some important properties of the floating bodies such as the natural frequencies and damping ratio can be evaluated the free decay experiments are carried out individually that the initial position of the bodies in heave roll and pitch dofs are set away from their equilibrium state the bodies are then let move freely on water surface the experimental results in time series are shown as the solid lines in fig 14 and fig 15 by the results the natural periods could be calculated as shown in table 3 damping coefficients in heave roll and pitch dofs can be estimated by the experimental results as explained in section 4 2 then simulation with the same conditions can be performed and the results are shown as the dotted line in figs 14 and 15 it can be obtained that the numerical results are consistent with the experimental results in most cases except the platform heave motion owing to the nonlinearity of the water plane area in vertical direction which is not taken into account by the modeling method in 10 the numerical results deviate at some level from the experimental results however as illustrated in section 5 3 the motion amplitude of the platform in heave dof is similar to the wave amplitude since the platform is of small mass therefore the water plane area varies small in practical situation and the linear model 10 would be proper for this stage of study 5 3 wave response the overview of the towing system for wave response experiments is shown in fig 16 the response of the towed bodies in moored state and towing process is studied a small boat is installed at the rear of the system for simulating the drag force on the system in the moored state the towing system is constrained within a specified area in the towing tank by connecting the experimental system to two fixed points the towropes are set to be slack by having the space interval between the bodies be smaller than the natural length of the towropes by the consideration both the drift caused by waves and the influence of the towropes on the body motion can be reduced in the towing process the front towing point is connected to the carriage and the system moves with a forward speed of u 0 6 m s the wave conditions which are setting to be in the suitability range of linear wave theory are given in table 4 the towing system under heading waves β 180 o are studied and motion response amplitude operators motion raos are applied to evaluate the body motion the results are shown by the mark in fig 17 and fig 18 the motion in sway roll and yaw dofs are not plotted in the figures since they are small under the heading waves from the experiments it can be found that the anchor motion in heave dof at ω e l g 1 2 and in pitch dof at ω e l g 1 4 and the platform motion in pitch dof at ω e l g 1 7 are relatively large compared to other cases since their natural frequencies are close to these frequencies in addition the motion amplitude of the towed bodies in the towing process are smaller than the motion in the moored state owing to the restraint caused by the towropes moreover as the center of mass of the platform is deviated away from the water plane the motion in surge dof is found to be coupled with the motion in pitch dof this is not preferred since the large motion in surge dof would cause the towropes vary their state in slack and in tight frequently which would not only reduce the life span of the towropes but also cause detriments for the whole system from the experiments it is noteworthy that the water overtopping phenomenon happens on the anchor in the towing process since the deck is of low height the towing force and the drag force make a pitching effect on the anchor and the front part of the anchor ducks into the water in waves during the towing process in simulation wave periods are set to vary from 4 s to 10 s with a step size of 0 2 s the first 30 s are treated as the transient process and the results in the thereafter 20 wave periods are applied for rao analysis the results are shown as the dot dashed line in figs 17 and 18 owing to the effects of window size and the discontinuities at the boundaries of finite time series data spectral resolution in rao analysis is limited so that the motion raos are non smooth compared to other frequency based analysis it can be found that the simulation results can be coincident with the experimental results in most cases except the platform motion in pitch dof in the moored state and the anchor motion in surge dof in the towing process as the metacentric height of the platform vary widely in waves in large pitch motion which is not taken into account in the numerical model the simulation results of the platform in pitch dof deviates some level away from the experimental results in addition the reason that the simulation results of anchor motion in surge dof mismatch the experimental results would be due to the water overtopping phenomenon happens in the towing experiments owing to the overtopping the seakeeping and maneuvering calculations applied in the numerical model cannot properly explain the experimental system as the water overtopping would also reduce the course stability performance some additional approaches such as change the location of towing points would be applicable in practical situations according to the above experimental and numerical studies the proposed numerical method in particular the low pass filter for separating the slowly and fast velocity components for maneuvering and seakeeping calculations is demonstrated to be applicable for the model in the following a circular motion in irregular waves is studied 5 4 circular motion in irregular waves to evaluate the reliability of the towing system in practical ocean conditions a clockwise circular motion with a radius of 500 m is studied the trajectory of the front towing point is shown as the solid line in fig 19 a fully developed wind generated sea state characterized by the pierson moskowitz pm spectrum fossen 2011 27 s ω a ω 5 exp b ω 4 is applied in this study the terms a and b are the parameters given by a 8 1 10 3 g 2 b 3 11 h s 2 where h s is the significant wave height set as h s 2 m the wave is set to propagate in negative x direction by the setting the towing system can be studied under waves with various incident angles the motion trajectories of the anchor and the platform are shown as the dash dotted line and the dash line in fig 19 respectively the contours in r 500 m 10 m are augmented in the figure for ease of comparison it can be found that the system can be properly towed in head sea and following sea states however the anchor behaves wildly in bow quartering sea state as the settling time of towing the anchor back on its course is much longer than the wave periods as shown in fig 13 it would be tough for the anchor to return back to its due course under bow quartering sea state therefore more study on improving the performance of anchor course stability such as to use fins at its stern would be necessary in practical conditions 6 conclusion in this study a unified seakeeping and maneuvering model was proposed to analyze a multiple linked ship towing system with triangular bodies a low pass filter was applied to separate the slowly and fast varying motion components of the bodies for maneuvering and seakeeping calculations therefore the influence of wave induced motion on the maneuvering could be reduced the hydrodynamic interaction between the bodies was taken into account in the seakeeping by linear convolution integral formulation besides damping coefficients were tuned based on experimental results so that the model would describe the physical system with high accuracy the numerical model is implemented by simmechanics and the fully coupled motion of the towing system could be evaluated the effectiveness of the model was also demonstrated by wave response experiments with and without forward speed in addition a circular motion of the towing system in irregular waves was studied using the proposed model from the study we can find that several attention should be paid for next study phase as the center of mass of the platform stays far above from the still water level the motion in surge dof is strongly coupled with the motion in pitch dof and therefore the surge motion would become large in practical situations this would cause the towropes to vary their state in slack and in tight frequently which is detrimental to the ropes and the towing system the water overtopping phenomenon on the anchor may happen during the towing process as the deck of the anchor is of low height therefore the surge motion of the anchor would be overestimated by the model it is noteworthy that the water overtopping would affect the course stability of the anchor and reduce the performance of the towing system therefore more study is required for investigate the effects of the water overtopping owing to the weak performance on course stability the anchor would behave wildly especially in bow quartering sea state this would significantly affect the control system of the front towing vehicle use of longer towropes or to attach fins at the stern of the anchor would be the options to improve its course stability performance in general the studies performed in this paper provide a fast modeling method for a multiple linked ship towing system in a seaway more studies to handle the path following control the towing system would be performed in future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research was partially supported by japan science and technology agency grant number

21073,numerical models play a fundamental role in the development of marine hydrokinetic mhk turbines as they can evaluate their performance and assess interactions with the local environment actuator representations that incorporate a force in the momentum equation of the flow are commonly used in numerical models to study the complex dynamics of wakes generated by the devices however the implications of adopting any of these approaches in simulations of turbulent wakes are not yet clear to understand the effects produced by different approaches we carry out simulations using a coherent structure resolving turbulence model for which we test three actuator representations actuator disk blade element momentum and actuator lines we reproduce an experiment with a horizontal axis turbine and show the influence of each formulation on the mean flow and on the dynamics of the wake in all three cases unsteady large scale vortices govern the flow statistics but while the mean flow is captured reasonably well by all models they produce structures of different scales and rotational features that control the details of wake recovery these new insights can help define the most appropriate model for each specific flow and improve predictions at different spatial scales in future investigations keywords tidal turbines numerical modeling wake dynamics actuator models turbulence computational fluid dynamics 1 introduction interactions between marine hydrokinetic mhk devices and the flow in tidal channels produce turbulent wakes with complex hydrodynamics characterized by the presence of large scale turbulent coherent structures of different temporal and spatial scales with high rotational components generated by the operation of the turbines these flows can have a significant influence on the surrounding environment in several key aspects including the local hydrodynamics sediment transport ecosystem dynamics and submarine noise among others and the dynamics of wake interactions in turbine arrays can also play an important role on energy extraction performances myers and bahaj 2012 three dimensional 3 d numerical simulations have become essential tools to assess the flows past mhk devices as they provide thorough information to support a wide range of application cases models can represent the complex unsteady hydrodynamics involved especially related to the wake development and the velocity recovery downstream of the devices and explore the connections with the performance of the turbines zhang et al 2020 computational approaches provide insights on the local dynamics of turbine arrays to enhance the energy extraction strategies and assess their consequences on the surrounding environment nash and phoenix 2017 previous investigations have provided important insights from numerical simulations using coherent structure resolving turbulence models including interactions with the bed ouro and stoesser 2019 and the dynamics of turbulence produced in the wake ahmadi and yang 2020 computationally expensive simulations that focus on specific turbine designs resolve the details of the turbine geometry in the discretizations kang et al 2014 chawdhary et al 2017 while simulations aimed at evaluating the effects on the flow in the far field or with multiple devices typically employ flexible approaches that simplify the representation of the turbines batten et al 1985 stevens et al 2018 gajardo et al 2019 gotelli et al 2019 soto rivas et al 2019 these representations that can be easily modified are also an advantage for mhk devices that have a wider variety of geometries compared to more established designs of wind turbines to capture the interactions of the flow with mhk devices at different levels of detail we need to make two critical modeling choices 1 a flow solver with a turbulence approach to compute the velocity and pressure field in high reynolds number conditions and 2 a dynamic representation of the turbines with a methodology that can capture the interactions of the devices with the flow concerning the flow solver selected to study the dynamics of turbine wakes previous investigations have shown that either large eddy simulation les creech et al 2017 kang et al 2014 or hybrid turbulence models that combine unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with les urans les such as the detached eddy simulation des approach gajardo et al 2019 gotelli et al 2019 soto rivas et al 2019 can resolve the most energetic large scale coherent structures of the wakes using affordable computational resources for the representation of the turbines on the other hand there is a wide range of approaches from considering the devices as an enhanced bottom drag at large scales kramer and piggott 2016 to a very detailed representation of the specific geometry of the device kang et al 2014 in between the so called momentum sink approaches have the flexibility to incorporate multiple devices or rapidly adapt to changes on the design of the turbine geometry in these approaches mhk turbines are represented by adding external forces in the momentum conservation equations of the flow and their computational cost is related to the complexity of the actuator model to calculate these forces in general for the momentum sink approaches there are three options with different levels of complexity and computational costs the simplest is the actuator disk model adm burton et al 2011 soto rivas et al 2019 that represents the turbines by incorporating a force per unit volume within the disk region which encompasses the entire volume occupied by the turbine in the adm approach therefore the devices are represented by a thrust force and the geometrical details of the turbine and blades are not considered a more complex model is the blade element momentum bem approach creech et al 2015 gajardo et al 2019 which incorporates the turbine rotation defined by the tip speed ratio tsr and also the blade geometry to compute the local instantaneous forces in the actuator volume as a function of the disk radius finally the more sophisticated approach is the actuator line model alm sørensen and shen 2002 which represents the individual blades by distributing forces along lines that represent their instantaneous position in alm the forces exerted on the flow field are parameterized by using data from the blade geometry and the local hydrodynamics a comparison of turbine resolved simulations with two of these approaches adm and alm exhibited some differences among the numerical solutions kang et al 2014 the simulations for a turbine with a large hub and nacelle showed that capturing the precessing vortex breakdown downstream of the hub was necessary to resolve the near wake and the interactions that give rise to the wake meandering process in this investigation we perform three dimensional 3 d numerical simulations by using the des flow solver gajardo et al 2019 gotelli et al 2019 soto rivas et al 2019 coupled with the three different actuator formulations mentioned above adm bem and alm for representing one device with a small hub stallard et al 1985 we focus on the dominant structures of the mean and instantaneous flow and their influence on the main physical mechanisms that drive the exchange of momentum and energy in the wake we consider some additional features as low frequency oscillations wake meandering and other instabilities due to their relevance on the dissipation processes and its potential effects on downstream devices in turbine arrays the main objective of this study is to analyze the effects of large scale coherent structures generated due to the flow device interaction in the actuator type approximations their influence on the velocity recovery the dissipation mechanisms and the dominant turbulent features of the wake with this information we can describe the advantages and disadvantages of choosing different actuator approaches and provide information to select the most appropriate for specific cases the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we provide an overview of the computational framework which embeds the flow and actuator models in section 3 we describe the details of the study case and computational setup in section 4 we present the main results of this investigation with the three actuator representations the conclusions of this study and topics for future work are provided in section 5 2 numerical modeling of horizontal axial tidal turbines 2 1 flow governing equations the governing equations for the resolved flow are the three dimensional incompressible unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations urans for mass and momentum conservation these equations are expressed in non dimensional form and tensor notation as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j p x i 1 r e 2 u i x j x j x j u i u j s i where s i is a momentum source or sink term and it corresponds to the non dimensional force per unit volume incorporated into the flow by the corresponding actuator model r e is the bulk reynolds number of the flow and the length and velocity scales used to non dimensionalize the equation are the mean water depth h and mean free stream velocity u respectively for the turbulence closure we employed the hybrid urans les model known as detached eddy simulation des spalart and allmaras 1994 spalart 2009 which is a one equation eddy viscosity transport model the des approach works as an unsteady reynolds averaged model urans near the walls reducing the computational costs compared to wall resolving les meanwhile far from solid boundaries the turbulence model spalart and allmaras 1994 becomes a subgrid scale model that can resolve the large scale dynamics of turbulence in the main flow at the grid resolution the governing equations are solved in generalized curvilinear coordinates using a dual time stepping artificial compressibility ac iteration scheme the ac form of the governing equations is discretized using a second order accurate finite volume method on a non staggered computational grid the performance and application of this model has been extensively discussed in a series of previous investigations paik et al 2007 paik et al 2010 escauriaza and sotiropoulos 2011a escauriaza and sotiropoulos 1029 escauriaza and sotiropoulos 2011b link et al 2012 gajardo et al 2019 sandoval et al 2019 soto rivas et al 2019 gotelli et al 2019 2 2 actuator representations to represent mhk devices in the flow we coupled the des model with three different actuator models adm bem and alm all of them are based on the momentum sink approach to account for the effects of the turbines in the flow represented through the incorporation of an equivalent body force into the momentum conservation equation 2 even though these approaches do not resolve the complex coherent structure dynamics induced in the flow by the full turbine geometry they exhibit considerable advantages in terms of the computational costs involved and they are a suitable tool to study the wake dynamics induced by the rotor at different complexity levels the main differences among the actuator models considered in this study are the calculation of the force and the rotational dynamics incorporated in each model these approaches are sorted from the simplest to the more complex as adm bem and alm a schematic representation of the difference between the three methods is presented in fig 1 in the following subsections we describe the details on the implementation of each model 2 2 1 actuator disk model the actuator disk model is one of the simplest methods to represent mhk devices since it does not take into account the geometry nor the rotation of the devices in this model the momentum sink is represented by a thrust force that is incorporated into the streamwise direction f 1 of the momentum conservation equation this force is distributed in the grid nodes inside the rotor area a d and it is defined as follows 3 f 1 1 2 ρ u 2 a d c t where u is the undisturbed velocity in the streamwise direction upstream the disk and c t is the thrust coefficient which is defined as the ratio between the axial force acting upon the turbine and the kinetic energy in the incoming flow as described in soto rivas et al 2019 this formulation for computing instantaneous streamwise force may not be suitable in unsteady 3 d simulations especially inside an arrangement of turbines where it is not clear what to use as undisturbed velocity for this reason we implemented a modified approach suggested by meyers and meneveau 2010 and calaf et al 2010 for les adm simulations this method uses the velocity at the disk s rotor u d and a modified thrust coefficient c t which is related to c t as follows 4 c t c t 1 a 2 where a 1 2 1 1 c t is the induction factor burton et al 2011 this way we calculated the force in the streamwise direction by using the following expression which is equivalent to equation 3 but it is now based on local flow velocity at the disk so that 5 f 1 1 2 ρ u d 2 a d c t for consistency among models in our adm case we used the thrust coefficient calculated from the simulations performed by gajardo et al 2019 which corresponds to the bem case analyzed in the present work the thrust coefficient obtained by gajardo et al 2019 was c t 0 8 which conduits to a value of a 0 27 and c t 1 5 to obtain a better representation of the force exerted by the disk the value of c t is not uniformly distributed over the whole rotor area instead we use a gaussian distribution centered at the rotor center to obtain the resultant c t 1 5 the parameters of the distribution are an average c t 1 88 and a standard deviation of σ d 2 for further information about this methodology see the recent investigation on wake interactions among turbines of soto rivas et al 2019 also mikkelsen and sørensen 2004 and appendix a 2 2 2 blade element momentum model in this approach the forces produced by the rotor over the flow i e lift and drag are determined instantaneously by spatially averaging the local forces acting over rings which correspond to a radial discretization of a disk with an area equivalent to the rotor cross section as seen in fig 1 for a ring at radius r r a constant average effect is considered which depends only on local flow conditions and the blade geometry at that specific distance from the center of the rotor despite the advantage of using a simplified turbine representation allowing a more straightforward and better quality mesh when averaging in time it is not possible to describe flow characteristics derived from the position of each blade malki et al 2014 in our model we used the bem approach proposed by creech et al 2015 which has recently been successfully coupled with des gajardo et al 2019 gotelli et al 2019 following this method the relative speed u r e l is calculated as 6 u r e l u 2 r ω r e l 2 where u is the local instantaneous streamwise velocity component and ω r e l is the relative rotational speed between the blade and the fluid the latter is written as 7 ω r e l r ω v sin θ b w cos θ b where θ b is the azimuthal angle between a grid point and the horizontal plane as shown in fig 2 v and w are the local transverse and vertical velocity components respectively and ω is the turbine rotational speed which is assumed constant in addition the relative flow angle is obtained by the following expression 8 φ tan 1 u ω r e l r we calculate the local angle of attack α by subtracting the local blade twist angle as follows 9 α φ β the lift and drag forces per span unit length on the blades are calculated as a function of the radial distance the relative velocity and the angle of attack such that 10 f 2 d f l f d 11 f l f d 1 2 ρ u r e l 2 c r c l α r e l ˆ c d α r e d ˆ where l ˆ and d ˆ are the local lift and drag directions for each grid point and c l α r e and c d α r e are obtained from whelan and stallard 2011a these forces per unit length must be transformed into forces per unit of volume creech et al 2015 proposed the following expressions 12 f l η x n b 2 π r f l 13 f d η x n b 2 π r f d where n b is the number of blades and η x is a gaussian function used to distribute the forces axially inside the turbine volume see appendix a for more details lift and drag forces are then projected in the cartesian coordinate system 14 f x f l cos φ f d sin φ 15 f y sin θ f l sin φ f d cos φ 16 f z cos θ f l sin φ f d cos φ concerning the hub we opted to represent it as a region located within the turbine volume consistent with bem where the nodes have a zero velocity condition in every direction even though this option is not the optimal representation of the nacelle geometry the results show a good agreement with experimental data as shown in our previous work gajardo et al 2019 gotelli et al 2019 2 2 3 actuator lines model the actuator lines model represents the turbine as body forces in the flow equal and opposite to the lift and drag forces experienced by the turbine sørensen and shen 2002 churchfield et al 1985 each blade of the turbine is represented by a line which is divided into a number of equally distributed segments represented by actuator points to compute lift and drag forces we perform the same geometrical decomposition used in bem which is shown in fig 2 each actuator point represents a blade section with a known geometry chord length and twist angle and lift and drag coefficients see fig 2 depending on the relative velocity angle the angle of attack is computed with that information and the local reynolds number the lift and drag coefficients are obtained from whelan and stallard 2011a and used to compute lift and drag forces finally we filter the forces by a gaussian function as proposed by sørensen et al 2015 to smooth spurious velocity oscillations and project them on the 3 d flow to spread the forces in space we follow the methodology proposed by sørensen and shen 2002 where the force at a grid cell located at x y z is related to the actuator line forces as follows 17 f x y z b 1 n b r h r f 2 d r b η ε d d r b here n b is the number of blades d is the distance between the point located at x y z and the actuator point of the b blade located at r b from the center of the rotor f 2 d f l f d computed locally for each actuator point and η ε is a gaussian projection function defined as 18 η ε 1 ε 3 π 3 2 exp d 2 ε 2 where ε is the radius of the projection force and it is computed as ε 2 δ x δ y δ z sørensen and shen 2002 to incorporate the effects of the hub in alm we implement a zero velocity condition within the center of the turbine the same as in the bem approach gajardo et al 2019 gotelli et al 2019 2 3 study case and model setup the study case selected for this investigation corresponds to the turbine used as part of the performance of arrays of wave and tidal perawat project results are contrasted with the experimental work carried out by stallard et al 1985 thomson et al 2011 and whelan and stallard 2011b the device corresponds to a three bladed turbine with a göettingen 804 foil geometry with radial chord length and twists variations the blockage factor ratio between frontal area swept by the turbine and the cross section area is 2 54 and according to previously reported blockage studies the blocking effects can be considered negligible nishino and willden 2012 chamorro et al 2013 main turbine parameters and flow conditions for this case are presented in table 1 for the numerical simulations with all three actuator representations we use the same rectangular grid with a total of approximately 10 million nodes the spatial resolution is higher at the zone where the turbine is located for details see fig 3 in this region the resolution in streamwise direction was δ x d 10 2 whereas the resolution in transverse and vertical direction was δ y d δ z d 8 3 10 3 respectively for alm a total of 30 actuator points were used resulting in a blade resolution of δ r b d 1 5 10 2 which was shown by troldborg et al 2010 to fulfill the basic demands for a well resolved les the resolution for the actuator models is 54 nodes across the rotor diameter which is greater than previous studies for simulations of flows with similar conditions lu and porté agel 2011 churchfield et al 2012 chawdhary et al 2017 kang et al 2014 ouro et al 2017 the mesh is also clustered near the solid walls using a hyperbolic tangent distribution with y 1 0 this configuration supported on the previous studies listed above showed that this grid is adequate for capturing all the fundamental physical phenomena associated with tidal turbines relevant parameters related to mesh resolution are summarized in table 2 for the inlet boundary condition we used the random flow generator technique proposed by smirnov et al 2001 which is capable of reproducing the ambient turbulence intensity measured in the experiments 10 stallard et al 1985 through this technique an unsteady velocity field is incorporated at the inlet each time step which preserves the turbulent features of the flow in the experiments gajardo et al 2019 gotelli et al 2019 no slip conditions are imposed at all solid boundaries while a zero shear and rigid plane boundary condition is applied at the free surface the assumption of rigid lid is based on the froude number value see table 1 which is far from the range were free surface perturbations become considerable furthermore previous studies on hydrokinetic turbines in open channel flows for similar froude number and vertical blockage ratio d h conditions kinsey and dumas 2017 have shown that rigid lid assumption is an acceptable modeling approach for parameters values in this range kang et al 2014 chawdhary et al 2017 ouro et al 2017 3 results 3 1 time averaged flow field we start the analysis by comparing the numerical results of the three actuator models with experimental data in fig 4 we plot the velocity deficit u d 1 u u and turbulence intensity i in the streamwise direction where 19 i σ u u u u u regarding the velocity deficit in the streamwise direction fig 4 a we observe that two diameters 2 d downstream the turbine bem and alm underpredict the deficit measured in the experiments especially in the hub area however 4 d downstream of the device the results become more accurate since the effect of the hub appears in both measurements and simulated data concerning the adm representation we can observe that it significantly overpredicts the deficit at the center 4d downstream of the device which is related to the calculation of the thrust force in every point inside the disk by using the local velocity while previous studies at larger scales and with different coefficients have a better adjustment by using a constant thrust force based on the average velocity on the entire disc area yang et al 2014 stevens et al 2018 it is important to note that the adm representation used here has a larger thrust force only at the disc center near the device we have not attempted any calibration of the parameters to modify the computational results in this case as the purpose of the simulations is to capture the general effects of the adm approach and not to produce a case specific simulation designed to solve this discrepancy for the rest of the locations downstream of the turbine the discrepancies between the representations become less significant especially 10 d downstream where the differences in the hub area become negligible fig 5 shows the velocity in the wake of the turbine at z z h u b for the three models and compares them with the experimental data the adm approach overestimates the velocity deficit caused by the turbine while the bem and alm results indicate the opposite for the first 5 d 7 d downstream after this point in the wake the three models overestimate the deficit with adm having the best results followed by alm and bem regarding the turbulence statistics in fig 4 b we can observe that all the approaches reproduce the increment of turbulence intensity at the tip both for 2 d and 4 d downstream of the device meanwhile the turbulence generated by the hub is only captured by bem and alm approaches furthermore we note that the differences among the profiles become more significant as we move downstream of the turbine this discrepancy is due to the distribution of the applied forces which produces distinct sizes of the main coherent structures downstream to every case those above cause that the wake in the alm case dissipates faster than for the bem and adm approaches it is important to note that the simulated values correspond only to the resolved component of turbulence meanwhile the measured data shows the total value the disk representation also affects the shape and length of the wake downstream of the devices fig 6 shows the limit where the time averaged streamwise velocity downstream of the turbines recovers the 99 of inlet velocity the figure depicts the differences on the wake expansion for each model where the wake downstream of the disks is wider for adm than for bem and alm these conditions occur because in adm the disk exerts a uniform force which is only modulated by the gaussian distribution described in appendix a soto rivas et al 2019 these conditions concentrate the momentum source in the center of the disk in the opposite direction of the flow which bifurcates leading to the wake expansion on the other hand for bem and alm where the local force term in the flow is three dimensional the flow is directed to local drag and lift directions see fig 2 and exhibits a lower wake expansion furthermore in the case of alm where the rotation of the blades is explicitly incorporated in the model the results show the inherent asymmetry of the wake produced by the turbine operation which has been reported previously both experimentally and numerically churchfield et al 1985 afgan et al 2013 chawdhary et al 2017 to study the effects of the actuator formulations on the spatial characteristics of the time averaged flow field in fig 7 we plot contours of the streamwise velocity component for a horizontal plane at z h u b the velocity shows both the local and near wake mechanisms of momentum extraction generation of the velocity deficit and far wake recovery dynamics in each case the three models exhibit a pronounced velocity deficit in the near wake followed by a gradual wake recovery which extends up to 20 d downstream of the turbine in the case of adm the results exhibit the presence of a reversed flow between 2 d and 4 d generating a recirculation zone immediately downstream of the turbine as commonly observed in flows downstream of obstacles or past a flat plate perpendicular to the flow in the case of bem two zones of the velocity deficit can be distinguished the first one corresponds to the hub wake whereas the deficit induced by the region of the blades surrounds it up to a distance of 5 d downstream approximately at this location two regions converge and the wake mixes completely in the case of alm these two regions can be distinguished as well but the wake mixes thoroughly before 4 d another essential aspect to consider is the capability of the models to represent wake rotation to depict the rotational features captured by each model in fig 8 we plot the non dimensional vertical velocity for the same plane shown in fig 7 in the case of adm in which rotation is not included the vertical velocity distribution in the wake is mostly related to the recirculation pattern behind the disk that was previously described the location of maximum vertical velocity coincides with the location of the maximum streamwise velocity deficit which again points to the fact that this model induces a wake dynamics more similar to a solid flat plate as expected in the case of bem the model exhibits a wake rotation consistent with the counter clockwise rotation of the turbine nevertheless this model is not capable of capturing the tip rotation which moves in the same direction of the rotor tony 2001 kang et al 2014 this phenomenon is well captured by alm which clearly shows the inner wake rotation opposite to the rotation of the rotor and outer wake rotation in the same direction of the rotor rotation the results show that the complex rotational dynamics of the wake can only be captured if the discrete rotation of the blades is explicitly included in the model in addition to the velocity results mentioned above in fig 9 we plot the vertical vorticity distribution in the wake to analyze the tip shear layer and the dynamics of the inner section of the wake for each actuator model the vorticity patterns observed in adm are consistent with the recirculating structure described previously on the time averaged velocity distribution in the case of bem and alm the tip shear layer shows lower values of vorticity due to the lower acceleration at the tip compared with adm in the bem simulations the vorticity distribution shows the effects of the hub in the inner wake where a high vorticity region is observed in the case of alm the vorticity distribution shows the complex interaction of different turbulent structures in the inner wake which increases momentum transfer at these locations we also analyze the second order statistics of the flow by computing the resolved turbulent kinetic energy t k e defined as follows 20 t k e 1 2 u i u i the spatial distribution of t k e also provides information on the statistical influence of large scale turbulent structures on the mean flow in fig 10 some important differences are observed among the three actuator type models mostly related to the evolution of the tip shear layer and the influence of the hub on the t k e distribution in the adm representation fig 10 a we observe that just next to the turbine there is a zone with low tke that is extended up to 2 d downstream which is produced by the substantial velocity deficit behind the device downstream the t k e shows a significant increment due to the tip shear layer expansion the increase of t k e coincides with the location of the recirculating cell induced by the device which is observed in the mean flow field see fig 7 for bem and alm t k e profiles show similar patterns in fig 10 b and 10 c we observe pockets of high t k e around the tip and the hub areas both zones of high t k e extend downstream in a nearly columnar way and merge around 2 d downstream of the disk for bem and 4 d for alm the differences are governed by the rotation dynamics of each model since the more detailed representation of the blades in alm produces a higher t k e region just downstream of the device whereas in the case of bem this zone is mostly concentrated in the tip shear layer which is similar to adm previous investigations have suggested that these high t k e values in locations between 3 d and 5 d downstream could be related to large scale oscillations of the wake lyu et al 1204 the swirling vortex is advected downstream the hub and collides with the outer wake as it expands producing an unstable flow that exhibits large scale oscillations or the so called wake meandering other authors have reported that it is only possible to capture this dynamic feature correctly if the full geometry of the rotor is resolved kang et al 2014 howard et al 2015 however large scale oscillations of the wake for two actuator type models have been reported kang et al 2014 but at a different location and with no significant differences on t k e magnitude compared with experimental results and full geometry simulations on the other hand lyu et al 1204 showed regions of high t k e magnitude also related to the wake meandering from les calculations in fig 11 we show the instantaneous peak velocity deficit filtered by using the methodology proposed in howard et al 2015 to remove spurious oscillations to track wake meandering and capture the large scale motion of the wake even though the representation of the turbine geometry in all three actuator representations is very simplified we observe large scale oscillations in all three models but these characteristics have different origins as we explain in the next section for now in this figure we observe that the envelope of the wake is wider for adm compared to the other two cases which is also consistent with fig 6 3 2 coherent structure dynamics local interactions between the flow and the turbine lead to the generation of unsteady large scale coherent structures that control the dynamics of the wake these structures evolve as they move downstream and constitute the main mechanisms of energy momentum transport and velocity recovery along the wake the selection of the actuator model to represent the turbines in the flow has a strong influence on the coherent structure dynamics resolved in the wake in this section we describe the most relevant dynamic features of the coherent structures observed in the wake produced by each model as we seek to elucidate the influence of these representations on the wake dynamics and its evolution to obtain a visualization of the instantaneous 3 d coherent dynamics of the flow we use the q criterion jcr et al 1988 defined as a scalar that is computed as follows 21 q 1 2 ω i j ω i j s i j s i j where ω i j and s i j corresponds to the antisymmetric and symmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor respectively the large scale coherent structures are identified in regions where q 0 where local rotation rate magnitude is higher than the strain rate in fig 12 we show instantaneous images of the coherent structures of the wake generated by each model by using q criterion and colored by the streamwise velocity noticeable differences are observed in the topology and spatial distribution of the large scale vortices generated by each actuator model in the adm where the forces applied on the flow are strictly horizontal the flow experiments a strong adverse pressure gradient which leads the formation of a zone with high velocity deficit behind the turbine inner wake and a zone that exhibits substantial acceleration in the tip region outer wake in the outer wake region large arch shaped vortices emerge leading the expansion of the flow as they move downstream and interact with the vortices of the inner wake region since a different dynamical treatment of the hub and blades is incorporated in the bem model the inner and outer wake are characterized by different vortical structures representative of the root and tip vortices respectively see fig 12 the model does not capture in detail the rotational dynamics of the tip vortices but the distribution of the local force in 3 d space leads to the diminishing of the artificial wake expansion and tip acceleration seen in the previous case finally in the alm case the discrete representation of the blades can capture the rotational dynamics of the tip vortices this approach produces the decrease of the wake expansion and enhances mixing in the near wake region which reduces the distance of mean velocity recovery the results show that as we improve the details of the representation of the turbine the spatial complexity of instantaneous large scale structures increases as well furthermore the structures become smaller and contain more complex rotational dynamics the dynamics of the energy transfer across scales suggest that the formation of smaller vortices contributes to the mixing of momentum in the wake these results provide a comprehensive and consistent explanation of the mechanisms that drive the dynamics of flow described in the previous subsection 3 1 to provide additional insights about the dominant time scales in the wake we analyze the power spectrum of the resolved vertical velocity at the top height of the turbine in the center of the channel fig 13 shows how the level of complexity of the model affects the way that the energy is transferred from the large scales to the smaller ones especially in the very near wake i e 1 d and 2 d downstream of the turbine in particular we observe 1 d downstream the device the inertial subrange with a slope m 5 3 at other distances the inertial subrange is more limited in the simulations as the rotational features occupy the energy containing part of the spectra at distances of 1 d and 2 d downstream from the turbine alm captures the top tip vortex shedding frequency which is equal to 3 f t where f t is the turbine rotation period fig 13 a b meanwhile neither the adm nor the bem approaches can capture this peak in the spectrum even though bem contains a rotational component the frequency associated with the peak i e 3 f t has been reported before for three blade turbines in the near wake region both experimental and numerically kang et al 2014 markfort et al 1080 chamorro and porté agel 2010 zhang et al 2012 other experimental investigations zhang et al 2012 have shown harmonic frequencies for 3 f t in spectra at distances smaller than 1 d downstream the turbine which we cannot represent due to the simplified representation of the geometry of the devices to estimate the peak in frequency shown in fig 13 we can use the time series of streamwise velocity at the top and the distance between consecutive top tip vortices in our case the distance between vortices is around 0 23 d as shown in fig 12 we thus estimate a frequency of 7 6 h z which coincides with the most energetic frequency content shown in the power spectra finally we can see that at a location 4 d downstream from the turbines fig 13 c the spectra of all three models become similar to each other this condition highlights the fact that no distinguishable structures emerging from the actuator models dominate the wake dynamics further than 4 d downstream where the wake is mostly mixed 3 3 effects on the bed one of the key points to evaluate in mhk operation is the effect of fluid device interaction on bottom shear dynamics this point is crucial to predict the depositional patterns of the sediment eroded due to the local interaction of the flow with the turbine as we have shown in previous research gotelli et al 2019 to evaluate this effect for each actuator model we compute the instantaneous friction velocity u at each time step and on every point of the bed the times series of u were used to compute the mean and standard deviation for the entire horizontal domain on the bed the friction velocity distribution is shown in fig 14 as we can see in this figure the friction velocity distribution is quite different in adm compared with bem and alm while the lowest values of u for bem and alm are located at downstream distances between 0 and 3d in adm the smallest values are located in two zones immediately upstream of the turbine and between 3 and 5 diameters downstream this is mainly explained by the structure of the velocity deficit induced by each model adm induces a high velocity deficit in the streamwise direction and the flow tends to accelerate under the actuator disk as we discussed in the previous section this mechanism leads the generation of a shear layer with large scale coherent structures these structures mix with the surrounding flow and dissipate energy as they move downstream which leads the high values of u in the vicinity of the actuator disk downstream the device in the case of bem and alm the incorporation of a three dimensional decomposition prevents the excessive acceleration of the flow under the devices leading to a friction velocity distribution where the lower values are located immediately downstream the turbine where the velocity deficit is maximum since sand particles at the channel bed are usually in critical equilibrium conditions gotelli et al 2019 hill et al 2014 hill et al 2016 it implies that any alteration in the shear stress distribution would generate changes in scour and deposition patterns for this reason the time variability of the distribution of bed stresses is also critical to evaluate the effects on sediment transport in fig 15 we show the distribution of the rms root mean square of u even though the maximum values of u r m s are approximately the same for all three cases differences are smaller than 5 among the models the figure indicates that the variability of u induced by each model is significantly different in the case of alm as this model produces a more intense mixing in the near wake region it generates a decrease in bed shear turbulent fluctuations on the other hand adm presents a wide region with high fluctuations these results depicts the importance of the instantaneous dynamics of the turbulent flow induced by the actuator model on bottom stresses where strong coherent motions as shear layer vortices induced by adm are shown to be the most important mechanism for inducing turbulent fluctuations on the bed 4 conclusions and future work in this work we carried out 3 d numerical simulations of turbulent flow past a hydrokinetic turbine tested experimentally stallard et al 1985 by using the des approach coupled with three actuator type models an actuator disk model adm blade element momentum bem and actuator lines model alm we focus on the effects of the coherent structure dynamics induced in the wake by each model with emphasis on the influence in the wake recovery and mixing mechanisms downstream the device we briefly summarize the general findings that we elaborate below 1 all three models resolve correctly the mean flow and velocity deficits from a distance of 4 d downstream of the turbine with errors smaller than 20 on the averaged flow 2 the adm approach produces a wider wake which is a consequence of the large arch type coherent vortices formed behind the disk calculated with the instantaneous resolved velocity 3 bem can reproduce better the mean features of the wake gajardo et al 2019 gotelli et al 2019 but not all the rotational effects are resolved 4 alm has all the topological characteristics of the instantaneous flow that have been observed in experiments and in geometry resolved simulations including the inner and outer wake interactions as also observed in wind turbines and 5 even though all three models show meandering wakes the origin of the process is different for adm and bem than the processes reported for mhk turbines since the disk models generate a continuous vortex shedding which are characteristic of flows past vertical plates in all these cases the inlet fluctuations reproduced from the experiment are small compared to these large scale vortical structures that scale with the turbine diameter the comparison between simulations and available experimental data shows the ability of each actuator model to capture the far wake velocity recovery the main differences are observed closer to the devices mostly in the region between the disk and 4 d downstream in this zone the dynamical formulation of the model has a strong influence on both the mean and instantaneous flow fields these differences are depicted by comparing the computed and measured turbulence intensity the results show that all the models capture the increased turbulence at the tip and only bem and alm capture the turbulence due to the presence of the hub the dynamical formulation of the actuator model also has a strong influence on the wake expansion dynamics we observe that the area swept by the resultant force and its direction cause differences in the time averaged results in the adm approach the device acts similar to a solid flat plate since the force is distributed in the entire disk area and is only applied in the streamwise direction the interaction between the flow and the disk causes a broader wake with a high velocity deficit and turbulence downstream in the bem approach the force is also distributed in the entire disk area however it is decomposed in three dimensional directions which causes attenuation in the streamwise velocity deficit and turbulence profiles finally in alm the force is only applied in the area of the blades which produces an even weaker streamwise velocity deficit and wake turbulence the results showed that the best approach to capture the rotational dynamics induced by the turbine is through a discrete blade representation which is alm we demonstrated that even though bem incorporates the effects of disk rotation in the computation of the local forces it is not able to capture the inner wake and outer wake rotational dynamics nor the inherent asymmetry of the wake the ability of the alm model to capture these mechanisms can also be observed in the topology of the coherent structures present in the wake downstream of the device we showed that as we increase the complexity of the flow device interactions the dynamics of the coherent structures exhibit a higher complexity as well enhancing momentum transfer and wake mixing as we reported in gotelli et al 2019 the bed stresses can contribute to the analysis of the effects of mhk turbines on the bed and the results underscore the differences of the variability of stresses for different models the spatial distribution of tke that we observe for each case also acquires relevance in the context of numerical simulations of tidal channels at larger scales that employ momentum sink approaches to incorporate the effects of turbines in the flow murray and gallego 2017 this statistic is important to modify turbulence production terms in large scale models since blade rotation and wake vortices induce additional shear that is not considered in typical isotropic two equation closures used in ocean models which need to represent the correct effects of the devices on the modeled part of the turbulent kinetic energy roc et al 2013 future work will focus on the study of the effects of the turbine representations on the dynamics of coherent structures in farms with multiple devices we will also explore a combination of actuator approaches in the model including the representation of some of the geometrical details of the support structure or the device in the numerical mesh to improve our representation of the wakes with moderate computational resources credit authorship contribution

supported by the supercomputing infrastructure of the nlhpc ecm 02 appendix a gaussian force distribution for representing the force in the adm approach we use a regularization kernel η that follows a gaussian distribution to apply the coefficient c t across the area of the turbine i e in a y z plane the maximum value c t 1 88 is located at the disk center to represent the increased momentum at the hub the kernel is a function of the distance between any point inside the turbine area and its center x as a 1 η x 1 2 π σ 2 exp 1 2 x σ 2 for the bem model the equation used for the gaussian distribution is the same nevertheless in this case the distribution of forces depends only on the longitudinal distance between the node and the rotor center x x x t since the azimuthal spreading of the forces is handled by the bem approach with the second term in equations 12 and 13 
21073,numerical models play a fundamental role in the development of marine hydrokinetic mhk turbines as they can evaluate their performance and assess interactions with the local environment actuator representations that incorporate a force in the momentum equation of the flow are commonly used in numerical models to study the complex dynamics of wakes generated by the devices however the implications of adopting any of these approaches in simulations of turbulent wakes are not yet clear to understand the effects produced by different approaches we carry out simulations using a coherent structure resolving turbulence model for which we test three actuator representations actuator disk blade element momentum and actuator lines we reproduce an experiment with a horizontal axis turbine and show the influence of each formulation on the mean flow and on the dynamics of the wake in all three cases unsteady large scale vortices govern the flow statistics but while the mean flow is captured reasonably well by all models they produce structures of different scales and rotational features that control the details of wake recovery these new insights can help define the most appropriate model for each specific flow and improve predictions at different spatial scales in future investigations keywords tidal turbines numerical modeling wake dynamics actuator models turbulence computational fluid dynamics 1 introduction interactions between marine hydrokinetic mhk devices and the flow in tidal channels produce turbulent wakes with complex hydrodynamics characterized by the presence of large scale turbulent coherent structures of different temporal and spatial scales with high rotational components generated by the operation of the turbines these flows can have a significant influence on the surrounding environment in several key aspects including the local hydrodynamics sediment transport ecosystem dynamics and submarine noise among others and the dynamics of wake interactions in turbine arrays can also play an important role on energy extraction performances myers and bahaj 2012 three dimensional 3 d numerical simulations have become essential tools to assess the flows past mhk devices as they provide thorough information to support a wide range of application cases models can represent the complex unsteady hydrodynamics involved especially related to the wake development and the velocity recovery downstream of the devices and explore the connections with the performance of the turbines zhang et al 2020 computational approaches provide insights on the local dynamics of turbine arrays to enhance the energy extraction strategies and assess their consequences on the surrounding environment nash and phoenix 2017 previous investigations have provided important insights from numerical simulations using coherent structure resolving turbulence models including interactions with the bed ouro and stoesser 2019 and the dynamics of turbulence produced in the wake ahmadi and yang 2020 computationally expensive simulations that focus on specific turbine designs resolve the details of the turbine geometry in the discretizations kang et al 2014 chawdhary et al 2017 while simulations aimed at evaluating the effects on the flow in the far field or with multiple devices typically employ flexible approaches that simplify the representation of the turbines batten et al 1985 stevens et al 2018 gajardo et al 2019 gotelli et al 2019 soto rivas et al 2019 these representations that can be easily modified are also an advantage for mhk devices that have a wider variety of geometries compared to more established designs of wind turbines to capture the interactions of the flow with mhk devices at different levels of detail we need to make two critical modeling choices 1 a flow solver with a turbulence approach to compute the velocity and pressure field in high reynolds number conditions and 2 a dynamic representation of the turbines with a methodology that can capture the interactions of the devices with the flow concerning the flow solver selected to study the dynamics of turbine wakes previous investigations have shown that either large eddy simulation les creech et al 2017 kang et al 2014 or hybrid turbulence models that combine unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with les urans les such as the detached eddy simulation des approach gajardo et al 2019 gotelli et al 2019 soto rivas et al 2019 can resolve the most energetic large scale coherent structures of the wakes using affordable computational resources for the representation of the turbines on the other hand there is a wide range of approaches from considering the devices as an enhanced bottom drag at large scales kramer and piggott 2016 to a very detailed representation of the specific geometry of the device kang et al 2014 in between the so called momentum sink approaches have the flexibility to incorporate multiple devices or rapidly adapt to changes on the design of the turbine geometry in these approaches mhk turbines are represented by adding external forces in the momentum conservation equations of the flow and their computational cost is related to the complexity of the actuator model to calculate these forces in general for the momentum sink approaches there are three options with different levels of complexity and computational costs the simplest is the actuator disk model adm burton et al 2011 soto rivas et al 2019 that represents the turbines by incorporating a force per unit volume within the disk region which encompasses the entire volume occupied by the turbine in the adm approach therefore the devices are represented by a thrust force and the geometrical details of the turbine and blades are not considered a more complex model is the blade element momentum bem approach creech et al 2015 gajardo et al 2019 which incorporates the turbine rotation defined by the tip speed ratio tsr and also the blade geometry to compute the local instantaneous forces in the actuator volume as a function of the disk radius finally the more sophisticated approach is the actuator line model alm sørensen and shen 2002 which represents the individual blades by distributing forces along lines that represent their instantaneous position in alm the forces exerted on the flow field are parameterized by using data from the blade geometry and the local hydrodynamics a comparison of turbine resolved simulations with two of these approaches adm and alm exhibited some differences among the numerical solutions kang et al 2014 the simulations for a turbine with a large hub and nacelle showed that capturing the precessing vortex breakdown downstream of the hub was necessary to resolve the near wake and the interactions that give rise to the wake meandering process in this investigation we perform three dimensional 3 d numerical simulations by using the des flow solver gajardo et al 2019 gotelli et al 2019 soto rivas et al 2019 coupled with the three different actuator formulations mentioned above adm bem and alm for representing one device with a small hub stallard et al 1985 we focus on the dominant structures of the mean and instantaneous flow and their influence on the main physical mechanisms that drive the exchange of momentum and energy in the wake we consider some additional features as low frequency oscillations wake meandering and other instabilities due to their relevance on the dissipation processes and its potential effects on downstream devices in turbine arrays the main objective of this study is to analyze the effects of large scale coherent structures generated due to the flow device interaction in the actuator type approximations their influence on the velocity recovery the dissipation mechanisms and the dominant turbulent features of the wake with this information we can describe the advantages and disadvantages of choosing different actuator approaches and provide information to select the most appropriate for specific cases the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we provide an overview of the computational framework which embeds the flow and actuator models in section 3 we describe the details of the study case and computational setup in section 4 we present the main results of this investigation with the three actuator representations the conclusions of this study and topics for future work are provided in section 5 2 numerical modeling of horizontal axial tidal turbines 2 1 flow governing equations the governing equations for the resolved flow are the three dimensional incompressible unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations urans for mass and momentum conservation these equations are expressed in non dimensional form and tensor notation as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j p x i 1 r e 2 u i x j x j x j u i u j s i where s i is a momentum source or sink term and it corresponds to the non dimensional force per unit volume incorporated into the flow by the corresponding actuator model r e is the bulk reynolds number of the flow and the length and velocity scales used to non dimensionalize the equation are the mean water depth h and mean free stream velocity u respectively for the turbulence closure we employed the hybrid urans les model known as detached eddy simulation des spalart and allmaras 1994 spalart 2009 which is a one equation eddy viscosity transport model the des approach works as an unsteady reynolds averaged model urans near the walls reducing the computational costs compared to wall resolving les meanwhile far from solid boundaries the turbulence model spalart and allmaras 1994 becomes a subgrid scale model that can resolve the large scale dynamics of turbulence in the main flow at the grid resolution the governing equations are solved in generalized curvilinear coordinates using a dual time stepping artificial compressibility ac iteration scheme the ac form of the governing equations is discretized using a second order accurate finite volume method on a non staggered computational grid the performance and application of this model has been extensively discussed in a series of previous investigations paik et al 2007 paik et al 2010 escauriaza and sotiropoulos 2011a escauriaza and sotiropoulos 1029 escauriaza and sotiropoulos 2011b link et al 2012 gajardo et al 2019 sandoval et al 2019 soto rivas et al 2019 gotelli et al 2019 2 2 actuator representations to represent mhk devices in the flow we coupled the des model with three different actuator models adm bem and alm all of them are based on the momentum sink approach to account for the effects of the turbines in the flow represented through the incorporation of an equivalent body force into the momentum conservation equation 2 even though these approaches do not resolve the complex coherent structure dynamics induced in the flow by the full turbine geometry they exhibit considerable advantages in terms of the computational costs involved and they are a suitable tool to study the wake dynamics induced by the rotor at different complexity levels the main differences among the actuator models considered in this study are the calculation of the force and the rotational dynamics incorporated in each model these approaches are sorted from the simplest to the more complex as adm bem and alm a schematic representation of the difference between the three methods is presented in fig 1 in the following subsections we describe the details on the implementation of each model 2 2 1 actuator disk model the actuator disk model is one of the simplest methods to represent mhk devices since it does not take into account the geometry nor the rotation of the devices in this model the momentum sink is represented by a thrust force that is incorporated into the streamwise direction f 1 of the momentum conservation equation this force is distributed in the grid nodes inside the rotor area a d and it is defined as follows 3 f 1 1 2 ρ u 2 a d c t where u is the undisturbed velocity in the streamwise direction upstream the disk and c t is the thrust coefficient which is defined as the ratio between the axial force acting upon the turbine and the kinetic energy in the incoming flow as described in soto rivas et al 2019 this formulation for computing instantaneous streamwise force may not be suitable in unsteady 3 d simulations especially inside an arrangement of turbines where it is not clear what to use as undisturbed velocity for this reason we implemented a modified approach suggested by meyers and meneveau 2010 and calaf et al 2010 for les adm simulations this method uses the velocity at the disk s rotor u d and a modified thrust coefficient c t which is related to c t as follows 4 c t c t 1 a 2 where a 1 2 1 1 c t is the induction factor burton et al 2011 this way we calculated the force in the streamwise direction by using the following expression which is equivalent to equation 3 but it is now based on local flow velocity at the disk so that 5 f 1 1 2 ρ u d 2 a d c t for consistency among models in our adm case we used the thrust coefficient calculated from the simulations performed by gajardo et al 2019 which corresponds to the bem case analyzed in the present work the thrust coefficient obtained by gajardo et al 2019 was c t 0 8 which conduits to a value of a 0 27 and c t 1 5 to obtain a better representation of the force exerted by the disk the value of c t is not uniformly distributed over the whole rotor area instead we use a gaussian distribution centered at the rotor center to obtain the resultant c t 1 5 the parameters of the distribution are an average c t 1 88 and a standard deviation of σ d 2 for further information about this methodology see the recent investigation on wake interactions among turbines of soto rivas et al 2019 also mikkelsen and sørensen 2004 and appendix a 2 2 2 blade element momentum model in this approach the forces produced by the rotor over the flow i e lift and drag are determined instantaneously by spatially averaging the local forces acting over rings which correspond to a radial discretization of a disk with an area equivalent to the rotor cross section as seen in fig 1 for a ring at radius r r a constant average effect is considered which depends only on local flow conditions and the blade geometry at that specific distance from the center of the rotor despite the advantage of using a simplified turbine representation allowing a more straightforward and better quality mesh when averaging in time it is not possible to describe flow characteristics derived from the position of each blade malki et al 2014 in our model we used the bem approach proposed by creech et al 2015 which has recently been successfully coupled with des gajardo et al 2019 gotelli et al 2019 following this method the relative speed u r e l is calculated as 6 u r e l u 2 r ω r e l 2 where u is the local instantaneous streamwise velocity component and ω r e l is the relative rotational speed between the blade and the fluid the latter is written as 7 ω r e l r ω v sin θ b w cos θ b where θ b is the azimuthal angle between a grid point and the horizontal plane as shown in fig 2 v and w are the local transverse and vertical velocity components respectively and ω is the turbine rotational speed which is assumed constant in addition the relative flow angle is obtained by the following expression 8 φ tan 1 u ω r e l r we calculate the local angle of attack α by subtracting the local blade twist angle as follows 9 α φ β the lift and drag forces per span unit length on the blades are calculated as a function of the radial distance the relative velocity and the angle of attack such that 10 f 2 d f l f d 11 f l f d 1 2 ρ u r e l 2 c r c l α r e l ˆ c d α r e d ˆ where l ˆ and d ˆ are the local lift and drag directions for each grid point and c l α r e and c d α r e are obtained from whelan and stallard 2011a these forces per unit length must be transformed into forces per unit of volume creech et al 2015 proposed the following expressions 12 f l η x n b 2 π r f l 13 f d η x n b 2 π r f d where n b is the number of blades and η x is a gaussian function used to distribute the forces axially inside the turbine volume see appendix a for more details lift and drag forces are then projected in the cartesian coordinate system 14 f x f l cos φ f d sin φ 15 f y sin θ f l sin φ f d cos φ 16 f z cos θ f l sin φ f d cos φ concerning the hub we opted to represent it as a region located within the turbine volume consistent with bem where the nodes have a zero velocity condition in every direction even though this option is not the optimal representation of the nacelle geometry the results show a good agreement with experimental data as shown in our previous work gajardo et al 2019 gotelli et al 2019 2 2 3 actuator lines model the actuator lines model represents the turbine as body forces in the flow equal and opposite to the lift and drag forces experienced by the turbine sørensen and shen 2002 churchfield et al 1985 each blade of the turbine is represented by a line which is divided into a number of equally distributed segments represented by actuator points to compute lift and drag forces we perform the same geometrical decomposition used in bem which is shown in fig 2 each actuator point represents a blade section with a known geometry chord length and twist angle and lift and drag coefficients see fig 2 depending on the relative velocity angle the angle of attack is computed with that information and the local reynolds number the lift and drag coefficients are obtained from whelan and stallard 2011a and used to compute lift and drag forces finally we filter the forces by a gaussian function as proposed by sørensen et al 2015 to smooth spurious velocity oscillations and project them on the 3 d flow to spread the forces in space we follow the methodology proposed by sørensen and shen 2002 where the force at a grid cell located at x y z is related to the actuator line forces as follows 17 f x y z b 1 n b r h r f 2 d r b η ε d d r b here n b is the number of blades d is the distance between the point located at x y z and the actuator point of the b blade located at r b from the center of the rotor f 2 d f l f d computed locally for each actuator point and η ε is a gaussian projection function defined as 18 η ε 1 ε 3 π 3 2 exp d 2 ε 2 where ε is the radius of the projection force and it is computed as ε 2 δ x δ y δ z sørensen and shen 2002 to incorporate the effects of the hub in alm we implement a zero velocity condition within the center of the turbine the same as in the bem approach gajardo et al 2019 gotelli et al 2019 2 3 study case and model setup the study case selected for this investigation corresponds to the turbine used as part of the performance of arrays of wave and tidal perawat project results are contrasted with the experimental work carried out by stallard et al 1985 thomson et al 2011 and whelan and stallard 2011b the device corresponds to a three bladed turbine with a göettingen 804 foil geometry with radial chord length and twists variations the blockage factor ratio between frontal area swept by the turbine and the cross section area is 2 54 and according to previously reported blockage studies the blocking effects can be considered negligible nishino and willden 2012 chamorro et al 2013 main turbine parameters and flow conditions for this case are presented in table 1 for the numerical simulations with all three actuator representations we use the same rectangular grid with a total of approximately 10 million nodes the spatial resolution is higher at the zone where the turbine is located for details see fig 3 in this region the resolution in streamwise direction was δ x d 10 2 whereas the resolution in transverse and vertical direction was δ y d δ z d 8 3 10 3 respectively for alm a total of 30 actuator points were used resulting in a blade resolution of δ r b d 1 5 10 2 which was shown by troldborg et al 2010 to fulfill the basic demands for a well resolved les the resolution for the actuator models is 54 nodes across the rotor diameter which is greater than previous studies for simulations of flows with similar conditions lu and porté agel 2011 churchfield et al 2012 chawdhary et al 2017 kang et al 2014 ouro et al 2017 the mesh is also clustered near the solid walls using a hyperbolic tangent distribution with y 1 0 this configuration supported on the previous studies listed above showed that this grid is adequate for capturing all the fundamental physical phenomena associated with tidal turbines relevant parameters related to mesh resolution are summarized in table 2 for the inlet boundary condition we used the random flow generator technique proposed by smirnov et al 2001 which is capable of reproducing the ambient turbulence intensity measured in the experiments 10 stallard et al 1985 through this technique an unsteady velocity field is incorporated at the inlet each time step which preserves the turbulent features of the flow in the experiments gajardo et al 2019 gotelli et al 2019 no slip conditions are imposed at all solid boundaries while a zero shear and rigid plane boundary condition is applied at the free surface the assumption of rigid lid is based on the froude number value see table 1 which is far from the range were free surface perturbations become considerable furthermore previous studies on hydrokinetic turbines in open channel flows for similar froude number and vertical blockage ratio d h conditions kinsey and dumas 2017 have shown that rigid lid assumption is an acceptable modeling approach for parameters values in this range kang et al 2014 chawdhary et al 2017 ouro et al 2017 3 results 3 1 time averaged flow field we start the analysis by comparing the numerical results of the three actuator models with experimental data in fig 4 we plot the velocity deficit u d 1 u u and turbulence intensity i in the streamwise direction where 19 i σ u u u u u regarding the velocity deficit in the streamwise direction fig 4 a we observe that two diameters 2 d downstream the turbine bem and alm underpredict the deficit measured in the experiments especially in the hub area however 4 d downstream of the device the results become more accurate since the effect of the hub appears in both measurements and simulated data concerning the adm representation we can observe that it significantly overpredicts the deficit at the center 4d downstream of the device which is related to the calculation of the thrust force in every point inside the disk by using the local velocity while previous studies at larger scales and with different coefficients have a better adjustment by using a constant thrust force based on the average velocity on the entire disc area yang et al 2014 stevens et al 2018 it is important to note that the adm representation used here has a larger thrust force only at the disc center near the device we have not attempted any calibration of the parameters to modify the computational results in this case as the purpose of the simulations is to capture the general effects of the adm approach and not to produce a case specific simulation designed to solve this discrepancy for the rest of the locations downstream of the turbine the discrepancies between the representations become less significant especially 10 d downstream where the differences in the hub area become negligible fig 5 shows the velocity in the wake of the turbine at z z h u b for the three models and compares them with the experimental data the adm approach overestimates the velocity deficit caused by the turbine while the bem and alm results indicate the opposite for the first 5 d 7 d downstream after this point in the wake the three models overestimate the deficit with adm having the best results followed by alm and bem regarding the turbulence statistics in fig 4 b we can observe that all the approaches reproduce the increment of turbulence intensity at the tip both for 2 d and 4 d downstream of the device meanwhile the turbulence generated by the hub is only captured by bem and alm approaches furthermore we note that the differences among the profiles become more significant as we move downstream of the turbine this discrepancy is due to the distribution of the applied forces which produces distinct sizes of the main coherent structures downstream to every case those above cause that the wake in the alm case dissipates faster than for the bem and adm approaches it is important to note that the simulated values correspond only to the resolved component of turbulence meanwhile the measured data shows the total value the disk representation also affects the shape and length of the wake downstream of the devices fig 6 shows the limit where the time averaged streamwise velocity downstream of the turbines recovers the 99 of inlet velocity the figure depicts the differences on the wake expansion for each model where the wake downstream of the disks is wider for adm than for bem and alm these conditions occur because in adm the disk exerts a uniform force which is only modulated by the gaussian distribution described in appendix a soto rivas et al 2019 these conditions concentrate the momentum source in the center of the disk in the opposite direction of the flow which bifurcates leading to the wake expansion on the other hand for bem and alm where the local force term in the flow is three dimensional the flow is directed to local drag and lift directions see fig 2 and exhibits a lower wake expansion furthermore in the case of alm where the rotation of the blades is explicitly incorporated in the model the results show the inherent asymmetry of the wake produced by the turbine operation which has been reported previously both experimentally and numerically churchfield et al 1985 afgan et al 2013 chawdhary et al 2017 to study the effects of the actuator formulations on the spatial characteristics of the time averaged flow field in fig 7 we plot contours of the streamwise velocity component for a horizontal plane at z h u b the velocity shows both the local and near wake mechanisms of momentum extraction generation of the velocity deficit and far wake recovery dynamics in each case the three models exhibit a pronounced velocity deficit in the near wake followed by a gradual wake recovery which extends up to 20 d downstream of the turbine in the case of adm the results exhibit the presence of a reversed flow between 2 d and 4 d generating a recirculation zone immediately downstream of the turbine as commonly observed in flows downstream of obstacles or past a flat plate perpendicular to the flow in the case of bem two zones of the velocity deficit can be distinguished the first one corresponds to the hub wake whereas the deficit induced by the region of the blades surrounds it up to a distance of 5 d downstream approximately at this location two regions converge and the wake mixes completely in the case of alm these two regions can be distinguished as well but the wake mixes thoroughly before 4 d another essential aspect to consider is the capability of the models to represent wake rotation to depict the rotational features captured by each model in fig 8 we plot the non dimensional vertical velocity for the same plane shown in fig 7 in the case of adm in which rotation is not included the vertical velocity distribution in the wake is mostly related to the recirculation pattern behind the disk that was previously described the location of maximum vertical velocity coincides with the location of the maximum streamwise velocity deficit which again points to the fact that this model induces a wake dynamics more similar to a solid flat plate as expected in the case of bem the model exhibits a wake rotation consistent with the counter clockwise rotation of the turbine nevertheless this model is not capable of capturing the tip rotation which moves in the same direction of the rotor tony 2001 kang et al 2014 this phenomenon is well captured by alm which clearly shows the inner wake rotation opposite to the rotation of the rotor and outer wake rotation in the same direction of the rotor rotation the results show that the complex rotational dynamics of the wake can only be captured if the discrete rotation of the blades is explicitly included in the model in addition to the velocity results mentioned above in fig 9 we plot the vertical vorticity distribution in the wake to analyze the tip shear layer and the dynamics of the inner section of the wake for each actuator model the vorticity patterns observed in adm are consistent with the recirculating structure described previously on the time averaged velocity distribution in the case of bem and alm the tip shear layer shows lower values of vorticity due to the lower acceleration at the tip compared with adm in the bem simulations the vorticity distribution shows the effects of the hub in the inner wake where a high vorticity region is observed in the case of alm the vorticity distribution shows the complex interaction of different turbulent structures in the inner wake which increases momentum transfer at these locations we also analyze the second order statistics of the flow by computing the resolved turbulent kinetic energy t k e defined as follows 20 t k e 1 2 u i u i the spatial distribution of t k e also provides information on the statistical influence of large scale turbulent structures on the mean flow in fig 10 some important differences are observed among the three actuator type models mostly related to the evolution of the tip shear layer and the influence of the hub on the t k e distribution in the adm representation fig 10 a we observe that just next to the turbine there is a zone with low tke that is extended up to 2 d downstream which is produced by the substantial velocity deficit behind the device downstream the t k e shows a significant increment due to the tip shear layer expansion the increase of t k e coincides with the location of the recirculating cell induced by the device which is observed in the mean flow field see fig 7 for bem and alm t k e profiles show similar patterns in fig 10 b and 10 c we observe pockets of high t k e around the tip and the hub areas both zones of high t k e extend downstream in a nearly columnar way and merge around 2 d downstream of the disk for bem and 4 d for alm the differences are governed by the rotation dynamics of each model since the more detailed representation of the blades in alm produces a higher t k e region just downstream of the device whereas in the case of bem this zone is mostly concentrated in the tip shear layer which is similar to adm previous investigations have suggested that these high t k e values in locations between 3 d and 5 d downstream could be related to large scale oscillations of the wake lyu et al 1204 the swirling vortex is advected downstream the hub and collides with the outer wake as it expands producing an unstable flow that exhibits large scale oscillations or the so called wake meandering other authors have reported that it is only possible to capture this dynamic feature correctly if the full geometry of the rotor is resolved kang et al 2014 howard et al 2015 however large scale oscillations of the wake for two actuator type models have been reported kang et al 2014 but at a different location and with no significant differences on t k e magnitude compared with experimental results and full geometry simulations on the other hand lyu et al 1204 showed regions of high t k e magnitude also related to the wake meandering from les calculations in fig 11 we show the instantaneous peak velocity deficit filtered by using the methodology proposed in howard et al 2015 to remove spurious oscillations to track wake meandering and capture the large scale motion of the wake even though the representation of the turbine geometry in all three actuator representations is very simplified we observe large scale oscillations in all three models but these characteristics have different origins as we explain in the next section for now in this figure we observe that the envelope of the wake is wider for adm compared to the other two cases which is also consistent with fig 6 3 2 coherent structure dynamics local interactions between the flow and the turbine lead to the generation of unsteady large scale coherent structures that control the dynamics of the wake these structures evolve as they move downstream and constitute the main mechanisms of energy momentum transport and velocity recovery along the wake the selection of the actuator model to represent the turbines in the flow has a strong influence on the coherent structure dynamics resolved in the wake in this section we describe the most relevant dynamic features of the coherent structures observed in the wake produced by each model as we seek to elucidate the influence of these representations on the wake dynamics and its evolution to obtain a visualization of the instantaneous 3 d coherent dynamics of the flow we use the q criterion jcr et al 1988 defined as a scalar that is computed as follows 21 q 1 2 ω i j ω i j s i j s i j where ω i j and s i j corresponds to the antisymmetric and symmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor respectively the large scale coherent structures are identified in regions where q 0 where local rotation rate magnitude is higher than the strain rate in fig 12 we show instantaneous images of the coherent structures of the wake generated by each model by using q criterion and colored by the streamwise velocity noticeable differences are observed in the topology and spatial distribution of the large scale vortices generated by each actuator model in the adm where the forces applied on the flow are strictly horizontal the flow experiments a strong adverse pressure gradient which leads the formation of a zone with high velocity deficit behind the turbine inner wake and a zone that exhibits substantial acceleration in the tip region outer wake in the outer wake region large arch shaped vortices emerge leading the expansion of the flow as they move downstream and interact with the vortices of the inner wake region since a different dynamical treatment of the hub and blades is incorporated in the bem model the inner and outer wake are characterized by different vortical structures representative of the root and tip vortices respectively see fig 12 the model does not capture in detail the rotational dynamics of the tip vortices but the distribution of the local force in 3 d space leads to the diminishing of the artificial wake expansion and tip acceleration seen in the previous case finally in the alm case the discrete representation of the blades can capture the rotational dynamics of the tip vortices this approach produces the decrease of the wake expansion and enhances mixing in the near wake region which reduces the distance of mean velocity recovery the results show that as we improve the details of the representation of the turbine the spatial complexity of instantaneous large scale structures increases as well furthermore the structures become smaller and contain more complex rotational dynamics the dynamics of the energy transfer across scales suggest that the formation of smaller vortices contributes to the mixing of momentum in the wake these results provide a comprehensive and consistent explanation of the mechanisms that drive the dynamics of flow described in the previous subsection 3 1 to provide additional insights about the dominant time scales in the wake we analyze the power spectrum of the resolved vertical velocity at the top height of the turbine in the center of the channel fig 13 shows how the level of complexity of the model affects the way that the energy is transferred from the large scales to the smaller ones especially in the very near wake i e 1 d and 2 d downstream of the turbine in particular we observe 1 d downstream the device the inertial subrange with a slope m 5 3 at other distances the inertial subrange is more limited in the simulations as the rotational features occupy the energy containing part of the spectra at distances of 1 d and 2 d downstream from the turbine alm captures the top tip vortex shedding frequency which is equal to 3 f t where f t is the turbine rotation period fig 13 a b meanwhile neither the adm nor the bem approaches can capture this peak in the spectrum even though bem contains a rotational component the frequency associated with the peak i e 3 f t has been reported before for three blade turbines in the near wake region both experimental and numerically kang et al 2014 markfort et al 1080 chamorro and porté agel 2010 zhang et al 2012 other experimental investigations zhang et al 2012 have shown harmonic frequencies for 3 f t in spectra at distances smaller than 1 d downstream the turbine which we cannot represent due to the simplified representation of the geometry of the devices to estimate the peak in frequency shown in fig 13 we can use the time series of streamwise velocity at the top and the distance between consecutive top tip vortices in our case the distance between vortices is around 0 23 d as shown in fig 12 we thus estimate a frequency of 7 6 h z which coincides with the most energetic frequency content shown in the power spectra finally we can see that at a location 4 d downstream from the turbines fig 13 c the spectra of all three models become similar to each other this condition highlights the fact that no distinguishable structures emerging from the actuator models dominate the wake dynamics further than 4 d downstream where the wake is mostly mixed 3 3 effects on the bed one of the key points to evaluate in mhk operation is the effect of fluid device interaction on bottom shear dynamics this point is crucial to predict the depositional patterns of the sediment eroded due to the local interaction of the flow with the turbine as we have shown in previous research gotelli et al 2019 to evaluate this effect for each actuator model we compute the instantaneous friction velocity u at each time step and on every point of the bed the times series of u were used to compute the mean and standard deviation for the entire horizontal domain on the bed the friction velocity distribution is shown in fig 14 as we can see in this figure the friction velocity distribution is quite different in adm compared with bem and alm while the lowest values of u for bem and alm are located at downstream distances between 0 and 3d in adm the smallest values are located in two zones immediately upstream of the turbine and between 3 and 5 diameters downstream this is mainly explained by the structure of the velocity deficit induced by each model adm induces a high velocity deficit in the streamwise direction and the flow tends to accelerate under the actuator disk as we discussed in the previous section this mechanism leads the generation of a shear layer with large scale coherent structures these structures mix with the surrounding flow and dissipate energy as they move downstream which leads the high values of u in the vicinity of the actuator disk downstream the device in the case of bem and alm the incorporation of a three dimensional decomposition prevents the excessive acceleration of the flow under the devices leading to a friction velocity distribution where the lower values are located immediately downstream the turbine where the velocity deficit is maximum since sand particles at the channel bed are usually in critical equilibrium conditions gotelli et al 2019 hill et al 2014 hill et al 2016 it implies that any alteration in the shear stress distribution would generate changes in scour and deposition patterns for this reason the time variability of the distribution of bed stresses is also critical to evaluate the effects on sediment transport in fig 15 we show the distribution of the rms root mean square of u even though the maximum values of u r m s are approximately the same for all three cases differences are smaller than 5 among the models the figure indicates that the variability of u induced by each model is significantly different in the case of alm as this model produces a more intense mixing in the near wake region it generates a decrease in bed shear turbulent fluctuations on the other hand adm presents a wide region with high fluctuations these results depicts the importance of the instantaneous dynamics of the turbulent flow induced by the actuator model on bottom stresses where strong coherent motions as shear layer vortices induced by adm are shown to be the most important mechanism for inducing turbulent fluctuations on the bed 4 conclusions and future work in this work we carried out 3 d numerical simulations of turbulent flow past a hydrokinetic turbine tested experimentally stallard et al 1985 by using the des approach coupled with three actuator type models an actuator disk model adm blade element momentum bem and actuator lines model alm we focus on the effects of the coherent structure dynamics induced in the wake by each model with emphasis on the influence in the wake recovery and mixing mechanisms downstream the device we briefly summarize the general findings that we elaborate below 1 all three models resolve correctly the mean flow and velocity deficits from a distance of 4 d downstream of the turbine with errors smaller than 20 on the averaged flow 2 the adm approach produces a wider wake which is a consequence of the large arch type coherent vortices formed behind the disk calculated with the instantaneous resolved velocity 3 bem can reproduce better the mean features of the wake gajardo et al 2019 gotelli et al 2019 but not all the rotational effects are resolved 4 alm has all the topological characteristics of the instantaneous flow that have been observed in experiments and in geometry resolved simulations including the inner and outer wake interactions as also observed in wind turbines and 5 even though all three models show meandering wakes the origin of the process is different for adm and bem than the processes reported for mhk turbines since the disk models generate a continuous vortex shedding which are characteristic of flows past vertical plates in all these cases the inlet fluctuations reproduced from the experiment are small compared to these large scale vortical structures that scale with the turbine diameter the comparison between simulations and available experimental data shows the ability of each actuator model to capture the far wake velocity recovery the main differences are observed closer to the devices mostly in the region between the disk and 4 d downstream in this zone the dynamical formulation of the model has a strong influence on both the mean and instantaneous flow fields these differences are depicted by comparing the computed and measured turbulence intensity the results show that all the models capture the increased turbulence at the tip and only bem and alm capture the turbulence due to the presence of the hub the dynamical formulation of the actuator model also has a strong influence on the wake expansion dynamics we observe that the area swept by the resultant force and its direction cause differences in the time averaged results in the adm approach the device acts similar to a solid flat plate since the force is distributed in the entire disk area and is only applied in the streamwise direction the interaction between the flow and the disk causes a broader wake with a high velocity deficit and turbulence downstream in the bem approach the force is also distributed in the entire disk area however it is decomposed in three dimensional directions which causes attenuation in the streamwise velocity deficit and turbulence profiles finally in alm the force is only applied in the area of the blades which produces an even weaker streamwise velocity deficit and wake turbulence the results showed that the best approach to capture the rotational dynamics induced by the turbine is through a discrete blade representation which is alm we demonstrated that even though bem incorporates the effects of disk rotation in the computation of the local forces it is not able to capture the inner wake and outer wake rotational dynamics nor the inherent asymmetry of the wake the ability of the alm model to capture these mechanisms can also be observed in the topology of the coherent structures present in the wake downstream of the device we showed that as we increase the complexity of the flow device interactions the dynamics of the coherent structures exhibit a higher complexity as well enhancing momentum transfer and wake mixing as we reported in gotelli et al 2019 the bed stresses can contribute to the analysis of the effects of mhk turbines on the bed and the results underscore the differences of the variability of stresses for different models the spatial distribution of tke that we observe for each case also acquires relevance in the context of numerical simulations of tidal channels at larger scales that employ momentum sink approaches to incorporate the effects of turbines in the flow murray and gallego 2017 this statistic is important to modify turbulence production terms in large scale models since blade rotation and wake vortices induce additional shear that is not considered in typical isotropic two equation closures used in ocean models which need to represent the correct effects of the devices on the modeled part of the turbulent kinetic energy roc et al 2013 future work will focus on the study of the effects of the turbine representations on the dynamics of coherent structures in farms with multiple devices we will also explore a combination of actuator approaches in the model including the representation of some of the geometrical details of the support structure or the device in the numerical mesh to improve our representation of the wakes with moderate computational resources credit authorship contribution

supported by the supercomputing infrastructure of the nlhpc ecm 02 appendix a gaussian force distribution for representing the force in the adm approach we use a regularization kernel η that follows a gaussian distribution to apply the coefficient c t across the area of the turbine i e in a y z plane the maximum value c t 1 88 is located at the disk center to represent the increased momentum at the hub the kernel is a function of the distance between any point inside the turbine area and its center x as a 1 η x 1 2 π σ 2 exp 1 2 x σ 2 for the bem model the equation used for the gaussian distribution is the same nevertheless in this case the distribution of forces depends only on the longitudinal distance between the node and the rotor center x x x t since the azimuthal spreading of the forces is handled by the bem approach with the second term in equations 12 and 13 
21074,the three dimensional vortex characteristics behind the wavy cylinders are studied by large eddy simulation les at re 3900 the wavelength ratios λ d m 1 8 5 0 and amplitude ratios a d m 0 05 0 2 are mainly considered the spanwise waviness is analyzed for the wavy cylinder on the flow control effect and the results of the unmodified cylinder uc are introduced for the comparison the results show that there is a strong three dimensional effect in the flow field distribution between the node and the saddle the phenomenon of the multi scale and the rib like vortices are observed in the wake region boundary vortex flux of the cylinder reveals the vortex generation mechanism the conversion of streamwise vortices further explain that mechanism in addition the length of vortex formation behind the wavy cylinder is longer than that of the uc the mean streamwise velocity distribution exhibits a semi symmetrical u shaped to v shaped transformation with the different characteristic positions with the increment of the amplitude ratio the statistical average of fluid force coefficients gradually reduces and reaches its minimum value at a d m 0 2 the effect of the flow control is close to that of the uc at λ d m 2 75 finally the wake control of the wavy cylinder is mainly related to vortex characteristics keywords wavy cylinder wavelength ratios amplitude ratios fluid dynamic forces flow characteristics 1 introduction the excessive flow induced forces have plagued many ocean and civil engineering applications such as deep water risers bridge stay cables etc due to the long terms exposure of the structure to the fluid load the kármán vortex shedding was produced it also generated periodic fluid forces which would cause structural vibration and fatigue failure therefore how to control the wake around the structure to reduce fluid forces had attracted the interest of many researchers at present the methods for flow control mainly include passive control methods zdravkovich 1981 choi et al 2008 demartino and ricciardelli 2017 ahmed and bays muchmore 1992 ahmed et al 1993 bearman and owen 1998 zhang et al 2005 2016 2018 lam et al 2004 2010 lam and lin 2007 2008 zhao et al 2011 zou and lin 2009 zou et al 2013 lin et al 2016 new et al 2015 and active control methods bourguet and jacono 2014 darvishyadegari and hassanzadeh 2019 patnaik and wei 2002 the passive control mainly suppressed the generation and development of the wake vortex by changing the geometric shape altering the inclined angle of the cylinder and adding the affiliated cylinders the active control required external energy input compared with the active control the passive controls were widely introduced because they had many advantages such as simple design and easy installation three passive control means were introduced by zdravkovich 1981 for suppressing vortex shedding which mainly included surface protrusions shrouds and near wake stabilizers the mechanism of vortex shedding was studied for these three categories and the findings included the analysis of the fluid force coefficient the pressure coefficient and so on choi et al 2008 summarized the flow visualization of different shapes of cylinders which mainly included the three dimensional vortex structure of a rectangular cylinder with a smooth stagnation surface and a wavy surface at low reynolds number meanwhile the phenomenon of flow separation was depicted under the subcritical reynolds number on the surface of a sphere the variation of such flow separation was also given along the axial direction for the unmodified cylinder uc recently demartino and ricciardelli 2017 summarized the existing literature related to the flow around the cylinder which studied the aerodynamic characteristics of cylinders with different surface and cross sectional shapes the flow characteristics of short cylinders were also introduced with different shapes in addition to the study of cylinders of different shapes the cylinder was also described with the attached spiral lamina at the end of the paper further research was suggested the flow around cylinder of three dimensional spanwise modification was numerically and experimentally investigated by many researchers in recent years meanwhile it is also of great significance to understand other passive control methods ahmed and bays muchmore 1992 conducted the experiment with respect to the wavy cylinder and the surrounding flow in which the circumferential surface pressure distribution were mainly analyzed and flow characteristics as well they figured out the significant spanwise pressure gradients around the wavy cylinder giving rise to the formation of 3 d separation lines and the 3 d vortex structures near the node compared to saddles nodes had larger values of the drag coefficient subsequently ahmed et al 1993 did an experiment on the turbulent wake of the wavy cylinder the separation lines of the boundary layer were discovered on the cylinder surface and their topology was depicted the development of wake turbulence structure in 3 d was also observed the trailing vortex formed behind the separation point of the node led to the narrow wake and the turbulence suppression near the boundary layer the spanwise deformation was found in bearman and owen 1998 on the upstream and downstream surfaces of the semi elliptic and square cylinders by changing the leading surface of the square cylinder the maximum drag coefficient was reduced by more than 30 at re 40000 subsequently based on particle image velocimetry piv technique zhang et al 2005 studied the 3 d near wake distribution characteristics of the wavy cylinder by doing experiment at re 3000 it was observed that along the spanwise of the wavy cylinder the vortices of opposite rotating directions were shed at the near wake area the generation of vortices with large strength was suppressed thus the turbulent kinetic energy markedly decreased lam et al 2004 and lam and lin 2007 2008 investigated the laminar and turbulent flows of the wavy cylinder at different reynolds numbers with the help of the laser doppler velocimetry ldv and numerical simulations comparing to the uc the cylinder with wave geometry was essential to the control of wake flow and fluid forces it was also reported that the scale of vortices formed by wavy cylinder was larger than the results of uc which was linked with the drag force reduction by using the les method it showed that when spanwise wavelength λ d m depicted in fig 1 for details equaled to 1 9 the drag force as well as the vibration would be largely damped under the turbulent flow at re 3000 moreover the numerical investigation was carried on flow past the wavy cylinder with different spanwise wavelengths at small reynolds number and it was found that when λ d m equaled to 2 or 6 the drag force could be reduced significantly furthermore for the wavy cylinder when the wavelength ratio λ d m was 6 the kármán vortex shedding would be greatly suppressed in the wake and the fluid forces significantly reduced for the wavy cylinder of sinusoidal shape the cross flow was also conducted by zou and lin 2009 and zou et al 2013 at reynolds numbers of 100 and 3000 they reported that the mean fluid force coefficients of the wavy cylinder were smaller than the results of the uc because of the larger wake vortex scale the 3 d free shear layers induced by the wavy surface developed into full scale vortices at a further location along the downstream and markedly altered the distribution of wake with considering the spacing ratios l d m 1 5 5 5 as the key parameter they also numerically simulated the 3 d laminar flow past two wavy cylinders arranged in tandem it was found that vibration and drag of both cylinders decreased significantly in which the kármán vortex was generated in a much further downstream position lin et al 2016 numerically investigated the wake of the wavy cylinder when the range of the wavelength λ d m was 3 79 7 57 while the wave amplitude a d m shown in fig 1 for details was 0 152 at re 3000 compared with the uc the mean drag force and the fluctuating lift force were reduced by 16 and 93 at λ d m 6 06 respectively near the wake region of the saddle some extra vortices with opposite rotating directions interacted vigorously along the streamline which would contribute to a constant vortex formation length l f at λ d m 6 0 along the spanwise direction in addition the scale adaptive numerical module was employed by zhao et al 2011 for flow around wavy cylinders at re 8000 the strouhal number and the fluctuating lift coefficients were 50 and 92 decreased to their maximum due to the wavy configuration respectively this also indicated that the vortex induced vibration could be released effectively at certain bigger values for λ d m and a d m the free shear layer turned to be stable and mature vortex could be generated at further downstream when values of λ d m were between 5 and 7 in order to explore the flow control mechanism of the shape modified circular cylinder zhang et al 2016 performed a series of numerical simulations at re 5000 the study found that the two wavy cylinders could significantly modify the flow wake resulting in a significant reduction in aerodynamic forces however the polygonal and ridged cylinders had less effect on the reduction of aerodynamic forces the vortex shedding frequency however differed from node to saddle new et al 2015 experimentally investigated the flow mechanism of the confined aspect ratio of the wavy cylinder by setting the mean blockage ratio as 0 5 in addition for confined wavy cylinders the length of the vortex formation normally was shorter than that of the unconfined counterpart resulting in the variations with geometrical shape consistent under unconfined flow conditions the results revealed that vortices were regularly shed from the wall of wavy cylinder and the wake region of the confined wavy cylinder was more sensitive to geometric changes furthermore the combination of small wavelength and large amplitude would effectively reduce the vortex of the coherent wavy cylinder in addition the flow characteristics were affected by the axial section shape and the inclination of the cylinder the 3 d characteristics of turbulent flow around the wavy cylinder were numerically studied by lam et al 2010 with yaw angles of 0 60 at re 3900 they reported that between the yawed wavy cylinder and the yawed circular cylinder the former one would have smaller average drag and the fluctuating lift coefficients with increasing yaw angles the independence principle was not applicable to the inclined wavy cylinder and the advantageous effect of wavy cylinder on force mitigation tended to be insignificant recently another numerical work was released by zhang et al 2018 which aimed at the aerodynamics of flow surrounding the inclined wavy cylinder at re 5000 they found that with the increment of the inclination angle the spanwise lift force would also increase for the wavy cylinder while the opposite applied to the uc the spanwise mean drag coefficient was bound up with the magnitude of the vortex formation length and the base pressure whereas the stagnation pressure had a large influence on the sectional distribution of the drag coefficient in the above research the numerical simulation was mainly used by the most researchers because it could better capture the three dimensional instantaneous vortex structure and the average velocity variation in the wake region which was convenient for the statistics and analysis of the fluid force coefficient however the researchers were almost all studying the influence of the single geometric parameter of the wavy cylinder on the mutual interference mechanism of the wake lam and lin 2008 zhao et al 2011 zou and lin 2009 lin et al 2016 the current work is aimed to explore the effect of flow control of employing a row of wavy cylinders with considering two different geometric parameters at re 3900 in addition the geometry of the wavy cylinder in this paper is shown in fig 1 the 3 d vortex structure flow streamwise velocity flow induced forces on the cylinder surface will be presented and discussed in this paper as well as the effects of vorticity transportation and deformation on the flow induced forces and flow characteristics the flow and mechanical behaviors of wavy cylinder will be further understood through the present work the paper is organized as follows the numerical methodology the validation cases of flow around an unmodified cylinder and the subgrid model are presented in section 2 following this geometry of the wave cylinders and computational domain together with the boundary conditions are also shown in section 3 the mechanism of the flow control is revealed in section 4 in section 5 the main findings are summarized finally 2 governing equation and numerical method 2 1 governing the current investigation adopts les turbulence model the filtered incompressible navier stokes equations are as follow 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j τ i j x j where u i or u j i 1 2 3 represent the filtered velocity components in x i or x j coordinate direction ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity and ρ is fluid density the p is the pressure and τ i j u i u j u i u j is the subgrid scale stress most of the subgrid scale models use the eddy viscosity models as below 3 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 ν t s i j where the trace of the subgrid scale stress is taken into the pressure to acquire modified pressure terms ν t is the kinematic viscosity for the subgrid scale and s i j is the strain rate tensor for the resolved scale defined by 4 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i in the subgrid scale models for most of cases the subgrid kinematic viscosity ν t is read as 5 ν t l s 2 s i j where l s is the mixing length for the subgrid scales which is given by 6 l s min k y c s δ 1 3 where k y and c s are the von kármán constant k 0 42 the distance to the nearest wall and the smagorinsky constant respectively here represents the volume of the computational cell the value of c s ranges from 0 065 to 0 25 in fact a small value c s 0 1 can affect convergence of correlation curve however for a large c s value c s 0 2 there would be excessive damping of the large scale fluctuations lam and lin 2008 in the present study c s 0 2 is applied by following zhang et al 2015 the above equations are solved by fluent software which employs the finite volume framework the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple algorithm is applied to deal with the coupling between the pressure and the velocity patankar and spalding 1972 there are two kinds of conditions at the boundary for the pressure correction equation the pressure at the boundary is given the velocity is unknown and the velocity component normal to the boundary is specified as for the spatial discretization of the convective term it is accomplished through the quadratic upwind interpolation for convective kinematics quick scheme the central difference scheme and bounded second order implicit forward discretization are used for the diffusive terms of the momentum equations and transient formulation for the purpose of reducing the convergence time respectively compared to other equations the continuity equation is harder to converge thus the criteria for convergence are residual 10 4 for continuity equation and 10 5 for other equations respectively 2 2 validation studies the entire computational domain is defined as 28d 16d 4d length width height for the unmodified cylinder uc in this study the similar setup can be found in lin et al 2016 where d 0 1m is the diameter of the uc as shown in fig 2 a the cartesian coordinate system x y z is used and the center of the cylinder is set as the origin of the coordinates on the other hand the boundary conditions are as follows the inlet boundary u u v 0 w 0 is located 8d from the coordinate origin and the outlet boundary u x v x w x 0 is located 20d from the coordinate origin respectively symmetry conditions are used at the lateral boundaries which are placed 8d away from the coordinate origin no slip wall condition u 0 v 0 w 0 is employed on the surface of the cylinder the mesh is divided by a hexahedral structured grid considering the accuracy and reliability of numerical calculation the surrounding area and the wake area are mesh encrypted behind the cylinder the surrounding encryption area is 3d 3d with 8 encryption layers and the grid size near the wall of the cylinder is 0 003182d an o type grid of 0 1d as shown in fig 2 b is distributed within the area close to the cylinder to easily adjust the cell size here re 3900 is also employed for the uc and all wavy cylinders where re ud ν and ν 1 39000 m2 s the non dimensional cp p p 0 0 5ρu 2 is the pressure coefficient where p and p 0 0 are the static pressure of the cylinder surface and static pressure of the oncoming flow respectively in a moving fluid the magnitude of p is related to the orientation of the acting surface but it is affected by flow velocity which is different from the static pressure in a static fluid that has nothing to do with the change in the orientation of the acting surface and st f s d u is strouhal number where f s is the vortex shedding frequency the blocking rate is b 100 d 16d 6 25 d d m where d m is the mean diameter of the wavy cylinder for the uc and the wavy cylinder in this study the same setting can be found in lam and lin 2008 and lin et al 2016 the grid independence tests are carried out for the uc case the numerical results of models are compared and analyzed with different near wall meshes the effect of the number of circumferential nodes the scale of the first layer grid on the average drag coefficient and st are shown in table 1 mesh1 mesh2 and mesh3 are the influence of the first layer scale mesh1 mesh4 and mesh5 are the influence of the number of circumferential nodes all the investigations presented hereafter are based on the mesh 1 which mainly consider the simulation time and the accuracy of the results under the matching results the mesh model mesh1 can simulate the flow field better the non dimensional time step is set as u δt d 0 01 and meets the requirement of cfl 1 lin et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 where cfl u δt δx is the courant friedrichs lewy cfl courant et al 1967 the values of y u δy 1 ν are smaller than 1 0 in all simulation where u and δy 1 denote the friction velocity at the nearest wall and the grid scale of the boundary layer respectively the lift and drag coefficients are computed from the following relations 7 c d c d p c d f 2 f d ρ u 2 d h 0 h 0 2 π c p cos θ d θ 2 re 0 2 π u y v x sin θ d θ d z 8 c l c l p c l f 2 f l ρ u 2 d h 0 h 0 2 π c p sin θ d θ 2 re 0 2 π u

force respectively h is the height of the uc in this paper comparing the results of the uc with the existing literature results to verify the accuracy and reliability of the calculation method calculation model and related parameter settings the main comparison parameters are as follows the mean drag coefficient c d the strouhal number st separation angle θ sep and the comparison with the numerical results of the existing literature breuer 1998 kravchenko and moin 2000 lehmkuhl et al 2013 as shown in table 2 it can be found that the present results mesh1 are in good agreement with the literature results in addition the distribution of the mean streamwise velocity along the centerline of the wake region at the middle of cylinder z h 0 50 are compared with the calculation results in the literature yan et al 2018 lourenco and shih 1993 kravchenko and moin 2000 as shown in fig 3 a it can be found that the present results agree well with the results of literature and its trends are completely consistent the distribution of the mean streamwise velocity z h 0 50 are selected in the different locations of the wake the mean velocity of the profile is presented at three positions of x d 1 04 1 58 and 2 02 respectively as shown in fig 3 b with the change of the location of wake field the time averaged velocity distribution changes from u shaped to v shaped gradually becomes flat and finally tends to be smooth and straight line the present results mesh1 are highly consistent with the results of yan et al 2018 which is slightly different from the results in the literature kravchenko and moin 2000 but its overall trend is consistent 3 problem description the wavy cylinder has the geometry given by 9 d z d m 2acos 2πz λ where d z represents the axial diameter of the wavy cylinder d m d d min d max 2 0 1 m is the mean diameter of the wavy cylinder where d min and d max is the minimum and maximum diameter of the corresponding wavy cylinder in the spanwise direction respectively as shown in fig 1 the parameter a denotes the amplitude of the wave curved surface of the wavy cylinder the wavelength is defined as λ in the spanwise direction the node means the maximum axial diameter of the wavy cylinder and the saddle shows minimum diameter the intermediate location between the node and the saddle is also defined as middle all geometric scales are measured by d m the dimensionless wavelength λ d m 1 8 5 0 and wave amplitude a d m 0 05 0 2 are adopted in this study the physical properties of the wake field the statistics of the fluid force coefficient and the average circumferential pressure are analyzed in present work and the influence of wavy cylinder on the flow characteristics under different cases is discussed and the internal mechanism of flow control is revealed all scale dimensions are referenced to d m in this study such as re ud m ν and st f s d m u the specific parameters are shown as table 3 the computational domain size is 28d m 16d m 2λ length width height and the center of the wavy cylinder is the coordinate origin the corresponding boundary conditions are the same as those in the previous sub section 2 2 and the number of axial nodes cylinders is 84 for the wavy cylinder the grid diagram of the wavy cylinder shown in fig 4 is presented with a close up near the node plane and the saddle plane in addition many scholars use the drag coefficient mean integral curve to determine whether the current numerical simulation results reach steady zhang et al 2016 fig 5 shows the average integral curve of the drag coefficient of the wavy cylinder with different amplitude ratios and wavelength ratios as can be seen from the curve in fig 5 the flow quantities like the drag forces are enough to meet their mean values in the current simulations additionally the statistics are collected after nearly 500 vortex shedding periods in the simulation the statistics are captured in every time step and a total of 30 vortex shedding cycles are counted breuer 1998 4 results and discussion 4 1 wake pattern fig 6 depicts the instantaneous flow fields in the wake of different cases at three continuous instants and each instant is set at intervals of five time steps to facilitate the analysis of the development of the vortex behind the wavy cylinder fig 6 only shows the three dimensional vortices of four typical cases for wavy cylinder the vortices are visualized by the iso surface of q 1 0 q is defined by s ij s ji e ij e ji 2 s ij and e ji are the vortices tensor and the strain rate tensor respectively and the iso surface are colored by the spanwise vortices ω z in the case of uc as shown in fig 6 a while the wake is rendered highly three dimensional by the streamwise vortices the kármán vortex shedding evidenced by the spanwise vortex tubes dominates the wake giving rise to large hydrodynamic forces such coherent structures are clearly suppressed in the wakes of the wavy cylinders where the free shear layers break down in each wavelength segment independently it is worth noting that the transition of the spanwise vortex to the streamwise vortex is also captured in general the vortex structure also develops into the multi scale eddy as the wavelength ratio increases while this phenomenon is not marked for the uc seen fig 6 a for the uc the shear layers strongly roll up and form vortices that develop into the mature streamwise vortex near the wake and the well known periodic kármán vortex street is evidently observable such streamwise vortex was also captured by lam et al 2004 at re 600 for the wavy cylinder the iso surface has a wavy flow along the spanwise direction indicating that the shear layer has a strong 3 d effect on the surface of the cylinder and these three dimensional shear layers do not appear to be stable and roll up weakly to form the vortex compared with the uc the vortex shed behind the wavy cylinder shows up further along the downstream bringing about a longer vortex formation length furthermore for the case of λ d m 2 75 the distribution of the wake vortex structure is disorderly distributed the intact kármán vortex tubes found in the uc case and the kármán vortex tubes of the λ d m 2 75 remain intact which slightly varies along the spanwise direction such phenomenon was also reported by zhang et al 2018 the multi scale vortex pattern is very significant in the wake of the case of λ d m 2 75 and the vortex formation length is smaller than that of λ d m 1 8 it can be seen that the transformation of the multi scale vortex pattern is sensitive to the dimensionless wavelength the multi scale vortex pattern has an influence on the vortex structure control mechanism of the cylinder figs 6 d e show the instantaneous 3 d vortex structures behind the wavy cylinders for two different amplitude ratios a d m 0 05 and 0 125 the vortex line and the rib like vortices are also observed in the case of a d m 0 05 with the increasing of the amplitude ratio it can be seen that the trend of the streamwise vortex structure is irregularly developed for the wavy cylinder the vortex structure also varies with the increasing of the amplitude and the transformation of the multi scale vortex pattern can be observed in fact the large scale and small scale vortices of the a d m 0 125 are mixed with each other making the wake more chaotic than that of the a d m 0 05 obviously there is a certain correlation with the flow control mechanism in the wake region compared with the case of a d m 0 05 the free shear layer of the a d m 0 125 is not easy to rolls up to form 3 d vortex structures at the farther downstream of the cylinder finally the mature vortex are gradually generated at a further downstream position for the case a d m 0 125 in the wake it also reveals that the significant flow control can be attributed to a larger vortex formation length 4 2 vorticity transportation and deformation since the wake dynamics of cylinders are mainly associated with the vortices it is important to examine the source of the vorticity in an incompressible flow vorticity can only be generated on the no slip surface and enter the flow by diffusion the rate at which the vorticity is created at the surface per unit area and time is measured by the boundary vorticity flux bvf lightthill 1963 defined as 10 σ ν n where is the voriticity gradient tensor at wall and n is the unit normal vector the three components of bvf σ x σ y σ z denote the generation the three vorticity components ω x ω y ω z figs 7 and 8 present the three components of bvf for the uc and the wavy cylinder with λ d m 2 75 and a d m 0 15 for the uc while the magnitudes of σ x and σ y of are around 0 at the upstream surface σ z stands out significantly it can be further explained that the surface vortices of the uc are mainly diffused from σ z stretch and turn to other vortices in different directions figs 7 a and b for another the bvf components σ x and σ y are originated from the middle of the upstream surface for the case of λ d m 2 75 a d m 0 15 it is worth noting that σ z of the saddle is larger than that of the node all of bvf components of the rear stream surface are almost zero on the wavy cylinder surface which also indicates that the vortex mainly generates at the upstream surface of the cylinder as depicted in fig 8 figs 7 and 8 also schematically show the 3 d surface streamlines and the separation line for the wavy cylinder and the results of the uc are also included for a comparison purpose the 3 d flow separation phenomenon of the cylinder is more easily captured at the upstream surface so the surface streamlines are shown only on the upstream surface of the cylinder the separation line consists of many separation points where the shear stress disappears on the surface of the cylinder at different axial planes it is worth noting that there is a significant axial flow shifting from the node to the saddle on the surface of the wavy cylinder compared with the uc the surface streamlines of the wavy cylinder gather at the nodal plane and diverge from the node to the saddle this phenomenon indicates that the separation angle is greater at the node than that of saddle so the free shear layer separates in advance at the saddle and the same results are found by ahmed and bays muchmore 1992 in addition the flow separation pattern of the wavy cylinder is also referred to the vortex shedding pattern of the near wake region thereafter the free shear layer near the wall of the wavy cylinder rolls up into 3 d vortex that extends and deforms along the wake as shown in fig 6 on the other hand it can be considered that the streamwise vorticity component ω x is generated by stretching and turning of vortex formed near the separation line the surface streamlines distribution of the cylinder is inseparable from the transportation and transformation of the surface vortex the vortex stretches and deforms when it goes in the flow field from the cylinder surface resulting in the original σ z converting into σ x it is extremely significant to observe the change of σ z to σ x because of the σ x playing a major role in suppressing generation of vortex fig 9 shows the distribution of the streamwaise vortices components along the surface of the cylinder the mechanisms of the vortex stretching and transformation are impressively different between the wavy cylinder and the uc in order to further analyze the transport mechanism of vorticity the development of ω x are investigated based on the vorticity stretching term p 1 ω x u x and vorticity turning term p 2 ω y u y ω z u z of ω x equation zhao et al 2017 hansen et al 2016 11 d ω x d t ω x u x ω y u y ω z u z ν 2 ω x in fact the terms p1 and p2 show the effect of flow vorticity stretching on ω x and the generation of on ω x by means of vorticity tilting respectively so the overall influence of vorticity convection on ω x can be expressed as p1 p2 in fig 9 the primary vortex shows up near the middle of the cylinder which is the same as the source of the bvf of the cylinder surface as shown in fig 8 the sign of p1 p2 changes with further weakening the primary vortices in addition the primary vortices of the p1 and the p2 are larger than that of the p1 p2 the vorticity stretching and tilting terms have a dominant influence on the development of the primary vorticity the vortex stretching is nearly offset by the vorticity tilting mechanism which leads to the reduction of the p1 p2 iso surface magnitude and induces the generation of secondary vortices as the wavelength ratio increases the iso surface shape of the vortices stretching terms and tilting terms gradually develops to the wind leaf shape at the middle plane for the wavy cylinder seen in figs 9 b d the primary vortex basically dominates the surface of the wavy cylinder for the terms p1 and p2 while the primary vortex is suppressed for the term p1 p2 it can be inferred that the change of the p1 p2 term affects the formation of the primary vortex which in turn affects the transportation and transformation of the vortex in the flow field and indirectly induces the formation of fluid forces in the cylinder in addition it is worth noting that the less diffusion and conversion of ω x is taken with the amplitude ratio increasing in the wake moreover it will affect the flow control in the cylinder wake region as the λ d m changes from 1 8 to 5 0 the secondary vortex gradually disappears on the surface of the cylinder however as the amplitude ratio increases the secondary vortex is more likely to form which is mainly attributed to the p1 p2 offsetting most of the primary vortex formation seen in figs 9 e g for the uc the value of p1 p2 at the surface is almost zero due to interaction of the p1 and p2 in addition the term p1 evolution mechanism is closely related to the streamwise velocity gradient in shear layer u x is positive and negative at the middle because the acceleration or deceleration of streamwise velocity takes place near the primary vortices on this account the term p1 and ω x are of the same sign leading to the enhancement of primary vortices subsequently the primary vortex gradually dissipates because of the disappearance of positive and negative velocity gradient for another hand the separation mechanism of the free shear layer is also related to its surrounding static pressure the presence of the reverse pressure gradient around the cylinder surface leads to the free shear layer separating and producing vorticity in the wake based on the fact that the secondary vortex generated by the p1 p2 can affect the development of the shear layer so the p1 p2 term is certainly contact with the static pressure 4 3 velocity distributions and vortex formation length in order to further analyze the flow mechanism it is important to understand the velocity distribution characteristics in the wake region of the cylinder fig 10 shows that the evolution of the mean longitudinal velocity u u along the centerline of the wake for different cases at re 3900 the typical curves for wavy cylinder at re 3000 and 5000 have been published by lam et al 2004 and zhang et al 2018 are also plotted for comparison with the present results as seen from fig 10 there is a little discrepancy between the current study and other published results which is attributed to the comprehensive effect related to notable differences in calculation method and reynolds number etc one can point out that the wake flow of the cylinder begins to change from streamwise flow to reverse flow at x d m 0 5 moreover the mean longitudinal velocity distributions differ largely from those of other cases for the λ d m 2 75 and the u u distribution for the λ d m 2 75 is significantly offset upstream along the near wake revealing a smaller reversal flow than that of other cases as shown in fig 10 a figs 11 and 12 show transverse distributions of mean streamwise velocity u u at x d m 1 06 2 02 for wavy cylinder and the uc the experimental results of norberg 1998 and lam et al 2004 as well as the numerical results of kim 2006 are presented which show a larger discrepancy with that one can conclude that the near wake of the wavy cylinder shows more difference compared with that of the uc in u u distribution at three planes especially at y d m 0 5 the result suggests that wavy cylinder has a narrower near wake region compared to that of uc in fact there is a strong correlation between the wake width and the flow characteristics from fig 11 the u u distributions of the wake of the wavy cylinder shows a semi symmetric trend of u shaped and finally converges to the same level as the uc at x d m 1 06 and the results in les are basically consistent with the experiments lam et al 2004 the u u distribution of the λ d m 5 0 is delayed in the wake at the nodal plane as shown in fig 11 a this phenomenon can also be seen observed in fig 12 a the u u distributions basically tends to the v shaped semi symmetric and finally stabilizes to a smooth straight line at x d m 2 02 which can be observed from fig 12 it is worth noting that the wake pattern is slowly changing from u shaped to v shaped for the u u distributions when the amplitude gradually increases at both saddle and middle planes the high reverse flow indicates that the flow field around x d m 2 02 exist strong 3 d characteristics due to the stretching and deforming of flow vortices in the separated shear layer for further analysis the non dimensional mean spanwise velocity w u are presented near the edge of the immediate near wake y d m 1 x d m 1 1 5 and 2 as depicted in fig 13 the value of the mean spanwise of all wavy cylinders is zero at both the nodal planes and the saddle planes which confirms the results of lam and lin 2008 this kind distribution of the spanwise velocity strongly indicates that there are strong 3 d characteristics in wake flow for all wavy cylinders furthermore this three dimensional characteristic can also be observed in the sub section 4 1 as shown in fig 6 which is consistent with the formation of three dimensional separation lines of wavy cylinder and the vortex stretching and deformation also affect the wake for the wavy cylinder the time averaged formation length is closely related to the length of mean recirculation wake obtained by time averaged flow and directly affects the flow control effect the time averaged formation length l f is measured by distance between the cylinder center point and the point of u u 0 in the wake centerline the dimensionless time averaged formation length l f d m of the wavy cylinder and the uc are shown in table 4 compared with the result of the uc the magnitude l f of all wavy cylinders is significantly larger along the spanwise direction of wavy cylinder the length of l f at the nodal plane is shorter than that of the saddle plane in particular the l f of the λ d m 2 75 is smaller than the other two cases λ d m 1 8 and 5 0 at node and saddle on the other hand with the increasing of amplitude it can be seen that the l f of the case a d m 0 2 is larger than that of the a d m 0 05 the corresponding results of the a d m 0 05 and 0 2 can also be found from fig 6 in the sub section 4 1 4 4 pressure coefficients since the drag and lift force coefficients are mainly calculated from the surface pressure at such large reynolds number it is necessary to explore the pressure distribution characteristics along the circumference of the wavy cylinder the time averaged pressure coefficients of different wavy cylinders are depicted in figs 14 and 15 at different characteristic locations nodal middle and saddle planes for all the cases the maximum value of cp mean locates in stagnation point where the shear stress is zero williamson 1988 cp mean sharply decreases from the stagnation point position resulting in the generation of a favorable pressure gradient p x 0 that accelerates the boundary layer flow cp mean reaches its maximum negative value about θ 60 90 and then it grows to a relatively steady state within the range of u x 0 and p x 0 the boundary layer momentum is hindered by the adverse pressure gradient giving rise to separation of the boundary layer the maximum negative pressure point represents a point in which the pressure coefficient reaches its the lowest position the angular location of separation point mentioned in sub section 4 2 is defined as the position of the point on the surface of cylinder where the shear stress is zero the pressure coefficient remains almost constant after about θ 90 and the maximum negative pressure for the wavy cylinder are all smaller compared to the uc meanwhile the smaller suction can be found on the rear of the wavy cylinder fig 14 shows the variation of cp mean the wavy cylinder with different wavelength ratios and the results of the corresponding literatures lam and lin 2008 zhao et al 2011 are also given in general the maximum negative pressure point appears at θ 60 at the node and θ 60 for the saddle which can be seen from figs 14 a and c in fact the maximum negative pressure point of the three wavy cylinder changes from 60 8 to 63 4 at the saddle which are all smaller than the result 72 5 of the uc this change may also cause the separation line to converting from the straight line to the curve line in the lowest pressure position of the wavy cylinder along the spanwise for another one it is consistent with the difference in 3 d separation line variation at the saddle plane and nodal one mentioned earlier shown in fig 8 it can found that the lowest position of cp mean at the saddle is in front of the middle plane and the node plane showing that the separation of the saddle is earlier than that of other spanwise positions particularly the pressure distribution of the case λ d m 2 75 is close to that of the uc at both node and saddle planes suggesting that the advantageous effect of flow control is not obvious in this case the cp mean distributions are also presented in the wavy cylinder with different amplitudes the corresponding results of lam et al 2004 and zhang et al 2016 are also included for comparison as sketched in fig 15 generally when the amplitude ratio gradually increases the curves of the cp mean will converge to the same level at the three different planes and the convergence value of the λ d m 2 0 a d m 0 2 is larger than other cases in the position of the stagnation point θ 0 for the case of the a d m 0 2 the cp mean at the middle plane is significantly smaller than that of the saddle plane and the node plane lam and lin 2008 which is attributed to the difference in spanwise three dimensional flow a larger value of a d m may bring about a stronger three dimensional characteristics along the spanwise of the wavy cylinder at the middle plane with the larger a d m the greater the flow velocity can be obtained near the stagnation point which can result in a smaller pressure as shown in fig 15 b in addition with the a d m increasing the lowest pressure position at the saddle plane markedly increases from θ 55 to θ 68 and it reduces from θ 77 to θ 72 at the nodal plane finally considering again eq 7 the pressure component of the drag coefficient cd p is decided by cp mean of the wavy cylinder 4 5 force coefficients a summary of statistical values of fluid force coefficients as the function of λ d m and a d m are presented in figs 16 and 17 in this paper the mean drag coefficient is mainly composed of two parts the pressure and viscous components of the mean drag coefficient as shown in fig 16 a the c d increases gradually when λ d m moves from 1 8 to 2 75 then it drops in the λ d m range of 2 75 5 0 the variation of c d blue lines exhibits one peak at λ d m 2 75 suggesting that the flow control effect of the case of λ d m 2 75 is obviously poor in fact the optimal wake control is at λ d m 1 8 where the average drag coefficient is reduced by 12 fig 16 a also shows the variation of the viscous component of the drag coefficient with different wavelength ratios λ d m 1 8 5 0 and the pressure component of the drag coefficient is also presented it is known that the viscous drag coefficient raises as the λ d m increases and the viscous drag accounts for 28 2 of the total mean drag for the λ d m 5 0 while it accounts for only 8 03 for the uc on the other hand with an increase in λ d m the pressure component of the drag greatly climbs but slightly reduces from the λ d m 2 75 the pressure difference drag of the wavy cylinder is linked to the effect of the flow control for wavy cylinder compared with the uc the cl markedly reduces for the wavy cylinder with λ d m 1 8 and 5 0 and a significant reduction up to 74 is evident as shown in fig 16 b this further demonstrates that the flow control effect of wavy cylinders with λ d m 1 8 and 5 0 is very impressive in the wake region fig 17 shows that the mean drag coefficient components of drag coefficient and fluctuating lift coefficient for different wavy cylinders a d m 0 05 0 2 together with the results of the uc all the magnitude of statistical values of fluid force coefficients of the wavy cylinder is smaller than the results of uc the mean drag coefficient reaches a maximum value c d 1 03 at a d m 0 05 and then decreases nonlinearly to a minimum value c d 0 89 as the amplitude increases with a maximum reduction of 13 as shown in fig 17 a in addition fig 17 a also shows the variation of the pressure and viscous components of the drag coefficient for the different amplitude ratios a d m 0 05 0 2 the results of the uc are also presented for comparison the viscous drag does not fluctuate significantly with the amplitude ratio changing but the great ratio of viscous drag to total drag can be observed at the large amplitude ratio in addition the pressure component of the drag coefficient drops significantly in the range of large amplitude ratio which further reveals that the flow control of the wavy cylinder is mainly depending on the reduction of the pressure difference the results depicted in fig 17 show that the fluid force coefficients decrease as the a d m gradually increases for wavy cylinder compared with the uc the fluctuating lift coefficient reduction up to 93 can be observed for the case λ d m 2 0 a d m 0 2 in general a conspicuous reduction of the statistical values of fluid force coefficients can be achieved by increasing the wave amplitude ratio 5 conclusion the effects of the spanwise waviness are investigated on the control mechanism of the cylinder wake at re 3900 in this study the calculated results of the wavy cylinder are compared with the uc the distribution characteristics of the wake flow the boundary vorticity flux the fluid coefficients and the flow separation are analyzed and the internal coupling mechanism is also explained the main results of the present work are summarized as follows i the free shear layer of the λ d m 2 75 gradually separates and forms vortex shedding near the downstream of the wall of the cylinder and the flow control is not significant in this case for the case λ d m 1 8 the vortex formation length is obviously larger than that of the uc in addition with the increasing of the amplitude the boundary layer separation is markedly delayed ii the bvf further explains the source mechanism of vorticity which is closely related to the flow control the surface streamline distribution of the cylinder is related to vorticity transportation and deformation resulting in the difference of the flow control between wavy cylinder and uc the stretching and turning mechanism of the ω x provide strong evidence for the transportation and deformation of vortices in fact the p1 and p2 terms have a large correlation with the velocity distribution and static pressure in near wall of the cylinder iii the distribution of present mean velocities changes from a symmetrical u shaped to a v shaped when characteristic position x d m moves further downstream in the wake region of the wavy cylinder from the saddle to the node the mean spanwise velocity distribution shows a significant wave shaped flow pattern and 3 d characteristic along the spanwise direction iv for the different wavy cylinders the development of the circumference pressure coefficient is obviously different between node and saddle the magnitude of cp mean converges to the same result as the uc for the λ d m 2 75 and the cp mean value is proportional to the amplitude ratio the mean drag coefficient and the fluctuating lift coefficient rapidly increase and then markedly decrease with the changing of the wavelength ratio in fact the mean drag coefficient reaches the maximum value of 1 04 at λ d m 2 75 however the cl decreases rapidly with the increasing of wave amplitude the flow control of the wavy cylinder depends on the pressure component of the drag coefficient credit authorship contribution statement zhihao zhang software validation writing original

21074,the three dimensional vortex characteristics behind the wavy cylinders are studied by large eddy simulation les at re 3900 the wavelength ratios λ d m 1 8 5 0 and amplitude ratios a d m 0 05 0 2 are mainly considered the spanwise waviness is analyzed for the wavy cylinder on the flow control effect and the results of the unmodified cylinder uc are introduced for the comparison the results show that there is a strong three dimensional effect in the flow field distribution between the node and the saddle the phenomenon of the multi scale and the rib like vortices are observed in the wake region boundary vortex flux of the cylinder reveals the vortex generation mechanism the conversion of streamwise vortices further explain that mechanism in addition the length of vortex formation behind the wavy cylinder is longer than that of the uc the mean streamwise velocity distribution exhibits a semi symmetrical u shaped to v shaped transformation with the different characteristic positions with the increment of the amplitude ratio the statistical average of fluid force coefficients gradually reduces and reaches its minimum value at a d m 0 2 the effect of the flow control is close to that of the uc at λ d m 2 75 finally the wake control of the wavy cylinder is mainly related to vortex characteristics keywords wavy cylinder wavelength ratios amplitude ratios fluid dynamic forces flow characteristics 1 introduction the excessive flow induced forces have plagued many ocean and civil engineering applications such as deep water risers bridge stay cables etc due to the long terms exposure of the structure to the fluid load the kármán vortex shedding was produced it also generated periodic fluid forces which would cause structural vibration and fatigue failure therefore how to control the wake around the structure to reduce fluid forces had attracted the interest of many researchers at present the methods for flow control mainly include passive control methods zdravkovich 1981 choi et al 2008 demartino and ricciardelli 2017 ahmed and bays muchmore 1992 ahmed et al 1993 bearman and owen 1998 zhang et al 2005 2016 2018 lam et al 2004 2010 lam and lin 2007 2008 zhao et al 2011 zou and lin 2009 zou et al 2013 lin et al 2016 new et al 2015 and active control methods bourguet and jacono 2014 darvishyadegari and hassanzadeh 2019 patnaik and wei 2002 the passive control mainly suppressed the generation and development of the wake vortex by changing the geometric shape altering the inclined angle of the cylinder and adding the affiliated cylinders the active control required external energy input compared with the active control the passive controls were widely introduced because they had many advantages such as simple design and easy installation three passive control means were introduced by zdravkovich 1981 for suppressing vortex shedding which mainly included surface protrusions shrouds and near wake stabilizers the mechanism of vortex shedding was studied for these three categories and the findings included the analysis of the fluid force coefficient the pressure coefficient and so on choi et al 2008 summarized the flow visualization of different shapes of cylinders which mainly included the three dimensional vortex structure of a rectangular cylinder with a smooth stagnation surface and a wavy surface at low reynolds number meanwhile the phenomenon of flow separation was depicted under the subcritical reynolds number on the surface of a sphere the variation of such flow separation was also given along the axial direction for the unmodified cylinder uc recently demartino and ricciardelli 2017 summarized the existing literature related to the flow around the cylinder which studied the aerodynamic characteristics of cylinders with different surface and cross sectional shapes the flow characteristics of short cylinders were also introduced with different shapes in addition to the study of cylinders of different shapes the cylinder was also described with the attached spiral lamina at the end of the paper further research was suggested the flow around cylinder of three dimensional spanwise modification was numerically and experimentally investigated by many researchers in recent years meanwhile it is also of great significance to understand other passive control methods ahmed and bays muchmore 1992 conducted the experiment with respect to the wavy cylinder and the surrounding flow in which the circumferential surface pressure distribution were mainly analyzed and flow characteristics as well they figured out the significant spanwise pressure gradients around the wavy cylinder giving rise to the formation of 3 d separation lines and the 3 d vortex structures near the node compared to saddles nodes had larger values of the drag coefficient subsequently ahmed et al 1993 did an experiment on the turbulent wake of the wavy cylinder the separation lines of the boundary layer were discovered on the cylinder surface and their topology was depicted the development of wake turbulence structure in 3 d was also observed the trailing vortex formed behind the separation point of the node led to the narrow wake and the turbulence suppression near the boundary layer the spanwise deformation was found in bearman and owen 1998 on the upstream and downstream surfaces of the semi elliptic and square cylinders by changing the leading surface of the square cylinder the maximum drag coefficient was reduced by more than 30 at re 40000 subsequently based on particle image velocimetry piv technique zhang et al 2005 studied the 3 d near wake distribution characteristics of the wavy cylinder by doing experiment at re 3000 it was observed that along the spanwise of the wavy cylinder the vortices of opposite rotating directions were shed at the near wake area the generation of vortices with large strength was suppressed thus the turbulent kinetic energy markedly decreased lam et al 2004 and lam and lin 2007 2008 investigated the laminar and turbulent flows of the wavy cylinder at different reynolds numbers with the help of the laser doppler velocimetry ldv and numerical simulations comparing to the uc the cylinder with wave geometry was essential to the control of wake flow and fluid forces it was also reported that the scale of vortices formed by wavy cylinder was larger than the results of uc which was linked with the drag force reduction by using the les method it showed that when spanwise wavelength λ d m depicted in fig 1 for details equaled to 1 9 the drag force as well as the vibration would be largely damped under the turbulent flow at re 3000 moreover the numerical investigation was carried on flow past the wavy cylinder with different spanwise wavelengths at small reynolds number and it was found that when λ d m equaled to 2 or 6 the drag force could be reduced significantly furthermore for the wavy cylinder when the wavelength ratio λ d m was 6 the kármán vortex shedding would be greatly suppressed in the wake and the fluid forces significantly reduced for the wavy cylinder of sinusoidal shape the cross flow was also conducted by zou and lin 2009 and zou et al 2013 at reynolds numbers of 100 and 3000 they reported that the mean fluid force coefficients of the wavy cylinder were smaller than the results of the uc because of the larger wake vortex scale the 3 d free shear layers induced by the wavy surface developed into full scale vortices at a further location along the downstream and markedly altered the distribution of wake with considering the spacing ratios l d m 1 5 5 5 as the key parameter they also numerically simulated the 3 d laminar flow past two wavy cylinders arranged in tandem it was found that vibration and drag of both cylinders decreased significantly in which the kármán vortex was generated in a much further downstream position lin et al 2016 numerically investigated the wake of the wavy cylinder when the range of the wavelength λ d m was 3 79 7 57 while the wave amplitude a d m shown in fig 1 for details was 0 152 at re 3000 compared with the uc the mean drag force and the fluctuating lift force were reduced by 16 and 93 at λ d m 6 06 respectively near the wake region of the saddle some extra vortices with opposite rotating directions interacted vigorously along the streamline which would contribute to a constant vortex formation length l f at λ d m 6 0 along the spanwise direction in addition the scale adaptive numerical module was employed by zhao et al 2011 for flow around wavy cylinders at re 8000 the strouhal number and the fluctuating lift coefficients were 50 and 92 decreased to their maximum due to the wavy configuration respectively this also indicated that the vortex induced vibration could be released effectively at certain bigger values for λ d m and a d m the free shear layer turned to be stable and mature vortex could be generated at further downstream when values of λ d m were between 5 and 7 in order to explore the flow control mechanism of the shape modified circular cylinder zhang et al 2016 performed a series of numerical simulations at re 5000 the study found that the two wavy cylinders could significantly modify the flow wake resulting in a significant reduction in aerodynamic forces however the polygonal and ridged cylinders had less effect on the reduction of aerodynamic forces the vortex shedding frequency however differed from node to saddle new et al 2015 experimentally investigated the flow mechanism of the confined aspect ratio of the wavy cylinder by setting the mean blockage ratio as 0 5 in addition for confined wavy cylinders the length of the vortex formation normally was shorter than that of the unconfined counterpart resulting in the variations with geometrical shape consistent under unconfined flow conditions the results revealed that vortices were regularly shed from the wall of wavy cylinder and the wake region of the confined wavy cylinder was more sensitive to geometric changes furthermore the combination of small wavelength and large amplitude would effectively reduce the vortex of the coherent wavy cylinder in addition the flow characteristics were affected by the axial section shape and the inclination of the cylinder the 3 d characteristics of turbulent flow around the wavy cylinder were numerically studied by lam et al 2010 with yaw angles of 0 60 at re 3900 they reported that between the yawed wavy cylinder and the yawed circular cylinder the former one would have smaller average drag and the fluctuating lift coefficients with increasing yaw angles the independence principle was not applicable to the inclined wavy cylinder and the advantageous effect of wavy cylinder on force mitigation tended to be insignificant recently another numerical work was released by zhang et al 2018 which aimed at the aerodynamics of flow surrounding the inclined wavy cylinder at re 5000 they found that with the increment of the inclination angle the spanwise lift force would also increase for the wavy cylinder while the opposite applied to the uc the spanwise mean drag coefficient was bound up with the magnitude of the vortex formation length and the base pressure whereas the stagnation pressure had a large influence on the sectional distribution of the drag coefficient in the above research the numerical simulation was mainly used by the most researchers because it could better capture the three dimensional instantaneous vortex structure and the average velocity variation in the wake region which was convenient for the statistics and analysis of the fluid force coefficient however the researchers were almost all studying the influence of the single geometric parameter of the wavy cylinder on the mutual interference mechanism of the wake lam and lin 2008 zhao et al 2011 zou and lin 2009 lin et al 2016 the current work is aimed to explore the effect of flow control of employing a row of wavy cylinders with considering two different geometric parameters at re 3900 in addition the geometry of the wavy cylinder in this paper is shown in fig 1 the 3 d vortex structure flow streamwise velocity flow induced forces on the cylinder surface will be presented and discussed in this paper as well as the effects of vorticity transportation and deformation on the flow induced forces and flow characteristics the flow and mechanical behaviors of wavy cylinder will be further understood through the present work the paper is organized as follows the numerical methodology the validation cases of flow around an unmodified cylinder and the subgrid model are presented in section 2 following this geometry of the wave cylinders and computational domain together with the boundary conditions are also shown in section 3 the mechanism of the flow control is revealed in section 4 in section 5 the main findings are summarized finally 2 governing equation and numerical method 2 1 governing the current investigation adopts les turbulence model the filtered incompressible navier stokes equations are as follow 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j τ i j x j where u i or u j i 1 2 3 represent the filtered velocity components in x i or x j coordinate direction ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity and ρ is fluid density the p is the pressure and τ i j u i u j u i u j is the subgrid scale stress most of the subgrid scale models use the eddy viscosity models as below 3 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 ν t s i j where the trace of the subgrid scale stress is taken into the pressure to acquire modified pressure terms ν t is the kinematic viscosity for the subgrid scale and s i j is the strain rate tensor for the resolved scale defined by 4 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i in the subgrid scale models for most of cases the subgrid kinematic viscosity ν t is read as 5 ν t l s 2 s i j where l s is the mixing length for the subgrid scales which is given by 6 l s min k y c s δ 1 3 where k y and c s are the von kármán constant k 0 42 the distance to the nearest wall and the smagorinsky constant respectively here represents the volume of the computational cell the value of c s ranges from 0 065 to 0 25 in fact a small value c s 0 1 can affect convergence of correlation curve however for a large c s value c s 0 2 there would be excessive damping of the large scale fluctuations lam and lin 2008 in the present study c s 0 2 is applied by following zhang et al 2015 the above equations are solved by fluent software which employs the finite volume framework the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple algorithm is applied to deal with the coupling between the pressure and the velocity patankar and spalding 1972 there are two kinds of conditions at the boundary for the pressure correction equation the pressure at the boundary is given the velocity is unknown and the velocity component normal to the boundary is specified as for the spatial discretization of the convective term it is accomplished through the quadratic upwind interpolation for convective kinematics quick scheme the central difference scheme and bounded second order implicit forward discretization are used for the diffusive terms of the momentum equations and transient formulation for the purpose of reducing the convergence time respectively compared to other equations the continuity equation is harder to converge thus the criteria for convergence are residual 10 4 for continuity equation and 10 5 for other equations respectively 2 2 validation studies the entire computational domain is defined as 28d 16d 4d length width height for the unmodified cylinder uc in this study the similar setup can be found in lin et al 2016 where d 0 1m is the diameter of the uc as shown in fig 2 a the cartesian coordinate system x y z is used and the center of the cylinder is set as the origin of the coordinates on the other hand the boundary conditions are as follows the inlet boundary u u v 0 w 0 is located 8d from the coordinate origin and the outlet boundary u x v x w x 0 is located 20d from the coordinate origin respectively symmetry conditions are used at the lateral boundaries which are placed 8d away from the coordinate origin no slip wall condition u 0 v 0 w 0 is employed on the surface of the cylinder the mesh is divided by a hexahedral structured grid considering the accuracy and reliability of numerical calculation the surrounding area and the wake area are mesh encrypted behind the cylinder the surrounding encryption area is 3d 3d with 8 encryption layers and the grid size near the wall of the cylinder is 0 003182d an o type grid of 0 1d as shown in fig 2 b is distributed within the area close to the cylinder to easily adjust the cell size here re 3900 is also employed for the uc and all wavy cylinders where re ud ν and ν 1 39000 m2 s the non dimensional cp p p 0 0 5ρu 2 is the pressure coefficient where p and p 0 0 are the static pressure of the cylinder surface and static pressure of the oncoming flow respectively in a moving fluid the magnitude of p is related to the orientation of the acting surface but it is affected by flow velocity which is different from the static pressure in a static fluid that has nothing to do with the change in the orientation of the acting surface and st f s d u is strouhal number where f s is the vortex shedding frequency the blocking rate is b 100 d 16d 6 25 d d m where d m is the mean diameter of the wavy cylinder for the uc and the wavy cylinder in this study the same setting can be found in lam and lin 2008 and lin et al 2016 the grid independence tests are carried out for the uc case the numerical results of models are compared and analyzed with different near wall meshes the effect of the number of circumferential nodes the scale of the first layer grid on the average drag coefficient and st are shown in table 1 mesh1 mesh2 and mesh3 are the influence of the first layer scale mesh1 mesh4 and mesh5 are the influence of the number of circumferential nodes all the investigations presented hereafter are based on the mesh 1 which mainly consider the simulation time and the accuracy of the results under the matching results the mesh model mesh1 can simulate the flow field better the non dimensional time step is set as u δt d 0 01 and meets the requirement of cfl 1 lin et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 where cfl u δt δx is the courant friedrichs lewy cfl courant et al 1967 the values of y u δy 1 ν are smaller than 1 0 in all simulation where u and δy 1 denote the friction velocity at the nearest wall and the grid scale of the boundary layer respectively the lift and drag coefficients are computed from the following relations 7 c d c d p c d f 2 f d ρ u 2 d h 0 h 0 2 π c p cos θ d θ 2 re 0 2 π u y v x sin θ d θ d z 8 c l c l p c l f 2 f l ρ u 2 d h 0 h 0 2 π c p sin θ d θ 2 re 0 2 π u

force respectively h is the height of the uc in this paper comparing the results of the uc with the existing literature results to verify the accuracy and reliability of the calculation method calculation model and related parameter settings the main comparison parameters are as follows the mean drag coefficient c d the strouhal number st separation angle θ sep and the comparison with the numerical results of the existing literature breuer 1998 kravchenko and moin 2000 lehmkuhl et al 2013 as shown in table 2 it can be found that the present results mesh1 are in good agreement with the literature results in addition the distribution of the mean streamwise velocity along the centerline of the wake region at the middle of cylinder z h 0 50 are compared with the calculation results in the literature yan et al 2018 lourenco and shih 1993 kravchenko and moin 2000 as shown in fig 3 a it can be found that the present results agree well with the results of literature and its trends are completely consistent the distribution of the mean streamwise velocity z h 0 50 are selected in the different locations of the wake the mean velocity of the profile is presented at three positions of x d 1 04 1 58 and 2 02 respectively as shown in fig 3 b with the change of the location of wake field the time averaged velocity distribution changes from u shaped to v shaped gradually becomes flat and finally tends to be smooth and straight line the present results mesh1 are highly consistent with the results of yan et al 2018 which is slightly different from the results in the literature kravchenko and moin 2000 but its overall trend is consistent 3 problem description the wavy cylinder has the geometry given by 9 d z d m 2acos 2πz λ where d z represents the axial diameter of the wavy cylinder d m d d min d max 2 0 1 m is the mean diameter of the wavy cylinder where d min and d max is the minimum and maximum diameter of the corresponding wavy cylinder in the spanwise direction respectively as shown in fig 1 the parameter a denotes the amplitude of the wave curved surface of the wavy cylinder the wavelength is defined as λ in the spanwise direction the node means the maximum axial diameter of the wavy cylinder and the saddle shows minimum diameter the intermediate location between the node and the saddle is also defined as middle all geometric scales are measured by d m the dimensionless wavelength λ d m 1 8 5 0 and wave amplitude a d m 0 05 0 2 are adopted in this study the physical properties of the wake field the statistics of the fluid force coefficient and the average circumferential pressure are analyzed in present work and the influence of wavy cylinder on the flow characteristics under different cases is discussed and the internal mechanism of flow control is revealed all scale dimensions are referenced to d m in this study such as re ud m ν and st f s d m u the specific parameters are shown as table 3 the computational domain size is 28d m 16d m 2λ length width height and the center of the wavy cylinder is the coordinate origin the corresponding boundary conditions are the same as those in the previous sub section 2 2 and the number of axial nodes cylinders is 84 for the wavy cylinder the grid diagram of the wavy cylinder shown in fig 4 is presented with a close up near the node plane and the saddle plane in addition many scholars use the drag coefficient mean integral curve to determine whether the current numerical simulation results reach steady zhang et al 2016 fig 5 shows the average integral curve of the drag coefficient of the wavy cylinder with different amplitude ratios and wavelength ratios as can be seen from the curve in fig 5 the flow quantities like the drag forces are enough to meet their mean values in the current simulations additionally the statistics are collected after nearly 500 vortex shedding periods in the simulation the statistics are captured in every time step and a total of 30 vortex shedding cycles are counted breuer 1998 4 results and discussion 4 1 wake pattern fig 6 depicts the instantaneous flow fields in the wake of different cases at three continuous instants and each instant is set at intervals of five time steps to facilitate the analysis of the development of the vortex behind the wavy cylinder fig 6 only shows the three dimensional vortices of four typical cases for wavy cylinder the vortices are visualized by the iso surface of q 1 0 q is defined by s ij s ji e ij e ji 2 s ij and e ji are the vortices tensor and the strain rate tensor respectively and the iso surface are colored by the spanwise vortices ω z in the case of uc as shown in fig 6 a while the wake is rendered highly three dimensional by the streamwise vortices the kármán vortex shedding evidenced by the spanwise vortex tubes dominates the wake giving rise to large hydrodynamic forces such coherent structures are clearly suppressed in the wakes of the wavy cylinders where the free shear layers break down in each wavelength segment independently it is worth noting that the transition of the spanwise vortex to the streamwise vortex is also captured in general the vortex structure also develops into the multi scale eddy as the wavelength ratio increases while this phenomenon is not marked for the uc seen fig 6 a for the uc the shear layers strongly roll up and form vortices that develop into the mature streamwise vortex near the wake and the well known periodic kármán vortex street is evidently observable such streamwise vortex was also captured by lam et al 2004 at re 600 for the wavy cylinder the iso surface has a wavy flow along the spanwise direction indicating that the shear layer has a strong 3 d effect on the surface of the cylinder and these three dimensional shear layers do not appear to be stable and roll up weakly to form the vortex compared with the uc the vortex shed behind the wavy cylinder shows up further along the downstream bringing about a longer vortex formation length furthermore for the case of λ d m 2 75 the distribution of the wake vortex structure is disorderly distributed the intact kármán vortex tubes found in the uc case and the kármán vortex tubes of the λ d m 2 75 remain intact which slightly varies along the spanwise direction such phenomenon was also reported by zhang et al 2018 the multi scale vortex pattern is very significant in the wake of the case of λ d m 2 75 and the vortex formation length is smaller than that of λ d m 1 8 it can be seen that the transformation of the multi scale vortex pattern is sensitive to the dimensionless wavelength the multi scale vortex pattern has an influence on the vortex structure control mechanism of the cylinder figs 6 d e show the instantaneous 3 d vortex structures behind the wavy cylinders for two different amplitude ratios a d m 0 05 and 0 125 the vortex line and the rib like vortices are also observed in the case of a d m 0 05 with the increasing of the amplitude ratio it can be seen that the trend of the streamwise vortex structure is irregularly developed for the wavy cylinder the vortex structure also varies with the increasing of the amplitude and the transformation of the multi scale vortex pattern can be observed in fact the large scale and small scale vortices of the a d m 0 125 are mixed with each other making the wake more chaotic than that of the a d m 0 05 obviously there is a certain correlation with the flow control mechanism in the wake region compared with the case of a d m 0 05 the free shear layer of the a d m 0 125 is not easy to rolls up to form 3 d vortex structures at the farther downstream of the cylinder finally the mature vortex are gradually generated at a further downstream position for the case a d m 0 125 in the wake it also reveals that the significant flow control can be attributed to a larger vortex formation length 4 2 vorticity transportation and deformation since the wake dynamics of cylinders are mainly associated with the vortices it is important to examine the source of the vorticity in an incompressible flow vorticity can only be generated on the no slip surface and enter the flow by diffusion the rate at which the vorticity is created at the surface per unit area and time is measured by the boundary vorticity flux bvf lightthill 1963 defined as 10 σ ν n where is the voriticity gradient tensor at wall and n is the unit normal vector the three components of bvf σ x σ y σ z denote the generation the three vorticity components ω x ω y ω z figs 7 and 8 present the three components of bvf for the uc and the wavy cylinder with λ d m 2 75 and a d m 0 15 for the uc while the magnitudes of σ x and σ y of are around 0 at the upstream surface σ z stands out significantly it can be further explained that the surface vortices of the uc are mainly diffused from σ z stretch and turn to other vortices in different directions figs 7 a and b for another the bvf components σ x and σ y are originated from the middle of the upstream surface for the case of λ d m 2 75 a d m 0 15 it is worth noting that σ z of the saddle is larger than that of the node all of bvf components of the rear stream surface are almost zero on the wavy cylinder surface which also indicates that the vortex mainly generates at the upstream surface of the cylinder as depicted in fig 8 figs 7 and 8 also schematically show the 3 d surface streamlines and the separation line for the wavy cylinder and the results of the uc are also included for a comparison purpose the 3 d flow separation phenomenon of the cylinder is more easily captured at the upstream surface so the surface streamlines are shown only on the upstream surface of the cylinder the separation line consists of many separation points where the shear stress disappears on the surface of the cylinder at different axial planes it is worth noting that there is a significant axial flow shifting from the node to the saddle on the surface of the wavy cylinder compared with the uc the surface streamlines of the wavy cylinder gather at the nodal plane and diverge from the node to the saddle this phenomenon indicates that the separation angle is greater at the node than that of saddle so the free shear layer separates in advance at the saddle and the same results are found by ahmed and bays muchmore 1992 in addition the flow separation pattern of the wavy cylinder is also referred to the vortex shedding pattern of the near wake region thereafter the free shear layer near the wall of the wavy cylinder rolls up into 3 d vortex that extends and deforms along the wake as shown in fig 6 on the other hand it can be considered that the streamwise vorticity component ω x is generated by stretching and turning of vortex formed near the separation line the surface streamlines distribution of the cylinder is inseparable from the transportation and transformation of the surface vortex the vortex stretches and deforms when it goes in the flow field from the cylinder surface resulting in the original σ z converting into σ x it is extremely significant to observe the change of σ z to σ x because of the σ x playing a major role in suppressing generation of vortex fig 9 shows the distribution of the streamwaise vortices components along the surface of the cylinder the mechanisms of the vortex stretching and transformation are impressively different between the wavy cylinder and the uc in order to further analyze the transport mechanism of vorticity the development of ω x are investigated based on the vorticity stretching term p 1 ω x u x and vorticity turning term p 2 ω y u y ω z u z of ω x equation zhao et al 2017 hansen et al 2016 11 d ω x d t ω x u x ω y u y ω z u z ν 2 ω x in fact the terms p1 and p2 show the effect of flow vorticity stretching on ω x and the generation of on ω x by means of vorticity tilting respectively so the overall influence of vorticity convection on ω x can be expressed as p1 p2 in fig 9 the primary vortex shows up near the middle of the cylinder which is the same as the source of the bvf of the cylinder surface as shown in fig 8 the sign of p1 p2 changes with further weakening the primary vortices in addition the primary vortices of the p1 and the p2 are larger than that of the p1 p2 the vorticity stretching and tilting terms have a dominant influence on the development of the primary vorticity the vortex stretching is nearly offset by the vorticity tilting mechanism which leads to the reduction of the p1 p2 iso surface magnitude and induces the generation of secondary vortices as the wavelength ratio increases the iso surface shape of the vortices stretching terms and tilting terms gradually develops to the wind leaf shape at the middle plane for the wavy cylinder seen in figs 9 b d the primary vortex basically dominates the surface of the wavy cylinder for the terms p1 and p2 while the primary vortex is suppressed for the term p1 p2 it can be inferred that the change of the p1 p2 term affects the formation of the primary vortex which in turn affects the transportation and transformation of the vortex in the flow field and indirectly induces the formation of fluid forces in the cylinder in addition it is worth noting that the less diffusion and conversion of ω x is taken with the amplitude ratio increasing in the wake moreover it will affect the flow control in the cylinder wake region as the λ d m changes from 1 8 to 5 0 the secondary vortex gradually disappears on the surface of the cylinder however as the amplitude ratio increases the secondary vortex is more likely to form which is mainly attributed to the p1 p2 offsetting most of the primary vortex formation seen in figs 9 e g for the uc the value of p1 p2 at the surface is almost zero due to interaction of the p1 and p2 in addition the term p1 evolution mechanism is closely related to the streamwise velocity gradient in shear layer u x is positive and negative at the middle because the acceleration or deceleration of streamwise velocity takes place near the primary vortices on this account the term p1 and ω x are of the same sign leading to the enhancement of primary vortices subsequently the primary vortex gradually dissipates because of the disappearance of positive and negative velocity gradient for another hand the separation mechanism of the free shear layer is also related to its surrounding static pressure the presence of the reverse pressure gradient around the cylinder surface leads to the free shear layer separating and producing vorticity in the wake based on the fact that the secondary vortex generated by the p1 p2 can affect the development of the shear layer so the p1 p2 term is certainly contact with the static pressure 4 3 velocity distributions and vortex formation length in order to further analyze the flow mechanism it is important to understand the velocity distribution characteristics in the wake region of the cylinder fig 10 shows that the evolution of the mean longitudinal velocity u u along the centerline of the wake for different cases at re 3900 the typical curves for wavy cylinder at re 3000 and 5000 have been published by lam et al 2004 and zhang et al 2018 are also plotted for comparison with the present results as seen from fig 10 there is a little discrepancy between the current study and other published results which is attributed to the comprehensive effect related to notable differences in calculation method and reynolds number etc one can point out that the wake flow of the cylinder begins to change from streamwise flow to reverse flow at x d m 0 5 moreover the mean longitudinal velocity distributions differ largely from those of other cases for the λ d m 2 75 and the u u distribution for the λ d m 2 75 is significantly offset upstream along the near wake revealing a smaller reversal flow than that of other cases as shown in fig 10 a figs 11 and 12 show transverse distributions of mean streamwise velocity u u at x d m 1 06 2 02 for wavy cylinder and the uc the experimental results of norberg 1998 and lam et al 2004 as well as the numerical results of kim 2006 are presented which show a larger discrepancy with that one can conclude that the near wake of the wavy cylinder shows more difference compared with that of the uc in u u distribution at three planes especially at y d m 0 5 the result suggests that wavy cylinder has a narrower near wake region compared to that of uc in fact there is a strong correlation between the wake width and the flow characteristics from fig 11 the u u distributions of the wake of the wavy cylinder shows a semi symmetric trend of u shaped and finally converges to the same level as the uc at x d m 1 06 and the results in les are basically consistent with the experiments lam et al 2004 the u u distribution of the λ d m 5 0 is delayed in the wake at the nodal plane as shown in fig 11 a this phenomenon can also be seen observed in fig 12 a the u u distributions basically tends to the v shaped semi symmetric and finally stabilizes to a smooth straight line at x d m 2 02 which can be observed from fig 12 it is worth noting that the wake pattern is slowly changing from u shaped to v shaped for the u u distributions when the amplitude gradually increases at both saddle and middle planes the high reverse flow indicates that the flow field around x d m 2 02 exist strong 3 d characteristics due to the stretching and deforming of flow vortices in the separated shear layer for further analysis the non dimensional mean spanwise velocity w u are presented near the edge of the immediate near wake y d m 1 x d m 1 1 5 and 2 as depicted in fig 13 the value of the mean spanwise of all wavy cylinders is zero at both the nodal planes and the saddle planes which confirms the results of lam and lin 2008 this kind distribution of the spanwise velocity strongly indicates that there are strong 3 d characteristics in wake flow for all wavy cylinders furthermore this three dimensional characteristic can also be observed in the sub section 4 1 as shown in fig 6 which is consistent with the formation of three dimensional separation lines of wavy cylinder and the vortex stretching and deformation also affect the wake for the wavy cylinder the time averaged formation length is closely related to the length of mean recirculation wake obtained by time averaged flow and directly affects the flow control effect the time averaged formation length l f is measured by distance between the cylinder center point and the point of u u 0 in the wake centerline the dimensionless time averaged formation length l f d m of the wavy cylinder and the uc are shown in table 4 compared with the result of the uc the magnitude l f of all wavy cylinders is significantly larger along the spanwise direction of wavy cylinder the length of l f at the nodal plane is shorter than that of the saddle plane in particular the l f of the λ d m 2 75 is smaller than the other two cases λ d m 1 8 and 5 0 at node and saddle on the other hand with the increasing of amplitude it can be seen that the l f of the case a d m 0 2 is larger than that of the a d m 0 05 the corresponding results of the a d m 0 05 and 0 2 can also be found from fig 6 in the sub section 4 1 4 4 pressure coefficients since the drag and lift force coefficients are mainly calculated from the surface pressure at such large reynolds number it is necessary to explore the pressure distribution characteristics along the circumference of the wavy cylinder the time averaged pressure coefficients of different wavy cylinders are depicted in figs 14 and 15 at different characteristic locations nodal middle and saddle planes for all the cases the maximum value of cp mean locates in stagnation point where the shear stress is zero williamson 1988 cp mean sharply decreases from the stagnation point position resulting in the generation of a favorable pressure gradient p x 0 that accelerates the boundary layer flow cp mean reaches its maximum negative value about θ 60 90 and then it grows to a relatively steady state within the range of u x 0 and p x 0 the boundary layer momentum is hindered by the adverse pressure gradient giving rise to separation of the boundary layer the maximum negative pressure point represents a point in which the pressure coefficient reaches its the lowest position the angular location of separation point mentioned in sub section 4 2 is defined as the position of the point on the surface of cylinder where the shear stress is zero the pressure coefficient remains almost constant after about θ 90 and the maximum negative pressure for the wavy cylinder are all smaller compared to the uc meanwhile the smaller suction can be found on the rear of the wavy cylinder fig 14 shows the variation of cp mean the wavy cylinder with different wavelength ratios and the results of the corresponding literatures lam and lin 2008 zhao et al 2011 are also given in general the maximum negative pressure point appears at θ 60 at the node and θ 60 for the saddle which can be seen from figs 14 a and c in fact the maximum negative pressure point of the three wavy cylinder changes from 60 8 to 63 4 at the saddle which are all smaller than the result 72 5 of the uc this change may also cause the separation line to converting from the straight line to the curve line in the lowest pressure position of the wavy cylinder along the spanwise for another one it is consistent with the difference in 3 d separation line variation at the saddle plane and nodal one mentioned earlier shown in fig 8 it can found that the lowest position of cp mean at the saddle is in front of the middle plane and the node plane showing that the separation of the saddle is earlier than that of other spanwise positions particularly the pressure distribution of the case λ d m 2 75 is close to that of the uc at both node and saddle planes suggesting that the advantageous effect of flow control is not obvious in this case the cp mean distributions are also presented in the wavy cylinder with different amplitudes the corresponding results of lam et al 2004 and zhang et al 2016 are also included for comparison as sketched in fig 15 generally when the amplitude ratio gradually increases the curves of the cp mean will converge to the same level at the three different planes and the convergence value of the λ d m 2 0 a d m 0 2 is larger than other cases in the position of the stagnation point θ 0 for the case of the a d m 0 2 the cp mean at the middle plane is significantly smaller than that of the saddle plane and the node plane lam and lin 2008 which is attributed to the difference in spanwise three dimensional flow a larger value of a d m may bring about a stronger three dimensional characteristics along the spanwise of the wavy cylinder at the middle plane with the larger a d m the greater the flow velocity can be obtained near the stagnation point which can result in a smaller pressure as shown in fig 15 b in addition with the a d m increasing the lowest pressure position at the saddle plane markedly increases from θ 55 to θ 68 and it reduces from θ 77 to θ 72 at the nodal plane finally considering again eq 7 the pressure component of the drag coefficient cd p is decided by cp mean of the wavy cylinder 4 5 force coefficients a summary of statistical values of fluid force coefficients as the function of λ d m and a d m are presented in figs 16 and 17 in this paper the mean drag coefficient is mainly composed of two parts the pressure and viscous components of the mean drag coefficient as shown in fig 16 a the c d increases gradually when λ d m moves from 1 8 to 2 75 then it drops in the λ d m range of 2 75 5 0 the variation of c d blue lines exhibits one peak at λ d m 2 75 suggesting that the flow control effect of the case of λ d m 2 75 is obviously poor in fact the optimal wake control is at λ d m 1 8 where the average drag coefficient is reduced by 12 fig 16 a also shows the variation of the viscous component of the drag coefficient with different wavelength ratios λ d m 1 8 5 0 and the pressure component of the drag coefficient is also presented it is known that the viscous drag coefficient raises as the λ d m increases and the viscous drag accounts for 28 2 of the total mean drag for the λ d m 5 0 while it accounts for only 8 03 for the uc on the other hand with an increase in λ d m the pressure component of the drag greatly climbs but slightly reduces from the λ d m 2 75 the pressure difference drag of the wavy cylinder is linked to the effect of the flow control for wavy cylinder compared with the uc the cl markedly reduces for the wavy cylinder with λ d m 1 8 and 5 0 and a significant reduction up to 74 is evident as shown in fig 16 b this further demonstrates that the flow control effect of wavy cylinders with λ d m 1 8 and 5 0 is very impressive in the wake region fig 17 shows that the mean drag coefficient components of drag coefficient and fluctuating lift coefficient for different wavy cylinders a d m 0 05 0 2 together with the results of the uc all the magnitude of statistical values of fluid force coefficients of the wavy cylinder is smaller than the results of uc the mean drag coefficient reaches a maximum value c d 1 03 at a d m 0 05 and then decreases nonlinearly to a minimum value c d 0 89 as the amplitude increases with a maximum reduction of 13 as shown in fig 17 a in addition fig 17 a also shows the variation of the pressure and viscous components of the drag coefficient for the different amplitude ratios a d m 0 05 0 2 the results of the uc are also presented for comparison the viscous drag does not fluctuate significantly with the amplitude ratio changing but the great ratio of viscous drag to total drag can be observed at the large amplitude ratio in addition the pressure component of the drag coefficient drops significantly in the range of large amplitude ratio which further reveals that the flow control of the wavy cylinder is mainly depending on the reduction of the pressure difference the results depicted in fig 17 show that the fluid force coefficients decrease as the a d m gradually increases for wavy cylinder compared with the uc the fluctuating lift coefficient reduction up to 93 can be observed for the case λ d m 2 0 a d m 0 2 in general a conspicuous reduction of the statistical values of fluid force coefficients can be achieved by increasing the wave amplitude ratio 5 conclusion the effects of the spanwise waviness are investigated on the control mechanism of the cylinder wake at re 3900 in this study the calculated results of the wavy cylinder are compared with the uc the distribution characteristics of the wake flow the boundary vorticity flux the fluid coefficients and the flow separation are analyzed and the internal coupling mechanism is also explained the main results of the present work are summarized as follows i the free shear layer of the λ d m 2 75 gradually separates and forms vortex shedding near the downstream of the wall of the cylinder and the flow control is not significant in this case for the case λ d m 1 8 the vortex formation length is obviously larger than that of the uc in addition with the increasing of the amplitude the boundary layer separation is markedly delayed ii the bvf further explains the source mechanism of vorticity which is closely related to the flow control the surface streamline distribution of the cylinder is related to vorticity transportation and deformation resulting in the difference of the flow control between wavy cylinder and uc the stretching and turning mechanism of the ω x provide strong evidence for the transportation and deformation of vortices in fact the p1 and p2 terms have a large correlation with the velocity distribution and static pressure in near wall of the cylinder iii the distribution of present mean velocities changes from a symmetrical u shaped to a v shaped when characteristic position x d m moves further downstream in the wake region of the wavy cylinder from the saddle to the node the mean spanwise velocity distribution shows a significant wave shaped flow pattern and 3 d characteristic along the spanwise direction iv for the different wavy cylinders the development of the circumference pressure coefficient is obviously different between node and saddle the magnitude of cp mean converges to the same result as the uc for the λ d m 2 75 and the cp mean value is proportional to the amplitude ratio the mean drag coefficient and the fluctuating lift coefficient rapidly increase and then markedly decrease with the changing of the wavelength ratio in fact the mean drag coefficient reaches the maximum value of 1 04 at λ d m 2 75 however the cl decreases rapidly with the increasing of wave amplitude the flow control of the wavy cylinder depends on the pressure component of the drag coefficient credit authorship contribution statement zhihao zhang software validation writing original
