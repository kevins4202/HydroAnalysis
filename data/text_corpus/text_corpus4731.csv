23655,hurricane induced wave forces on a box girder deck for a coastal bridge are investigated by experimental tests and numerical simulations a series of 70 experiments which include six types of wave heights three types of deck elevations and various water depths are conducted the results show that there are five types of submergence coefficients that cover the elevated and submerged conditions for each deck elevation following the experiments a two dimensional numerical model is utilized to investigate the wave forces on the box girder deck in which reynolds averaged navier stokes equations combined with k ω turbulence model are applied for wave simulations the volume of fluid method is used to trace the interface of air and water this numerical model shows a close agreement with the experimental data in most cases the laboratory experiment and numerical simulation are different compared to other wave in bridge studies in that the box girder superstructure is complex and unique this study can provide a beneficial tool for estimating hurricane induced extreme wave forces for this type of coastal bridge superstructure regular wave forces on a box girder deck are discussed in part i of these series of works while the irregular wave forces will be presented in part ii keywords regular wave experiments wave force coastal bridge superstructures hurricanes numerical models 1 introduction in the past decades hurricane induced storm surges and extreme waves caused devastating damages on coastal structures among these the 2005 hurricane katrina slamming the coasts of alabama mississippi and louisiana was one of the costliest natural disasters in u s history which caused extensive damages to infrastructures and coastal structures graumann et al 2005 fema 2006 the cost of rebuilding the coastal bridges damaged in hurricanes katrina and ivan was more than 1 billion nickas et al 2005 coastal bridges are vulnerable to damage under these natural disasters i e hurricanes and typhoons these extreme conditions often cause the water level to rise producing huge waves that hit directly on girders which are only installed at the piers by their own weight or connected by some weak joints the failure of coastal bridges connecting the roads from islands to the mainland in the western pacific region may cause traffic paralysis and delayed rescue activities further aggravating the disaster the failure mechanisms of coastal bridges under extreme waves still require further studies xu and cai 2014 rebuilding of the damaged bridges and retrofitting the existing coastal bridges require an accurate estimation of hurricane induced wave forces on coastal bridge superstructures therefore it is very important to improve our understanding of hurricane induced wave forces on these structures during the last decades several investigations on the effects of wave forces on coastal structures have been conducted kulin 1958 french 1979 mcpherson 2008 lau et al 2011 seiffert et al 2014a 2014b zhao et al 2014 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015 to simulate the solitary wave forces on coastal structures hayashi 2013 conducted small scale experiments to investigate the effect of tsunami wave forces on a box girder deck which is generally applied to expressway bridges he provided a detailed discussion on the tsunami wave forces on the box girder deck and converted the maximum horizontal wave force and vertical wave force measured in the experiment into values at actual bridge level and compared them with the dead load of the girder of the target bridge a brief comparison between the wave forces of the box girder and t type girder was conducted however the reason for the differences was not explained in detail hayashi 2013 focused on the tsunami wave forces which are different from the regular wave forces used in this study xu and cai 2015 used the dynamic mesh updating technique to investigate the lateral restraining stiffness effect on solitary wave induced forces on decks istrati et al 2016 conducted large scale experiments to study the tsunami induced wave forces on a bridge the effects of fluid structure interaction and air venting on wave forces were considered in their experiments xu et al 2016b conducted a comprehensive study on predicting solitary wave forces on a typical deck using a numerical method based on the numerical simulations they expanded the formula which was originally proposed by mcpherson 2008 to estimate accurately the solitary wave forces on a typical deck with girders the effect of entrapped air on solitary wave forces on a deck was presented by seiffert et al 2016 and they also found that there was a significant reduction in vertical uplift forces when air relief openings were added to the bridge model xu et al 2016d investigated the wave forces on a typical bridge deck based on a component level assessment and the countermeasure of air venting holes qu et al 2017 investigated the effect of the opening size of vents and other relevant factors including the submergence depth of the deck wave height water depth and number of girders on hydrodynamic loads through a two dimensional 2d numerical study sarfaraz and pak 2017 conducted a comprehensive study on tsunami induced loads on bridge superstructures using smoothed particle hydrodynamics furthermore simple non dimensional equations were proposed for estimating the tsunami induced forces and moments on the bridge superstructures in their study they were mostly focused on solitary wave forces these experiments mainly focused on coastal structures such as the plate and bridge deck with t type girders among these studies only hayashi 2013 investigated the wave effects on a box girder experiments and numerical simulations involving periodic wave forces on coastal bridges were also conducted by many researchers wang 1970 conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate the validity of his prediction rules for estimating the maximum uplift wave forces induced by various incident waves on a flat plate he indicated that the magnitude of impulse force is huge and engineers should pay close attention to it shih and anastasiou 1992 showed the important features associated with this type of loading for the first time by conducting a series of laboratory experiments that covered regular and irregular wave conditions they also used these experimental data to improve the formula that is used to estimate the uplift wave forces on the bottom of the decks in shallow and intermediate water depths takaki 2001 proposed the optimal inclination of a submerged plate under a breakwater based on the maker and cell method and laboratory experiments douglass et al 2004 reviewed existing methods to estimate wave forces on highway bridge superstructures and other coastal structures they found that existing methods were inadequate for estimating the wave forces on bridge decks a modified empirical equation for estimating the wave forces on bridge decks was proposed by douglass et al 2006 based on laboratory experiments aashto 2008 proposed parametric equations for calculating the wave forces on coastal bridges based on numerous experimental tests mcpherson 2008 proposed a new method to calculate the horizontal and vertical forces on typical u s bridges based on large scale wave basin experiments and existing theoretical methods bradner 2008 conducted 1 5 large scale experiments to investigate realistic wave forces on the i 10 bridge the roller and rail system were used in their experiments to simulate the dynamic response of the bridge structure sheppard and marin 2009 conducted a comprehensive study of the wave forces on the i 10 escambia bay bridge through wave tank tests and a theoretical wave force model with drag and inertia coefficients had been proposed for estimating the wave forces on coastal bridges cuomo et al 2009 conducted large scale experiments to investigate the dynamics of coastal bridges and the effect of openings in the bridge deck on wave forces the wave forces on eight 1 30 scale bridge models with various deck clearances were investigated by henry 2011 bradner et al 2011 conducted unique 1 5 scale experiments with consideration of the stiffness of the horizontal support system which can better examine the dynamic properties of a bridge system furthermore the relationship between the wave forces on the superstructure and the hydraulic parameters were also presented in their study rey and touboul 2011 conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the relevance of a linear theory that describe the efficiency of wave breaking and the forces and moments on a horizontal plate more recently sheppard et al 2015 proposed a wave and surge atlas which is presented in a geographic information system to compute surge wave loads on bridge superstructures seiffert et al 2015 conducted 1 35 scale laboratory experiments to measure nonlinear wave forces on a typical two lane coastal bridge under various conditions in their work different waves and several locations of decks covering fully submerged partially submerged and above still water level swl were selected the experimental data were compared with computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation results and those of the empirical equation proposed by douglass et al 2006 guo et al 2015 performed hydrodynamic experiments to investigate the wave forces on the superstructure of coastal highway bridges they found that the slamming component of the wave force is not noticeable in the horizontal direction and the total vertical force can be taken as twice the quasi static vertical force the horizontal and vertical forces on a horizontal plate in shallow water were studied through laboratory experiments by hayatdavoodi et al 2015b two water depths five wavelengths and six plate elevations were chosen in their experiment to investigate the wave forces on the plate under cnoidal waves a series of excellent works was conducted by hayatdavoodi 2013 hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2012 2014 2015 hayatdavoodi et al 2015a and xu and cai 2017 which greatly contributed to the understanding of extreme periodic wave induced forces on coastal bridges almost all of the above studies were focused on the horizontal plate or the typical bridge deck however none of them focused on the box girder deck so far which is widely used in the construction of long span coastal bridges this study presents a series of experiments involving periodic regular waves acting on a box girder deck under various wave characteristics and water depths and under submerged and elevated conditions the complex shape of the superstructure and simple wave form make these experiments useful for designing superstructures moreover it is beneficial to apply the results of this study for bridges in the western pacific region where box girders are used for the numerical simulations the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are utilized to describe the mean flow motion and the volume of fluid vof method is used to trace the free surface of water this approach was also adopted by xiao et al 2010 who proposed a wave loading model based on the rans equations which was used to simulate the wave forces on the biloxi bay bridge under hurricane katrina induced waves jin and meng 2011 used the software flow 3d to investigate the wave loads on bridge structures xu et al 2016a also used the rans equations with the shear stress transport k ω turbulence model to simulate the deck wave interaction similar works were also conducted by hayatdavoodi et al 2015b to simulate the wave propagation wave breaking and wave impact on coastal bridges the setup of the laboratory experiment is described in section 2 the results of regular waves are presented in section 3 in section 4 comparisons between the experimental data and numerical results are presented then the hurricane induced wave forces on the t type girder deck with similar size as the box girder deck are calculated by numerical simulations furthermore a method for estimating the maximum wave forces on a box girder deck is proposed we close this study by elaborating the conclusions drawn from the experimental data and comparisons 2 experimental set up 2 1 experimental facility experiments were conducted at tianjin port engineering institute ltd tianjin china the wave flume is 68 m in length 1 m in width and 1 6 m in height periodic waves are generated on the left side of the flume by a wave generator without reflection which was purchased from mitsui shipbuilding co ltd the wave generator can eliminate the influence of reflection of incident waves by using an active wave absorbing method the wave machine generates waves that combine the incident wave and eliminating wave which is used to eliminate the reflection wave the combined waves are generated according to real time signal of wave motions in the wave flume therefore the reflection of the incident wave can be eliminated using this method a wave absorber is placed at the right side of the wave flume to reduce the wave reflection and absorb the wave energy it is made of beach pebbles with a 1 5 slope a rigid steel frame is used to connect the bridge specimen to a 3 component dynamometer this configuration prevents the 3 component dynamometer from water splashes and also ensures that there is enough space between the water and the 3 component dynamometer the distance between the top of specimen and the 3 component dynamometer is 28 85 cm a plastic bag covering the dynamometer is also used to prevent water splashes on the sensors all of these materials are suspended on a steel support above the wave flume see fig 1 a and b 2 2 superstructure model and configuration the prototype model is patterned from a 4 lane long span coastal bridge which is under construction and located at the taiwan strait decks with box girders are widely used for long span coastal bridges in china the parameters of the model and corresponding prototype are given in table 1 the fabrication errors of the specimen are less than 1 0 mm the model of the coastal bridge is constructed from polymethyl methacrylate the inside of this model is empty and the outside is closed there are only two holes in the front and back of the model which are used to insert the sensors that measure the pressure on the surface of model the detailed arrangements of points and photo of the sensors are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively as shown in fig 2 a the cables of pressure sensors are close to the wall of the flume which is necessary to avoid the influence of incoming waves the hole size is small enough to allow only the cables to pass through and that there is no opening for water to get into the model all of points 1 16 are located in the centerline of the model in order to determine the sampling frequency the wave forces on the box girder deck were measured repetitively using different types of sampling frequencies from 100 to 300 hz of the dynamometer and pressure gauges however the results showed that there were the no significant changes on the data by using more than 100 hz sampling frequency although higher sampling frequencies are suggested for measuring the impulsive pressures and forces in many studies such frequencies were used for high elevation cases additionally seiffert et al 2014b also mentioned that the 100 hz sampling rate is deemed sufficient for experiments to capture the impulsive pressures and forces therefore the 100 hz sampling frequency was used here because the width of the wave flume is 1 m and the length of the deck is 0 98 m the problem is treated two dimensionally and the forces were computed per unit of deck length however the structure length was found to affect only the 2d accuracy for extremely narrow spans sheppard and marin 2009 in addition many 2d experiments and numerical simulations were conducted in many studies sheppard and marin 2009 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 xu et al 2016c xu and cai 2017 the wave height is measured using capacitance type wave gauges with a sampling rate of 50 hz and a precision of 0 1 mm the wave height without the model is measured at the center of the model location it is used to investigate the wave parameters at this position when the incident wave propagates in the flume the wave heights measured by the capacitance type wave gauges are used to compare with the theoretical solutions of the wave theory which can further ensure the accuracy of the wave maker it is found that both the cnoidal wave theory and the stokes wave theory can be used in generating the waves because the water depth in the experiments are either shallow or transitional zhu 1983 proposed a range of several wave theories based on measured data and analysis of these data it is suggested to use t g d 10 for stokes fifth order wave theory and t g d 10 for the cnoidal wave theory this parameter in the current study is 7 7 t g d 12 5 therefore the cnoidal wave theory is chosen in the current study the first order cnoidal wave theory is used as the theory for the wave maker the paddle motion of the piston type wave maker is controlled by an experimental software the paddle displacement and the initial stroke position are generated following the method proposed by goring 1979 the formula for the wave maker motion with time ξ is as follows 1 ξ t h k d n 1 n a n n sin 2 n π t t ξ l 2 a n e k m 2 m 2 n 0 2 π 2 m 2 k 2 n q n 1 q 2 n n 1 where h is the wave height d is the water depth t is the wave period t is the time l is the wave length and k and e are the first and second complete elliptic integral with m as parameter respectively m 2 m 2 1 q exp πk m k m k 2π l and n is the expansion term of the fourier series 2 3 test procedure and data acquisition the hurricane induced wave characteristics were selected from the measured data of previous studies and the construction sites of the coastal bridges seventy cases shown in fig 3 a were tested during the experiments which include 11 types of water depths and 3 types of deck elevations equal to 0 263 m 0 398 m and 0 533 m all the deck elevations in this study refer to the distance between the bottom of the wave flume to the bottom of the box girder the different water depths ensure that there are 5 types of submergence coefficients c s 0 0 5 1 1 5 2 of deck for each elevation the specification of the submergence coefficient is shown in fig 3 a a submergence coefficient c s 0 means that the bottom of the girder is equal to the swl and c s 1 means that the top of deck is equal to the swl the elevated conditions were considered only for the case of c s 0 in the current study we performed a series of tests before conducting the experiments it was found that the vertical wave forces on the deck with box girder for other elevated conditions are no larger than those for c s 0 additionally the wave forces on the box girder deck for c s 2 were smaller than those for c s 2 therefore we chose a submergence coefficient from 0 to 2 in the experiment the significant component of the impulse horizontal forces for elevated conditions will be further investigated in the future various wave heights from 0 0667 m to 0 2333 m with an interval of 0 0333 m were tested in the experiments for each submergence coefficient a wide range of water depths was selected from 0 263 m to 0 713 m each of the experimental cases was conducted three times to reduce the repeatable errors the maximum wave forces presented in this study were obtained from the averaged of the maximum value during one wave period in order to verify the accuracy and repeatability of the experimental data the comparison of wave forces between the measurements by the 3 component dynamometer and the integral of pressures is presented in table 2 which shows a close agreement between the two results the differences may be due to the pressure gauges which were not covered throughout the model the elevation of the deck model was 0 263 m in these cases and the wave period was 2 04 s in order to determine the influence of the suspension system on the measurements of wave forces a set of experiments was conducted for each condition three times with the suspension system alone the results of these three experiments were used to reduce the experimental errors as much as possible the measured wave forces were subtracted from the total wave forces when both the deck model and suspension system were present there were some differences in the flow characteristics between these two scenarios owing to the interaction of the wave and bridge deck when the deck was present however the differences were neglected in this study and the force acting on the suspension system alone was subtracted from the total force acting on the bridge deck and suspension system the actual wave height of the incident wave without the model was also measured at the center of the model location using the capacitance type wave gauge the bottom friction has some influence on the wave propagation resulting in some reduction of wave height during the wave propagation before conducting the experiments a set of experiments was conducted without the model to ensure that the wave characteristics obtained from the wave gauge are the specified values as mentioned above then the test settings were used to generate waves in this study four types of wave forces are considered namely the maximum vertical force uplift force minimum vertical force downward force maximum horizontal force as the positive force and finally the minimum horizontal force as the negative force shown in fig 5 i and j the vertical f v and horizontal f h forces are presented in normalized forms by dividing them by the length of the deck l 0 98 m it is important that all of these forces are measured by the dynamometer and the pressure sensors do not include the buoyancy force because there is a rigid steel frame between the deck and the dynamometer the effect of the rigid steel frame on the measurements of the buoyancy forces need to be eliminated therefore all of the measurements have been set as zero when the installation of the model was completed to eliminate such effect furthermore the buoyancy forces can be easily estimated based on the volume of the specimen if required 3 experimental results and discussion to determine the repeatable errors of generating regular waves a series of experiments is conducted for each case without the bridge model during one period a wave gauge located at the center of the model is used to measure the wave heights the values are compared with theoretical solutions it is necessary to ensure that waves generated by the wave maker have only small differences the comparisons between the measured values and theoretical solutions of the cnoidal wave theory are shown in fig 4 here the wave period is 2 04 s the measurements of surface elevations agree closely with those calculated using the equations of cnoidal wave theory the repeatable errors are within 4 deviation fig 5 shows the time series of the wave forces on the deck with a box girder under the condition of a wave period of 2 04 s wave height of 0 0167 m and deck elevation of 0 398 m for various submergence coefficients in all of the cases in this study the total duration of the wave acting on the specimen is 64 s the wave forces are separated into two parts a quasi static force and a high frequency impulse force as shown in fig 5 the low pass 8th order butterworth filter is used to filter out the higher frequency components of the force the initial impulse force signal is then determined by subtracting the filtered quasi static force from the total force additionally the signal of the structural vibrations is collected with the wave acting on the specimen after analyzing the digital vibration signal the frequency of the structure is approximately 12 40 hz the high frequency oscillations are mainly attributed to the natural frequency of the specimen with the rigid steel frame and the frequencies of 12 20 hz are attributed to the frequency of the specimen with the rigid steel frame owing to the joints between the 3 component dynamometer and the specimen with the rigid steel frame therefore a low pass digital filter with a cutoff frequency of 12 hz is used to separate the component of the structural vibrations from the impulse forces and obtain the final impulse force the wave forces on the box girder deck are compared with each other under different submergence coefficients it should be noted that the change in submergence coefficient is caused by the change in water depth the elevation of the deck is constant which is in accordance with the actual situation when the water level rises with time during hurricane events with increasing submergence coefficients the maximum horizontal force decreases as shown in fig 5 in the elevated and partially submerged conditions the impulse force has a substantial contribution to the total wave force when the submergence coefficient is 0 the bottom of the box girder is equal to the swl and the total horizontal force can be two times the quasi static force with the increase in duration of the wave action the latter maximum wave force at approximately t 16 s is larger than the former one at approximately t 13 5 s this phenomenon has never been observed in previous studies focusing on wave forces on typical t type decks combining the results of the time series and the snapshots of the experiments figs 7 and 8 it can be observed that the phenomenon is caused by the specific shape of box girder the front empty part shown in fig 2 b under the deck and in front of the box girder restricts the propagation of the wave upward and forward shown in fig 7 c then the latter wave interacts with the reflected wave from the box wave breaking occurs on the surface of the model during the interaction between the wave and bridge model the complex interaction between the wave and the deck also causes a huge magnitude of impulse force fig 7 shows snapshots of the interaction of the wave and specimen for the cases of fig 5 a and b and it also provides the corresponding snapshots when the peak values points a b and c in fig 5 a and b occur during the interaction of the wave and specimen it can be observed that a lot of wave breaking occurs when the wave is acting on the bottom of the deck this is mainly caused by the blocking effect of the front empty part the peak value for point a and b occurs when the wave is acting on the web of the girder and the bottom of the deck respectively the negative horizontal force in this case is extremely small because only small amount of water is on the back of the box girder when c s 0 5 the box girder is partially submerged in the water but the deck is still over the swl because the front empty part of the model is partially submerged in the water the impact is considerable there are two peak values of wave forces appearing in this case due to the existence of the front empty part which causes the wave to hit the deck and box girder in sequence when c s 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 the negative horizontal forces are larger than those of the above cases because the model is completely submerged in water and the wave forces on the back of the box girder become larger the positive maximum horizontal wave force is almost constant in order to obtain a deep understanding of the wave action in these cases a fourier analysis of the time series of horizontal force is conducted the fourier spectra of wave force with two different c s values under the same wave conditions are depicted in fig 6 it should be noted that the wave forces used in fig 6 are the untreated total wave forces which contain structural vibrations it can be observed that the spectrum can be divided into three parts in the case of c s 0 shown in fig 6 a namely the quasi static force impulse force and structural vibration from the quasi static forces obtained above it can be concluded that the frequency of the quasi static force is in the range of 0 2 hz the dominant frequency is 0 5 hz which is equal to the frequency of the incoming wave other high frequencies in this range are mainly due to the nonlinear waves and the higher order velocity potentials which are caused by incident and diffracted waves the same conclusions were also presented in the study by guo et al 2015 additionally the frequencies of the impulse forces can be obtained using the fourier analysis the main frequencies of the impulse forces on the deck with box girder are in the range of 2 6 hz which is different from the range of 5 10 hz proposed by guo et al 2015 the difference is possibly caused by the geometrical shape of the girder and the different experimental scales between these two deck models the box girder deck has a complex shape of the empty part which causes the wave energy to shift from a low frequency to a high frequency fig 6 b also shows that the influence of nonlinear waves and the higher order velocity potentials on wave forces still exist within the range of frequencies of 0 5 2 hz there is also a high frequency component even under a deeply submerged condition of the deck i e fig 6 c however for the vertical forces with c s 2 the high frequency component rarely exists fig 6 d this part of high frequency oscillations is related to the structural vibrations of the model and the suspension system after finishing a series of fourier analyses of these high frequency signals the vibration frequency of the structure is in the range of 12 40 hz therefore all of these structural noises are filtered out from the data that is analyzed subsequently both for the dynamometer and pressure sensors the vertical impulse force is found in the condition of c s 0 and 0 5 the wave partly acts on the deck with a wave height of 0 167 m a small part of the wave overtops the top of the deck and then induces a small downward force for c s 0 and 0 5 fig 5 b and d with the increase in submergence depth the downward force increases and reaches the maximum value for c s 1 and 1 5 fig 5 f and h when the submergence coefficient is equal to 2 the larger submergence depth results in a smaller downward force because a large water depth decreases the influence of wave blocking effects owing to the wave blocking effect a large amount of water will overtop the deck even for a small submergence depth which causes the maximum vertical force to decrease with an increase in wave height this conclusion can be verified in fig 5 b the same phenomenon is also observed in the snapshots of the experiment fig 8 shows the snapshots of the wave overtopping at approximately 13 5 s and 16 s in the case of fig 5 b it can be observed from the snapshots of wave overtopping that the blocking effect of the front empty part causes a larger wave run up for the second wave the water volume of wave overtopping in the second wave is larger than that in the first wave fig 5 b also shows that the maximum vertical force becomes smaller during the wave action the front empty part of the model prevents the wave to move up and forward it could lead to an interaction with the incoming waves and the reflected waves which causes a larger wave run up and results in reduction of vertical forces fig 6 also shows the fourier spectrum of the vertical wave force with c s 0 and 2 from this figure it could also be noted that the vertical force f v with higher frequency is weaker than the horizontal force f h it can be concluded from figs 5 and 6 that the empty part of the bridge model significantly affects the wave force on the box girder deck guo et al 2015 found that the impulse component of the wave force is not noticeable in the horizontal direction and the total vertical force can be taken as twice the quasi static vertical force for the deck with t type girders however in the current study of the wave forces on the deck with box girder the impulse component of the wave force is not noticeable in the vertical direction and the total horizontal force can be taken as twice the quasi static horizontal force this significant difference is mostly caused by the different geometrical shapes between these two girders the experimental data of the vertical uplift maximum force f v vertical downward maximum force f v horizontal positive maximum force f h and horizontal negative maximum force f h with various submergence coefficients are shown in figs 9 11 these four types of wave forces are the total forces on the specimen the wave force increases with the increment of wave height in fig 9 for the deck elevation of 0 263 m the wave blocking effect of the front empty part and the impulse component of wave forces lead to a larger vertical uplift force and positive horizontal force for higher wave heights at c s 0 the influence of the front empty part is small at c s 0 5 compared with that at c s 0 because the empty part is partially submerged in the water at c s 0 5 the blocking effect of the front empty part has a negative effect on the vertical uplift forces therefore the vertical uplift force is smallest when c s 1 because the large wave overtops the top of the deck and reduces the uplift force this phenomenon can also be verified in fig 9 b where the vertical downward force is largest for c s 1 compared with other conditions with a submergence coefficient larger than 0 5 the blocking effect has little influence on the impulse component of wave forces due to the large submergence depth of the superstructure which can be clearly observed from the time series of wave forces shown in fig 5 fig 9 b also shows that when the submergence coefficient is 2 the larger submerged depth causes a smaller downward force the wave is overtopping the top of the deck with c s 0 which led to small vertical downward forces with wave height of 6 67 cm and 10 cm with the small wave height the horizontal positive force is almost constant under various submerged conditions however with the increase in wave height the empty part and the impact action of the wave become the key factors to determine the magnitude of the horizontal positive forces the small horizontal positive force with a wave height of 6 67 cm and submergence coefficient of 0 is caused by the small wave that interacts with the web of the girder furthermore it induced a small horizontal positive force because small wave energy is transmitted the horizontal positive force for c s 0 5 has a small value because the model is partially submerged in the water in fact when the deck is near the swl the empty part of the deck breaks the incoming wave and results in energy loss thus only a small proportion of wave energy is transmitted it can be observed that a higher wave height at c s 0 can induce a larger horizontal negative force the cause of this phenomenon will be discussed in the following based on the analysis of pressures figs 10 and 11 show that the wave forces for these two deck elevations are different from each other the vertical uplift force first increases and then decreases with the increment of wave height in figs 10 a and 11 a for c s 0 however for other submerged cases the vertical uplift force increases with increasing wave height owing to the wave blocking effect the wave run up occurs easily with a large wave height for c s 0 the peak value of the maximum vertical forces for the deck elevation of 0 398 m appears at a wave height of 0 1667 m but the peak value of maximum vertical forces for the deck elevation of 0 533 m is appeared at wave height of 0 2 m this is possibly caused by the different relatively superstructure width to wavelength ratios owing to the different water depths used in these two cases as shown in figs 10 c and 11 c the horizontal positive force for the highest wave height under c s 0 is not so large as expected because with large wave heights the interaction between the incoming wave and the empty part of the deck the wave blocking effect of the empty part will lead to wave breaking and energy loss by increasing the wave height from 16 67 cm to 20 cm for c s 0 the positive horizontal force decreases because when the wave amplitude is larger than the height of the deck 9 cm the wave acts on the edge of the deck first then on the web of the girder furthermore the acting times on the deck and the girder are not the same and the process of wave acting on the edge of the deck causes the wave to separate and further induce energy loss the wave forces shown in figs 10 c and 11 c are smaller than those in fig 9 c under the same wave height for c s 0 a possible reason for this behavior is that the component of impulse force decreases with the increase in water depth the horizontal negative forces with the deck elevation of 0 533 m have significant differences from those of 0 398 m and 0 263 m the cause of this phenomenon will be discussed in the following based on the analysis of pressures in order to better understand the hydrodynamic phenomena and the wave forces on the box girder deck the pressures at 16 points were measured in the experiment fig 2 as discussed previously several configurations were selected for a detailed pressure p distribution during a certain time series in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 a the pressures at points 5 6 and 7 are very small because the positive pressures at these points are caused by the splashing of water the small negative pressures at these three points are caused by the effects of surface tension of the splashing of water the pressures at points 1 4 are not illustrated in the figure because their values are relatively small the horizontal positive force is contributed by the pressures at points 8 and 9 because the wave with a wave height of 6 67 cm can only act on the web of the girder the negative pressures at points 8 and 9 are caused by the water movement from the surface of the web of girder the pressures at points 10 and 11 are the main components of the vertical force which include the uplift and downward forces the wave acting on the bottom of the deck and the girder provides the large uplift pressure there is a large downward force generated by the overtopping of water the pressures at points12 16 are very small because there is almost no wave acting on these parts in fig 12 b the maximum pressure at point 5 occurs at the relative time of 3 13 which is later than the time of maximum pressures at points 6 10 hence the positive pressure is caused by the wave overtopping the top of the deck compared with point 6 point 7 at the bottom of the deck bears a larger pressure the larger pressure at point 7 results in the larger vertical uplift force compared with the other cases shown in fig 9 a the pressures at points 8 and 9 at the web of the girder compose the main part of the horizontal positive force the pressures at these two points also have some contributions to the vertical uplift force owing to the angle of the web the pressures at points 10 11 and 12 at the bottom of the girder compose the main part of the vertical uplift force the largest horizontal negative force in fig 9 d with a wave height of 13 33 cm at c s 0 is caused by the positive pressure at point 13 at the back of the web of the girder hence the significant great change in the horizontal negative force for three different wave heights with c s 0 is due to the interaction of the large wave height and the back empty part compared with fig 12 a the pressures in fig 12 b change significantly over time to explain the phenomenon that the horizontal negative force at the deck elevation of 0 533 m significantly differs from that at elevation 0 398 m pressures for the corresponding configurations are shown in fig 12 c d e and f compared with the pressures shown in fig 12 e for the deck elevation of 0 533 m the pressures in fig 12 c with the deck elevation of 0 398 m vary notably in time the maximum pressures are smaller with higher model elevations compare fig 12 c with fig 12 e the phase difference between the positive pressure points 8 and 9 and negative pressure points 13 and 14 for the deck elevation of 0 533 m in fig 12 f is higher than that for the deck elevation of 0 398 m in fig 12 d the higher phase difference results in a larger horizontal negative force the larger horizontal negative force for c s 1 and smaller horizontal negative force for c s 0 with the deck elevation of 0 533 m lead to the phenomenon mentioned above several conclusions can be obtained based on the pressures in fig 12 larger values of wave height and the wave blocking effect in the front empty part with c s 0 and 1 easily cause a large amount of water to overtop the top of deck which can be proved by the large positive pressures at points 1 5 in fig 12 e and f the negative pressures at the bottom of the girder points 10 11 and 12 and positive pressures points 1 5 which are generated from the wave overtopping the deck compose the vertical downward force the positive pressures at the bottom of the girder positive pressures on the bottom of the deck and part of the positive pressures on the web of the girder compose the vertical uplift force the horizontal forces are mostly composed of the pressures on the web of the girder the bottom of the deck including point 7 bears a larger wave force than the other parts of the deck which should be considered in the design of structural elements of bridge superstructures 4 numerical simulation in this study the hurricane induced wave forces on the box girder deck for various submerged conditions and wave conditions are simulated with a 2d numerical model the computations are performed using the open source cfd platform openfoam here the fluid can be considered as an incompressible viscous material the rans equations with the k ω turbulence model are utilized to describe the mean flow motion the vof method is used to trace the interface of air and water wave generation is achieved using waves2foam which is a wave generation toolbox in openfoam two dimensional numerical simulations of the wave forces on coastal bridge superstructures had been conducted a study by istrati et al 2016 discussed the role of air entrapment in the case of an i girder bridge and suggested that three dimensional 3d effects can be significant when the bridge is impacted by solitary waves however very few 3d models have been developed owing to the high computational cost additionally 2d numerical simulations can provide reasonably accurate results and save extensive computational cost bozorgnia and lee 2012 in this section the governing equations and boundary conditions of the 2d model is presented then the validation of grid convergence is also discussed the section will be closed by presenting the computation results as well as the suggested method for estimating the maximum wave forces on box girder decks 4 1 governing equations and boundary conditions in wave structure interaction problems water and air are considered in the computational domain in this study the rans equations are utilized to describe the mean flow motion which are based on the decomposition of navier stokes equations the standard k ω turbulence model is used to relate the reynolds stresses to the mean flow variables and close the equations with regard to the incompressible flows the continuity and momentum conservation equations should be written as follows 3 u 0 4 ρ u t ρ u u t p g x ρ μ u ρ τ σ κ α where x is the cartesian coordinate u is the velocity field p is the pressure in excess of the hydrostatic and ρ is the density which is equal to ρ x and varies with the content of air water in the computational cells t is the time g is the acceleration of gravity μ is the dynamic viscosity τ is the reynolds stress tensor σ is the surface tension coefficient κ is the surface curvature and α is the indicator function the surface tension coefficient between air and water at 20 c is 0 074 kg s2 a detailed discussion on these equations is provided in the study by jacobsen et al 2012 in order to predict accurately the interaction of wave and structure in this study the k ω turbulence model is applied based on the description by wilcox 2006 2008 where k is the turbulent kinetic energy and ω is the characteristic frequency of the turbulence the two additional advection diffusion equations take the following form for ω and k 5 ρ ω t ρ u ω c 1 p ω c 2 ω 2 σ d ω k ω t μ σ ω k ω ω 6 ρ k t ρ u k p k c 3 k ω μ σ v t k 7 σ d 0 k ω t 0 1 8 k ω t 0 where coefficients c 1 13 25 c 2 0 0708 c 3 0 09 σ ω 0 5 and σ 0 6 v t is the dynamic eddy viscosity while p w and p k are the production terms a detailed description of these parameters is provided in the studies by mayer and madsen 2000 and wilcox 2006 2008 in order to trace the interface of air and water the vof method by hirt and nichols 1981 is used the modified method used in this code introduces an indicator phase function α to describe the quantity of water per unit of volume at each cell the vof equation is combined with an artificial compressive term weller 2002 instead of using a compression differencing scheme to advect the volume fraction α and to maintain a sharp fluid interface 8 α t u α u r α 1 α 0 where u r min c α u max u and c α is a specific factor with a default value of 1 the boundary conditions in this study are summarized below additionally the sketch of the numerical setup with boundary conditions and the location of the sponge layer are shown in fig 13 the periodic cnoidal wave is generated in the inlet boundary on the left side of the flume based on the korteweg de vries kdv equations by svendsen and jonsson 1976 the free surface level and velocities for two coordinates x and z are prescribed in eqs 9 11 the pressure is calculated using a special boundary condition available in openfoam which is similar to neumann boundary conditions the free surface and velocity components of the cnoidal wave theory are given by 9 η 16 d 3 3 l 2 k k e h h c n 2 2 k x l t t m 10 u x g d 5 4 3 z t 2 d z t 2 4 d 2 3 h 2 d z t h 2 d 2 c n 2 h 2 4 d 2 c n 4 8 h k 2 l 2 d 3 z 2 2 d m 2 s n 2 c n 2 c n 2 d n 2 s n 2 d n 2 11 u z g d z 2 h k l d 1 z t d h

the first and second complete elliptic integral with m as parameter respectively z is the vertical coordinate of the given point in the coordinate system z t is the distance between the bottom of the wave flume and the wave trough cn is the jacobi elliptic cosine function sn is the jacobi elliptic sine function and dn is the jacobi elliptic delta function a detailed discussion on the cnoidal wave theory is provided in the studies by keulegan and patterson 1940 svendsen and jonsson 1976 and svendsen 2006 in order to avoid waves reflected internally in the computational domain to interfere with the wave maker boundary a relaxation zone with a length of 2 m is provided in the inlet boundary after testing the length of the relaxation zone it was found that a length of 2 m is sufficient for keeping a continuous surface elevation and avoiding divergent solutions during simulations an outlet boundary is utilized at the right side of the computational domain in order to prevent significant reflection of the wave going out of the outlet boundary a relaxation zone with a length of 5 m is added to the outlet boundary the relaxation function is given as 12 α r χ r 1 exp χ r 3 5 1 exp 1 1 for χ r 0 1 and is applied inside the relaxation zone in the following way 13 ϕ α r ϕ c o m p u t e d 1 α r ϕ t arg e t where ϕ is either u or α the variation of α r is the same as that given by fuhrman et al 2006 the definition of χ r is such that α r is always 1 at the interface between the non relaxed part of the computational domain and the relaxation zone however the relaxation zone for the outlet boundary does not work perfectly there will be a little reflection into the domain therefore the length of the computation domain is chosen as 70 m the computational domain includes 68 meter long domain for wave structure interaction and the 2 meter long relaxation zones for the inlet boundary the 68 m length of the domain is equal to that of the experimental wave flume the domain for the wave structure interaction can ensure that the time series of wave forces on the deck model are no less than 5 wave periods as soon as the reflected wave contaminates the results at the bottom of the computational domain the slip boundary conditions are utilized the swl separates the regions of the air phase and water phase at the initial condition an empty condition is used on the frontback boundary the boundary condition in the top of the numerical wave flume is the atmospheric boundary condition the atmospheric boundary condition in openfoam allows the water and air to follow out but only air is allowed to flow into the computational domain the pressure velocity coupling is solved using the improved algorithm called pimple which is a combination of the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators and simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithms it allows an equation under relaxation to ensure the convergence of all the equations at each time step additionally the first order euler implicit scheme is for time integration a detailed description of the discretization schemes in both space and time can be found in the study by jasak 1996 4 2 grid convergence in order to check the sensitivity and accuracy of the adopted mesh system in simulating the wave force on the box girder deck a set of mesh sizes is established by refining the mesh system until no significant changes in the simulation results are observed several types of structured mesh sizes are selected to attain grid convergence fig 14 illustrates the wave induced vertical uplift on the deck with box girder by using different mesh sizes expressed by the total mesh number n for d 0 398 m h 0 1 m t 2 04 s and c s 0 as shown in fig 14 the mesh size adopted in this study is feasible enough to satisfy the computation accuracy we set constant spatial distances of δx 0 005 m 0 003 m and 0 02 m for the near inlet zone main computational zone and far field from the main computational zone respectively moreover δz 0 01 m 0 0015 m and 0 003 m for the air zone near water zone and deep water zone respectively are used in all cases a very fine mesh is used near the wall boundaries for the analysis of the boundary layer and the mesh refinement close to the surface the y value non dimensional wall distance is used as a reference parameter in the current study the y value is kept smaller than 50 to ensure a satisfactory boundary layer modeling according to the logarithmic law for the wall additionally it can ensure that the pressure field and velocity field around the near wall regions are reliable in the computation domain the length of the numerical wave flume is kept constant at 70 m the height of the flume changes with different water depths and elevations it is also necessary to keep the water particles away from the top of the wave flume a computer with a single intel xeon e5 2670 processor 2 6 ghz 20 m cache cpu and 32 g internal storage is used for the numerical study moreover the average computational runtime of each case is approximately 628 600 s a time step with δt 0 001 s is used for all the numerical simulations in this study the courant number limitation is satisfied even in the worst condition of simulation cases with this time step the courant number is given as 14 c o δ t u δ x where δt is the time step and u is the absolute value of the velocity to ensure numerical stability and temporal accuracy the courant number should be less than 1 for the fixed value of spatial distance the maximum value of the absolute velocity is required the maximum value of the velocity occurs at the maximum water depth 0 713 m and maximum wave height 0 233 m then the maximum value of the velocity is calculated based on the eqs 9 11 therefore the time step is chosen as 0 001 s and the maximum value of the courant number c omax 0 5 is kept constant throughout the numerical simulations 4 3 results and comparisons numerical modeling for all experimental cases are conducted to compare with the experimental data however only cases of three submergence coefficients c s 0 1 and 2 and some selected wave heights are presented in this study the deck model in the numerical flume has the same size as the physical model the comparisons of four types of wave forces between the numerical results and the measurements are shown in figs 15 17 all vertical forces do not include the buoyancy force to have a reasonable comparison with the experimental data a close agreement is observed between the numerical results and measurements in all of the cases the agreement is very close for the submerged conditions and small wave heights and some differences occur for the elevated conditions owing to the wave breaking on the surface of the bridge model with the increase in water depth the differences between the numerical results and measurements become smaller the maximum horizontal and vertical forces with small wave heights for c s 0 show a very close agreement the difference in wave forces between the numerical results and measurements has a similar trend for large wave heights the vertical downward force for c s 1 differs for small water depths possibly because of the difference in the impulse force on the top of the deck in general the numerical model presented in the current study can be successfully used to calculate the wave forces on box girder decks the space under the deck and in front of the box girder has a significant influence in predicting the wave force the comparisons between the numerical and experimental time histories of wave forces are shown in figs 18 20 the numerical model shows a high level of accuracy in calculating the wave forces on the box girder deck the time series of wave forces in figs 18 20 cover elevated and submerged conditions and also show that the numerical model can effectively simulate the interaction of the wave and box girder deck using the numerical model a set of simulations is conducted to study the effect of the girder geometry on the wave forces on superstructures in the past decades many researchers focused on the wave forces on coastal bridges with the typical t type girders very few researchers have investigated the wave forces on box girder decks because of the noticeable difference in geometrical shape between these two girders their wave forces may have significant differences in this study the wave forces on the t type girder and box girder are calculated under the same conditions to investigate their differences the configurations of the deck with t type girders fig 21 is designed based on the size of the box girder deck to ensure that the top and lateral lengths of these two models have the same sizes three types of submergence coefficients several values of wave heights and three deck elevations are considered in this study the effects of wave air interaction on box girders are easier to determine than those for t type girders because the wave air interaction can be extremely nonlinear and have a significant effect on the induced wave forces for the case of t type girders therefore a comparison of the maximum wave forces on the t type girders between the measurements conducted by seiffert et al 2015 and the numerical results simulated using the openfoam code is conducted in the current study fig 22 the comparison is useful for validating the accuracy of the openfoam code nine cases with the same parameters for the specimen and the same size of wave flume are simulated a mesh configuration of δx 0 001 m and δz 0 001 m is used in the numerical simulations presented here fig 22 shows that the openfoam code has a high level of accuracy in simulating the wave air interaction and wave structure interaction figs 23 25 show the comparisons of the computed wave forces on the box girder and the t type girder deck all of these three figures illustrate that the wave forces on these two girders have great differences particularly for the elevated conditions in order to provide a direct insight into the differences caused by the different geometries snapshots of the wave bridge interaction distribution of the flow vector and pressure contours of these two types of girders are shown in figs 26 28 respectively these figures are useful to understand the differences caused by the different geometrical shape of the superstructures for the case of d 0 533 m h 0 1667 m t 2 04 s and c s 0 fig 26 shows the snapshots of the wave and superstructure interaction for the two types of girders where the red color represents the air and the blue one represents the water the horizontal positive forces on the t type girder deck are larger than that on the box girder deck the difference increases with the increase in wave height the vertical shape of the t type girder intensifies the horizontal positive wave force because the wave directly acts on the lateral side of the model however the box girder deck has an empty part before the girder which causes the wave force on the lateral side to be not so large than expected see fig 26 a the angle of the web also divides the wave force into horizontal and vertical parts but for the horizontal negative force the box girder bears a larger force than the t type girder for submerged conditions and small wave heights at elevated conditions the horizontal negative wave force is large on the back of the web of the girder this can be observed from fig 26 c owing to the wave blocking effect on the front empty part of the box girder a large wave force is generated on the surface of the flange bottom of deck and in front of the girder of the box girder which causes the vertical uplift force on the box girder deck to be larger than that on the t type girder deck see in fig 26 b with the increase in wave height the vertical uplift force on the box girder can reach almost three times that of the deck with t type girder at elevated conditions the lateral shape of the t type girders causes the wave to overtop the deck easily which can further induce larger vertical downward forces on the t type girder deck see in fig 26 b however there are some cases in which the wave forces decrease with increasing wave heights for the t type girder deck the negative horizontal wave forces decrease with increasing wave height this is possibly caused by the large energy loss due to the wave overtopping and the wave bridge interaction for the large wave heights therefore there are few waves acting on the back of the girder the same phenomenon is also observed in the study by hayatdavoodi et al 2014 there are some exceptions at small wave heights and elevated conditions where the vertical downward forces on the t type girder deck are smaller than those on the box girder deck this phenomenon may be caused by negative pressures on the bottom of the box girder which can be observed from the pressures at points 10 and 11 in fig 12 a and b thus there are some vertical downward forces on the deck with box girder for small wave heights however with the increase in wave height the vertical downward force on the t type girder deck is larger than that on the box girder deck as shown in fig 27 for the case of the t type girder deck the air remains in the space between the girders and undergoes some small rotational displacements however for the box girder deck with a box girder the velocity of flow is high around the flange of the deck this is caused by the wave acting on the web of the girder and the geometrical shape of the empty part the air has been pushed out from the empty part by waves it is speculated that the air squeezed out from the empty part may produce vertical forces on the top of the empty part therefore the effect of the geometrical shape of the empty part on the air wave forces on the box girder deck requires further investigation the pressure contours during the interaction of the wave with the superstructure for the two types of girders are shown in fig 28 from the figure the main difference in pressure between these two types of girders is the local pressure caused by the entrapped air the entrapped air between the t type girders causes the local pressure to increase there is no such phenomenon in the interaction of the wave with the box girder deck therefore it can be concluded that the wave force on this complex geometrical shape of superstructure should be further investigated to establish a valuable reference for the safety of coastal bridges under hurricane events 4 4 suggested method it can be expected that the formulae for predicting the wave forces on the t type girder deck cannot compute accurately the wave forces on the box girder deck therefore an improved prediction method is necessary to estimate the wave forces on the box girder deck for the worst situation c s 0 many empirical formulae have been established for the wave forces on the t type girder deck through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations douglass et al 2006 mcpherson 2008 aashto 2008 cuomo et al 2009 boon intra 2010 sheppard et al 2015 xu et al 2016b it is confirmed that the hydrostatic force and hydrodynamic force should be considered in the suggested method therefore an improved prediction method is proposed for the box girder deck by modifying the method by xu et al 2016b the equations are expressed as follows 15 f h f h y d r o s t a t i c f r o n t f d f d e c k 16 f v f h y d r o s t a t i c f l f d e c k b o t t o m f h c o n t r i b u t i

respectively and they are set as 1 0 in this study c w 0 6 is the web inclination coefficient ξ 1 3 is the surge factor and c b 1 5 is the blocking effect coefficient of the front empty part except for the case in which η max h girder where c b 1 3 c d is the horizontal damping coefficient which is related to the wave height water depth and blocking effect and it is set as 1 0 for h d 2 and 0 6

of the center of the girder point x in fig 29 u 2x is the maximum horizontal fluid velocity at the position of the center of the deck point 2x in fig 29 and u z is the vertical fluid velocity of the wave crest these three velocities are calculated using eqs 9 11 respectively the definitions of these parameters are shown in fig 29 it should be noted that the proposed empirical method is used to estimate the maximum wave forces on the box girder deck for the worst condition c s 0 because most of the maximum wave forces for c s 0 are larger than those for other submerged conditions additionally bridge designers also focus on the maximum wave forces on coastal bridge superstructures therefore the proposed empirical method can estimate the maximum horizontal and vertical forces for this purpose in order to examine the effectiveness and accuracy of the given method the proposed method is validated by comparing the predicted wave forces and the measurements see fig 30 as a result it can be concluded that this suggested method can be used by bridge engineers as a reference for predicting the maximum wave forces on the box girder deck 5 conclusions this study presents a hydrodynamic experiment on hurricane induced wave forces on a box girder deck of a coastal bridge a 1 30 scale model is used for the experiment in a wave flume under different wave conditions and various submerged and elevated conditions the measurements and computations in this study show the following 1 the impulse force cannot be neglected in the design of this type of coastal bridge superstructures the total force can reach even two times that of the quasi static force under elevated conditions in the horizontal direction 2 owing to the complex geometrical shape of the box girder deck the wave blocking effect caused by the front empty part has a significant influence on the wave force 3 horizontal and vertical forces increase with the increase in wave height except for the case of c s 0 the largest horizontal positive force and vertical uplift force occur when the submergence coefficient is 0 and the largest vertical downward force occurs when the submergence coefficient is1 4 the positive pressures on the bottom of the girder positive pressures on the bottom of the deck and vertical pressures on the web of the girder compose the vertical force the horizontal forces are mostly related to the pressures on the web of the girder 5 comparisons of the wave forces between the t type girder deck and the box girder deck under the same conditions show that the interactions of the wave with these two girders have significant differences an improved method for estimating the maximum wave forces on the box girder deck is proposed the limitations of the current study and future work are described as follows 1 in this study the elevated condition is considered only for the case of c s 0 and the effect of the wave period is ignored therefore additional cases should be considered to investigate the wave forces at various elevated conditions and the effect of the wave period on the wave forces should be determined 2 two dimensional numerical simulations are conducted in this study three dimensional numerical simulations will be considered to improve the computational performance and provide results that are more accurate 3 numerical simulations on different geometrical shapes of the empty part of this type of superstructure will be conducted to investigate their influence on the wave forces on the box girder deck 4 the suggested method can be further modified to adapt to other situations additionally the empirical coefficients proposed in this method should be modified further 5 the bridge deck wave interaction requires more research particularly for long span bridges that have relatively large structural vibration periods acknowledgments the first author is grateful for the support from the national natural

23655,hurricane induced wave forces on a box girder deck for a coastal bridge are investigated by experimental tests and numerical simulations a series of 70 experiments which include six types of wave heights three types of deck elevations and various water depths are conducted the results show that there are five types of submergence coefficients that cover the elevated and submerged conditions for each deck elevation following the experiments a two dimensional numerical model is utilized to investigate the wave forces on the box girder deck in which reynolds averaged navier stokes equations combined with k ω turbulence model are applied for wave simulations the volume of fluid method is used to trace the interface of air and water this numerical model shows a close agreement with the experimental data in most cases the laboratory experiment and numerical simulation are different compared to other wave in bridge studies in that the box girder superstructure is complex and unique this study can provide a beneficial tool for estimating hurricane induced extreme wave forces for this type of coastal bridge superstructure regular wave forces on a box girder deck are discussed in part i of these series of works while the irregular wave forces will be presented in part ii keywords regular wave experiments wave force coastal bridge superstructures hurricanes numerical models 1 introduction in the past decades hurricane induced storm surges and extreme waves caused devastating damages on coastal structures among these the 2005 hurricane katrina slamming the coasts of alabama mississippi and louisiana was one of the costliest natural disasters in u s history which caused extensive damages to infrastructures and coastal structures graumann et al 2005 fema 2006 the cost of rebuilding the coastal bridges damaged in hurricanes katrina and ivan was more than 1 billion nickas et al 2005 coastal bridges are vulnerable to damage under these natural disasters i e hurricanes and typhoons these extreme conditions often cause the water level to rise producing huge waves that hit directly on girders which are only installed at the piers by their own weight or connected by some weak joints the failure of coastal bridges connecting the roads from islands to the mainland in the western pacific region may cause traffic paralysis and delayed rescue activities further aggravating the disaster the failure mechanisms of coastal bridges under extreme waves still require further studies xu and cai 2014 rebuilding of the damaged bridges and retrofitting the existing coastal bridges require an accurate estimation of hurricane induced wave forces on coastal bridge superstructures therefore it is very important to improve our understanding of hurricane induced wave forces on these structures during the last decades several investigations on the effects of wave forces on coastal structures have been conducted kulin 1958 french 1979 mcpherson 2008 lau et al 2011 seiffert et al 2014a 2014b zhao et al 2014 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015 to simulate the solitary wave forces on coastal structures hayashi 2013 conducted small scale experiments to investigate the effect of tsunami wave forces on a box girder deck which is generally applied to expressway bridges he provided a detailed discussion on the tsunami wave forces on the box girder deck and converted the maximum horizontal wave force and vertical wave force measured in the experiment into values at actual bridge level and compared them with the dead load of the girder of the target bridge a brief comparison between the wave forces of the box girder and t type girder was conducted however the reason for the differences was not explained in detail hayashi 2013 focused on the tsunami wave forces which are different from the regular wave forces used in this study xu and cai 2015 used the dynamic mesh updating technique to investigate the lateral restraining stiffness effect on solitary wave induced forces on decks istrati et al 2016 conducted large scale experiments to study the tsunami induced wave forces on a bridge the effects of fluid structure interaction and air venting on wave forces were considered in their experiments xu et al 2016b conducted a comprehensive study on predicting solitary wave forces on a typical deck using a numerical method based on the numerical simulations they expanded the formula which was originally proposed by mcpherson 2008 to estimate accurately the solitary wave forces on a typical deck with girders the effect of entrapped air on solitary wave forces on a deck was presented by seiffert et al 2016 and they also found that there was a significant reduction in vertical uplift forces when air relief openings were added to the bridge model xu et al 2016d investigated the wave forces on a typical bridge deck based on a component level assessment and the countermeasure of air venting holes qu et al 2017 investigated the effect of the opening size of vents and other relevant factors including the submergence depth of the deck wave height water depth and number of girders on hydrodynamic loads through a two dimensional 2d numerical study sarfaraz and pak 2017 conducted a comprehensive study on tsunami induced loads on bridge superstructures using smoothed particle hydrodynamics furthermore simple non dimensional equations were proposed for estimating the tsunami induced forces and moments on the bridge superstructures in their study they were mostly focused on solitary wave forces these experiments mainly focused on coastal structures such as the plate and bridge deck with t type girders among these studies only hayashi 2013 investigated the wave effects on a box girder experiments and numerical simulations involving periodic wave forces on coastal bridges were also conducted by many researchers wang 1970 conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate the validity of his prediction rules for estimating the maximum uplift wave forces induced by various incident waves on a flat plate he indicated that the magnitude of impulse force is huge and engineers should pay close attention to it shih and anastasiou 1992 showed the important features associated with this type of loading for the first time by conducting a series of laboratory experiments that covered regular and irregular wave conditions they also used these experimental data to improve the formula that is used to estimate the uplift wave forces on the bottom of the decks in shallow and intermediate water depths takaki 2001 proposed the optimal inclination of a submerged plate under a breakwater based on the maker and cell method and laboratory experiments douglass et al 2004 reviewed existing methods to estimate wave forces on highway bridge superstructures and other coastal structures they found that existing methods were inadequate for estimating the wave forces on bridge decks a modified empirical equation for estimating the wave forces on bridge decks was proposed by douglass et al 2006 based on laboratory experiments aashto 2008 proposed parametric equations for calculating the wave forces on coastal bridges based on numerous experimental tests mcpherson 2008 proposed a new method to calculate the horizontal and vertical forces on typical u s bridges based on large scale wave basin experiments and existing theoretical methods bradner 2008 conducted 1 5 large scale experiments to investigate realistic wave forces on the i 10 bridge the roller and rail system were used in their experiments to simulate the dynamic response of the bridge structure sheppard and marin 2009 conducted a comprehensive study of the wave forces on the i 10 escambia bay bridge through wave tank tests and a theoretical wave force model with drag and inertia coefficients had been proposed for estimating the wave forces on coastal bridges cuomo et al 2009 conducted large scale experiments to investigate the dynamics of coastal bridges and the effect of openings in the bridge deck on wave forces the wave forces on eight 1 30 scale bridge models with various deck clearances were investigated by henry 2011 bradner et al 2011 conducted unique 1 5 scale experiments with consideration of the stiffness of the horizontal support system which can better examine the dynamic properties of a bridge system furthermore the relationship between the wave forces on the superstructure and the hydraulic parameters were also presented in their study rey and touboul 2011 conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the relevance of a linear theory that describe the efficiency of wave breaking and the forces and moments on a horizontal plate more recently sheppard et al 2015 proposed a wave and surge atlas which is presented in a geographic information system to compute surge wave loads on bridge superstructures seiffert et al 2015 conducted 1 35 scale laboratory experiments to measure nonlinear wave forces on a typical two lane coastal bridge under various conditions in their work different waves and several locations of decks covering fully submerged partially submerged and above still water level swl were selected the experimental data were compared with computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation results and those of the empirical equation proposed by douglass et al 2006 guo et al 2015 performed hydrodynamic experiments to investigate the wave forces on the superstructure of coastal highway bridges they found that the slamming component of the wave force is not noticeable in the horizontal direction and the total vertical force can be taken as twice the quasi static vertical force the horizontal and vertical forces on a horizontal plate in shallow water were studied through laboratory experiments by hayatdavoodi et al 2015b two water depths five wavelengths and six plate elevations were chosen in their experiment to investigate the wave forces on the plate under cnoidal waves a series of excellent works was conducted by hayatdavoodi 2013 hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2012 2014 2015 hayatdavoodi et al 2015a and xu and cai 2017 which greatly contributed to the understanding of extreme periodic wave induced forces on coastal bridges almost all of the above studies were focused on the horizontal plate or the typical bridge deck however none of them focused on the box girder deck so far which is widely used in the construction of long span coastal bridges this study presents a series of experiments involving periodic regular waves acting on a box girder deck under various wave characteristics and water depths and under submerged and elevated conditions the complex shape of the superstructure and simple wave form make these experiments useful for designing superstructures moreover it is beneficial to apply the results of this study for bridges in the western pacific region where box girders are used for the numerical simulations the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are utilized to describe the mean flow motion and the volume of fluid vof method is used to trace the free surface of water this approach was also adopted by xiao et al 2010 who proposed a wave loading model based on the rans equations which was used to simulate the wave forces on the biloxi bay bridge under hurricane katrina induced waves jin and meng 2011 used the software flow 3d to investigate the wave loads on bridge structures xu et al 2016a also used the rans equations with the shear stress transport k ω turbulence model to simulate the deck wave interaction similar works were also conducted by hayatdavoodi et al 2015b to simulate the wave propagation wave breaking and wave impact on coastal bridges the setup of the laboratory experiment is described in section 2 the results of regular waves are presented in section 3 in section 4 comparisons between the experimental data and numerical results are presented then the hurricane induced wave forces on the t type girder deck with similar size as the box girder deck are calculated by numerical simulations furthermore a method for estimating the maximum wave forces on a box girder deck is proposed we close this study by elaborating the conclusions drawn from the experimental data and comparisons 2 experimental set up 2 1 experimental facility experiments were conducted at tianjin port engineering institute ltd tianjin china the wave flume is 68 m in length 1 m in width and 1 6 m in height periodic waves are generated on the left side of the flume by a wave generator without reflection which was purchased from mitsui shipbuilding co ltd the wave generator can eliminate the influence of reflection of incident waves by using an active wave absorbing method the wave machine generates waves that combine the incident wave and eliminating wave which is used to eliminate the reflection wave the combined waves are generated according to real time signal of wave motions in the wave flume therefore the reflection of the incident wave can be eliminated using this method a wave absorber is placed at the right side of the wave flume to reduce the wave reflection and absorb the wave energy it is made of beach pebbles with a 1 5 slope a rigid steel frame is used to connect the bridge specimen to a 3 component dynamometer this configuration prevents the 3 component dynamometer from water splashes and also ensures that there is enough space between the water and the 3 component dynamometer the distance between the top of specimen and the 3 component dynamometer is 28 85 cm a plastic bag covering the dynamometer is also used to prevent water splashes on the sensors all of these materials are suspended on a steel support above the wave flume see fig 1 a and b 2 2 superstructure model and configuration the prototype model is patterned from a 4 lane long span coastal bridge which is under construction and located at the taiwan strait decks with box girders are widely used for long span coastal bridges in china the parameters of the model and corresponding prototype are given in table 1 the fabrication errors of the specimen are less than 1 0 mm the model of the coastal bridge is constructed from polymethyl methacrylate the inside of this model is empty and the outside is closed there are only two holes in the front and back of the model which are used to insert the sensors that measure the pressure on the surface of model the detailed arrangements of points and photo of the sensors are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively as shown in fig 2 a the cables of pressure sensors are close to the wall of the flume which is necessary to avoid the influence of incoming waves the hole size is small enough to allow only the cables to pass through and that there is no opening for water to get into the model all of points 1 16 are located in the centerline of the model in order to determine the sampling frequency the wave forces on the box girder deck were measured repetitively using different types of sampling frequencies from 100 to 300 hz of the dynamometer and pressure gauges however the results showed that there were the no significant changes on the data by using more than 100 hz sampling frequency although higher sampling frequencies are suggested for measuring the impulsive pressures and forces in many studies such frequencies were used for high elevation cases additionally seiffert et al 2014b also mentioned that the 100 hz sampling rate is deemed sufficient for experiments to capture the impulsive pressures and forces therefore the 100 hz sampling frequency was used here because the width of the wave flume is 1 m and the length of the deck is 0 98 m the problem is treated two dimensionally and the forces were computed per unit of deck length however the structure length was found to affect only the 2d accuracy for extremely narrow spans sheppard and marin 2009 in addition many 2d experiments and numerical simulations were conducted in many studies sheppard and marin 2009 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 xu et al 2016c xu and cai 2017 the wave height is measured using capacitance type wave gauges with a sampling rate of 50 hz and a precision of 0 1 mm the wave height without the model is measured at the center of the model location it is used to investigate the wave parameters at this position when the incident wave propagates in the flume the wave heights measured by the capacitance type wave gauges are used to compare with the theoretical solutions of the wave theory which can further ensure the accuracy of the wave maker it is found that both the cnoidal wave theory and the stokes wave theory can be used in generating the waves because the water depth in the experiments are either shallow or transitional zhu 1983 proposed a range of several wave theories based on measured data and analysis of these data it is suggested to use t g d 10 for stokes fifth order wave theory and t g d 10 for the cnoidal wave theory this parameter in the current study is 7 7 t g d 12 5 therefore the cnoidal wave theory is chosen in the current study the first order cnoidal wave theory is used as the theory for the wave maker the paddle motion of the piston type wave maker is controlled by an experimental software the paddle displacement and the initial stroke position are generated following the method proposed by goring 1979 the formula for the wave maker motion with time ξ is as follows 1 ξ t h k d n 1 n a n n sin 2 n π t t ξ l 2 a n e k m 2 m 2 n 0 2 π 2 m 2 k 2 n q n 1 q 2 n n 1 where h is the wave height d is the water depth t is the wave period t is the time l is the wave length and k and e are the first and second complete elliptic integral with m as parameter respectively m 2 m 2 1 q exp πk m k m k 2π l and n is the expansion term of the fourier series 2 3 test procedure and data acquisition the hurricane induced wave characteristics were selected from the measured data of previous studies and the construction sites of the coastal bridges seventy cases shown in fig 3 a were tested during the experiments which include 11 types of water depths and 3 types of deck elevations equal to 0 263 m 0 398 m and 0 533 m all the deck elevations in this study refer to the distance between the bottom of the wave flume to the bottom of the box girder the different water depths ensure that there are 5 types of submergence coefficients c s 0 0 5 1 1 5 2 of deck for each elevation the specification of the submergence coefficient is shown in fig 3 a a submergence coefficient c s 0 means that the bottom of the girder is equal to the swl and c s 1 means that the top of deck is equal to the swl the elevated conditions were considered only for the case of c s 0 in the current study we performed a series of tests before conducting the experiments it was found that the vertical wave forces on the deck with box girder for other elevated conditions are no larger than those for c s 0 additionally the wave forces on the box girder deck for c s 2 were smaller than those for c s 2 therefore we chose a submergence coefficient from 0 to 2 in the experiment the significant component of the impulse horizontal forces for elevated conditions will be further investigated in the future various wave heights from 0 0667 m to 0 2333 m with an interval of 0 0333 m were tested in the experiments for each submergence coefficient a wide range of water depths was selected from 0 263 m to 0 713 m each of the experimental cases was conducted three times to reduce the repeatable errors the maximum wave forces presented in this study were obtained from the averaged of the maximum value during one wave period in order to verify the accuracy and repeatability of the experimental data the comparison of wave forces between the measurements by the 3 component dynamometer and the integral of pressures is presented in table 2 which shows a close agreement between the two results the differences may be due to the pressure gauges which were not covered throughout the model the elevation of the deck model was 0 263 m in these cases and the wave period was 2 04 s in order to determine the influence of the suspension system on the measurements of wave forces a set of experiments was conducted for each condition three times with the suspension system alone the results of these three experiments were used to reduce the experimental errors as much as possible the measured wave forces were subtracted from the total wave forces when both the deck model and suspension system were present there were some differences in the flow characteristics between these two scenarios owing to the interaction of the wave and bridge deck when the deck was present however the differences were neglected in this study and the force acting on the suspension system alone was subtracted from the total force acting on the bridge deck and suspension system the actual wave height of the incident wave without the model was also measured at the center of the model location using the capacitance type wave gauge the bottom friction has some influence on the wave propagation resulting in some reduction of wave height during the wave propagation before conducting the experiments a set of experiments was conducted without the model to ensure that the wave characteristics obtained from the wave gauge are the specified values as mentioned above then the test settings were used to generate waves in this study four types of wave forces are considered namely the maximum vertical force uplift force minimum vertical force downward force maximum horizontal force as the positive force and finally the minimum horizontal force as the negative force shown in fig 5 i and j the vertical f v and horizontal f h forces are presented in normalized forms by dividing them by the length of the deck l 0 98 m it is important that all of these forces are measured by the dynamometer and the pressure sensors do not include the buoyancy force because there is a rigid steel frame between the deck and the dynamometer the effect of the rigid steel frame on the measurements of the buoyancy forces need to be eliminated therefore all of the measurements have been set as zero when the installation of the model was completed to eliminate such effect furthermore the buoyancy forces can be easily estimated based on the volume of the specimen if required 3 experimental results and discussion to determine the repeatable errors of generating regular waves a series of experiments is conducted for each case without the bridge model during one period a wave gauge located at the center of the model is used to measure the wave heights the values are compared with theoretical solutions it is necessary to ensure that waves generated by the wave maker have only small differences the comparisons between the measured values and theoretical solutions of the cnoidal wave theory are shown in fig 4 here the wave period is 2 04 s the measurements of surface elevations agree closely with those calculated using the equations of cnoidal wave theory the repeatable errors are within 4 deviation fig 5 shows the time series of the wave forces on the deck with a box girder under the condition of a wave period of 2 04 s wave height of 0 0167 m and deck elevation of 0 398 m for various submergence coefficients in all of the cases in this study the total duration of the wave acting on the specimen is 64 s the wave forces are separated into two parts a quasi static force and a high frequency impulse force as shown in fig 5 the low pass 8th order butterworth filter is used to filter out the higher frequency components of the force the initial impulse force signal is then determined by subtracting the filtered quasi static force from the total force additionally the signal of the structural vibrations is collected with the wave acting on the specimen after analyzing the digital vibration signal the frequency of the structure is approximately 12 40 hz the high frequency oscillations are mainly attributed to the natural frequency of the specimen with the rigid steel frame and the frequencies of 12 20 hz are attributed to the frequency of the specimen with the rigid steel frame owing to the joints between the 3 component dynamometer and the specimen with the rigid steel frame therefore a low pass digital filter with a cutoff frequency of 12 hz is used to separate the component of the structural vibrations from the impulse forces and obtain the final impulse force the wave forces on the box girder deck are compared with each other under different submergence coefficients it should be noted that the change in submergence coefficient is caused by the change in water depth the elevation of the deck is constant which is in accordance with the actual situation when the water level rises with time during hurricane events with increasing submergence coefficients the maximum horizontal force decreases as shown in fig 5 in the elevated and partially submerged conditions the impulse force has a substantial contribution to the total wave force when the submergence coefficient is 0 the bottom of the box girder is equal to the swl and the total horizontal force can be two times the quasi static force with the increase in duration of the wave action the latter maximum wave force at approximately t 16 s is larger than the former one at approximately t 13 5 s this phenomenon has never been observed in previous studies focusing on wave forces on typical t type decks combining the results of the time series and the snapshots of the experiments figs 7 and 8 it can be observed that the phenomenon is caused by the specific shape of box girder the front empty part shown in fig 2 b under the deck and in front of the box girder restricts the propagation of the wave upward and forward shown in fig 7 c then the latter wave interacts with the reflected wave from the box wave breaking occurs on the surface of the model during the interaction between the wave and bridge model the complex interaction between the wave and the deck also causes a huge magnitude of impulse force fig 7 shows snapshots of the interaction of the wave and specimen for the cases of fig 5 a and b and it also provides the corresponding snapshots when the peak values points a b and c in fig 5 a and b occur during the interaction of the wave and specimen it can be observed that a lot of wave breaking occurs when the wave is acting on the bottom of the deck this is mainly caused by the blocking effect of the front empty part the peak value for point a and b occurs when the wave is acting on the web of the girder and the bottom of the deck respectively the negative horizontal force in this case is extremely small because only small amount of water is on the back of the box girder when c s 0 5 the box girder is partially submerged in the water but the deck is still over the swl because the front empty part of the model is partially submerged in the water the impact is considerable there are two peak values of wave forces appearing in this case due to the existence of the front empty part which causes the wave to hit the deck and box girder in sequence when c s 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 the negative horizontal forces are larger than those of the above cases because the model is completely submerged in water and the wave forces on the back of the box girder become larger the positive maximum horizontal wave force is almost constant in order to obtain a deep understanding of the wave action in these cases a fourier analysis of the time series of horizontal force is conducted the fourier spectra of wave force with two different c s values under the same wave conditions are depicted in fig 6 it should be noted that the wave forces used in fig 6 are the untreated total wave forces which contain structural vibrations it can be observed that the spectrum can be divided into three parts in the case of c s 0 shown in fig 6 a namely the quasi static force impulse force and structural vibration from the quasi static forces obtained above it can be concluded that the frequency of the quasi static force is in the range of 0 2 hz the dominant frequency is 0 5 hz which is equal to the frequency of the incoming wave other high frequencies in this range are mainly due to the nonlinear waves and the higher order velocity potentials which are caused by incident and diffracted waves the same conclusions were also presented in the study by guo et al 2015 additionally the frequencies of the impulse forces can be obtained using the fourier analysis the main frequencies of the impulse forces on the deck with box girder are in the range of 2 6 hz which is different from the range of 5 10 hz proposed by guo et al 2015 the difference is possibly caused by the geometrical shape of the girder and the different experimental scales between these two deck models the box girder deck has a complex shape of the empty part which causes the wave energy to shift from a low frequency to a high frequency fig 6 b also shows that the influence of nonlinear waves and the higher order velocity potentials on wave forces still exist within the range of frequencies of 0 5 2 hz there is also a high frequency component even under a deeply submerged condition of the deck i e fig 6 c however for the vertical forces with c s 2 the high frequency component rarely exists fig 6 d this part of high frequency oscillations is related to the structural vibrations of the model and the suspension system after finishing a series of fourier analyses of these high frequency signals the vibration frequency of the structure is in the range of 12 40 hz therefore all of these structural noises are filtered out from the data that is analyzed subsequently both for the dynamometer and pressure sensors the vertical impulse force is found in the condition of c s 0 and 0 5 the wave partly acts on the deck with a wave height of 0 167 m a small part of the wave overtops the top of the deck and then induces a small downward force for c s 0 and 0 5 fig 5 b and d with the increase in submergence depth the downward force increases and reaches the maximum value for c s 1 and 1 5 fig 5 f and h when the submergence coefficient is equal to 2 the larger submergence depth results in a smaller downward force because a large water depth decreases the influence of wave blocking effects owing to the wave blocking effect a large amount of water will overtop the deck even for a small submergence depth which causes the maximum vertical force to decrease with an increase in wave height this conclusion can be verified in fig 5 b the same phenomenon is also observed in the snapshots of the experiment fig 8 shows the snapshots of the wave overtopping at approximately 13 5 s and 16 s in the case of fig 5 b it can be observed from the snapshots of wave overtopping that the blocking effect of the front empty part causes a larger wave run up for the second wave the water volume of wave overtopping in the second wave is larger than that in the first wave fig 5 b also shows that the maximum vertical force becomes smaller during the wave action the front empty part of the model prevents the wave to move up and forward it could lead to an interaction with the incoming waves and the reflected waves which causes a larger wave run up and results in reduction of vertical forces fig 6 also shows the fourier spectrum of the vertical wave force with c s 0 and 2 from this figure it could also be noted that the vertical force f v with higher frequency is weaker than the horizontal force f h it can be concluded from figs 5 and 6 that the empty part of the bridge model significantly affects the wave force on the box girder deck guo et al 2015 found that the impulse component of the wave force is not noticeable in the horizontal direction and the total vertical force can be taken as twice the quasi static vertical force for the deck with t type girders however in the current study of the wave forces on the deck with box girder the impulse component of the wave force is not noticeable in the vertical direction and the total horizontal force can be taken as twice the quasi static horizontal force this significant difference is mostly caused by the different geometrical shapes between these two girders the experimental data of the vertical uplift maximum force f v vertical downward maximum force f v horizontal positive maximum force f h and horizontal negative maximum force f h with various submergence coefficients are shown in figs 9 11 these four types of wave forces are the total forces on the specimen the wave force increases with the increment of wave height in fig 9 for the deck elevation of 0 263 m the wave blocking effect of the front empty part and the impulse component of wave forces lead to a larger vertical uplift force and positive horizontal force for higher wave heights at c s 0 the influence of the front empty part is small at c s 0 5 compared with that at c s 0 because the empty part is partially submerged in the water at c s 0 5 the blocking effect of the front empty part has a negative effect on the vertical uplift forces therefore the vertical uplift force is smallest when c s 1 because the large wave overtops the top of the deck and reduces the uplift force this phenomenon can also be verified in fig 9 b where the vertical downward force is largest for c s 1 compared with other conditions with a submergence coefficient larger than 0 5 the blocking effect has little influence on the impulse component of wave forces due to the large submergence depth of the superstructure which can be clearly observed from the time series of wave forces shown in fig 5 fig 9 b also shows that when the submergence coefficient is 2 the larger submerged depth causes a smaller downward force the wave is overtopping the top of the deck with c s 0 which led to small vertical downward forces with wave height of 6 67 cm and 10 cm with the small wave height the horizontal positive force is almost constant under various submerged conditions however with the increase in wave height the empty part and the impact action of the wave become the key factors to determine the magnitude of the horizontal positive forces the small horizontal positive force with a wave height of 6 67 cm and submergence coefficient of 0 is caused by the small wave that interacts with the web of the girder furthermore it induced a small horizontal positive force because small wave energy is transmitted the horizontal positive force for c s 0 5 has a small value because the model is partially submerged in the water in fact when the deck is near the swl the empty part of the deck breaks the incoming wave and results in energy loss thus only a small proportion of wave energy is transmitted it can be observed that a higher wave height at c s 0 can induce a larger horizontal negative force the cause of this phenomenon will be discussed in the following based on the analysis of pressures figs 10 and 11 show that the wave forces for these two deck elevations are different from each other the vertical uplift force first increases and then decreases with the increment of wave height in figs 10 a and 11 a for c s 0 however for other submerged cases the vertical uplift force increases with increasing wave height owing to the wave blocking effect the wave run up occurs easily with a large wave height for c s 0 the peak value of the maximum vertical forces for the deck elevation of 0 398 m appears at a wave height of 0 1667 m but the peak value of maximum vertical forces for the deck elevation of 0 533 m is appeared at wave height of 0 2 m this is possibly caused by the different relatively superstructure width to wavelength ratios owing to the different water depths used in these two cases as shown in figs 10 c and 11 c the horizontal positive force for the highest wave height under c s 0 is not so large as expected because with large wave heights the interaction between the incoming wave and the empty part of the deck the wave blocking effect of the empty part will lead to wave breaking and energy loss by increasing the wave height from 16 67 cm to 20 cm for c s 0 the positive horizontal force decreases because when the wave amplitude is larger than the height of the deck 9 cm the wave acts on the edge of the deck first then on the web of the girder furthermore the acting times on the deck and the girder are not the same and the process of wave acting on the edge of the deck causes the wave to separate and further induce energy loss the wave forces shown in figs 10 c and 11 c are smaller than those in fig 9 c under the same wave height for c s 0 a possible reason for this behavior is that the component of impulse force decreases with the increase in water depth the horizontal negative forces with the deck elevation of 0 533 m have significant differences from those of 0 398 m and 0 263 m the cause of this phenomenon will be discussed in the following based on the analysis of pressures in order to better understand the hydrodynamic phenomena and the wave forces on the box girder deck the pressures at 16 points were measured in the experiment fig 2 as discussed previously several configurations were selected for a detailed pressure p distribution during a certain time series in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 a the pressures at points 5 6 and 7 are very small because the positive pressures at these points are caused by the splashing of water the small negative pressures at these three points are caused by the effects of surface tension of the splashing of water the pressures at points 1 4 are not illustrated in the figure because their values are relatively small the horizontal positive force is contributed by the pressures at points 8 and 9 because the wave with a wave height of 6 67 cm can only act on the web of the girder the negative pressures at points 8 and 9 are caused by the water movement from the surface of the web of girder the pressures at points 10 and 11 are the main components of the vertical force which include the uplift and downward forces the wave acting on the bottom of the deck and the girder provides the large uplift pressure there is a large downward force generated by the overtopping of water the pressures at points12 16 are very small because there is almost no wave acting on these parts in fig 12 b the maximum pressure at point 5 occurs at the relative time of 3 13 which is later than the time of maximum pressures at points 6 10 hence the positive pressure is caused by the wave overtopping the top of the deck compared with point 6 point 7 at the bottom of the deck bears a larger pressure the larger pressure at point 7 results in the larger vertical uplift force compared with the other cases shown in fig 9 a the pressures at points 8 and 9 at the web of the girder compose the main part of the horizontal positive force the pressures at these two points also have some contributions to the vertical uplift force owing to the angle of the web the pressures at points 10 11 and 12 at the bottom of the girder compose the main part of the vertical uplift force the largest horizontal negative force in fig 9 d with a wave height of 13 33 cm at c s 0 is caused by the positive pressure at point 13 at the back of the web of the girder hence the significant great change in the horizontal negative force for three different wave heights with c s 0 is due to the interaction of the large wave height and the back empty part compared with fig 12 a the pressures in fig 12 b change significantly over time to explain the phenomenon that the horizontal negative force at the deck elevation of 0 533 m significantly differs from that at elevation 0 398 m pressures for the corresponding configurations are shown in fig 12 c d e and f compared with the pressures shown in fig 12 e for the deck elevation of 0 533 m the pressures in fig 12 c with the deck elevation of 0 398 m vary notably in time the maximum pressures are smaller with higher model elevations compare fig 12 c with fig 12 e the phase difference between the positive pressure points 8 and 9 and negative pressure points 13 and 14 for the deck elevation of 0 533 m in fig 12 f is higher than that for the deck elevation of 0 398 m in fig 12 d the higher phase difference results in a larger horizontal negative force the larger horizontal negative force for c s 1 and smaller horizontal negative force for c s 0 with the deck elevation of 0 533 m lead to the phenomenon mentioned above several conclusions can be obtained based on the pressures in fig 12 larger values of wave height and the wave blocking effect in the front empty part with c s 0 and 1 easily cause a large amount of water to overtop the top of deck which can be proved by the large positive pressures at points 1 5 in fig 12 e and f the negative pressures at the bottom of the girder points 10 11 and 12 and positive pressures points 1 5 which are generated from the wave overtopping the deck compose the vertical downward force the positive pressures at the bottom of the girder positive pressures on the bottom of the deck and part of the positive pressures on the web of the girder compose the vertical uplift force the horizontal forces are mostly composed of the pressures on the web of the girder the bottom of the deck including point 7 bears a larger wave force than the other parts of the deck which should be considered in the design of structural elements of bridge superstructures 4 numerical simulation in this study the hurricane induced wave forces on the box girder deck for various submerged conditions and wave conditions are simulated with a 2d numerical model the computations are performed using the open source cfd platform openfoam here the fluid can be considered as an incompressible viscous material the rans equations with the k ω turbulence model are utilized to describe the mean flow motion the vof method is used to trace the interface of air and water wave generation is achieved using waves2foam which is a wave generation toolbox in openfoam two dimensional numerical simulations of the wave forces on coastal bridge superstructures had been conducted a study by istrati et al 2016 discussed the role of air entrapment in the case of an i girder bridge and suggested that three dimensional 3d effects can be significant when the bridge is impacted by solitary waves however very few 3d models have been developed owing to the high computational cost additionally 2d numerical simulations can provide reasonably accurate results and save extensive computational cost bozorgnia and lee 2012 in this section the governing equations and boundary conditions of the 2d model is presented then the validation of grid convergence is also discussed the section will be closed by presenting the computation results as well as the suggested method for estimating the maximum wave forces on box girder decks 4 1 governing equations and boundary conditions in wave structure interaction problems water and air are considered in the computational domain in this study the rans equations are utilized to describe the mean flow motion which are based on the decomposition of navier stokes equations the standard k ω turbulence model is used to relate the reynolds stresses to the mean flow variables and close the equations with regard to the incompressible flows the continuity and momentum conservation equations should be written as

while p w and p k are the production terms a detailed description of these parameters is provided in the studies by mayer and madsen 2000 and wilcox 2006 2008 in order to trace the interface of air

the numerical setup with boundary conditions and the location of the sponge layer are shown in fig 13 the periodic cnoidal wave is generated in the inlet boundary on the left side of the flume based on the korteweg de vries kdv equations by svendsen and jonsson 1976 the free surface level and velocities for two coordinates x and z are prescribed in eqs 9 11 the pressure is calculated using a special boundary condition available in openfoam which is similar to neumann boundary conditions the free surface and velocity components of the cnoidal wave theory are given by 9 η 16 d 3 3 l 2 k k e

wave flume and the wave trough cn is the jacobi elliptic cosine function sn is the jacobi elliptic sine function and dn is the jacobi elliptic delta function a detailed discussion on the cnoidal wave theory is provided in the studies by keulegan and patterson 1940 svendsen and jonsson 1976 and svendsen 2006 in order to avoid waves reflected internally in the computational domain to interfere with the wave maker boundary a relaxation zone with a length of 2 m is provided in the inlet boundary after testing the length of the relaxation zone it was found that a length of 2 m is sufficient for keeping a continuous surface elevation and avoiding divergent solutions during simulations an outlet boundary is utilized at the right side of the computational domain in order to prevent significant reflection of the wave going out of the outlet boundary a relaxation zone with a length of 5 m is added to the outlet boundary the relaxation function is given as 12 α r χ r 1 exp χ r 3 5 1 exp 1 1 for χ r 0 1 and is applied inside the relaxation zone in the following way 13 ϕ α r ϕ c o m p u t e d 1 α r ϕ t arg e t where ϕ is either u or α the variation of α r is the same as that given by fuhrman et al 2006 the definition of χ r is such that α r is always 1 at the interface between the non relaxed part of the computational domain and the relaxation zone however the relaxation zone for the outlet boundary does not work perfectly there will be a little reflection into the domain therefore the length of the computation domain is chosen as 70 m the computational domain includes 68 meter long domain for wave structure interaction and the 2 meter long relaxation zones for the inlet boundary the 68 m length of the domain is equal to that of the experimental wave flume the domain for the wave structure interaction can ensure that the time series of wave forces on the deck model are no less than 5 wave periods as soon as the reflected wave contaminates the results at the bottom of the computational domain the slip boundary conditions are utilized the swl separates the regions of the air phase and water phase at the initial condition an empty condition is used on the frontback boundary the boundary condition in the top of the numerical wave flume is the atmospheric boundary condition the atmospheric boundary condition in openfoam allows the water and air to follow out but only air is allowed to flow into the computational domain the pressure velocity coupling is solved using the improved algorithm called pimple which is a combination of the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators and simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithms it allows an equation under relaxation to ensure the convergence of all the equations at each time step additionally the first order euler implicit scheme is for time integration a detailed description of the discretization schemes in both space and time can be found in the study by jasak 1996 4 2 grid convergence in order to check the sensitivity and accuracy of the adopted mesh system in simulating the wave force on the box girder deck a set of mesh sizes is established by refining the mesh system until no significant changes in the simulation results are observed several types of structured mesh sizes are selected to attain grid convergence fig 14 illustrates the wave induced vertical uplift on the deck with box girder by using different mesh sizes expressed by the total mesh number n for d 0 398 m h 0 1 m t 2 04 s and c s 0 as shown in fig 14 the mesh size adopted in this study is feasible enough to satisfy the computation accuracy we set constant spatial distances of δx 0 005 m 0 003 m and 0 02 m for the near inlet zone main computational zone and far field from the main computational zone respectively moreover δz 0 01 m 0 0015 m and 0 003 m for the air zone near water zone and deep water zone respectively are used in all cases a very fine mesh is used near the wall boundaries for the analysis of the boundary layer and the mesh refinement close to the surface the y value non dimensional wall distance is used as a reference parameter in the current study the y value is kept smaller than 50 to ensure a satisfactory boundary layer modeling according to the logarithmic law for the wall additionally it can ensure that the pressure field and velocity field around the near wall regions are reliable in the computation domain the length of the numerical wave flume is kept constant at 70 m the height of the flume changes with different water depths and elevations it is also necessary to keep the water particles away from the top of the wave flume a computer with a single intel xeon e5 2670 processor 2 6 ghz 20 m cache cpu and 32 g internal storage is used for the numerical study moreover the average computational runtime of each case is approximately 628 600 s a time step with δt 0 001 s is used for all the numerical simulations in this study the courant number limitation is satisfied even in the worst condition of simulation cases with this time step the courant number is given as 14 c o δ t u δ x where δt is the time step and u is the absolute value of the velocity to ensure numerical stability and temporal accuracy the courant number should be less than 1 for the fixed value of spatial distance the maximum value of the absolute velocity is required the maximum value of the velocity occurs at the maximum water depth 0 713 m and maximum wave height 0 233 m then the maximum value of the velocity is calculated based on the eqs 9 11 therefore the time step is chosen as 0 001 s and the maximum value of the courant number c omax 0 5 is kept constant throughout the numerical simulations 4 3 results and comparisons numerical modeling for all experimental cases are conducted to compare with the experimental data however only cases of three submergence coefficients c s 0 1 and 2 and some selected wave heights are presented in this study the deck model in the numerical flume has the same size as the physical model the comparisons of four types of wave forces between the numerical results and the measurements are shown in figs 15 17 all vertical forces do not include the buoyancy force to have a reasonable comparison with the experimental data a close agreement is observed between the numerical results and measurements in all of the cases the agreement is very close for the submerged conditions and small wave heights and some differences occur for the elevated conditions owing to the wave breaking on the surface of the bridge model with the increase in water depth the differences between the numerical results and measurements become smaller the maximum horizontal and vertical forces with small wave heights for c s 0 show a very close agreement the difference in wave forces between the numerical results and measurements has a similar trend for large wave heights the vertical downward force for c s 1 differs for small water depths possibly because of the difference in the impulse force on the top of the deck in general the numerical model presented in the current study can be successfully used to calculate the wave forces on box girder decks the space under the deck and in front of the box girder has a significant influence in predicting the wave force the comparisons between the numerical and experimental time histories of wave forces are shown in figs 18 20 the numerical model shows a high level of accuracy in calculating the wave forces on the box girder deck the time series of wave forces in figs 18 20 cover elevated and submerged conditions and also show that the numerical model can effectively simulate the interaction of the wave and box girder deck using the numerical model a set of simulations is conducted to study the effect of the girder geometry on the wave forces on superstructures in the past decades many researchers focused on the wave forces on coastal bridges with the typical t type girders very few researchers have investigated the wave forces on box girder decks because of the noticeable difference in geometrical shape between these two girders their wave forces may have significant differences in this study the wave forces on the t type girder and box girder are calculated under the same conditions to investigate their differences the configurations of the deck with t type girders fig 21 is designed based on the size of the box girder deck to ensure that the top and lateral lengths of these two models have the same sizes three types of submergence coefficients several values of wave heights and three deck elevations are considered in this study the effects of wave air interaction on box girders are easier to determine than those for t type girders because the wave air interaction can be extremely nonlinear and have a significant effect on the induced wave forces for the case of t type girders therefore a comparison of the maximum wave forces on the t type girders between the measurements conducted by seiffert et al 2015 and the numerical results simulated using the openfoam code is conducted in the current study fig 22 the comparison is useful for validating the accuracy of the openfoam code nine cases with the same parameters for the specimen and the same size of wave flume are simulated a mesh configuration of δx 0 001 m and δz 0 001 m is used in the numerical simulations presented here fig 22 shows that the openfoam code has a high level of accuracy in simulating the wave air interaction and wave structure interaction figs 23 25 show the comparisons of the computed wave forces on the box girder and the t type girder deck all of these three figures illustrate that the wave forces on these two girders have great differences particularly for the elevated conditions in order to provide a direct insight into the differences caused by the different geometries snapshots of the wave bridge interaction distribution of the flow vector and pressure contours of these two types of girders are shown in figs 26 28 respectively these figures are useful to understand the differences caused by the different geometrical shape of the superstructures for the case of d 0 533 m h 0 1667 m t 2 04 s and c s 0 fig 26 shows the snapshots of the wave and superstructure interaction for the two types of girders where the red color represents the air and the blue one represents the water the horizontal positive forces on the t type girder deck are larger than that on the box girder deck the difference increases with the increase in wave height the vertical shape of the t type girder intensifies the horizontal positive wave force because the wave directly acts on the lateral side of the model however the box girder deck has an empty part before the girder which causes the wave force on the lateral side to be not so large than expected see fig 26 a the angle of the web also divides the wave force into horizontal and vertical parts but for the horizontal negative force the box girder bears a larger force than the t type girder for submerged conditions and small wave heights at elevated conditions the horizontal negative wave force is large on the back of the web of the girder this can be observed from fig 26 c owing to the wave blocking effect on the front empty part of the box girder a large wave force is generated on the surface of the flange bottom of deck and in front of the girder of the box girder which causes the vertical uplift force on the box girder deck to be larger than that on the t type girder deck see in fig 26 b with the increase in wave height the vertical uplift force on the box girder can reach almost three times that of the deck with t type girder at elevated conditions the lateral shape of the t type girders causes the wave to overtop the deck easily which can further induce larger vertical downward forces on the t type girder deck see in fig 26 b however there are some cases in which the wave forces decrease with increasing wave heights for the t type girder deck the negative horizontal wave forces decrease with increasing wave height this is possibly caused by the large energy loss due to the wave overtopping and the wave bridge interaction for the large wave heights therefore there are few waves acting on the back of the girder the same phenomenon is also observed in the study by hayatdavoodi et al 2014 there are some exceptions at small wave heights and elevated conditions where the vertical downward forces on the t type girder deck are smaller than those on the box girder deck this phenomenon may be caused by negative pressures on the bottom of the box girder which can be observed from the pressures at points 10 and 11 in fig 12 a and b thus there are some vertical downward forces on the deck with box girder for small wave heights however with the increase in wave height the vertical downward force on the t type girder deck is larger than that on the box girder deck as shown in fig 27 for the case of the t type girder deck the air remains in the space between the girders and undergoes some small rotational displacements however for the box girder deck with a box girder the velocity of flow is high around the flange of the deck this is caused by the wave acting on the web of the girder and the geometrical shape of the empty part the air has been pushed out from the empty part by waves it is speculated that the air squeezed out from the empty part may produce vertical forces on the top of the empty part therefore the effect of the geometrical shape of the empty part on the air wave forces on the box girder deck requires further investigation the pressure contours during the interaction of the wave with the superstructure for the two types of girders are shown in fig 28 from the figure the main difference in pressure between these two types of girders is the local pressure caused by the entrapped air the entrapped air between the t type girders causes the local pressure to increase there is no such phenomenon in the interaction of the wave with the box girder deck therefore it can be concluded that the wave force on this complex geometrical shape of superstructure should be further investigated to establish a valuable reference for the safety of coastal bridges under hurricane events 4 4 suggested method it can be expected that the formulae for predicting the wave forces on the t type girder deck cannot compute accurately the wave forces on the box girder deck therefore an improved prediction method is necessary to estimate the wave forces on the box girder deck for the worst situation c s 0 many empirical formulae have been established for the wave forces on the t type girder deck through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations douglass et al 2006 mcpherson 2008 aashto 2008 cuomo et al 2009 boon intra 2010 sheppard et al 2015 xu et al 2016b it is confirmed that the hydrostatic force and hydrodynamic force should be considered in the suggested method therefore an improved prediction method is proposed for the box girder deck by modifying the method by xu et al 2016b the equations are expressed as follows 15 f h f h y d r o s t a t i c f r o n t f d f d e c k 16 f v f h y d r o s t a t i c f l f d e c k b o t t o m f h c o n t r i b u t i

force f l hydrodynamic force on the bottom of the deck f deckbottom and vertical force due to the contribution of the horizontal force f hcontribution c d and c l are the drag and lift coefficients respectively and they are set as 1 0 in this study c w 0 6 is the web inclination coefficient ξ 1 3 is the surge factor and c b 1 5 is the blocking effect coefficient of the front empty part except for the case in which η max h girder where c b 1 3 c d is the horizontal damping coefficient which is related to the wave height water depth and blocking effect and it is set as 1 0 for h d 2 and 0 6 for h d 2 when the water depths are 0 263 m and 0 398 m c d 0 38 for η max d 6 when the water depth is 0 533 m c dv is the vertical damping coefficient which is related to the wave breaking and blocking effect and it is set as 1 0 for h d 2 and 0 8 for h d 2 when the water depth is 0 398 m and 0 7 for h d 2 when the water depth is 0 533 m η max is the distance from the swl to the wave crest

deck w deckbottom 0 1 m is the width of the bottom of the deck l bridge is the length of the bridge acted upon by the lateral wave forces u x is the maximum horizontal fluid velocity at the position of the center of the girder point x in fig 29 u 2x is the maximum horizontal fluid velocity at the position of the center of the deck point 2x in fig 29 and u z is the vertical fluid velocity of the wave crest these three velocities are calculated using eqs 9 11 respectively the definitions of these parameters are shown in fig 29 it should be noted that the proposed empirical method is used to estimate the maximum wave forces on the box girder deck for the worst condition c s 0 because most of the maximum wave forces for c s 0 are larger than those for other submerged conditions additionally bridge designers also focus on the maximum wave forces on coastal bridge superstructures therefore the proposed empirical method can estimate the maximum horizontal and vertical forces for this purpose in order to examine the effectiveness and accuracy of the given method the proposed method is validated by comparing the predicted wave forces and the measurements see fig 30 as a result it can be concluded that this suggested method can be used by bridge engineers as a reference for predicting the maximum wave forces on the box girder deck 5 conclusions this study presents a hydrodynamic experiment on hurricane induced wave forces on a box girder deck of a coastal bridge a 1 30 scale model is used for the experiment in a wave flume under different wave conditions and various submerged and elevated conditions the measurements and computations in this study show the following 1 the impulse force cannot be neglected in the design of this type of coastal bridge superstructures the total force can reach even two times that of the quasi static force under elevated conditions in the horizontal direction 2 owing to the complex geometrical shape of the box girder deck the wave blocking effect caused by the front empty part has a significant influence on the wave force 3 horizontal and vertical forces increase with the increase in wave height except for the case of c s 0 the largest horizontal positive force and vertical uplift force occur when the submergence coefficient is 0 and the largest vertical downward force occurs when the submergence coefficient is1 4 the positive pressures on the bottom of the girder positive pressures on the bottom of the deck and vertical pressures on the web of the girder compose the vertical force the horizontal forces are mostly related to the pressures on the web of the girder 5 comparisons of the wave forces between the t type girder deck and the box girder deck under the same conditions show that the interactions of the wave with these two girders have significant differences an improved method for estimating the maximum wave forces on the box girder deck is proposed the limitations of the current study and future work are described as follows 1 in this study the elevated condition is considered only for the case of c s 0 and the effect of the wave period is ignored therefore additional cases should be considered to investigate the wave forces at various elevated conditions and the effect of the wave period on the wave forces should be determined 2 two dimensional numerical simulations are conducted in this study three dimensional numerical simulations will be considered to improve the computational performance and provide results that are more accurate 3 numerical simulations on different geometrical shapes of the empty part of this type of superstructure will be conducted to investigate their influence on the wave forces on the box girder deck 4 the suggested method can be further modified to adapt to other situations additionally the empirical coefficients proposed in this method should be modified further 5 the bridge deck wave interaction requires more research particularly for long span bridges that have relatively large structural vibration periods acknowledgments the first author is grateful for the support from the national natural

23656,marine animals have been the bio inspirational source for some novel concepts for locomotion sensing and the intelligent control of undersea vehicles there has been little if any research in the area of bio inspired energy utilization strategies applied to undersea vehicles for example there are reasons why some fish swim at a specific cruise speed why some fish move by burst acceleration to higher speeds followed by coasting and why some negatively buoyant fish alternately glide downwards and then swim upward the goal of this study is to develop the theory and models of the climb and glide form of autonomous undersea vehicle transit in a form that can permit assessment of future practical technology insertions such as drag reduction and wing design in addition existing theory was expanded to address vehicles with significant wet weight and the effect of hotel load equivalent to the basal metabolic rate of animals several observations from this preliminary analysis for climb glide operation of practical vehicles were made over a practical and useful range of hotel loads and net vehicle lift to drag ratios energy savings benefits relative to level flight transit from 10 to excess of 40 can be expected this translates directly into a 10 40 increase in range if a climb glide strategy is employed instead of level flight transit under the right operating conditions keywords

and triantafyllou 1995 sensing yang et al 2010 and the intelligent control of undersea vehicles low and willy 2006 blake et al 2008 other advantages of biological systems are their adaptability to changes in environment and their ability for self repair correction of the system at the same time it is important to realize that the design space of human made systems may be different than for biological systems vogel 2000 provides an excellent description of the different mechanical worlds of nature and those of interest to people and provides an excellent cautionary treatise regarding taking concepts of biomimetics too far the goal here is not to prove general benefits of biological systems rather the goal is to investigate the usefulness of a specific bio inspired concept of operation there has been little research in the specific application of bio inspired energy utilization strategies for undersea vehicles there are reasons why some fish swim at an optimal cruise speed weihs 1973a and why some fish first accelerate to higher speeds and then coast weihs 1974 videler and weihs 1982 of particular interest here is why some negatively buoyant fish alternately glide downward and then swim upward rayner 1985 rayner et al 2001 very similar intermittent strategies involving bounding undulating and chattering flight patterns have been observed with birds these are shown in fig 1 the question addressed here was can a climb glide type of transit strategy be used by human made vehicles the answer was affirmative over a large practical design space of vehicle parameters the key enabler of the intermittent burst coast and climb glide behaviors is that the drag experienced by animals during propulsion is greater than drag experience by these animals during coasting gliding this is because the lift based swimming methods used by these animals produces lift induced drag and can cause overall drag in excess of 2 3 times that of a non swimming animal weihs 1974 videler and weihs 1982 the climb glide behaviors appear to be a result of instinctive strategies for energy use minimization it seems reasonable that some of these strategies may be adopted by autonomous undersea vehicles auvs to increase range increase on station time or improve some other performance metric the ability to accomplish this with bioinspired auvs like robotuna triantafyllou and triantafyllou 1995 appears promising the ability to accomplish this goal with more traditional rigid auvs that use rotating propulsors is less clear for aeronautical applications keating 2002 has presented a preliminary discussion of bounding flight and possible extensions to uninhabited air vehicles however there is not much other work reported in the literature describing attempts to exploit intermittent avian transit of the type described above with aerial vehicle operations the closest attempt at application appears to be a study comparing thermal soaring with gliders akos et al 2010 underwater the petrel ii vehicle described by liu et al 2017 is a hybrid glider and conventionally propulsor propelled auv the main reason for this hybridization was to enable an undersea glider with a maximum gliding speed of about 1 knot to be able to operate in counter currents of at least 3 knots by use of the propulsor others have examined vehicle paths with the goal of energy minimization wehbe et al 2014 described dynamic modeling and path planning in an energy minimization context claus and bachmayer 2016 considered energy optimization using variable depth control in air cha et al 2016 indicated theoretically that a single climb glide process is the most energy favorable operation for a high altitude long endurance unmanned aerial vehicle employing solar cells an regenerative fuel cells the goal of this work is to develop the theory and models of the climb and glide form of transit in a form that permits its assessment for auv transit the development enables the evaluation of alternative component technology insertions the theory was additionally expanded to address vehicles with significant wet weight and to accommodate the vehicle hotel power load equivalent to the basal metabolic rate in animals this study is comprised of several sequential parts that are meant to support the next the first section compares optimal horizontal cruising of fish with that of auvs a detailed similar comparison is made by phillips et al 2017 the partial objective of this section is to act as a primer for the subsequent presentation of the climb glide strategy another objective is to affirm the validity of this bio inspired treatment to human made vehicles the second section presents the theoretical development of the climb glide mode of transit to auvs in a way that provides a platform for an eventual technical assessment of the effects of different wing cross sections and geometries see peters et al 2002 sun et al 2017 the results from this section are then compared with simpler assessments made previously for marine animal applications the auv centered equations are then exercised extensively the results show that there exists a design space defined by a group of nondimensional parameters that allows for energy savings in auvs of practical sizes and operating characteristics using climb glide transit the derivation of the equations here is intricate to give some confidence in the final form of the equations results of limit analyses of the equations are presented in the appendix these equations reduce in the limit to physically reasonable behaviors 2 optimal cruising 2 1 theory consider the determination of the optimal cruising speed of a vehicle animal as the point of departure for this discussion fig 2 is taken from weihs 1973a and illustrates s s max the ratio of fish transit range to maximum possible range plotted against swimming velocity the maximum possible range is obtained by operating at an optimal velocity u max the swimming velocity is normalized by this u max this figure is very similar in appearance to typical plots of range versus speed for auvs curtin et al 1993 for example plots from both sources show that the maximum range is associated with an optimal vehicle or animal speed they also show that the location and magnitude of the peak range is a strong function of hotel power load for auvs and basal metabolic power requirements for marine animals this strong similarity gives support to the idea that optimal energy conserving swimming strategies employed by marine animals may have application to human made undersea vehicles weihs 1973a provides an excellent presentation of the equations required for prediction of optimal steady horizontal cruising these are the basis of the derivation here these are expanded by accounting for dependence of propulsion efficiency on velocity and by approximating the drag as proportional to an arbitrary power of velocity the work w required to travel a horizontal distance s at a speed u is the product of a transit time and the sum of shaft power and hotel power here p s is the power delivered by a rotating shaft to a propulsor it can also be the power delivered by a contracting relaxing muscle to a tail and thence to the water the hotel load p h is equivalent to the biological basal metabolic power 1 w p s p h t 2 t s u the thrust t which equals drag d is 3 t 1 2 ρ c d a w u a 4 η p η t p s t u 5 η p β u α the thrust t is assumed proportional to velocity to a power of a a is generally though not always 2 the efficiency η t is the thermodynamic efficiency of mechanical or battery conversion of fuel energy to work the efficiency η p is the propulsor efficiency and is assumed to be a proportional to the velocity to the power α with constant of proportionality β the drag coefficient and the vehicle wetted surface area are c d and a w respectively the dependence of c d on velocity is generally captured with an empirical

range depends on speed for both real and idealized biological and auv examples the broader spread of the fish curves relative to the auv curves results from the assumption of a linear dependence of propulsion efficiency on speed for fish α 1 relative to the assumption of constant α 0 propulsive efficiency for auvs although this propulsion efficiency assumption is not universally valid for all fish it does appear to be appropriate for trout webb 1971 the assumption of constant propulsive efficiency for auvs is valid if the propulsor advance ratio is constant this is generally true except when operating over very large speed ranges the dashed and solid lines show differences resulting from the drag dependence on speed for real relative to idealized fish or auvs respectively for the idealized cases drag is assumed to be proportional to velocity squared while for trout and real auvs the exponent is closer to 1 79 webb 1990 and 1 88 miller et al 2014 respectively it is important to note that because the range and speed dependence is expressed relative to maximum range and the velocity required to achieve that maximum fig 3 does not imply that a bio inspired system has inherently greater range than a conventionally designed auv the curve does suggest that the bio inspired propulsion swimming system can approach maximum range over a broader spread of velocities suggesting that the performance of a bio inspired auv suffers less during off design operation if one assumes a square law dependence of drag with velocity a 2 for a fish or bio inspired auv with a propulsive efficiency proportional to velocity a 1 then weihs relationship that the swimming power required for maximum range is equal to the basal metabolic or hotel power p s p h however for a conventionally propelled auv with an approximately constant propulsive efficiency the swimming power required for maximum range is equal to one half the basal metabolic or hotel power p s p h 2 the resultant implication is that a fish or bio inspirationally propelled auv will swim at a higher velocity than a conventional auv to obtain a maximum range for a specific design 4 power and glide of a vehicle with wet weight i e not neutrally buoyant 4 1 theory oceanographic buoys that move vertically upwards downwards in the water column are currently widely deployed http www argo ucsd edu as part of the argo program this movement occurs by controlled modification of their buoyancy versions of these have credited sperm whale biology with design inspiration mcfarland et al 2003 it has been proposed miller et al 2004 that the oil in the sperm whale forehead is cooler and denser when the whales dive deep after prey and that the oil is then heated by increased blood flow which decrease its density and helps the whale ascend other systems employ battery powered pumps to force oil into bladders external to the vehicle pressure hull at depth displacement of seawater renders the vehicle buoyant for ascent at the surface the oil re enters the pressure hull which renders the vehicle negatively buoyant for descent these buoyancy engines are the basis for the motive ability of slocum gliders and others of their auv genre http www teledynemarine com webb research it is important to note that the energy expended by the pumps to enable the glider to traverse a horizontal distance is not less than the energy required to propel a traditional neutrally buoyant auv in steady level motion the total sum of upwards downwards and horizontal distances may be greater but the horizontal distance travelled is the same or less this is demonstrated in the subsequent discussion of fig 18 it has been proposed that negatively buoyant fish sharks or tunas have wet weight will glide downwards for a distance and then swim upwards to begin the cycle anew the reason for this may be that it can be more advantageous from an energy utilization point of view than steady level or horizontal swimming weihs 1973b these fish are relatively heavy because they do not possess a swimming bladder and rely on lift especially from the pectoral fins to offset negative buoyancy the energy benefit can be attributed to the fact that a swimming fish produces additional drag because of induced drag from its lift producing swimming mode that can be significantly greater than the fish s drag when simply coasting or gliding there exists a sweet region of design for negatively buoyant i e having wet weight animals where the climb and glide operation is energetically favorable for transit over land at the same effective over land speed this sweet region is discussed in depth in the results section the principal parameters defining the benefit appear to be the angle of gliding descent relative to the angle of powered ascent this type of power and glide behavior has clear applicability with auvs in particular because the energy density of auvs is often reduced because of the requirement of maintaining neutral buoyancy the use of downward glide followed by powered ascent may facilitate the use of heavier and denser oxygen storage systems or increase the effective energy density of heavy battery systems and vehicles with wet weight ascent or descent might be realized as suggested by chen 1963 or peters 2007 by use of wings or simply by changes in vehicle speed fig 4 shows how this procedure might be implemented as well as the definitions for h θ and ϕ depth glide angle and climb propulsion angle respectively it is anticipated here that gliding typically proceeds at a slower speed than climbing heavy vehicles have lift to drag λ characteristics that show maximum values at lower speeds and lower values at higher climbing speeds as a consequence powered climb is draggier than unpowered glide the powered climb and unpowered gliding behavior studied by weihs 1973b in the context of marine animal locomotion has also been described by rayner 1985 and rayner et al 2001 as undulating flight see fig 1 in the air it has been associated with larger birds with longer wings such as raptors and cranes spaar et al 1998 have described this behavior with levant sparrowhawks during the night when thermals are less available for soaring gliding modes a primary difference between undulating and bounding modes is the magnitude of h the closest attempt at limited application of this behavior with unmanned air vehicles gliding is lawrance and sukkarieh s lawrance and sukkarieh 2009 strategy for combined dynamic soaring i e taking advantage of wind shear and gliding a basic premise of this article is that the lift induced drag incurred during powered climb or horizontal flight of a heavy vehicle undersea vehicle with wet weight is greater than that experienced during equilibrium glide the average drag experienced by the vehicle during a climb and glide cycle can be less than incurred during level flight at the same average net level speed as shown later with fig 7 the lift to drag ratio for a typical vehicle is greatest at a lower speed gliding and lower at higher speeds climbing fig 5 is a representation of the relationship between lift and induced drag on a typical airfoil taken from anderson s text anderson 1989 the induced drag is given by 17 d i l sin α i because values for α i are typically small the assumption sin α i α i is applied and 18 d i l α i for an elliptical spanwise lift distribution incompressible flow theory predicts 19 α i c l π a r where ar is the wing aspect ratio given as ar b 2 s b is the wing span s is the planform wing area and c l πb 2 α i s for simplicity the assumption ar b c will be made where c is the airfoil chord consequently 20 d i l c l π a r and because 21 l 1 2 ρ u 2 s c l 22 d i 1 2 ρ u 2 s c l 2 π a r 23 the induced drag coefficient c di is c d i c l 2 π e a r where e represents a deviation from the idealized elliptic lift distribution and generally takes a value of 0 85 0 95 note here that c l refers to the lift coefficient of the wing and is based on the wing surface area s as is the induced drag coefficient the effective lift coefficient for the vehicle based on vehicle wetted or surface area a w assuming lift is solely due to the wing is 24 c l e f f s a w c l for ideal gliding large lift to drag c l will tend to be small and or ar large and consequently c di will be low during powered climb or level flight with wet weight lift to drag will be smaller because of the requirement of larger c l produced by flap angle angle of attack or modified wing shape the effective drag coefficient during unpowered gliding will be less than during powered propulsion with an airfoil analogous to the effect observed with the lower drag coefficient of coasting gliding relative to actively swimming marine animals the remainder of this development focuses on the necessary conditions required to produce the appropriate drag behavior the energy expenditure during the downwards glide portion e g is solely due to the vehicle hotel or an animal s basal metabolic load 25 e g p h c g h csc θ g u g the volume requirement for wing stowage and deployment can be applied by use of an effective loss of

propulsion energetics and the internal volume required to stow the wing the glide angle and the terminal glide velocity is readily available from the lift to drag ratio of the vehicle during glide λ g

the wet weight of the vehicle the ratio s a w is the ratio of wing plan form area to the entire vehicle wetted area inclusive of wing here it is assumed for simplicity that lift is generated solely from the wing s and drag is the sum of the 0o angle of attack body drag of both the vehicle body and wing and the induced drag produced by the lift generating wing the first term on the right hand side of the equal sign is basically the inverse of the lift to drag ratio based on the vehicle body drag with wing with no relative angle of attack and the second term is the lift to drag ratio of the wing based on induced drag by the lift producing wing of course this is a simplified treatment there are more nuanced but significant body wing interaction and angle of attack effects that could be accommodated in future work the equilibrium glide velocity u g is obtained from a force balance fig 6 32 1 2 ρ c d t o t a l a w u g 2 f w sin θ g 33 u g 2 f w a w ρ sin θ g c d t o t a l note that

drag experienced during climb for these equations the terms η c and η s are the product of thermodynamic conversion efficiency and propulsor efficiency for powered climb and horizontal transit operations respectively it is important to note that the wet weight of the vehicle animal affects these equations in two ways first by way of the potential energy required to raise the weight through a distance h as represented in term 3 of eqn 40 and by the lift induced drag represented by term 2 note that λ c is used because the lift to drag ratio during climb will likely be different than that

accomplished by including wing control surfaces or simply by changing vehicle speed the derivation presented previously for continuous steady horizontal travel of a lift requiring vehicle animal is modified here to more easily compare with the glide and climb energy equations note that for horizontal flight the wetted weight is equal to the required lift 45 e s p h s s s g s p u s s g s p d s η

climb operations respectively generally ψ ss may be different from ψ cg while both climb and glide and steady horizontal operation will require very similar wing stowage volumes their operational power requirements may be different for example the wing may be deployed once in steady level flight but deployed and retracted or modified in cross section as the vehicle cycles through climb and

horizontal flight to climb and glide transit in eqn 60 obviously as h 0 level transit eqn 60 must reduce to a physically realistic form the demonstration of this reduction is presented in the appendix

7 and 8 show the drag required and lift to drag ratios as a function of speed for a notional 21 diameter winged vehicle peters 2007 if this vehicle is designed so that initially a large λ g wing was deployed enabling it to glide downwards followed by a climb wing with increased lift and drag during powered operation then a mechanical situation analogous to the biological one results this can also occur simply by virtue that the glide occurs at low speed and the climb at higher speed in fig 8 an overall minimum drag condition occurs near a speed of 7 knots see peters 2007 where the sum of body drag which increases with velocity and lift induced drag which initially decreases with velocity is a minimum note that the purpose of these figures is to illustrate reasonable values for lift to drag ratios and their dependence of vehicle speed the results presented in the results section are applicable for a range of vehicle sizes and speeds and not just for the notional vehicle of figs 7 and 8 4 2 relationship to weihs derivation weihs 1973b derivation can be related directly to the one shown here if the effect of induced drag is lumped into the total drag this reduces the complexity of the derivation and still illustrates very salient features however is not satisfactory for design trades that seek to define optimal designs of lift generating devices also weihs 1973b derivation does not account for the presence of hotel or basal metabolic load its effect is now included in the following derivation the effect of lifting surface actuation is ignored however 66 e c p h c g e f f h csc ϕ

a case where there is no hotel load applied and the swimming drag equals the gliding drag κ 1 this figure shows that no benefit is realizable to come close to breaking even very shallow glide or power angles are needed if the swimming propulsive drag equals the gliding drag this result indicates that sea gliders do not produce an energy benefit per horizontal distance travelled relative to conventionally powered rotating propulsor auvs traveling horizontally note that while a sea glider has to be negatively buoyant to descend and positively buoyant to ascend it is on average neutrally buoyant over the span of a saw tooth cycle the principal benefit available from sea gliders in this case is their ability to transit a larger volume of water during their horizontal transit because of their vertical excursions these observations change significantly for cases where propulsive drag exceeds gliding drag equation 73 for κ 1 as shown in figs 10 and 11 note here that p h p s p h e f f d g u s in equation 73 recall this is analogous to the lift induced drag penalty that will occur with heavy vehicles there are substantial energy savings over a horizontal distance theoretically available for the no hotel load case especially if the cycling process involves relatively shallow glide and some steeper propulsion angles the impact of hotel load expressed as a ratio of hotel load to the propulsive energy requirements for a propulsive drag penalty of κ 1 5 and 3 0 are also shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively these results illustrate the adverse impact of hotel requirements and that a slightly shallower propulsive climb angle is now required to maximize savings for the notional vehicle described by figs 7 and 8 the effective propulsive drag versus gilding drag penalty is about 1 5 these results suggest that a conventional auv can benefit if a shallow glide angle is employed the fact that weight varies as a cube of diameter assuming constant vehicle length to diameter ratio while drag varies with the square of diameter suggests that heavy large diameter vehicles will require much greater lift and therefore greater induced drag than smaller diameter auvs and as shown in these figures a greater propulsive to gliding drag penalty enables a greater energy savings over a horizontal distance travelled than a smaller drag penalty equation 60 was exercised over a larger parameter space fig 12 through 16 show the theoretical energy benefit obtained by the glide climb process for these calculations it is assumed that the wing generating device is capable of producing variable lift to drag to enable different lift to drag ratios to be applied if the vehicle is descending ascending or in level flight the variation in lift to drag can also occur via changes in speed for all cases the gliding lift to drag ratio λ g was the independent variable the climbing lift to drag ratio λ c was varied between 5 and 7 and the climb angle was varied from 30 to 45 to 60o for all future results the efficiency η was set to 0 25 a value appropriate for thermal engines fig 12 shows the effect of a hotel load wet weight parameter ψ of zero for a horizontal lift to drag ratio of 7 over the entire region of improved energy benefit increased climb angle corresponds directly to increased energy benefit and increased the gliding and or the climbing lift to drag ratio also results in increased benefit figs 13 15 show the effect of increasing the value of ψ from zero i e no hotel load and or very heavy vehicle wet weight to 0 1 and 1 0 large hotel load and or very light vehicles respectively in general the impact of ϕ λ s λ c and λ g is similar for the larger values of ψ lower values for the climbing lift to drag ratio λ c 1 or lower are the most realizable for ψ 0 and λ s 7 one might expect a 20 improvement in range for ψ 0 1 10 15 improvement might be observed for ψ 1 range benefit will still be available but likely 10 the benefit observed with increasing climb angle is consistent with rayner s avian observations rayner et al 2001 pg 67 savings are still obtained with lower climb angles but the steepest possible angle should be adopted fig 16 presents these results in a different manner these results were obtained for a horizontal to glide velocity ratio u and a climbing lift to drag ratio of 1 and 3 respectively two different hotel power wet weight parameters were compared 0 and 0 04 with no difference in results the results were also varied with climb angles of 30 50 and 70o and horizontal transit lift to drag ratios λ s of 5 and 7 the key take away here is climb and glide compares better against level flight for lower level lift to drag ratios in every instance steeper climb angles produced better performance of climb and glide in the fig 16 caption the ratio of climb to glide velocities are shown for each climb angle the climb velocity for steeper angles can be greater than 3 times that of the glide speed however this will typically nor result in an excessively high absolute speed the benefit of reducing hotel and or increased wet weight is again apparent here with decreasing energy benefit with increased ψ the higher gliding lift to drag ratios correspond directly to shallower glide angles greater climb angles show some benefit as well there are two aspects of energy benefit that result specifically from the effect of the ratio of climb to glide velocity the first is that as a result of shallower climb angles or climbing velocities close to glide and horizontal transit velocities the vehicle may use the same low power energy convertor for both climbing and horizontal transit modes second for greater climb angles and therefore higher relative climb velocities a single higher power energy convertor can be used permitting both the high efficiency long duration transit as well as maintaining the capacity for a higher speed horizontal transit when desired the same ability employed for strictly horizontal transit requires the use of both low and high power hybrid energy convertors with extra volume and weight requirements finally increased benefit is also seen if the horizontal lift to drag ratio is lower 4 4 impact of the actuation parameter fig 13 showed results for a wing or lifting surface actuation parameter n e a c t f w r a of zero the impact of increasing this value to 0 1 and 0 25 is shown in figs 17 and 18 respectively while an actuation parameter of 0 1 shows only a slight reduction in energy benefit a value of 0 25 produces a much more severe impact if 1 kw of power is employed over 10 s of actuation both deployment and retraction a wet weight of 250 n and a small 100 m over ground transit is employed then an activation parameter of 0 4 is obtained if a more modest 0 5 kw and a greater transit of 200 m were used then the actuation parameter is about 0 1 these power levels and durations can also be representative of vehicle acceleration to determine the relative impact of the lifting surface activation energy it is convenient to define an impact factor such that 75 e s e c e g e a c t e s e c e g 1 1 e a c t e c e g where 76 e a c t e c e g n e a c t f w r a

climb angle appears to have little impact on the actuation penalty lower hotel power parameters in other words lower hotel load and or greater wet weight cause the vehicle to experience a greater adverse impact 5 concluding remarks there are several observations from this preliminary analysis for climb glide operation of a vehicle of interest here over a reasonable operational range of hotel loads and reasonable range of net vehicle lift to drag ratios energy savings from 10 to greater than 40 can be expected if the vehicle employs a slow glide speed period followed by a high power high speed climb significant energy savings are available if higher horizontal transit speeds are desired as a result when executing a high speed climb the power requirements are similar to those required for a high speed horizontal transit which suggests that a low power energy convertor may not be needed at all all propulsive power would be available from intermittent operation of the high power convertor with this type of operation and only a single energy convertor it may be possible to free volume for additional energy storage or inclusion of drag reduction technology limit analyses were also applied to the theoretical equations in the appendices these showed that in the limit of depth excursion going to zero low hotel power heavy wet weight high hotel power light wet weight and optimum performance the theoretical equations behave in a physically reasonable manner the derivation was presented here in terms of dimensionless variable combinations making it relevant to a wide range a vehicle geometries and operational parameters some technical challenges for implementation of these benefits can be described as well the ability to actively modify the lifting surface or vehicle body lift to drag ratio without sacrificing excessive volume or actuation energy represents one such challenge one way to do this in the future might be by geometric morphing peters et al 2002 another way might entail simply using acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle to produce the appropriate lift to drag mitigation of the extra drag produced when the propulsor is not operating is another challenge for real systems possible solutions for this challenge include the possible addition of a deployable fairing that would surround the inactive propulsor with a hydrodynamically favorable shape the feathering of the propulsor so that it produces neither net thrust nor net drag or implementation of a powered glide operation similar to landing operation employed by commercial aircraft the present analysis assumes that the vehicle climbing and gliding occurs with the axis of the vehicle body parallel to the climb and glide velocity vectors figs 4 and 6 a more accurate analysis would address vehicle trim requirements an alternative operation can occur where the vehicle remains horizontal during climb and glide this may be executed solely by increasing or decreasing

23656,marine animals have been the bio inspirational source for some novel concepts for locomotion sensing and the intelligent control of undersea vehicles there has been little if any research in the area of bio inspired energy utilization strategies applied to undersea vehicles for example there are reasons why some fish swim at a specific cruise speed why some fish move by burst acceleration to higher speeds followed by coasting and why some negatively buoyant fish alternately glide downwards and then swim upward the goal of this study is to develop the theory and models of the climb and glide form of autonomous undersea vehicle transit in a form that can permit assessment of future practical technology insertions such as drag reduction and wing design in addition existing theory was expanded to address vehicles with significant wet weight and the effect of hotel load equivalent to the basal metabolic rate of animals several observations from this preliminary analysis for climb glide operation of practical vehicles were made over a practical and useful range of hotel loads and net vehicle lift to drag ratios energy savings benefits relative to level flight transit from 10 to excess of 40 can be expected this translates directly into a 10 40 increase in range if a climb glide strategy is employed instead of level flight transit under the right operating conditions keywords

and triantafyllou 1995 sensing yang et al 2010 and the intelligent control of undersea vehicles low and willy 2006 blake et al 2008 other advantages of biological systems are their adaptability to changes in environment and their ability for self repair correction of the system at the same time it is important to realize that the design space of human made systems may be different than for biological systems vogel 2000 provides an excellent description of the different mechanical worlds of nature and those of interest to people and provides an excellent cautionary treatise regarding taking concepts of biomimetics too far the goal here is not to prove general benefits of biological systems rather the goal is to investigate the usefulness of a specific bio inspired concept of operation there has been little research in the specific application of bio inspired energy utilization strategies for undersea vehicles there are reasons why some fish swim at an optimal cruise speed weihs 1973a and why some fish first accelerate to higher speeds and then coast weihs 1974 videler and weihs 1982 of particular interest here is why some negatively buoyant fish alternately glide downward and then swim upward rayner 1985 rayner et al 2001 very similar intermittent strategies involving bounding undulating and chattering flight patterns have been observed with birds these are shown in fig 1 the question addressed here was can a climb glide type of transit strategy be used by human made vehicles the answer was affirmative over a large practical design space of vehicle parameters the key enabler of the intermittent burst coast and climb glide behaviors is that the drag experienced by animals during propulsion is greater than drag experience by these animals during coasting gliding this is because the lift based swimming methods used by these animals produces lift induced drag and can cause overall drag in excess of 2 3 times that of a non swimming animal weihs 1974 videler and weihs 1982 the climb glide behaviors appear to be a result of instinctive strategies for energy use minimization it seems reasonable that some of these strategies may be adopted by autonomous undersea vehicles auvs to increase range increase on station time or improve some other performance metric the ability to accomplish this with bioinspired auvs like robotuna triantafyllou and triantafyllou 1995 appears promising the ability to accomplish this goal with more traditional rigid auvs that use rotating propulsors is less clear for aeronautical applications keating 2002 has presented a preliminary discussion of bounding flight and possible extensions to uninhabited air vehicles however there is not much other work reported in the literature describing attempts to exploit intermittent avian transit of the type described above with aerial vehicle operations the closest attempt at application appears to be a study comparing thermal soaring with gliders akos et al 2010 underwater the petrel ii vehicle described by liu et al 2017 is a hybrid glider and conventionally propulsor propelled auv the main reason for this hybridization was to enable an undersea glider with a maximum gliding speed of about 1 knot to be able to operate in counter currents of at least 3 knots by use of the propulsor others have examined vehicle paths with the goal of energy minimization wehbe et al 2014 described dynamic modeling and path planning in an energy minimization context claus and bachmayer 2016 considered energy optimization using variable depth control in air cha et al 2016 indicated theoretically that a single climb glide process is the most energy favorable operation for a high altitude long endurance unmanned aerial vehicle employing solar cells an regenerative fuel cells the goal of this work is to develop the theory and models of the climb and glide form of transit in a form that permits its assessment for auv transit the development enables the evaluation of alternative component technology insertions the theory was additionally expanded to address vehicles with significant wet weight and to accommodate the vehicle hotel power load equivalent to the basal metabolic rate in animals this study is comprised of several sequential parts that are meant to support the next the first section compares optimal horizontal cruising of fish with that of auvs a detailed similar comparison is made by phillips et al 2017 the partial objective of this section is to act as a primer for the subsequent presentation of the climb glide strategy another objective is to affirm the validity of this bio inspired treatment to human made vehicles the second section presents the theoretical development of the climb glide mode of transit to auvs in a way that provides a platform for an eventual technical assessment of the effects of different wing cross sections and geometries see peters et al 2002 sun et al 2017 the results from this section are then compared with simpler assessments made previously for marine animal applications the auv centered equations are then exercised extensively the results show that there exists a design space defined by a group of nondimensional parameters that allows for energy savings in auvs of practical sizes and operating characteristics using climb glide transit the derivation of the equations here is intricate to give some confidence in the final form of the equations results of limit analyses of the equations are presented in the appendix these equations reduce in the limit to physically reasonable behaviors 2 optimal cruising 2 1 theory consider the determination of the optimal cruising speed of a vehicle animal as the point of departure for this discussion fig 2 is taken from weihs 1973a and illustrates s s max the ratio of fish transit range to maximum possible range plotted against swimming velocity the maximum possible range is obtained by operating at an optimal velocity u max the swimming velocity is normalized by this u max this figure is very similar in appearance to typical plots of range versus speed for auvs curtin et al 1993 for example plots from both sources show that the maximum range is associated with an optimal vehicle or animal speed they also show that the location and magnitude of the peak range is a strong function of hotel power load for auvs and basal metabolic power requirements for marine animals this strong similarity gives support to the idea that optimal energy conserving swimming strategies employed by marine animals may have application to human made undersea vehicles weihs 1973a provides an excellent presentation of the equations required for prediction of optimal steady horizontal cruising these are the basis of the derivation here these are expanded by accounting for dependence of propulsion efficiency on velocity and by approximating the drag as proportional to an arbitrary power of velocity the work w required to travel a horizontal distance s at a speed u is the product of a transit time and the sum of shaft power and hotel power here p s is the power delivered by a rotating shaft to a propulsor it can also be the power delivered by a contracting relaxing muscle to a tail and thence to the water the hotel load p h is equivalent to the biological basal metabolic power 1 w p s p h t 2 t s u the thrust t which equals drag d is 3 t 1 2 ρ c d a w u a 4 η p η t p s t u 5 η p β u α the thrust t is assumed proportional to velocity to a power of a a is generally though not always 2 the efficiency η t is the thermodynamic efficiency of mechanical or battery conversion of fuel energy to work the efficiency η p is the propulsor efficiency and is assumed to be a proportional to the velocity to the power α with constant of proportionality β the drag coefficient and the vehicle wetted surface area are c d and a w respectively the dependence of c d on velocity is generally captured with an empirical reynolds number dependence as vehicle wet weight becomes significant with the requirement of lift and control surfaces alternative dependencies of the drag coefficient may be needed to accommodate

16 or finally s s max σ 1 a α σ 1 a α a α where σ u u max and u max corresponds to the velocity at which maximum range is achieved 3 results fig 3 shows how range relative to the maximum possible range depends on speed for both real and idealized biological and auv examples the broader spread of the fish curves relative to the auv curves results from the assumption of a linear dependence of propulsion efficiency on speed for fish α 1 relative to the assumption of constant α 0 propulsive efficiency for auvs although this propulsion efficiency assumption is not universally valid for all fish it does appear to be appropriate for trout webb 1971 the assumption of constant propulsive efficiency for auvs is valid if the propulsor advance ratio is constant this is generally true except when operating over very large speed ranges the dashed and solid lines show differences resulting from the drag dependence on speed for real relative to idealized fish or auvs respectively for the idealized cases drag is assumed to be proportional to velocity squared while for trout and real auvs the exponent is closer to 1 79 webb 1990 and 1 88 miller et al 2014 respectively it is important to note that because the range and speed dependence is expressed relative to maximum range and the velocity required to achieve that maximum fig 3 does not imply that a bio inspired system has inherently greater range than a conventionally designed auv the curve does suggest that the bio inspired propulsion swimming system can approach maximum range over a broader spread of velocities suggesting that the performance of a bio inspired auv suffers less during off design operation if one assumes a square law dependence of drag with velocity a 2 for a fish or bio inspired auv with a propulsive efficiency proportional to velocity a 1 then weihs relationship that the swimming power required for maximum range is equal to the basal metabolic or hotel power p s p h however for a conventionally propelled auv with an approximately constant propulsive efficiency the swimming power required for maximum range is equal to one half the basal metabolic or hotel power p s p h 2 the resultant implication is that a fish or bio inspirationally propelled auv will swim at a higher velocity than a conventional auv to obtain a maximum range for a specific design 4 power and glide of a vehicle with wet weight i e not neutrally buoyant 4 1 theory oceanographic buoys that move vertically upwards downwards in the water column are currently widely deployed http www argo ucsd edu as part of the argo program this movement occurs by controlled modification of their buoyancy versions of these have credited sperm whale biology with design inspiration mcfarland et al 2003 it has been proposed miller et al 2004 that the oil in the sperm whale forehead is cooler and denser when the whales dive deep after prey and that the oil is then heated by increased blood flow which decrease its density and helps the whale ascend other systems employ battery powered pumps to force oil into bladders external to the vehicle pressure hull at depth displacement of seawater renders the vehicle buoyant for ascent at the surface the oil re enters the pressure hull which renders the vehicle negatively buoyant for descent these buoyancy engines are the basis for the motive ability of slocum gliders and others of their auv genre http www teledynemarine com webb research it is important to note that the energy expended by the pumps to enable the glider to traverse a horizontal distance is not less than the energy required to propel a traditional neutrally buoyant auv in steady level motion the total sum of upwards downwards and horizontal distances may be greater but the horizontal distance travelled is the same or less this is demonstrated in the subsequent discussion of fig 18 it has been proposed that negatively buoyant fish sharks or tunas have wet weight will glide downwards for a distance and then swim upwards to begin the cycle anew the reason for this may be that it can be more advantageous from an energy utilization point of view than steady level or horizontal swimming weihs 1973b these fish are relatively heavy because they do not possess a swimming bladder and rely on lift especially from the pectoral fins to offset negative buoyancy the energy benefit can be attributed to the fact that a swimming fish produces additional drag because of induced drag from its lift producing swimming mode that can be significantly greater than the fish s drag when simply coasting or gliding there exists a sweet region of design for negatively buoyant i e having wet weight animals where the climb and glide operation is energetically favorable for transit over land at the same effective over land speed this sweet region is discussed in depth in the results section the principal parameters defining the benefit appear to be the angle of gliding descent relative to the angle of powered ascent this type of power and glide behavior has clear applicability with auvs in particular because the energy density of auvs is often reduced because of the requirement of maintaining neutral buoyancy the use of downward glide followed by powered ascent may facilitate the use of heavier and denser oxygen storage systems or increase the effective energy density of heavy battery systems and vehicles with wet weight ascent or descent might be realized as suggested by chen 1963 or peters 2007 by use of wings or simply by changes in vehicle speed fig 4 shows how this procedure might be implemented as well as the definitions for h θ and ϕ depth glide angle and climb propulsion angle respectively it is anticipated here that gliding typically proceeds at a slower speed than climbing heavy vehicles have lift to drag λ characteristics that show maximum values at lower speeds and lower values at higher climbing speeds as a consequence powered climb is draggier than unpowered glide the powered climb and unpowered gliding behavior studied by weihs 1973b in the context of marine animal locomotion has also been described by rayner 1985 and rayner et al 2001 as undulating flight see fig 1 in the air it has been associated with larger birds with longer wings such as raptors and cranes spaar et al 1998 have described this behavior with levant sparrowhawks during the night when thermals are less available for soaring gliding modes a primary difference between undulating and bounding modes is the magnitude of h the closest attempt at limited application of this behavior with unmanned air vehicles gliding is lawrance and sukkarieh s lawrance and sukkarieh 2009 strategy for combined dynamic soaring i e taking advantage of wind shear and gliding a basic premise of this article is that the lift induced drag incurred during powered climb or horizontal flight of a heavy vehicle undersea vehicle with wet weight is greater than that experienced during equilibrium glide the average drag experienced by the vehicle during a climb and glide cycle can be less than incurred during level flight at the same average net level speed as shown later with fig 7 the lift to drag ratio for a typical vehicle is greatest at a lower speed gliding and lower at higher speeds climbing fig 5 is a representation of the relationship between lift and induced drag on a typical airfoil taken from anderson s text anderson 1989 the induced drag is given by 17 d i l sin α i because values for α i are typically small the assumption sin α i α i is applied and 18 d i l α i for an elliptical spanwise lift distribution incompressible flow theory predicts 19 α i c l π a r where ar is the wing aspect ratio given as ar b 2 s b is the wing span s is the planform wing area and c l πb 2 α i s for simplicity the assumption ar b c will be made where c is the airfoil chord consequently 20 d i l c l π a r and because 21 l 1 2 ρ u 2 s c l 22 d i 1 2 ρ u 2 s c l 2 π a r 23 the induced drag coefficient c di is c d i c l 2 π e a r where e represents a deviation from the idealized elliptic lift distribution and generally takes a value of 0 85 0 95 note here that c l refers to the lift coefficient of the wing and is based on the wing surface area s as is the induced drag coefficient the effective lift coefficient for the vehicle based on vehicle wetted or surface area a w assuming lift is solely due to the wing is 24 c l e f f s a w c l for ideal gliding large lift to drag c l will tend to be small and or ar large and consequently c di will be low during powered climb or level flight with wet weight lift to drag will be smaller because of the requirement of larger c l produced by flap angle angle of attack or modified wing shape the effective drag coefficient during unpowered gliding will be less than during powered propulsion with an airfoil analogous to the effect observed with the lower drag coefficient of coasting gliding relative to actively swimming marine animals the remainder of this development focuses on the necessary conditions required to produce the appropriate drag behavior the energy expenditure during the downwards glide portion e g is solely due to the vehicle hotel or an animal s basal metabolic load 25 e g p h c g h csc θ g u g the volume requirement for wing stowage and deployment can be applied by use of an effective loss of

propulsion energetics and the internal volume required to stow the wing the glide angle and the terminal glide velocity is readily available from the lift to drag ratio of the vehicle during glide λ g

the wet weight of the vehicle the ratio s a w is the ratio of wing plan form area to the entire vehicle wetted area inclusive of wing here it is assumed for simplicity that lift is generated solely from the wing s and drag is the sum of the 0o angle of attack body drag of both the vehicle body and wing and the induced drag produced by the lift generating wing the first term on the right hand side of the equal sign is basically the inverse of the lift to drag ratio based on the vehicle body drag with wing with no relative angle of attack and the second term is the lift to drag ratio of the wing based on induced drag by the lift producing wing of course this is a simplified treatment there are more nuanced but significant body wing interaction and angle of attack effects that could be accommodated in future work the equilibrium glide velocity u g is obtained from a force balance fig 6 32 1 2 ρ c d t o t a l a w u g 2 f w sin θ g 33 u g 2 f w a w ρ sin θ g c d t o t a l note that

drag experienced during climb for these equations the terms η c and η s are the product of thermodynamic conversion efficiency and propulsor efficiency for powered climb and horizontal transit operations respectively it is important to note that the wet weight of the vehicle animal affects these equations in two ways first by way of the potential energy required to raise the weight through a distance h as represented in term 3 of eqn 40 and by the lift induced drag represented by term 2 note that λ c is used because the lift to drag ratio during climb will likely be different than that

accomplished by including wing control surfaces or simply by changing vehicle speed the derivation presented previously for continuous steady horizontal travel of a lift requiring vehicle animal is

7 and 8 show the drag required and lift to drag ratios as a function of speed for a notional 21 diameter winged vehicle peters 2007 if this vehicle is designed so that initially a large λ g wing was deployed enabling it to glide downwards followed by a climb wing with increased lift and drag during powered operation then a mechanical situation analogous to the biological one results this can also occur simply by virtue that the glide occurs at low speed and the climb at higher speed in fig 8 an overall minimum drag condition occurs near a speed of 7 knots see peters 2007 where the sum of body drag which increases with velocity and lift induced drag which initially decreases with velocity is a minimum note that the purpose of these figures is to illustrate reasonable values for lift to drag ratios and their dependence of vehicle speed the results presented in the results section are applicable for a range of vehicle sizes and speeds and not just for the notional vehicle of figs 7 and 8 4 2 relationship to weihs derivation weihs 1973b derivation can be related directly to the one shown here if the effect of induced drag is lumped into the total drag this reduces the complexity of the derivation and still illustrates very salient features however is not satisfactory for design trades that seek to define optimal designs of lift generating devices also weihs 1973b derivation does not account for the presence of hotel or basal metabolic load its effect is now included in the following derivation the effect of lifting surface actuation is ignored however 66 e c p h c g e f f h csc ϕ

a case where there is no hotel load applied and the swimming drag equals the gliding drag κ 1 this figure shows that no benefit is realizable to come close to breaking even very shallow glide or power angles are needed if the swimming propulsive drag equals the gliding drag this result indicates that sea gliders do not produce an energy benefit per horizontal distance travelled relative to conventionally powered rotating propulsor auvs traveling horizontally note that while a sea glider has to be negatively buoyant to descend and positively buoyant to ascend it is on average neutrally buoyant over the span of a saw tooth cycle the principal benefit available from sea gliders in this case is their ability to transit a larger volume of water during their horizontal transit because of their vertical excursions these observations change significantly for cases where propulsive drag exceeds gliding drag equation 73 for κ 1 as shown in figs 10 and 11 note here that p h p s p h e f f d g u s in equation 73 recall this is analogous to the lift induced drag penalty that will occur with heavy vehicles there are substantial energy savings over a horizontal distance theoretically available for the no hotel load case especially if the cycling process involves relatively shallow glide and some steeper propulsion angles the impact of hotel load expressed as a ratio of hotel load to the propulsive energy requirements for a propulsive drag penalty of κ 1 5 and 3 0 are also shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively these results illustrate the adverse impact of hotel requirements and that a slightly shallower propulsive climb angle is now required to maximize savings for the notional vehicle described by figs 7 and 8 the effective propulsive drag versus gilding drag penalty is about 1 5 these results suggest that a conventional auv can benefit if a shallow glide angle is employed the fact that weight varies as a cube of diameter assuming constant vehicle length to diameter ratio while drag varies with the square of diameter suggests that heavy large diameter vehicles will require much greater lift and therefore greater induced drag than smaller diameter auvs and as shown in these figures a greater propulsive to gliding drag penalty enables a greater energy savings over a horizontal distance travelled than a smaller drag penalty equation 60 was exercised over a larger parameter space fig 12 through 16 show the theoretical energy benefit obtained by the glide climb process for these calculations it is assumed that the wing generating device is capable of producing variable lift to drag to enable different lift to drag ratios to be applied if the vehicle is descending ascending or in level flight the variation in lift to drag can also occur via changes in speed for all cases the gliding lift to drag ratio λ g was the independent variable the climbing lift to drag ratio λ c was varied between 5 and 7 and the climb angle was varied from 30 to 45 to 60o for all future results the efficiency η was set to 0 25 a value appropriate for thermal engines fig 12 shows the effect of a hotel load wet weight parameter ψ of zero for a horizontal lift to drag ratio of 7 over the entire region of improved energy benefit increased climb angle corresponds directly to increased energy benefit and increased the gliding and or the climbing lift to drag ratio also results in increased benefit figs 13 15 show the effect of increasing the value of ψ from zero i e no hotel load and or very heavy vehicle wet weight to 0 1 and 1 0 large hotel load and or very light vehicles respectively in general the impact of ϕ λ s λ c and λ g is similar for the larger values of ψ lower values for the climbing lift to drag ratio λ c 1 or lower are the most realizable for ψ 0 and λ s 7 one might expect a 20 improvement in range for ψ 0 1 10 15 improvement might be observed for ψ 1 range benefit will still be available but likely 10 the benefit observed with increasing climb angle is consistent with rayner s avian observations rayner et al 2001 pg 67 savings are still obtained with lower climb angles but the steepest possible angle should be adopted fig 16 presents these results in a different manner these results were obtained for a horizontal to glide velocity ratio u and a climbing lift to drag ratio of 1 and 3 respectively two different hotel power wet weight parameters were compared 0 and 0 04 with no difference in results the results were also varied with climb angles of 30 50 and 70o and horizontal transit lift to drag ratios λ s of 5 and 7 the key take away here is climb and glide compares better against level flight for lower level lift to drag ratios in every instance steeper climb angles produced better performance of climb and glide in the fig 16 caption the ratio of climb to glide velocities are shown for each climb angle the climb velocity for steeper angles can be greater than 3 times that of the glide speed however this will typically nor result in an excessively high absolute speed the benefit of reducing hotel and or increased wet weight is again apparent here with decreasing energy benefit with increased ψ the higher gliding lift to drag ratios correspond directly to shallower glide angles greater climb angles show some benefit as well there are two aspects of energy benefit that result specifically from the effect of the ratio of climb to glide velocity the first is that as a result of shallower climb angles or climbing velocities close to glide and horizontal transit velocities the vehicle may use the same low power energy convertor for both climbing and horizontal transit modes second for greater climb angles and therefore higher relative climb velocities a single higher power energy convertor can be used permitting both the high efficiency long duration transit as well as maintaining the capacity for a higher speed horizontal transit when desired the same ability employed for strictly horizontal transit requires the use of both low and high power hybrid energy convertors with extra volume and weight requirements finally increased benefit is also seen if the horizontal lift to drag ratio is lower 4 4 impact of the actuation parameter fig 13 showed results for a wing or lifting surface actuation parameter n e a c t f w r a of zero the impact of increasing this value to 0 1 and 0 25 is shown in figs 17 and 18 respectively while an actuation parameter of 0 1 shows only a slight reduction in energy benefit a value of 0 25 produces a much more severe impact if 1 kw of power is employed over 10 s of actuation both deployment and retraction a wet weight of 250 n and a small 100 m over ground transit is employed then an activation parameter of 0 4 is obtained if a more modest 0 5 kw and a greater transit of 200 m were used then the actuation parameter is about 0 1 these power levels and durations can also be representative of vehicle acceleration to determine the relative impact of the lifting surface activation energy it is convenient to define an impact factor such that 75 e s e c e g e a c t e s e c e g 1 1 e a c t e c e g where 76 e a c t e c e g n e a c t f w r a

climb angle appears to have little impact on the actuation penalty lower hotel power parameters in other words lower hotel load and or greater wet weight cause the vehicle to experience a greater adverse impact 5 concluding remarks there are several observations from this preliminary analysis for climb glide operation of a vehicle of interest here over a reasonable operational range of hotel loads and reasonable range of net vehicle lift to drag ratios energy savings from 10 to greater than 40 can be expected if the vehicle employs a slow glide speed period followed by a high power high speed climb significant energy savings are available if higher horizontal transit speeds are desired as a result when executing a high speed climb the power requirements are similar to those required for a high speed horizontal transit which suggests that a low power energy convertor may not be needed at all all propulsive power would be available from intermittent operation of the high power convertor with this type of operation and only a single energy convertor it may be possible to free volume for additional energy storage or inclusion of drag reduction technology limit analyses were also applied to the theoretical equations in the appendices these showed that in the limit of depth excursion going to zero low hotel power heavy wet weight high hotel power light wet weight and optimum performance the theoretical equations behave in a physically reasonable manner the derivation was presented here in terms of dimensionless variable combinations making it relevant to a wide range a vehicle geometries and operational parameters some technical challenges for implementation of these benefits can be described as well the ability to actively modify the lifting surface or vehicle body lift to drag ratio without sacrificing excessive volume or actuation energy represents one such challenge one way to do this in the future might be by geometric morphing peters et al 2002 another way might entail simply using acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle to produce the appropriate lift to drag mitigation of the extra drag produced when the propulsor is not operating is another challenge for real systems possible solutions for this challenge include the possible addition of a deployable fairing that would surround the inactive propulsor with a hydrodynamically favorable shape the feathering of the propulsor so that it produces neither net thrust nor net drag or implementation of a powered glide operation similar to landing operation employed by commercial aircraft the present analysis assumes that the vehicle climbing and gliding occurs with the axis of the vehicle body parallel to the climb and glide velocity vectors figs 4 and 6 a more accurate analysis would address vehicle trim requirements an alternative operation can occur where the vehicle remains horizontal during climb and glide this may be executed solely by increasing or decreasing

23657,in this study the multiphase poroelasticity theory is used to develop a theoretical model to analyze the horizontal and vertical motion at the surface of a gassy ocean sediment layer induced by obliquely p waves the marine layer is lying on the elastic solid bedrock and modeled as porous material with finite thickness which is saturated by two compressible and viscous fluids liquid and gas the analytical solutions for the wave reflection and transmission in the coupled seawater sediment substrate system are obtained then the theoretical formulation is derived for the computation of motion amplitudes in both horizontal and vertical components the displacement amplitudes displacement ratios and amplification coefficients are examined numerically with incident angle wave frequency thickness of porous layer and saturation degree of sediment it is demonstrated that even a slight change of gas content in the porous sediment may lead to significant influence on seismic dynamics of porous sediment layer in addition apart from saturation degree this influence also depends on the incident angle wave frequency and thickness of sediment layer the study shows that saturation condition need to be carefully taken into account for the interpretation of field observations on seismic ground motions of the seabed keywords ground motion wave propagation site effect ocean sediments saturation effect 1 introduction in the past several decades the subject of wave propagation reflection and transmission in the ocean floor has attracted great attentions among researchers due to its applications such as seismology underwater acoustics and ocean engineering stoll and kan 1981 bedford and stern 1983 wu et al 1990 santos et al 1992 sharma and kumar 2011 wang et al 2013 the fundamental theory of the elastic wave propagation in fluid saturated porous media was initially introduced by biot 1956 who predicted the existence of three types of bulk waves propagating in the fluid filled porous material namely p1 wave p2 wave and s wave the additional p2 wave was observed firstly in sintered glass beads plona 1980 and then in natural air filled sand stone nagy et al 1990 based on biot s theory the transmission and reflection of bulk waves at the boundary between water and fluid saturated porous solid media gradually showed its importance from the point of view of both practical application and the theoretical research stoll and kan 1981 albert 1993 denneman et al 2002 ohkawa et al 2005 dai and kuang 2008 in most of the aforementioned studies the seabed was modeled as a homogeneous and isotropic porous half space however in natural ocean environments more often the ocean floor is covered by the marine sediment layer with finite thickness which can be considered as porous medium consisting of solid skeleton and pore fluids therefore some other researches were carried out by modeling the ocean floor as layered sediments with an underlying substrate e g kuo 1992 ainslie 1996 wang et al 2013 furthermore it has been extensively accepted that some natural sedimentary materials are not fully saturated by liquid the situation of partial saturation is a typical case for marine sediments as evidenced by field and laboratory experiments hamilton 1971 carlson et al 1985 sills et al 1991 only a few literature modeling the ocean floor as layered sediment with an underlying substrate took the unsaturation of marine sediment layer into account to date to the best of our knowledge a few investigations have been launched to analyze the seismic motion of the gassy ocean sediment layer between upper seawater and underlying elastic seabed this problem is essential for the interpretation of field observations on seismic ground motions of the seabed in addition when seismic p wave strikes at the bottom obliquely both s wave and p wave are excited in the sediment simultaneously generating both horizontal and vertical motion of the sediment layer which may play an important role around and beneath the foundations of offshore structures such as breakwater pipeline and tunnel ye 2012 ye and wang 2015 as an attempt toward this end the problem described in present paper corresponds to the p wave incident from the underlying seabed and strike at the bottom of the gassy sediment layer our procedure is formulated within the framework of the continuum theory of mixtures the theoretical formulation is presented for the computation of horizontal and vertical displacement amplitudes which can be considered as a function of saturation degree incident angle wave frequency and layer thickness numerical result shows the influence of saturation degree of the porous sediment on the angle dependent frequency dependent and thickness dependent amplitudes of displacement in horizontal and vertical directions 2 theoretical formulation 2 1 poroelastic sediment for poroelastic ocean sediment pore fluid is considered as a mixture consisting of a

respectively solving these equations yield three types of compressional waves referred to as p1 wave p2 wave and p3 wave respectively and one shear wave s wave chen et al 2011 2015 in the completely saturated case eqs 5a and 5b could be reduced to the simpler form of classic biot model chen et al 2011 the characteristics of p1 and s waves are similar to the fast compressional wave and shear wave in the biot theory in addition p2 wave is similar to the slow compressional wave and is due to the interaction between the solid and fluid phases and p3 wave only appears if a second pore fluid is present i e due to the influence of capillary pressure all these four types of waves are frequency dependent and attenuated and the influence of water saturation on each of them is different the wave speed of p1 wave is fastest while its attenuation is smallest the p3 wave by contrast propagates most slowly and decays with greatest attenuation coefficient which is several orders magnitude lager than those of p1 p2 and s waves wei and muraleetharan 2002 chen et al 2012 the p1 p2 and s waves occupy the vast majority of the wave energy in the unsaturated porous sediment therefore the propagation of p3 wave has trifling influence on the dynamic characteristics of the sediment induced by waves and is not discussed in later sections the phase velocities of p1 p2 and s waves are computed and shown in fig 1 as a function of gas saturation 1 sr the physical parameters for the gassy porous sediment are listed in table 1 the gas saturation is assumed to be not greater than 50 the frequency between 0 1 hz and 100 hz is a representative frequency band of geological exploration and seismology murphy 1982 it is shown that the velocity of p1 wave has a marked increase before the sediment reaches complete liquid saturation for s wave as expected the influence of saturation is weak the influence of air inclusion on the velocity of p 2 wave is also noticeable like p1 wave the velocity of p2 wave also increases significantly near complete saturation in the frequency range discussed in this study the wave speeds of p1 and s waves are frequency independent while the wave speed of p2 wave increases with the frequency the attenuation coefficient is defined by the imaginary part of the corresponding complex wave number and is shown in fig 2 the attenuation coefficient of s wave reaches the maximum value when the sediment is completely filled with liquid it is also noted that the attenuation of all the three bulk waves increase with frequency and that p2 wave decay much faster than p1 and s waves in the sediment 3 motion of the sediment layer 3 1 wave fields the dynamic problem of the ocean sediment layer induced by seismic waves from underlying bedrock is considered in this study the coordinate system for the problem of seismic reflection is shown in fig 3 the incident waves are chosen to be p wave our physical model comprises the overlying seawater the sandwiched layer of poroelastic sediment with a small amount of air inclusions and the underlying one phase solid seabed i e rock the upper seawater is assumed as an ideal compressible fluid half space z 0 and the underlying sediment is considered as a linear elastic solid half space z h the thickness of sandwiched sediment layer is h as shown in fig 3 z axis is assumed directed vertically upwards and the x axis is assumed along horizontal direction then the interfaces at z 0 and z h separate the overlying seawater the gassy poroelastic layer and the underlying solid half space respectively the interface along z h is in perfect contact in such a way that the fluids i e liquid and gas cannot flow from poroelastic medium to the solid substrates the boundary value problem under consideration is also shown in fig 3 an incident p wave with an angular frequency ω and an incident angle θ i propagates through the elastic bedrock half space and then impinges upon the interface z h as a consequence two reflected waves i e reflected p and s waves are generated in the underlying half space z h according to eqs 5a and 5b in the region of poroelastic layer h z 0 four transmitted bulk waves i e transmitted p1 p2 p3 and s waves from the lower interface and four reflected bulk waves i e reflected p1 p2 p3 and s waves from the upper interface are predicted to be excited furthermore as seawater is not able to withstand shear stress only one transmitted p wave is generated in the seawater z 0 the wave fields in the different regions can be conveniently expressed in terms of displacement potentials as follows i in the region of overlying seawater z 0 6a φ w a t p exp i k t p l t p x n t p z c t p t ii in the region of poroelastic sediment layer h z 0 6b φ s n 1 3

in both stresses and displacements the additional hydraulic condition at the interface z h which has been found to be critical in generating p2 wave rasolofosaon 1988 yang 1999 in the saturated porous medium is assumed as impermeable due to the difficulty to determine the fluid flow impedance across the interface between overlying water and gassy poroelastic layer wu et al 1990 the sealed pore

model of an elastic seabed with an overlying gassy porous sediment layer as shown in fig 3 is chosen for the calculating example the physical parameters for the gassy porous sediment are summarized in table 1 the overlying seawater has a bulk modulus k w 2 2 gpa and density ρ w 1000 kg m 3 lame s constants of the solid substrate are μ e 5 gpa and λ e 12 gpa and its density ρ e 2460 kg m 3 the choice of appropriate values for the various material parameters of porous medium is referred to previous papers e g wei and muraleetharan 2002 4 1 dependence on liquid saturation in order to illustrate the influence of incident angle simultaneously both the horizontal and vertical displacement amplitudes calculated from eqs 10a and 10b are normalized by the amplitude of incident p wave i e k ipe a ipe the thickness of the sediment layer h is assumed to be 50 m and the frequency of incident p wave f is 5 hz the liquid saturations are assumed to be 60 70 80 90 and 100 respectively fig 4 shows the amplitudes of horizontal and vertical components of displacements as a function of incident angle in the five cases of saturation considered the results indicate that in all cases of saturation the horizontal components of the displacement at the surface of the seabed z 0 has a value of zero at the normal incidence and increases with an increase in θ i then achieves a maximum around θ i 55 and decreases to zero at the grazing incidence the vertical components of the displacement approach maximum values at normal incidence then continuously decrease to zero at the grazing incidence for both horizontal and vertical components a significant difference is noticed between the cases of partial and full saturation as shown in the figure lower saturation causes larger horizontal component of displacements by contrast the influence of saturation change on the vertical components in the case of incomplete saturation is insignificant when the incident angle is below θ i 40 incomplete saturation causes larger vertical components of displacement fig 5 presents the results for the ratios of horizontal to vertical components i e u x u z at the surface z 0 and bottom z h of gassy sediment layer respectively five different cases of saturation are also considered it is indicated that even a slight decrease of complete saturation may cause significant change on these ratios over the entire range of incident angles and the difference between these ratios increases with the incident angle for the displacement ratios at the surface z 0 of the sediment layer the ratio decreases with saturation on the contrary the ratio at the bottom z h of sediment layer increases with saturation the effect of saturation on angle dependent amplification coefficients of displacements is illustrated in fig 6 the amplification coefficient of displacement is defined by ratio of the displacement amplitude on the top of porous sediment layer to that on its bottom where the incident p waves strike on it is noted that in this case both the horizontal and vertical components of the displacement on the surface the sediment layer are calculated to be larger than the corresponding components on its bottom in fig 6a it is shown that the performance of amplification of horizontal displacement is more obvious for the incomplete saturation cases moreover the amplification coefficient of horizontal displacement decreases with saturation and increases with the increasing incident angle on the other hand for the vertical displacement fig 6b illustrates a significant difference between the cases of partial and full saturation when the sediment is not fully saturated the influence of incident angle on the vertical amplification coefficient is insignificant by comparing the results of horizontal direction for the fully saturation the amplification coefficient of vertical displacement also increase with incident angle just like that of horizontal displacement as shown in fig 6a 4 2 dependence on frequency as discussed in section 2 all types of bulk waves in porous sediment are frequency dependent implying the possibility of frequency influences on the horizontal and vertical motion of sediment layer it is also worth noting that when the excitation frequency exceeds a certain transition frequency the viscous coupling coefficient becomes frequency dependent and the frequency correction should be introduced lo et al 2007 chen et al 2015 the range of wave excitation frequency in this paper is much smaller than the transition frequency and thus the effect of the frequency correction factor can be negligible in this section this frequency dependency will be examined and f is set to be 0 1 hz 1 hz 10 hz and 100 hz respectively fig 7 illustrates the effect of frequency on angle dependent amplitudes of horizontal and vertical displacement at the surface of sediment layer it is shown that both the horizontal and vertical displacements are more likely to be affected by the high frequency say over 10 hz as shown as depicted in fig 8 a when the frequency is not more than 10 hz the displacement ratios at the surface z 0 increase with incident angle however as the frequency becomes higher like 100 hz the ratio reaches the peak around θ i 30 and then has a slight decrease before reaching the gracing angle similar behavior is observed for the displacement ratio at the bottom of the sediment layer z h as shown in fig 8b higher frequency causes greater influence on the displacement ratios on the bottom of the layer especially in the range of high incident angles above θ i 50 fig 9 illustrates the effect of frequency on amplification coefficients of horizontal and vertical displacements it is shown that in the low frequency range such as 0 1 hz and 1 hz the amplification coefficients of both horizontal and vertical displacements are almost independent on incident angle moreover when the frequency is 0 1 hz amplification coefficient equals to 1 implying that the displacement amplitude on the surface of the sediment layer is equal to the displacement of its bottom in horizontal and vertical directions as the frequency increases the amplification coefficients of both horizontal and vertical displacement become more dependent on the incident angle 4 3 dependence on layer thickness in this section the influence of the thickness of overlying sediment on the horizontal and vertical motion of the sediment layer is discussed to analyze the effect of layer thickness clearly both obliquely incidence and normal incidence are considered the frequency is respectively postulated to be 1 hz 5 hz and 10 hz and the layer thickness is assumed to not exceed 200 m the liquid saturation of the porous layer sr is set to be 80 the reflection and transition phenomenon of bulk waves in the porous sediment layer has close correlation with wavelengths of these bulk waves the oscillation of displacement results from the resonant response of the p and s waves in the porous layer when the incident wave is not perpendicular to the interface there is a transmitted s wave other than the three types of transmitted p wave exist in the gassy porous layer chen et al 2015 as shown in fig 10 in the case of obliquely incidence θ i 30 the motion of the porous sediment layer is simultaneously influenced by both p waves and s waves in the sediment and hence its motion becomes indeterminate thus the displacement amplitudes are shown to fluctuate with the increase of thickness irregularly the effect of frequency on the variation of displacement amplitude with h can also be revealed from fig 10 with the increasing of frequency i e decreasing of wavelength the fluctuation of the displacement amplitude with h becomes more frequent similarly at different frequencies the fluctuations of the displacement ratios in fig 11 and the amplification coefficients in fig 12 with layer thickness are less intensive when the frequency is low in the case of normal incidence θ i 0 the amplitudes of vertical displacement at z 0 as a function of layer thickness h for three different frequencies are shown in fig 13 no horizontal displacement component is generated in the case of normal incidence of p waves and the amplitudes of vertical displacement fluctuate periodically with layer thickness when the incident p wave strikes at the interface z h vertically from the substrate only three types of p waves i e p1 wave p2 wave and p3 wave are generated in the gassy porous layer chen et al 2015 moreover due to the high damping of the p2 and p3 waves the p1wave can be viewed as the major factor affecting the layer motion in this low frequency range for the case of sr 80 the phase speed of p1 wave in porous layer is found to be frequency independent and equals to 1410 m s therefore the wavelengths of the p1 wave corresponding to 5 hz and 10 hz are nearly 282 m and 141 m respectively meanwhile fig 13 shows that the change circle of displacement amplitude in 5 hz and 10 hz approximate to 141 m and 70 5 m namely l f 10hz in fig 13 respectively this indicates that at the normal incidence the change circle of displacement amplitude with respect to the thickness of the gassy poroelastic layer is equal to half of the wavelength of the p1 wave the similar trend is also observed for the amplification coefficients of the vertical displacement in fig 14 5 conclusions the two dimensional motion of a gassy poroelastic layer of ocean sediment with underlying elastic bedrock is investigated for the case of p wave incidence the theoretical formulation for the numerical computation is performed based on the multiphase continuum theory chen et al 2011 provided that the physical constraints imposed by the continuity of stress and displacement at the upper and lower interfaces are satisfied based on the expression of the amplitude of different reflected and transmitted waves the displacements in vertical and horizontal directions are analytically derived respectively the motion in horizontal and vertical directions is studied in forms of displacement amplitudes displacement ratios and amplification coefficients a numerical study is then carried out to illustrate the dependence of the motion on the incident angle wave frequency layer thickness and liquid saturation of sandwiched porous layer the numerical results indicate that incident angle renders significant but different influences on the motion of the sediment layer in horizontal and vertical directions it is also worth noting that even if a small amount of gas exists in the porous sediment its influence on displacement amplitudes displacement ratios as well as the amplification coefficients is substantial apart from liquid saturation this influence also depends on wave frequency and thickness of sediment layer the result obtained in current study implies that the gas effect need to be considered carefully and it could provide useful insight towards a better interpretation of field observations at the gassy ocean floor acknowledgements the authors would like to

23657,in this study the multiphase poroelasticity theory is used to develop a theoretical model to analyze the horizontal and vertical motion at the surface of a gassy ocean sediment layer induced by obliquely p waves the marine layer is lying on the elastic solid bedrock and modeled as porous material with finite thickness which is saturated by two compressible and viscous fluids liquid and gas the analytical solutions for the wave reflection and transmission in the coupled seawater sediment substrate system are obtained then the theoretical formulation is derived for the computation of motion amplitudes in both horizontal and vertical components the displacement amplitudes displacement ratios and amplification coefficients are examined numerically with incident angle wave frequency thickness of porous layer and saturation degree of sediment it is demonstrated that even a slight change of gas content in the porous sediment may lead to significant influence on seismic dynamics of porous sediment layer in addition apart from saturation degree this influence also depends on the incident angle wave frequency and thickness of sediment layer the study shows that saturation condition need to be carefully taken into account for the interpretation of field observations on seismic ground motions of the seabed keywords ground motion wave propagation site effect ocean sediments saturation effect 1 introduction in the past several decades the subject of wave propagation reflection and transmission in the ocean floor has attracted great attentions among researchers due to its applications such as seismology underwater acoustics and ocean engineering stoll and kan 1981 bedford and stern 1983 wu et al 1990 santos et al 1992 sharma and kumar 2011 wang et al 2013 the fundamental theory of the elastic wave propagation in fluid saturated porous media was initially introduced by biot 1956 who predicted the existence of three types of bulk waves propagating in the fluid filled porous material namely p1 wave p2 wave and s wave the additional p2 wave was observed firstly in sintered glass beads plona 1980 and then in natural air filled sand stone nagy et al 1990 based on biot s theory the transmission and reflection of bulk waves at the boundary between water and fluid saturated porous solid media gradually showed its importance from the point of view of both practical application and the theoretical research stoll and kan 1981 albert 1993 denneman et al 2002 ohkawa et al 2005 dai and kuang 2008 in most of the aforementioned studies the seabed was modeled as a homogeneous and isotropic porous half space however in natural ocean environments more often the ocean floor is covered by the marine sediment layer with finite thickness which can be considered as porous medium consisting of solid skeleton and pore fluids therefore some other researches were carried out by modeling the ocean floor as layered sediments with an underlying substrate e g kuo 1992 ainslie 1996 wang et al 2013 furthermore it has been extensively accepted that some natural sedimentary materials are not fully saturated by liquid the situation of partial saturation is a typical case for marine sediments as evidenced by field and laboratory experiments hamilton 1971 carlson et al 1985 sills et al 1991 only a few literature modeling the ocean floor as layered sediment with an underlying substrate took the unsaturation of marine sediment layer into account to date to the best of our knowledge a few investigations have been launched to analyze the seismic motion of the gassy ocean sediment layer between upper seawater and underlying elastic seabed this problem is essential for the interpretation of field observations on seismic ground motions of the seabed in addition when seismic p wave strikes at the bottom obliquely both s wave and p wave are excited in the sediment simultaneously generating both horizontal and vertical motion of the sediment layer which may play an important role around and beneath the foundations of offshore structures such as breakwater pipeline and tunnel ye 2012 ye and wang 2015 as an attempt toward this end the problem described in present paper corresponds to the p wave incident from the underlying seabed and strike at the bottom of the gassy sediment layer our procedure is formulated within the framework of the continuum theory of mixtures the theoretical formulation is presented for the computation of horizontal and vertical displacement amplitudes which can be considered as a function of saturation degree incident angle wave frequency and layer thickness numerical result shows the influence of saturation degree of the porous sediment on the angle dependent frequency dependent and thickness dependent amplitudes of displacement in horizontal and vertical directions 2 theoretical formulation 2 1 poroelastic sediment for poroelastic ocean sediment pore fluid is considered as a mixture consisting of a

respectively solving these equations yield three types of compressional waves referred to as p1 wave p2 wave and p3 wave respectively and one shear wave s wave chen et al 2011 2015 in the completely saturated case eqs 5a and 5b could be reduced to the simpler form of classic biot model chen et al 2011 the characteristics of p1 and s waves are similar to the fast compressional wave and shear wave in the biot theory in addition p2 wave is similar to the slow compressional wave and is due to the interaction between the solid and fluid phases and p3 wave only appears if a second pore fluid is present i e due to the influence of capillary pressure all these four types of waves are frequency dependent and attenuated and the influence of water saturation on each of them is different the wave speed of p1 wave is fastest while its attenuation is smallest the p3 wave by contrast propagates most slowly and decays with greatest attenuation coefficient which is several orders magnitude lager than those of p1 p2 and s waves wei and muraleetharan 2002 chen et al 2012 the p1 p2 and s waves occupy the vast majority of the wave energy in the unsaturated porous sediment therefore the propagation of p3 wave has trifling influence on the dynamic characteristics of the sediment induced by waves and is not discussed in later sections the phase velocities of p1 p2 and s waves are computed and shown in fig 1 as a function of gas saturation 1 sr the physical parameters for the gassy porous sediment are listed in table 1 the gas saturation is assumed to be not greater than 50 the frequency between 0 1 hz and 100 hz is a representative frequency band of geological exploration and seismology murphy 1982 it is shown that the velocity of p1 wave has a marked increase before the sediment reaches complete liquid saturation for s wave as expected the influence of saturation is weak the influence of air inclusion on the velocity of p 2 wave is also noticeable like p1 wave the velocity of p2 wave also increases significantly near complete saturation in the frequency range discussed in this study the wave speeds of p1 and s waves are frequency independent while the wave speed of p2 wave increases with the frequency the attenuation coefficient is defined by the imaginary part of the corresponding complex wave number and is shown in fig 2 the attenuation coefficient of s wave reaches the maximum value when the sediment is completely filled with liquid it is also noted that the attenuation of all the three bulk waves increase with frequency and that p2 wave decay much faster than p1 and s waves in the sediment 3 motion of the sediment layer 3 1 wave fields the dynamic problem of the ocean sediment layer induced by seismic waves from underlying bedrock is considered in this study the coordinate system for the problem of seismic reflection is shown in fig 3 the incident waves are chosen to be p wave our physical model comprises the overlying seawater the sandwiched layer of poroelastic sediment with a small amount of air inclusions and the underlying one phase solid seabed i e rock the upper seawater is assumed as an ideal compressible fluid half space z 0 and the underlying sediment is considered as a linear elastic solid half space z h the thickness of sandwiched sediment layer is h as shown in fig 3 z axis is assumed directed vertically upwards and the x axis is assumed along horizontal direction then the interfaces at z 0 and z h separate the overlying seawater the gassy poroelastic layer and the underlying solid half space respectively the interface along z h is in perfect contact in such a way that the fluids i e liquid and gas cannot flow from poroelastic medium to the solid substrates the boundary value problem under consideration is also shown in fig 3 an incident p wave with an angular frequency ω and an incident angle θ i propagates through the elastic bedrock half space and then impinges upon the interface z h as a consequence two reflected waves i e reflected p and s waves are generated in the underlying half space z h according to eqs 5a and 5b in the region of poroelastic layer h z 0 four transmitted bulk waves i e transmitted p1 p2 p3 and s waves from the lower interface and four reflected bulk waves i e reflected p1 p2 p3 and s waves from the upper interface are predicted to be excited furthermore as seawater is not able to withstand shear stress only one transmitted p wave is generated in the seawater z 0 the wave fields in the different regions can be conveniently expressed in

ratios of potentials related to solid and two pore fluids chen et al 2011 2012 3 2 boundary conditions the interface between porous sediment and single phase substrate is considered to be continuous in both stresses and displacements the additional hydraulic condition at the interface z h which has been found to be critical in generating p2 wave rasolofosaon 1988 yang 1999 in the saturated porous medium is assumed as impermeable due to the difficulty to determine the fluid flow impedance across the interface between overlying water and gassy poroelastic layer wu et al 1990 the sealed pore

model of an elastic seabed with an overlying gassy porous sediment layer as shown in fig 3 is chosen for the calculating example the physical parameters for the gassy porous sediment are summarized in table 1 the overlying seawater has a bulk modulus k w 2 2 gpa and density ρ w 1000 kg m 3 lame s constants of the solid substrate are μ e 5 gpa and λ e 12 gpa and its density ρ e 2460 kg m 3 the choice of appropriate values for the various material parameters of porous medium is referred to previous papers e g wei and muraleetharan 2002 4 1 dependence on liquid saturation in order to illustrate the influence of incident angle simultaneously both the horizontal and vertical displacement amplitudes calculated from eqs 10a and 10b are normalized by the amplitude of incident p wave i e k ipe a ipe the thickness of the sediment layer h is assumed to be 50 m and the frequency of incident p wave f is 5 hz the liquid saturations are assumed to be 60 70 80 90 and 100 respectively fig 4 shows the amplitudes of horizontal and vertical components of displacements as a function of incident angle in the five cases of saturation considered the results indicate that in all cases of saturation the horizontal components of the displacement at the surface of the seabed z 0 has a value of zero at the normal incidence and increases with an increase in θ i then achieves a maximum around θ i 55 and decreases to zero at the grazing incidence the vertical components of the displacement approach maximum values at normal incidence then continuously decrease to zero at the grazing incidence for both horizontal and vertical components a significant difference is noticed between the cases of partial and full saturation as shown in the figure lower saturation causes larger horizontal component of displacements by contrast the influence of saturation change on the vertical components in the case of incomplete saturation is insignificant when the incident angle is below θ i 40 incomplete saturation causes larger vertical components of displacement fig 5 presents the results for the ratios of horizontal to vertical components i e u x u z at the surface z 0 and bottom z h of gassy sediment layer respectively five different cases of saturation are also considered it is indicated that even a slight decrease of complete saturation may cause significant change on these ratios over the entire range of incident angles and the difference between these ratios increases with the incident angle for the displacement ratios at the surface z 0 of the sediment layer the ratio decreases with saturation on the contrary the ratio at the bottom z h of sediment layer increases with saturation the effect of saturation on angle dependent amplification coefficients of displacements is illustrated in fig 6 the amplification coefficient of displacement is defined by ratio of the displacement amplitude on the top of porous sediment layer to that on its bottom where the incident p waves strike on it is noted that in this case both the horizontal and vertical components of the displacement on the surface the sediment layer are calculated to be larger than the corresponding components on its bottom in fig 6a it is shown that the performance of amplification of horizontal displacement is more obvious for the incomplete saturation cases moreover the amplification coefficient of horizontal displacement decreases with saturation and increases with the increasing incident angle on the other hand for the vertical displacement fig 6b illustrates a significant difference between the cases of partial and full saturation when the sediment is not fully saturated the influence of incident angle on the vertical amplification coefficient is insignificant by comparing the results of horizontal direction for the fully saturation the amplification coefficient of vertical displacement also increase with incident angle just like that of horizontal displacement as shown in fig 6a 4 2 dependence on frequency as discussed in section 2 all types of bulk waves in porous sediment are frequency dependent implying the possibility of frequency influences on the horizontal and vertical motion of sediment layer it is also worth noting that when the excitation frequency exceeds a certain transition frequency the viscous coupling coefficient becomes frequency dependent and the frequency correction should be introduced lo et al 2007 chen et al 2015 the range of wave excitation frequency in this paper is much smaller than the transition frequency and thus the effect of the frequency correction factor can be negligible in this section this frequency dependency will be examined and f is set to be 0 1 hz 1 hz 10 hz and 100 hz respectively fig 7 illustrates the effect of frequency on angle dependent amplitudes of horizontal and vertical displacement at the surface of sediment layer it is shown that both the horizontal and vertical displacements are more likely to be affected by the high frequency say over 10 hz as shown as depicted in fig 8 a when the frequency is not more than 10 hz the displacement ratios at the surface z 0 increase with incident angle however as the frequency becomes higher like 100 hz the ratio reaches the peak around θ i 30 and then has a slight decrease before reaching the gracing angle similar behavior is observed for the displacement ratio at the bottom of the sediment layer z h as shown in fig 8b higher frequency causes greater influence on the displacement ratios on the bottom of the layer especially in the range of high incident angles above θ i 50 fig 9 illustrates the effect of frequency on amplification coefficients of horizontal and vertical displacements it is shown that in the low frequency range such as 0 1 hz and 1 hz the amplification coefficients of both horizontal and vertical displacements are almost independent on incident angle moreover when the frequency is 0 1 hz amplification coefficient equals to 1 implying that the displacement amplitude on the surface of the sediment layer is equal to the displacement of its bottom in horizontal and vertical directions as the frequency increases the amplification coefficients of both horizontal and vertical displacement become more dependent on the incident angle 4 3 dependence on layer thickness in this section the influence of the thickness of overlying sediment on the horizontal and vertical motion of the sediment layer is discussed to analyze the effect of layer thickness clearly both obliquely incidence and normal incidence are considered the frequency is respectively postulated to be 1 hz 5 hz and 10 hz and the layer thickness is assumed to not exceed 200 m the liquid saturation of the porous layer sr is set to be 80 the reflection and transition phenomenon of bulk waves in the porous sediment layer has close correlation with wavelengths of these bulk waves the oscillation of displacement results from the resonant response of the p and s waves in the porous layer when the incident wave is not perpendicular to the interface there is a transmitted s wave other than the three types of transmitted p wave exist in the gassy porous layer chen et al 2015 as shown in fig 10 in the case of obliquely incidence θ i 30 the motion of the porous sediment layer is simultaneously influenced by both p waves and s waves in the sediment and hence its motion becomes indeterminate thus the displacement amplitudes are shown to fluctuate with the increase of thickness irregularly the effect of frequency on the variation of displacement amplitude with h can also be revealed from fig 10 with the increasing of frequency i e decreasing of wavelength the fluctuation of the displacement amplitude with h becomes more frequent similarly at different frequencies the fluctuations of the displacement ratios in fig 11 and the amplification coefficients in fig 12 with layer thickness are less intensive when the frequency is low in the case of normal incidence θ i 0 the amplitudes of vertical displacement at z 0 as a function of layer thickness h for three different frequencies are shown in fig 13 no horizontal displacement component is generated in the case of normal incidence of p waves and the amplitudes of vertical displacement fluctuate periodically with layer thickness when the incident p wave strikes at the interface z h vertically from the substrate only three types of p waves i e p1 wave p2 wave and p3 wave are generated in the gassy porous layer chen et al 2015 moreover due to the high damping of the p2 and p3 waves the p1wave can be viewed as the major factor affecting the layer motion in this low frequency range for the case of sr 80 the phase speed of p1 wave in porous layer is found to be frequency independent and equals to 1410 m s therefore the wavelengths of the p1 wave corresponding to 5 hz and 10 hz are nearly 282 m and 141 m respectively meanwhile fig 13 shows that the change circle of displacement amplitude in 5 hz and 10 hz approximate to 141 m and 70 5 m namely l f 10hz in fig 13 respectively this indicates that at the normal incidence the change circle of displacement amplitude with respect to the thickness of the gassy poroelastic layer is equal to half of the wavelength of the p1 wave the similar trend is also observed for the amplification coefficients of the vertical displacement in fig 14 5 conclusions the two dimensional motion of a gassy poroelastic layer of ocean sediment with underlying elastic bedrock is investigated for the case of p wave incidence the theoretical formulation for the numerical computation is performed based on the multiphase continuum theory chen et al 2011 provided that the physical constraints imposed by the continuity of stress and displacement at the upper and lower interfaces are satisfied based on the expression of the amplitude of different reflected and transmitted waves the displacements in vertical and horizontal directions are analytically derived respectively the motion in horizontal and vertical directions is studied in forms of displacement amplitudes displacement ratios and amplification coefficients a numerical study is then carried out to illustrate the dependence of the motion on the incident angle wave frequency layer thickness and liquid saturation of sandwiched porous layer the numerical results indicate that incident angle renders significant but different influences on the motion of the sediment layer in horizontal and vertical directions it is also worth noting that even if a small amount of gas exists in the porous sediment its influence on displacement amplitudes displacement ratios as well as the amplification coefficients is substantial apart from liquid saturation this influence also depends on wave frequency and thickness of sediment layer the result obtained in current study implies that the gas effect need to be considered carefully and it could provide useful insight towards a better interpretation of field observations at the gassy ocean floor acknowledgements the authors would like to

chen proposed a neat real time nrt it can address the asynchronous nature of lbl measurements as well as model nonlinearities because the lbl positioning cycle in chens paper is short it almost has not error between the time and the location of the signal sent compared to the signal received so it is suitable for small auvs in harbor environments rather than larger scope and because the influence of water flow the yaw error is large chen et al 2016 in an effort to resolve the problems in lbl positioning systems we constructed an integrated navigation model based on an extended kalman filter ekf the integrated navigation model uses distance and velocity as observations based on which it updates the position information of the target when receiving the distance information of any number of beacons the solution model can guarantee a wide ranging and accurate navigation system below we first introduce the basic principle of lbl and its shortcomings we then propose an ekf model based on multi beacon ranging tailored to the shortcomings of the lbl system two methods are then established for treating measurement data to reduce the positioning error and filtering divergence caused by outliers we verify the feasibility of this approach by experimental data processing then discuss the accuracy of the proposed navigation system 2 navigation application of lbl positioning system the lbl positioning system has a variety of solution models the most common of which is the spherical intersection model the model uses distance information as the measurement data and underwater vessel navigation problems are traditionally solved via the least square method cao et al 2017 when the lbl is positioned for the underwater vehicles the interrogation signal is sent periodically via a ranging unit mounted on the vehicle after receiving the response signal of all the sound beacons the distance between the ranging unit and each sound beacon is obtained according to the two way propagation delay and the speed of sound the position of the acoustic beacon is then calculated according to the geographical coordinates of the acoustic beacon however underwater vehicles are usually in motion as shown in fig 1 when the underwater vehicle is in the signal transmission to response process the ranging unit in the signal transmission and the reception time coordinates are different thus the underwater vehicle to sound beacon and sound beacon to underwater vehicle corresponding to the propagation time are not the same the time and position of the different beacon response signals received are different because the distance between the target and each beacon is different the conventional lbl positioning model does not account for the influence of the target motion and the distance values corresponding to half of the propagation delay are taken as the observed distance information values the location solution is obtained then the actual coordinates of the target are obtained only detweiler c leonard j and author s detweiler and leonard 2006 proposed a solution to the above problem however when working in the deep sea for any long term period the battery life and the coherence of the beacon clock offset affect the continuity and effectiveness of the system the dynamic positioning error is even larger if the time measurement precision is insufficient in this study we developed an ekf model based on multi beacon ranging the motion model is established based on the analysis of the target motion state the moving state of the target such as speed heading and attitude is integrated with the acoustic positioning data this reduces the influence of target motion on the positioning system is reduced the conventional kalman filter is the minimum mean square error estimate which applies to the target motion model and linear gaussian case of the observed model however in the navigation system the state equations and measurement equations are often nonlinear which renders conventional kalman filtering no longer applicable the ekf is suitable for nonlinear weak estimation objects wang and wang 2012 and the unscented kalman filter is suitable for nonlinear strong estimation objects khairnar et al 2007 auvs move at uniform and low speed auv s acceleration is very slow and its mobility is weak so the system motion model established with auv is simple and the measurement information of auv is single for these reason ekf can be used to meet system requirements allotta et al 2016b modalavalasa et al 2015 3 ekf model based on multi beacon distance measurement 3 1 introduction to ekf for a nonlinear system the system state equation and measurement equation are qin et al 2012 1 x k f x k 1 k 1 g k 1 w k 1 2 z k h x k k v k where f is an n dimensional nonlinear vector functions h is an m dimensional nonlinear vector function w k is the r dimensional random system noise distribution sequence and v k is the m dimensional measurement system noise sequence we can ignore higher order terms above the first order based on taylor expansion of the state equation and measurement equation for the nonlinear system which allows the use the linearized equation approximation nonlinear function this yields the following formula 3 x k f x k k 1 x ˆ k f x k k 1 x k 1 t x ˆ k δ x k g k 1 w k 1 4 z k h x k k x ˆ k h x

k of the state variable at time to be recursively determined based on the measured value z k at time k 3 2 modeling and construction of model based on ekf auvs and other underwater vehicles usually have highly precise measuring facilities in our subsequent calculations the depth of information is considered a known quantity and we only consider the target in the horizontal state of motion common motion models include the cv model ca model singer model and current statistical model underwater vehicles are characterized by weak maneuverability of linear motion slow acceleration and small slow turning motions the cv model has weak motor tracking ability and insufficient accuracy the ca and singer models have appropriate parameters and decent accuracy and are superior to the current statistical model ji 2014 the ca model allows easier selection of filter parameters than the singer model so we chose the ca model as our auv motion model the range information obtained from the range unit and the speed information obtained from the auv are utilized as measurement information according to the ekf theory described in section 3 1 the system state eq 5 and system measurement eq 6 can be obtained 5 x k φ k k 1 x k γ k 1 w k 1 x k v x k a x k y k v y k a y k 1 t t 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 t 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 t t 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 t 0 0 0 0 0 1 x k 1 v x k 1 a x k 1 y k 1 v y k 1 a y k 1 t

system it is assumed that the overall duty cycle t s of the system is n seconds and that the kalman filter system recursive cycle t k is common for t k 1 s the ranging unit also takes t s as the period and receives the synchronization signal every n seconds one time then sends the interrogation signal a different number of response signals are received in one or more kalman filter cycles the kalman filter state update is run when no response signal is received or a different number of response signals are received each kalman filter cycle has the following workflow 1 state the one step

algorithm and traditional lbl locating positioning accuracy is mainly affected by random error and system error the size of the random error determines the target positioning accuracy the size of the system error determines the size of the target deviation from the true value i e target positioning accuracy han et al 2015 we ran a simulation to analyze the positioning accuracy only considering the impact of random errors in the simulated navigation algorithm it is necessary to analyze the influence of random measurement error on navigation accuracy therefore it is necessary to add gaussian white noise to the distance information of the acoustic beacon and the velocity information of the carrier to represent random error in the system we established consistent test conditions then compared different navigation system performance parameters after several monte carlo statistics runs first we assume that three beacons are placed at 1000 0 1000 0 0 1732 and the depth is 2000 m forming the equilateral triangular array of the baseline we set a target set 0 800 as the center a radius of 100 m and a fixed navigation trajectory depth to simulate the auv and other underwater vehicles in the resource exploration or submarine map mapping low speed movement the horizontal coordinate of the target starting point is 100 801 the depth is 1800 m the speed is 1 m s and the navigation time is 628 s the relative position of the reference beacon and the target is shown in fig 2 a see fig 3 we assume that the period of the auv navigation system is t a u v 8 s the period of the kalman filter is t k 1 s and the number of monte carlo tests is n m c 1000 the range unit uses the distance value corresponding to a one way delay as the distance information measurement value the distance measurement error is also gaussian white noise with mean value of 0 and standard deviation is 1 m the speed measurement error is gaussian white noise with a mean value of 0 and standard deviation of σ v 0 1 m s the initial errors in the horizontal plane are δ x 10 m and δ y 10 m the multi beacon combination navigation algorithm and traditional lbl positioning level error were compared as shown in fig 2 b under the simulation conditions the lbl positioning average error is 1 09 m the maximum positioning error is 1 10 m the minimum positioning error is 0 97 m the three beacon assisted ekf localization algorithm achieved five positioning periods decreased the error from 14 m to 1 01 m the average positioning error is 0 9 m the maximum positioning error is 1 06 m the minimum positioning error is 0 78 m before reaching the steady state the three beacon combination navigation algorithm is about 10 higher than that of lbl 4 experimental results we conducted an integrated lake navigation experiment in songhua lake jilin province china in september of 2015 to verify the reliability of the proposed method the average water depth of the lake during the experiment was about 45 m the experimental conditions included the installation of the test equipment calibration integrated navigation system accuracy testing and equipment recovery the test ship was equipped with an ixblue phins inertial navigation system and rdi dvl doppler log nominal precision of 0 3 v 0 002 m s to simulate an auv underwater navigation device the speed information obtained by the rdi dvl doppler log was used as the measurement information for the ekf the lbl system consists of aramses range unit and a series of four underwater acoustic beacons to anchor the sinker acoustic beacon float ball soft rope floating ball setup on the lake the distance information obtained from the ramses ranging unit at the water surface was used as the measurement information for the ekf leica gps1200 mobile station antenna installed above the lbl transponder ranging unit and set in rtk mode nominal accuracy of 0 02 m the output can be used as a reference for the assessment of the true value of the positioning error of navigation system we used a box in calibration procedure in which the survey ship travels around a circle centered on the beacon the radius of the circle is equal to the beacons deployment depth zhang et al 2016 the coordinates of beacon 1 beacon 2 beacon 3 and beacon 4 were calibrated at 1 m accuracy on the round track shown in fig 4 a the calibration accuracy exceeds the meter level and is close to the gps error so it can be used as a true distance value by gps inverse solution the distance between the measured value and the true distance from the gps inverse solution is shown in fig 4 b the measurement distance error is shown in fig 4 c assuming that the horizontal direction has a 10 m 10 m position error fig 5 a shows the track comparison chart fig 5 b shows the horizontal positioning error comparison chart as shown in fig 5 b the lbl positioning error can reach up to 20 m and the error is relatively large nominal positioning accuracy is 1 m in the accurate calibration conditions the error of the ranging information greatly affects the positioning accuracy of the navigation system this is the reason for the large baseline misalignment error as shown in fig 4 c the time measurement error in our experiment was also relatively large up to 15 m or so the measurement data contains outliers which result in a large positioning error fig 5 b we preprocessed the measurement information to reduce the positioning error and filter divergence caused by the outliers we first ran an outlier elimination for velocity information auv mobility as mentioned above is rather weak the auv is not efficiently mobile and accelerates slowly at a constant rate of constant speed operation the rate has a fixed value near the jitter outliers are commonly generated in the transmission process which yields wrong values the continuous observation points of the velocity information can be regarded as continuous changes then combined with the statistical model to exploit the rationality of the data to eliminate outliers liu and li 2004 we used a least square extrapolation method with limited trust to eliminate outliers in the velocity information assuming that the error of the velocity information obeys the gaussian distribution the velocity information of the four moments before the current target time is v k 1 v k 2 v k 3 and v k 4 respectively the degree of trust is n n 4 combined with the velocity history information the least square algorithm can be used to estimate the speed of the next moment 9 v ˆ k v k 1 1 2 v k 2 v k 1 assuming that the velocity measurement at time k is v k v k is satisfied under the following conditions 1 when v k v ˆ k δ v k is accepted 2 when v k v ˆ k δ is the outliers v k is removed and use v ˆ k replace with v k 3 if the number of consecutive accepted values exceeds the trust degree n the filter is re established we obtained distance information according to the propagation delay of the underwater acoustic signal the broadband coding signal effectively suppresses the random error caused by the low resolution of the time measurement which can safeguard the stability and reliability of the system however the underwater acoustic environment is extremely complex the signal is susceptible to environmental effects such as water surface seabed reflection and scattering elements such as surface submarine reflection and scattering cause multi channel signal interference and multi beacon signal superposition the signal cannot be detected effectively when there is consistent and strong sound source interference in the band and a broadband signal system cannot fully resolve this problem gross error data generally does not obey any fixed law it is easy to identify gross error data when there is substantial deviation from the true value due to detection invalidity or error conversely small scale gross error caused by multi effects is difficult to identify and does not allow the engineer to determine the difference between the estimated values of multi effects it can even render the entire system model completely inaccurate it is crucial to remove outliers from the distance information due to its gross errors in both large and small order distributions in the kalman filter system the covariance matrix describes the joint variance distribution of each state quantity the one step state estimation combined with the covariance estimate can be used to estimate the outliers in the distance information wang 2013a b when the system is in k time the state estimation matrix x ˆ k k 1 and covariance estimation matrix p k k 1 can be obtained according to the state update matrix x ˆ k 1 and covariance matrix p k 1 at the last moment in these two matrices there are estimates of the horizontal position and estimated variance x k y k σ x x 2 and σ y y 2 respectively if it is assumed that the coordinate of the acoustic beacon position is x i y i i 1 2 3 it is possible to obtain the estimated value r ˆ i k of the distance information for each beacon in only two dimensions thus we can define an estimate interval with a center r ˆ i k and a width of 2 δ r σ where δ r σ satisfies eq 11 if the measured value of distance information r i k obtained by the beacon i at k time does not fall within the estimation interval r ˆ i k δ r σ r ˆ i k δ r σ it is regarded as an outlier 10 r ˆ i k x k x i 2 y k y i 2 11 δ r σ σ x x 2 σ y y 2 as shown in fig 5 a and b if there is insufficient distance information the lbl navigation system cannot obtain positioning solutions for a portion of the running time however the multi beacon integrated navigation system can update the target location results when it receives any amount of distance information consider the pretreatment of the ranging data to remove outlying values the error of the beacon ranging information after data preprocessing is shown in fig 6 after pretreatment the distance error is significantly higher than the distance error shown in fig 4 c the maximum error changed from 15 m to 6 5 m the navigation level positioning error of the multi beacon system as shown in fig 5 a significantly improved when the ranging information was not preprocessed fig 5 b compared to the traditional lbl the multi beacon integrated navigation and positioning system achieves faster convergence the average positioning error is 2 4 m the maximum positioning error is 3 8 m the minimum positioning error is 0 2 m and real time target tracking to provide stable high precision location information we also design straight line track the coordinates of beacon 1 beacon 2 beacon 3 and beacon 4 were calibrated at 1 m accuracy on the round track shown in fig 7 a the distance between the measured value and the true distance from the gps inverse solution is shown in fig 7 b the measurement distance error is shown in fig 7 c assuming that the horizontal direction has a 10 m 10 m position error fig 7 d shows the horizontal positioning error under the straight line track the average positioning error is 1 1 m the maximum positioning error is 1 4 m the minimum positioning error is 0 3 m 5 conclusion the lbl positioning system is not well suited to auvs as it ignores the influence of underwater vehicle motion this creates a problem in which the signals are sent and received at different times at different locations which degrades the positioning accuracy and real time positioning capability this paper presents an integrated navigation algorithm based on multi beacon ranging information we constructed an integrated navigation solution model based on ekf which uses distance and velocity as measurement information when the distance information is not received the position information is updated by dead reckoning when the ranging information is received position correction is performed in real time target positioning at a high rate of output can be realized effectively using the proposed technique we conducted an experiment to find that the multi beacon navigation system after data preprocessing yields faster convergence and ranging error reduction from 15 m to 6 5 m the average positioning error is 2 4 m the maximum positioning error is 3 8 m the minimum positioning error is 0 2 m the algorithm can be applied to precise positioning under low measurement accuracy beacons positioning accuracy at the meter level can also be obtained with very low ranging error acknowledgment this work was supported by the key program of the national natural science foundation of china grant no 61531012 the heilongjiang science fund for distinguished young scholars of china grant no jc2016013

system it is assumed that the overall duty cycle t s of the system is n seconds and that the kalman filter system recursive cycle t k is common for t k 1 s the ranging unit also takes t s as the period and receives the synchronization signal every n seconds one time then sends the interrogation signal a different number of response signals are received in one or more kalman filter cycles the kalman filter state update is run when no response signal is received or a different number of response signals are received each kalman filter cycle has the following workflow 1 state the one step

algorithm and traditional lbl locating positioning accuracy is mainly affected by random error and system error the size of the random error determines the target positioning accuracy the size of the system error determines the size of the target deviation from the true value i e target positioning accuracy han et al 2015 we ran a simulation to analyze the positioning accuracy only considering the impact of random errors in the simulated navigation algorithm it is necessary to analyze the influence of random measurement error on navigation accuracy therefore it is necessary to add gaussian white noise to the distance information of the acoustic beacon and the velocity information of the carrier to represent random error in the system we established consistent test conditions then compared different navigation system performance parameters after several monte carlo statistics runs first we assume that three beacons are placed at 1000 0 1000 0 0 1732 and the depth is 2000 m forming the equilateral triangular array of the baseline we set a target set 0 800 as the center a radius of 100 m and a fixed navigation trajectory depth to simulate the auv and other underwater vehicles in the resource exploration or submarine map mapping low speed movement the horizontal coordinate of the target starting point is 100 801 the depth is 1800 m the speed is 1 m s and the navigation time is 628 s the relative position of the reference beacon and the target is shown in fig 2 a see fig 3 we assume that the period of the auv navigation system is t a u v 8 s the period of the kalman filter is t k 1 s and the number of monte carlo tests is n m c 1000 the range unit uses the distance value corresponding to a one way delay as the distance information measurement value the distance measurement error is also gaussian white noise with mean value of 0 and standard deviation is 1 m the speed measurement error is gaussian white noise with a mean value of 0 and standard deviation of σ v 0 1 m s the initial errors in the horizontal plane are δ x 10 m and δ y 10 m the multi beacon combination navigation algorithm and traditional lbl positioning level error were compared as shown in fig 2 b under the simulation conditions the lbl positioning average error is 1 09 m the maximum positioning error is 1 10 m the minimum positioning error is 0 97 m the three beacon assisted ekf localization algorithm achieved five positioning periods decreased the error from 14 m to 1 01 m the average positioning error is 0 9 m the maximum positioning error is 1 06 m the minimum positioning error is 0 78 m before reaching the steady state the three beacon combination navigation algorithm is about 10 higher than that of lbl 4 experimental results we conducted an integrated lake navigation experiment in songhua lake jilin province china in september of 2015 to verify the reliability of the proposed method the average water depth of the lake during the experiment was about 45 m the experimental conditions included the installation of the test equipment calibration integrated navigation system accuracy testing and equipment recovery the test ship was equipped with an ixblue phins inertial navigation system and rdi dvl doppler log nominal precision of 0 3 v 0 002 m s to simulate an auv underwater navigation device the speed information obtained by the rdi dvl doppler log was used as the measurement information for the ekf the lbl system consists of aramses range unit and a series of four underwater acoustic beacons to anchor the sinker acoustic beacon float ball soft rope floating ball setup on the lake the distance information obtained from the ramses ranging unit at the water surface was used as the measurement information for the ekf leica gps1200 mobile station antenna installed above the lbl transponder ranging unit and set in rtk mode nominal accuracy of 0 02 m the output can be used as a reference for the assessment of the true value of the positioning error of navigation system we used a box in calibration procedure in which the survey ship travels around a circle centered on the beacon the radius of the circle is equal to the beacons deployment depth zhang et al 2016 the coordinates of beacon 1 beacon 2 beacon 3 and beacon 4 were calibrated at 1 m accuracy on the round track shown in fig 4 a the calibration accuracy exceeds the meter level and is close to the gps error so it can be used as a true distance value by gps inverse solution the distance between the measured value and the true distance from the gps inverse solution is shown in fig 4 b the measurement distance error is shown in fig 4 c assuming that the horizontal direction has a 10 m 10 m position error fig 5 a shows the track comparison chart fig 5 b shows the horizontal positioning error comparison chart as shown in fig 5 b the lbl positioning error can reach up to 20 m and the error is relatively large nominal positioning accuracy is 1 m in the accurate calibration conditions the error of the ranging information greatly affects the positioning accuracy of the navigation system this is the reason for the large baseline misalignment error as shown in fig 4 c the time measurement error in our experiment was also relatively large up to 15 m or so the measurement data contains outliers which result in a large positioning error fig 5 b we preprocessed the measurement information to reduce the positioning error and filter divergence caused by the outliers we first ran an outlier elimination for velocity information auv mobility as mentioned above is rather weak the auv is not efficiently mobile and accelerates slowly at a constant rate of constant speed operation the rate has a fixed value near the jitter outliers are commonly generated in the transmission process which yields wrong values the continuous observation points of the velocity information can be regarded as continuous changes then combined with the statistical model to exploit the rationality of the data to eliminate outliers liu and li 2004 we used a least square extrapolation method with limited trust to eliminate outliers in the velocity information assuming that the error of the velocity information obeys the gaussian distribution the velocity information of the four moments before the current target time is v k 1 v k 2 v k 3 and v k 4 respectively the degree of trust is n n 4 combined with the velocity history information the least square algorithm can be used to estimate the speed of the next moment 9 v ˆ k v k 1 1 2 v k 2 v k 1 assuming that the velocity measurement at time k is v k v k is satisfied under the following conditions 1 when v k v ˆ k δ v k is accepted 2 when v k v ˆ k δ is the outliers v k is removed and use v ˆ k replace with v k 3 if the number of consecutive accepted values exceeds the trust degree n the filter is re established we obtained distance information according to the propagation delay of the underwater acoustic signal the broadband coding signal effectively suppresses the random error caused by the low resolution of the time measurement which can safeguard the stability and reliability of the system however the underwater acoustic environment is extremely complex the signal is susceptible to environmental effects such as water surface seabed reflection and scattering elements such as surface submarine reflection and scattering cause multi channel signal interference and multi beacon signal superposition the signal cannot be detected effectively when there is consistent and strong sound source interference in the band and a broadband signal system cannot fully resolve this problem gross error data generally does not obey any fixed law it is easy to identify gross error data when there is substantial deviation from the true value due to detection invalidity or error conversely small scale gross error caused by multi effects is difficult to identify and does not allow the engineer to determine the difference between the estimated values of multi effects it can even render the entire system model completely inaccurate it is crucial to remove outliers from the distance information due to its gross errors in both large and small order distributions in the kalman filter system the covariance matrix describes the joint variance distribution of each state quantity the one step state estimation combined with the covariance estimate can be used to estimate the outliers in the distance information wang 2013a b when the system is in k time the state estimation matrix x ˆ k k 1 and covariance estimation matrix p k k 1 can be obtained according to the state update matrix x ˆ k 1 and covariance matrix p k 1 at the last moment in these two matrices there are estimates of the horizontal position and estimated variance x k y k σ x x 2 and σ y y 2 respectively if it is assumed that the coordinate of the acoustic beacon position is x i y i i 1 2 3 it is possible to obtain the estimated value r ˆ i k of the distance information for each beacon in only two dimensions thus we can define an estimate interval with a center r ˆ i k and a width of 2 δ r σ where δ r σ satisfies eq 11 if the measured value of distance information r i k obtained by the beacon i at k time does not fall within the estimation interval r ˆ i k δ r σ r ˆ i k δ r σ it is regarded as an outlier 10 r ˆ i k x k x i 2 y k y i 2 11 δ r σ σ x x 2 σ y y 2 as shown in fig 5 a and b if there is insufficient distance information the lbl navigation system cannot obtain positioning solutions for a portion of the running time however the multi beacon integrated navigation system can update the target location results when it receives any amount of distance information consider the pretreatment of the ranging data to remove outlying values the error of the beacon ranging information after data preprocessing is shown in fig 6 after pretreatment the distance error is significantly higher than the distance error shown in fig 4 c the maximum error changed from 15 m to 6 5 m the navigation level positioning error of the multi beacon system as shown in fig 5 a significantly improved when the ranging information was not preprocessed fig 5 b compared to the traditional lbl the multi beacon integrated navigation and positioning system achieves faster convergence the average positioning error is 2 4 m the maximum positioning error is 3 8 m the minimum positioning error is 0 2 m and real time target tracking to provide stable high precision location information we also design straight line track the coordinates of beacon 1 beacon 2 beacon 3 and beacon 4 were calibrated at 1 m accuracy on the round track shown in fig 7 a the distance between the measured value and the true distance from the gps inverse solution is shown in fig 7 b the measurement distance error is shown in fig 7 c assuming that the horizontal direction has a 10 m 10 m position error fig 7 d shows the horizontal positioning error under the straight line track the average positioning error is 1 1 m the maximum positioning error is 1 4 m the minimum positioning error is 0 3 m 5 conclusion the lbl positioning system is not well suited to auvs as it ignores the influence of underwater vehicle motion this creates a problem in which the signals are sent and received at different times at different locations which degrades the positioning accuracy and real time positioning capability this paper presents an integrated navigation algorithm based on multi beacon ranging information we constructed an integrated navigation solution model based on ekf which uses distance and velocity as measurement information when the distance information is not received the position information is updated by dead reckoning when the ranging information is received position correction is performed in real time target positioning at a high rate of output can be realized effectively using the proposed technique we conducted an experiment to find that the multi beacon navigation system after data preprocessing yields faster convergence and ranging error reduction from 15 m to 6 5 m the average positioning error is 2 4 m the maximum positioning error is 3 8 m the minimum positioning error is 0 2 m the algorithm can be applied to precise positioning under low measurement accuracy beacons positioning accuracy at the meter level can also be obtained with very low ranging error acknowledgment this work was supported by the key program of the national natural

23659,the frequency domain approach has been studied as a potential replacement modality for the time domain method in fatigue analysis of offshore wind turbine structures it is assumed that in the frequency domain approach the stress response spectra induced by wind and wave loads can be expressed by a stress transfer function to obtain the stress transfer function coupled analysis should be performed in advance however since the response of a wind turbine to different average wind speeds is non linear the stress transfer function is bound to change with wind speed this means that repeated simulation is needed in order to calculate the stress transfer function according to wind speed change the problem though is that if the number of simulations is large prohibitively high computational and time costs probably will be incurred in this study to reduce the number of simulations and at the same time increase the accuracy of results a correction factor of the stress transfer function induced by wind load was artificial neural network approximated as a function of mean wind speed and frequency sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine how many sample points are required and how to select them also a superposition model is proposed to improve the accuracy of the ann model this model is designed so that the peaks in the stress spectrum have a dominant influence on fatigue damage in order to better simulate the correction factor around the peak the model considering only the data of the periphery of the peaks and the model reflecting the whole data are superimposed the total stress spectrum were calculated by summing stress spectrum induced by wind load from the ann model and induced by inertia load from motion analysis based on linear wave theory numerical analysis for a 10 mw class wave and offshore wind hybrid power generation wwhybrid system which is a kind of semi submersible wind turbine platform was performed to verify the performance of the proposed model it was confirmed that the superposition model improves the accuracy by 20 50 compared with the single ann model keywords floating wind turbine fatigue analysis wide band process stress transfer function neural network 1 introduction fatigue analysis of floating offshore wind turbine structures unlike that of general offshore structures confronts highly complex problems including the combined wind wave effect on platform motion nonlinearities induced by mooring force and large platform motion accordingly fatigue analysis of such structures typically has been performed in the time domain however whereas it is possible to handle nonlinearities and interaction problems in the time domain this approach incurs significant computational and time costs also inherent uncertainties make single run estimations of fatigue damage more difficult thus requiring repeated simulations time domain analysis at the initial design stage is also difficult given the thousands of combinations of environmental conditions that must be considered therefore time domain fatigue analysis is performed only in limited load cases that are assumed to represent whole load combinations in actual practice in order to make fatigue analysis of wind turbine structures more efficient the frequency domain approach has been developed this method assumes that there is a linear relationship between environmental parameters such as wind speed or wave amplitude and structural responses the relationship is expressed as a transfer function there are two main load sources acting on floating wind turbine structures wind and waves thus in fatigue analysis of floating wind turbines stress transfer functions induced by both wind and wave loads should be estimated an integrated frequency domain method for the support structure of a fixed monopile wind turbine was proposed by van der tempel 2006 in his method wind and wave loads are handled separately and the interaction effect between the two loads is considered only by aerodynamic damping when the wind load induced stress transfer function is calculated the platform is fixed to eliminate the effect of the wave load on the other hand the aerodynamic damping which means the damping effect induced by wind load on platform motion is applied in calculation of the stress transfer function by wave loads this method yields quite accurate results where the interaction effect between wind and waves is quite small as in the case of a fixed platform in a floating wind turbine structure however where the interaction effect is strong it might no longer be reasonable to consider wind and wave loads separately ragan and manuel 2007 compared equivalent fatigue loads calculated by conventional time domain method and dirlik s spectral method they pointed out that dirlik s spectral method could be useful for predicting fatigue loads for some but not all turbine responses especially edge bending moment they also explained that spectral method almost gave more conservative results than conventional rainflow counting method a floating wind turbine structure s motions as calculated by time and frequency domain simulations were compared by philippe et al 2011 the time domain simulation conducted by fast used an aerodynamic and wind turbine model that was not linearized in the frequency domain simulation by contrast the whole system was linearized the frequency domain simulation relative to the time domain simulation accordingly yielded quite accurate frequency response operators the authors also pointed out deviations of around 0 3 rad s in the sway roll and yaw motions that could have been caused by the aerodynamic and turbine model s non linear effects response analyses of a wind turbine installed in tension leg platform were performed by bachynski and moan 2012 using time and frequency domain methods the frequency domain method provided reasonable results only for the wave only condition especially in a mild sea when the wind load was applied the low frequency components of surge and pitch increased and excited some motion at the 1st pitch natural frequency the study on optimization of catenary mooring system for floating wind turbines was performed by brommundt et al 2012 they applied the frequency domain approach to reduce computation cost and time by using the linearized mooring stiffness matrix and spectral loading matrices they pointed out that the importance on directionality to define load cases in case of asymmetrical mooring system and low frequency contributions form wind could lead to excitations in platform pitch a method for fatigue analysis of a semi submersible type floating wind turbine structure was developed by kvittem and moan 2015 they investigated tower fatigue damage considering the first flexible mode of the turbine tower unlike van der tempel they reflected structural flexibility by modeling the tower base as a rotation spring and mass for calculation of the stress transfer function by wind load their wave only analysis showed good agreement between the frequency and time domain results whereas their wind wave analysis indicated that the frequency domain method tended to underestimate fatigue damage by as much as 60 merz 2015 developed a set of codes for describing the linearized aeroelastic dynamics of an offshore wind turbine to verify the codes he compared some turbine responses like natural frequencies damping ratios and transfer functions calculated other commercial codes zwick and muskulus 2016 performed regression analysis on fatigue damage of a jacket type support structure considering wind and wave loading to reduce the number of load cases while retaining a high level of accuracy they used a piecewise linear function and multivariate linear statistical model to express the fatigue damage of each load cases as a function of wind speed through case study for jacket structure they verified that the method could reduce the number of simulation from 21 to 3 as retaining the accuracy within 6 a stress transfer function by wind load is calculated from time simulation time series data for a specified mean wind speed because turbine responses have non linear relationships with mean wind speed the stress transfer function should vary under different mean wind speeds as mean wind speed increases more energy is concentrated on the 1st natural frequency of the support structure van der tempel 2006 this means that for precise fatigue damage estimation the stress transfer function by wind load should be estimated with every mean wind speed in a wind scatter diagram and in order to obtain those stress transfer functions time domain analysis would have to be performed in advance which could be time consuming work in the present study for the purpose of reducing the number of required time simulations and increasing the accuracy of results calculated by the frequency domain approach a regression analysis of a correction factor defined as the ratio of the stress transfer function by wind load at a specific wind speed to the stress transfer function at the rated wind speed was performed using the artificial neural network ann algorithm the proper input and output variables of the ann model are suggested and its optimal structure is discussed a study to determine the sampling strategy for the training process in construction of the model is performed the effect of each frequency component on fatigue damage in the stress spectrum is not equal the frequency component around the peak has a large spectral density which has a great influence on fatigue damage while the other components each have a relatively small influence a single ann model trained with the whole data cannot easily reflect these weights and thus can impair the accuracy of the final result in order to reflect the less important data in the model to overcome this problem this paper proposes a superposition model constructed by superimposing a model that considers the entire data with models trained only for the peak periphery data in other words the influence of other data is excluded in the periphery of the high importance peak the performance of this proposed model was verified in the present study by numerical analysis of a semi submersible type floating wind turbine the contents of this paper are as follows in section 2 the ann model s input and output variables are introduced and its optimal structure is determined by comparing several models section 3 summarizes the procedure for constructing the ann model and applying it in the frequency domain to a fatigue analysis on offshore wind turbine support structures finally section 4 provides a numerical example of the proposed method in a semi submersible type structure 2 artificial neural network ann approximation for stress transfer function according to the nonlinearity of turbine responses to different mean wind speeds a wind induced stress transfer function varies obtaining the stress transfer function from time simulations in fatigue analysis requires dozens of simulations to handle thousands of environmental conditions this is also time consuming work as a fully coupled time simulation entails estimation of the stress transfer function with each mean wind speed within a wind scatter diagram s range which process takes a couple of days to perform as a means of reducing the required number of simulations regression analysis can be effective one of useful tools for estimation of a function that depends on many input variables is the ann model indeed it has been widely adopted to solve problems in the field of ocean engineering the time series of an fpso s motions was calculated by mazaheri 2006 using an ann model uddin et al 2015 introduced various offshore fixed platform applications of ann models ranging from damage detection to jacket controls 2 1 correction factor for stress transfer function by wind load in frequency domain fatigue analysis of wind turbine support structures several inputs and outputs are needed fig 1 for example a stress response amplitude operator rao or a stress transfer function is a structural response to unit wave amplitude or wind speed if the structural response has a linear relationship to wave amplitude or wind speed it is possible to obtain the structural response also for different waves and winds the stress transfer function plays an important role in the frequency domain approach because by multiplying the stress transfer function by the wind or wave spectra the stress response spectra which are used to estimate the probability density function of the hot spot stress range can be computed in the case of wave force the linearized wave theory can be effectively applied to describe the motions of floating structures and wave induced structural responses however the relationship between wind speed and wind force has a strong non linearity therefore the transfer function between wind speed and corresponding structural responses varies with different wind speeds to obtain the stress transfer function by wind load with specific wind speeds time simulation is required in order to obtain wind load and hot spot stress time series unfortunately it is impossible to obtain in a scatter diagram sufficient information on stress transfer functions by wind load for every wind speed because in real engineering settings hundreds of fatigue bins would have to be considered in the estimation of the fatigue life of an offshore wind turbine thus instead the stress transfer functions are calculated for limited wind speeds while fatigue damage is calculated by means of stress transfer functions that are calculated according to the closest wind speed to each bin in the present study ann models were applied so as to reflect the effect of mean wind speed in the fatigue analysis results it is important to determine the input and output variables of the ann model properly as mean wind speed and frequency are assumed to be the inputs of the ann models possible outputs are the stress transfer function the stress spectrum and the fatigue damage itself if the fatigue damage is considered as an output variable a fatigue analysis should be performed with a specific wind speed in order to obtain one sample point this means that fatigue analysis should be repeated many times so that the number of sample points required to construct the ann model can be obtained also it provides only the fatigue damage it cannot show detailed information such as the stress spectrum and the problem about summing two fatigue damages induced by wind and wave loads should occur thus in the present study the fatigue damage was excluded from the output of the ann model sudden changes are observed in stress transfer functions and stress spectra near natural frequencies precise description of such changes is difficult as in general regression models focus on expressing the overall shape of original data so the important information such as the amplitude of stress rao near peak frequencies for these reasons a correction factor is introduced for smoothing the shape of stress transfer functions so the regression model could predict the exact solution stable and exactly fig 2 the correction factor c is defined in eq 1 as the ratio of the stress transfer function for a specific wind speed to the rated wind speed at a specific frequency since the correction factors are defined for each frequency a set of correction factors at all frequencies must be considered in order to calculate the stress transfer function at a specific speed finally the ann model is used to fit the correction factor which is expressed as a function of mean wind speed v w and frequency f 1 c v w f ln s t r e s s r a o v w f s t r e s s r a o v r a t e d f 2 2 determination of number of neurons in hidden layer with regard to the number of hidden layers one is sufficient panchal et al 2011 more than two hidden layers are needed only to model data with discontinuities in fact application of two hidden layers rarely improves the ann model and might lead to convergence to the local minima usually some empirical formulas are used to determine the number of hidden neurons but such determinations are not always accurate because many factors such as the complexity of the activation functions or the training samples database can have a huge effect on the number of hidden neurons panchal et al 2011 it is recommended that cross validation be utilized to determine the number of hidden layer neurons in other words the performances of different ann architectures should be compared in order to determine the best model among them for such comparison akaike s information criterion aic a measure of the goodness of an estimated statistical model akaike 1974 panchal et al 2010 is widely employed moreover a quantitative index of ann architecture performance is required this index does not test a model itself but rather is measure for model selection the aic can be expressed according to the residual sums of squares rss which is the sum of the squares of residuals between the actual data and an estimated value and is obtained based on the rss as 2 a i c n l n r s s n 2 k where n the number of data points k the number of free parameters in the model the ann model for the correction factor consists of two inputs v w f and one output c to determine the number of neurons in a hidden layer the aics of five different architectures are compared the number of hidden neurons ranges from 2 to 10 at intervals of 2 table 1 each ann model was constructed by the correction factor calculated from 11 different wind speed conditions which range from a cut in speed 4 m s to a cut out speed 25 m s at intervals of 2 m s in 10 mw class wave and offshore wind hybrid power generation wwhybrid system each time analysis was performed for 1 h and the each response spectrum calculated by fast fourier transform is composed of 410 frequency bins so 4510 samples were used in the model construction the models are trained using matlab toolbox the aics of each model are computed by eq 2 because the ann model that yields the lowest aic value among the five models is the best the number of hidden neurons is determined to be 8 in this problem 3 integrated frequency domain method for offshore wind turbine system using ann model the frequency domain approach is due to its high efficiency widely used to perform fatigue analyses on ships and offshore platforms however it cannot be applied to offshore wind turbines due to non linearities such as the combined wind wave effect and mooring force many researchers have studied representative methods and suggested approximate methods the present study is based on van der tempel s suggested integrated frequency domain method in addition the ann model was used to reflect the effect of mean wind speed in the stress transfer function and thereby estimate the fatigue damage of target wind turbine support structures 3 1 procedure for calculation of stress transfer function 3 1 1 stress spectrum induced by wind load van der tempel s proposed integrated frequency domain method assumed that wind and wave loads are independent considering the interaction effect between them only by aerodynamic damping based on this assumption the stress transfer functions induced by wind and wave loads are calculated separately the proposed method consists of two steps the first step is the construction of an ann model for stress transfer functions caused by wind loads fig 3 sample points consisting of mean wind speed frequency and correction factors are required for the training process which determines sampling issues such as the number of time simulations that should be performed and the wind speeds that should be included in those simulations the stress transfer functions required in order to obtain the correction factor can be derived through time simulations when time simulations are performed to obtain the stress transfer function caused by wind loads shear force and bending moment acting on tower base the support structure is modeled as a rigid structure to uncouple the turbine calculations from the behavior of the support structure the detailed time simulation procedure is summarized as follows 1 inlet wind speed and wind load time series are calculated by time simulation 2 the response spectra of the wind load are calculated by fast fourier transform fft of the time series data and smoothed with a proper window function 3 an amplitude of transfer function between wind speed and wind load h v f f is obtained by eq 3 3 h v f ω s f ω s v ω where h v f ω transfer function between wind speed and force s f ω force spectrum s v ω wind turbulence model 4 time series data on hot spot stress induced by wind load are obtained by multiplying the wind load histories by the stress effect factors 5 an amplitude of transfer function between wind load and hot spot stress h f σ f is obtained in the same manner as in 3 6 an amplitude of transfer function between wind speed and hot spot stress h v σ f is obtained by multiplying the two transfer functions as in eq 4 4 h v σ ω s σ ω s v ω s f ω s v ω s σ ω s f ω h v f ω h f σ ω where h v σ ω transfer function between wind speed and hot spot stress h v f ω transfer function between wind speed and force h f σ ω transfer function between force and hot spot stress s σ ω stress spectrum the next step is calculation of the stress response spectra according to the definition of correction factor in eq 1 a stress transfer function at a specific wind speed can be obtained by multiplying correction factors obtained from the ann models constructed in step 1 and the stress transfer function at the rated wind speed then the stress spectrum can be calculated by multiplying the square of the stress transfer function and the wind turbulence model 3 1 2 stress spectrum induced by wave load unlike the stress transfer function as induced by wind load the stress transfer function as induced by wave load does not change with different wave amplitudes if the transfer function is calculated based on the linear wave theory thus it is not necessary to apply the ann model in the case of wave loads the 6 dof motion of a floating platform y ω can be calculated by the linear equation of motion in eq 5 in frequency domain analysis linearized mooring force is reflected in the c matrix 5 m a ω y ω b ω y ω cy ω f ω where m mass matrix a ω a d d e d m a s s m a t r i x b ω d a m p i n g m a t r i x c r e s t o r i n g m a t r i x f

i ω t y i ω i ω h ζ y i ω e i ω t y i ω ω 2 h ζ y i ω the inertial force acting at the tower s cog is computed by multiplying the accelerations at the tower s cog x i ω and lumped mass therefore the accelerations y i ω at the platform s cog should be transformed to accelerations at the tower s cog so as to obtain the response spectrum of inertial force f i n e r ω at the tower s cog the transformation between y i ω and x i ω is expressed as 7 x 1 y 1 z y 5 y y 6 x 2 y 2 x y 6 z y 4 x 3 y 3 y y 4 x y 5 finally the response spectrum of the hot spot stress induced by wave loads is obtained by multiplying f i n e r ω by the stress effect factors according to an assumption that wind and wave excitations are independent except for the aerodynamic damping the combined stress spectrum can be obtained simply by summing the two response spectra in case of a stress spectrum by wave loads it is possible to calculate the structural response by wave loads in the frequency domain based on the assumption that the structural responses of the support structure have a linear relationship to the wave amplitude as for the aerodynamic damping it should be reflected in the wave analysis and it is assumed to be taken as 4 in this study finally the combined stress spectrum can be expressed by adding the two stress spectra 8 s c o m b ω s w i n d ω s w a v e ω 3 2 superposition ann model in wind turbine response calculation an example of a stress spectrum induced by wind with rated wind speed is shown in fig 4 there are three peaks in the stress transfer function the first one which ranges from 0 005 to 0 05 hz is caused by slowly varying wind speed the second frequency components are 1p and 3p because the average rotor speed is about 8 rpm 0 133 hz the 1p and 3p frequency components lie between 0 13 and 0 4 hz the last one is about the 1st natural frequency of tower 0 5991 hz it seems that most power spectral densities are concentrated in this range this fact implies that the significances of correction factors are different and that the correction factors located near these peaks have a larger effect on the fatigue damage than do the other ones there are many local irregularities in correction factors in fact it is impossible for the ann model to describe all of these local peaks the ann model just expresses this irregular line as a smoothed line as shown in fig 5 this line results from the optimization that aims to minimize the error between the actual correction factors and the approximate values there is no consideration of the weights of each correction factor in the optimization this is reasonable if all of the correction factors have the same significance to fatigue damage however correction factors in this problem have different significances those located near peaks have much more importance than do others thus the superposition model concept is proposed to impart more significance to the correction factors near peaks and thus to improve the accuracy of the ann model the superposition model consists of two kinds of ann model one called the single model is made by using correction factors in all of the frequency ranges and the other named the partial model is constructed by utilizing only the correction factors near peaks fig 5 this second type of model can explain the correction factors near peaks well because it considers only error that occurs near to peaks in other words the superposition model can apply more weight to the correction factors located in adjacent peaks and thereby can provide better results than the single ann model in this problem there are three peaks in the stress spectrum and so the superposition model is composed of a total of 4 models one single model and three partial models 4 numerical simulation the ann model for computation of the correction factors of the stress transfer function was constructed to perform fatigue analysis on the tower base of wind turbines installed on a wave and offshore wind hybrid power generation wwhybrid system this system comprising four wind turbines and 24 wave energy converters converts wave and offshore wind energies to electricity 4 1 modeling of wwhybrid system the wwhybrid system in this study consists of long span beams fig 6 shows a configuration of this system the detailed information on which is summarized in tables 2 and 3 the pontoon structure located at the bottom consists of outer pontoons inner pontoons and diagonal pontoon braces the upper deck structure is formed in the same way as the pontoon structure the pontoon and upper deck structures are connected by 21 columns the four wind turbines are located at the corners of the upper deck structure respectively and at each side six wave energy converters are installed these wave energy converters are modeled as fixed bodies in the time and frequency analyses simply because they are outside the scope of the present study this system is moored at the corner columns by eight catenary mooring lines chains boundary condition should be applied to avoid rigid body motion of a structural model and at least 6 degree of freedom should be fixed statically determined boundary conditions addressed by dnv 2012 is applied to the target structure for structural analysis as shown in fig 7 the capacity of the wind turbine used in this simulation is 3 mw the cut in cut out and rated wind speeds of this turbine are 4 25 and 11 7 m s respectively because the four wind turbines are operated at the same time in this system the wake effect on turbines located behind can be significant as for the control system the configuration of turbine in this work was variable speed and fixed pitch vs fp this means that turbine responses such as power and rotational speed above the rated wind speed were managed by controlling the generator torque the power efficiency of this kind of turbine is generally maximized at low speeds and the rated power is only achieved at the rated wind speed 4 2 environmental condition this system was designed for installation on the coast of chagwido korea because wind wave and current were considered in the numerical simulation the corresponding information was reflected in the scatter diagram for this coast it was assumed that waves come only from the north northwest nnw for which the directional probability is the highest for that direction there are a total of 60 sea states in the sea scatter diagram in case of wind condition it was only considered that wind and wave were aligned this assumption also minimized the wake effect which was not considered in this study in general a joint probability function of mean wind speed and significant wave height is used to reflect the environmental conditions for wind turbine structures dnv 2010 associated statistical wind and wave data are required to define the coefficients of the joint probability function a lack of associated data renders use of the joint probability function problematic instead mean wind speeds having equal cumulative probabilities for significant wave heights were calculated and allocated to the corresponding sea states as shown in fig 8 because an operational wind turbine was of interest in this study 41 fatigue bins the mean wind speeds of which lie between the cut in and cut out speeds were selected from among 60 fatigue bins as the load cases in this study table 4 with regard to the current conditions the current was considered only as a constant value 0 14 m s which is the weighted average per year for all of the fatigue bins 4 3 time simulations time simulations were performed in all of the fatigue bins to obtain the exact fatigue damage of the hot spots mufowt developed by texas a m university was used to perform a coupled time domain analysis for the wwhybrid system this tool can handle wind wave and current at the same time by integrating fast for aerodynamic loads and charm3d for hydrodynamic loads bae et al 2014 kang et al 2013 this could provide a time series of wind loads acting on the tower base and 6 dof platform motions at the platform s cog considering all of the relevant loads the duration of the time simulation was 4000 s including the transient state the position of the hot spot was determined at the tower bases of the 1st turbine fig 9 in order to obtain the time series of hot spot stress fe analysis is required in every time step however instead of fe analysis a stress effect factor was used to calculate the hot spot stress induced by wind and wave loads efficiently the stress effect factors are the structural responses induced by unit force and moment if it is possible to assume that structural responses have a linear relationship to applied loads a time series of the hot spot stress induced by arbitrary loads can be computed simply by multiplying the stress effect factors by the time series of the loads wind load was computed at the tower base on the other hand the inertial force induced by the platform motion was computed at the tower s cog because the lumped mass of the tower was assumed to be concentrated at the tower s cog the acting point of the wind load was moved to the tower s cog to reduce the number of required stress effect factors thus it could be said that the stress effect factors in this simulation were the structural responses of the hot spot locations induced by unit force and moment applied at the tower s cog nastran solver was used to calculate the stress effect factors in this problem 4 4 frequency domain analysis if the interaction effect between winds and waves in platform motion is strong it is difficult to consider winds and waves separately pitch and roll spectra at three different wind speed conditions 10 15 20 m s in the mild sea condition hs 0 5 m tp 13s were compared to evaluate the effect of wind loads on the platform motion fig 10 fully coupled time simulation was performed through mufowt to extract the time series data of the motion of the platform in each environmental condition and convert it into motion spectra by fft all spectra were smoothed with a hanning window and the number of discrete fourier transform points is 2048 so the length of subrecord is 204 8s a small change in the pitch motion spectrum was observed at the low frequency of 20 m s but there was no significant difference in the calculated motion spectra in the three environmental conditions in other words it seems that the effect of wind on platform motion is quite small in the wwhybrid system thus it is possible to consider winds and waves separately as in van der tempel s assumption this means that the stress transfer functions induced by winds and waves can be estimated separately 4 4 1 sampling strategy for construction of ann model prior to performing time simulations the question of how to determine the set of wind speeds used as sample points in the training process should be answered this question is very meaningful because the accuracy of the ann model is highly dependent on it in the current study a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the optimal set of sample points yielding the most reasonable results compared with the time simulation and minimizing the number of required simulations a total of 6 sets of sample points were constructed and 8 ann models including 6 single models and 2 superposition models were additionally constructed from them table 5 the sample points of sets 1 4 consisted of the results of time simulations with equally spaced mean wind speeds this method which does not consider any of the physical aspects of the turbine responses is the simplest way to determine how to select the sets of sample points the sample points of sets 5 6 included the correction factors computed at the cut in v1 rated v2 and cut out v3 wind speeds also for enhancing ann model accuracy sets 5 6 included additional sample points at equal intervals between v1 and v3 table 6 six single ann models sm1 sm6 were constructed using the 6 sample sets and two superposition models sp1 sp2 were made using the 1st and 5th sample sets the levenberg marquardt algorithm which is widely used to solve non linear least square problems was selected as the training algorithm in this work the construction of the ann models for computation of correction factors was performed using matlab toolbox 4 4 2 estimation of total stress spectrum and fatigue damage after constructing the ann model for computation of correction factors the stress transfer functions induced by wind loads were calculated by applying the environmental condition of the 41 fatigue bin in table 4 these stress transfer functions were combined with wind turbulence models to obtain the stress spectra for each fatigue bin fig 11 shows examples of stress spectra calculated by the frequency domain approach using the 5th ann model sm5 its superposition model sp2 and time simulation the kaimal spectrum defined in eq 9 was employed the information on the parameters is summarized in table 7 9 f s k f σ k 2 4 f l k v h u b 1 6 f l k v h u b 5 3 where f frequency hz s k f kaimal spectrum in k th direction l k integral scale i k standard deviation of turbulence v h u b hub height wind speed m s the motion analysis was performed in the frequency domain using wamit to obtain the motion transfer functions of the wwhybrid system fig 12 shows examples of the stress response spectra induced by wave loads in the time and frequency domains in the frequency domain the motion responses calculated from the linear potential theory did not take into account the wind load and considered the linearized morison load thus the computation results from wamit exclude lowly varying resonant motion responses that may occur in floating wind turbines due to the effect of low varying resonant motion response the calculated stress spectrum induced by wave loads also has a maximum difference of 20 in the peak and the maximum error of the zero order moment of the stress spectrum due to the wave load is 8 compared to the time simulation results however in the whole stress spectrum this difference is about 2 so it is assumed that the motion performance calculated by the linear wave theory is used in the frequency domain technique pitch and roll motions greatly influenced the stress spectra and so the spectral densities were concentrated near the resonance frequency of pitch and roll motion 0 0557 hz in the stress spectra induced by wave loads a combined stress response spectrum was computed simply by adding two stress response spectra caused by winds and waves there are three stress components σ x σ y τ x y of hot spot stress because it can be seen as a plane stress problem among these stress components σ y was used to estimate fatigue damage in this study because it is much larger than the other components and is normal to the weld line as seen in fig 13 this spectrum has multiple peaks caused by slowly varying wind speed wave frequencies and the 1st natural frequency of the tower this went against the narrow band assumption and so it was not possible to assume that the probability density function of the amplitude of hot spot stress follows the rayleigh distribution function instead approximate models for representation of the wide band process should be applied to analyze this kind of stress spectrum the dirlik model is widely used to analyze the wide band process we modeled the probability density function p r f c d k s of stress amplitude as the superposition of two rayleigh distribution functions and an exponential distribution function as in eq 10 dirlik 1985 10 p r f c d k s 1 λ 0 d 1 q e z q d 2 z r 2 e z 2 2 r 2 d 3 z e z 2 2 where s stress amplitude

model was applied to estimate the probability density functions of the hot spot stress amplitude in the frequency domain analysis 4 5 results fatigue analyses are performed by applying both time simulation and the frequency domain approach in the case of the frequency domain approach two different methods for the stress transfer functions induced by wind are used the first one uses the ann models to modify the stress transfer functions induced by wind with different wind speeds the other is used as a reference method to compare the efficiency of the ann models the transfer functions are calculated in advance at intervals of 2 m s when fatigue analysis is performed for a specific fatigue bin a transfer function calculated at the speed closest to the wind speed of the fatigue bin is used this model is used as a criterion for evaluating the accuracy and efficiency of the ann models in this study fig 14 provides contour plot of the correction factors estimated by time simulation turbine responses such as rotor speed and thrust force change rapidly when the wind speed is lower than the rated wind speed at the rated wind speed the turbine responses also reach the rated values this means that all of the responses are stable because the configuration of the turbine is assumed to be vs fp the turbine responses are unstable above the rated wind speed these facts are also reflected in the correction factors the correction factors seem to be large in regions where wind speed is extremely small or large as in those regions the turbine responses are unstable on the other hand stable turbine responses make the correction factor small at the rated wind speed in the case of frequency correction factors increase when they reach the three peak frequencies and decrease rapidly when they exceed 0 8 hz the results for the sum of squared errors of prediction sse and the maximum error among all fatigue bin of every ann model defined as eq 11 were compared to quantify the accuracies of these models fig 15 the exact solutions were computed by applying the dirlik model to the stress response spectra obtained by fft of the time simulations this was done because the error between the time domain and the dirlik model could affect the accuracy of the results computed by applying the ann models 11 sse i 1 n d i d ˆ i 2 where d i fatigue damage calculated by time simulation in i th bin d ˆ i f a t i g u e d a m a g e c a l u l a t e d b y f r e q u e n c y d o m a i n a p p r o a c y i n i t h b i n sm1 to sm4 are single ann models based on samples calculated at uniform intervals the sm1 model which reflects the 22 samples of the largest number of samples among the models has the smallest sse as 37 of the reference model this model could estimate the fatigue damages in all fatigue bins within maximum 48 error compared to time simulation results in case of sm2 and sm3 the sample data used to construct each model were 11 and 8 respectively but the sses of these model are the same level in other words the accuracy of the two models is similar but sm3 is considered to be superior in terms of efficiency considering the required number of time simulations however the sm4 which takes the interval to 4 m s shows poor performance in terms of sse than the reference model which is considered to be disadvantageous in terms of accuracy based on the reference model the ann model can estimate fatigue damage in all fatigue bins with a maximum error of 53 with 8 simulations sm3 if the simulations are performed at equal intervals the results for sm5 and sm6 considering the design speeds such as cut in cut out and rated wind speed are also summarized in fig 15 these models provide interesting results these models reflect the results of seven or nine simulations which are the same level of sm3 or sm4 but they do not differ much from the results of sm1 which reflects total 22 simulation results in terms of accuracy in the case of sm6 the maximum error in all fatigue bins was 43 which is smaller than sm1 this means that the sampling strategy has a significant impact on the accuracy of the results when performing fatigue analysis of offshore wind turbines in particular it can be considered that there is a large difference in the accuracy of the model depending on whether or not the correction factors at the rated wind speed are reflected in the model configuration therefore when constructing the ann model it is desirable to reflect the results of simulations at the cut in cut out and rated wind speed the superposition model concept is proposed to enhance the accuracy of fatigue analysis using the ann model without increasing the neurons in hidden layer or sample data two superposition models that share the same sample points of the 1st and 5th models were built and compared with single models fig 16 for the sm1 and sp1 which required total 22 time simulations sse in sp1 decreased to 60 of sm1 in addition in aspect of the maximum error sp1 could give better results than sm1 by 14 as for sp2 sse was about 78 of sm5 and the maximum error was reduced by 8 as a results the superposition models yielded improved results ranging from 22 to 40 compared with the single model without using any additional sample points this implies that the sample points far from the peaks can make the ann model describe the actual data near the peaks which seems to lead to decreased accuracy of expected fatigue damage by the ann model this fact could be verified by drawing contour plots for the correction factors obtained from actual data and ann models fig 17 as can be seen the single model which considers the entire data with equal importance could describe the overall trend of the time simulation results but it seemed to underestimate the correction factors near the peaks due to distortion because the fatigue damage was dominated by that region simply modifying the predicted values in the peaks could greatly improve the results finally fatigue damages calculated by time simulation and three regression model the reference model the sp1 and sp2 in all of the fatigue bins were compared fig 18 shows the relative error between time simulation and each model in the fatigue bin from 1 to 20 which is relatively mild environmental condition the variance of the error through the superposition model is not large however from the 21st fatigue bin where the mean wind speed exceeds 17 m s the variation of the error also appears to increase because of the sharply change in the correction factors in addition since the significant wave height exceeds 2 m in this bin the influence on the lowly varying resonant motion which is not considered in the analysis may increase which is also considered as a reason for increasing the fluctuation range of the error however sp2 which only reflects the results of 7 time simulations can be used to evaluate fatigue damage in all fatigue bins within the range of 35 to 31 thus the proposed superposition model could reduce the number of time simulations 41 to 7 within 35 of maximum error it can be also seen that the accuracy of the superposition model is clearly improved when compared with the reference model 5 conclusion this paper proposes a fatigue analysis method that applies the ann model to reflect the effect of wind speed in the stress transfer function the application of ann models in turbine analysis could help to reduce the number of required simulations from 41 to 7 within the maximum error range of 35 in case of sp2 much discussion on the construction of the ann model used in wind turbine assessment is herein provided this issue should be given much attention with respect to any sampling strategy for the training process moreover the designed wind speeds such as cut in cut out and rated wind speeds are recommended to be included in the sample points a concept of a superposition model is also suggested in order to improve the predicted results without increasing sample data and the number of neurons in hidden layer indeed it is verified that the correction factors near the peaks in the stress spectrum dominate the predicted fatigue damage therefore it is expected that the superposition model which applies more weight to the correction factors located near the peaks could improve results and in fact this was proved in the present study through numerical simulation in this study pitch control system lowly varying resonant motion and directionality were not considered if pitch control system is considered the response of the turbine may change significantly depending on whether the control system is operating at rated speed since pitch control system make the turbine responses stable above the rated wind speed below the rated wind speed the stress transfer function changes largely depending on whether the pitch controller is operated or not when the design wind speed is higher than the rated wind speed the pitch control usually operates during simulation so the magnitude of stress transfer function could be small and there is no significant change in the stress transfer function depending on the wind speed therefore in this case sampling should be focused below the rated speed and a small number of samples above the rated speed are sufficient it is recommended that this is taken into consideration when constructing the ann model in a floating wind turbine system lowly varying resonant motion can be a problem due to the coupling effect between wind and wave although the effect on the fatigue damages was small so not handled in this work reflecting this effect in the ann model will be an interesting topic for future work acknowledgements the present work was supported by the

23659,the frequency domain approach has been studied as a potential replacement modality for the time domain method in fatigue analysis of offshore wind turbine structures it is assumed that in the frequency domain approach the stress response spectra induced by wind and wave loads can be expressed by a stress transfer function to obtain the stress transfer function coupled analysis should be performed in advance however since the response of a wind turbine to different average wind speeds is non linear the stress transfer function is bound to change with wind speed this means that repeated simulation is needed in order to calculate the stress transfer function according to wind speed change the problem though is that if the number of simulations is large prohibitively high computational and time costs probably will be incurred in this study to reduce the number of simulations and at the same time increase the accuracy of results a correction factor of the stress transfer function induced by wind load was artificial neural network approximated as a function of mean wind speed and frequency sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine how many sample points are required and how to select them also a superposition model is proposed to improve the accuracy of the ann model this model is designed so that the peaks in the stress spectrum have a dominant influence on fatigue damage in order to better simulate the correction factor around the peak the model considering only the data of the periphery of the peaks and the model reflecting the whole data are superimposed the total stress spectrum were calculated by summing stress spectrum induced by wind load from the ann model and induced by inertia load from motion analysis based on linear wave theory numerical analysis for a 10 mw class wave and offshore wind hybrid power generation wwhybrid system which is a kind of semi submersible wind turbine platform was performed to verify the performance of the proposed model it was confirmed that the superposition model improves the accuracy by 20 50 compared with the single ann model keywords floating wind turbine fatigue analysis wide band process stress transfer function neural network 1 introduction fatigue analysis of floating offshore wind turbine structures unlike that of general offshore structures confronts highly complex problems including the combined wind wave effect on platform motion nonlinearities induced by mooring force and large platform motion accordingly fatigue analysis of such structures typically has been performed in the time domain however whereas it is possible to handle nonlinearities and interaction problems in the time domain this approach incurs significant computational and time costs also inherent uncertainties make single run estimations of fatigue damage more difficult thus requiring repeated simulations time domain analysis at the initial design stage is also difficult given the thousands of combinations of environmental conditions that must be considered therefore time domain fatigue analysis is performed only in limited load cases that are assumed to represent whole load combinations in actual practice in order to make fatigue analysis of wind turbine structures more efficient the frequency domain approach has been developed this method assumes that there is a linear relationship between environmental parameters such as wind speed or wave amplitude and structural responses the relationship is expressed as a transfer function there are two main load sources acting on floating wind turbine structures wind and waves thus in fatigue analysis of floating wind turbines stress transfer functions induced by both wind and wave loads should be estimated an integrated frequency domain method for the support structure of a fixed monopile wind turbine was proposed by van der tempel 2006 in his method wind and wave loads are handled separately and the interaction effect between the two loads is considered only by aerodynamic damping when the wind load induced stress transfer function is calculated the platform is fixed to eliminate the effect of the wave load on the other hand the aerodynamic damping which means the damping effect induced by wind load on platform motion is applied in calculation of the stress transfer function by wave loads this method yields quite accurate results where the interaction effect between wind and waves is quite small as in the case of a fixed platform in a floating wind turbine structure however where the interaction effect is strong it might no longer be reasonable to consider wind and wave loads separately ragan and manuel 2007 compared equivalent fatigue loads calculated by conventional time domain method and dirlik s spectral method they pointed out that dirlik s spectral method could be useful for predicting fatigue loads for some but not all turbine responses especially edge bending moment they also explained that spectral method almost gave more conservative results than conventional rainflow counting method a floating wind turbine structure s motions as calculated by time and frequency domain simulations were compared by philippe et al 2011 the time domain simulation conducted by fast used an aerodynamic and wind turbine model that was not linearized in the frequency domain simulation by contrast the whole system was linearized the frequency domain simulation relative to the time domain simulation accordingly yielded quite accurate frequency response operators the authors also pointed out deviations of around 0 3 rad s in the sway roll and yaw motions that could have been caused by the aerodynamic and turbine model s non linear effects response analyses of a wind turbine installed in tension leg platform were performed by bachynski and moan 2012 using time and frequency domain methods the frequency domain method provided reasonable results only for the wave only condition especially in a mild sea when the wind load was applied the low frequency components of surge and pitch increased and excited some motion at the 1st pitch natural frequency the study on optimization of catenary mooring system for floating wind turbines was performed by brommundt et al 2012 they applied the frequency domain approach to reduce computation cost and time by using the linearized mooring stiffness matrix and spectral loading matrices they pointed out that the importance on directionality to define load cases in case of asymmetrical mooring system and low frequency contributions form wind could lead to excitations in platform pitch a method for fatigue analysis of a semi submersible type floating wind turbine structure was developed by kvittem and moan 2015 they investigated tower fatigue damage considering the first flexible mode of the turbine tower unlike van der tempel they reflected structural flexibility by modeling the tower base as a rotation spring and mass for calculation of the stress transfer function by wind load their wave only analysis showed good agreement between the frequency and time domain results whereas their wind wave analysis indicated that the frequency domain method tended to underestimate fatigue damage by as much as 60 merz 2015 developed a set of codes for describing the linearized aeroelastic dynamics of an offshore wind turbine to verify the codes he compared some turbine responses like natural frequencies damping ratios and transfer functions calculated other commercial codes zwick and muskulus 2016 performed regression analysis on fatigue damage of a jacket type support structure considering wind and wave loading to reduce the number of load cases while retaining a high level of accuracy they used a piecewise linear function and multivariate linear statistical model to express the fatigue damage of each load cases as a function of wind speed through case study for jacket structure they verified that the method could reduce the number of simulation from 21 to 3 as retaining the accuracy within 6 a stress transfer function by wind load is calculated from time simulation time series data for a specified mean wind speed because turbine responses have non linear relationships with mean wind speed the stress transfer function should vary under different mean wind speeds as mean wind speed increases more energy is concentrated on the 1st natural frequency of the support structure van der tempel 2006 this means that for precise fatigue damage estimation the stress transfer function by wind load should be estimated with every mean wind speed in a wind scatter diagram and in order to obtain those stress transfer functions time domain analysis would have to be performed in advance which could be time consuming work in the present study for the purpose of reducing the number of required time simulations and increasing the accuracy of results calculated by the frequency domain approach a regression analysis of a correction factor defined as the ratio of the stress transfer function by wind load at a specific wind speed to the stress transfer function at the rated wind speed was performed using the artificial neural network ann algorithm the proper input and output variables of the ann model are suggested and its optimal structure is discussed a study to determine the sampling strategy for the training process in construction of the model is performed the effect of each frequency component on fatigue damage in the stress spectrum is not equal the frequency component around the peak has a large spectral density which has a great influence on fatigue damage while the other components each have a relatively small influence a single ann model trained with the whole data cannot easily reflect these weights and thus can impair the accuracy of the final result in order to reflect the less important data in the model to overcome this problem this paper proposes a superposition model constructed by superimposing a model that considers the entire data with models trained only for the peak periphery data in other words the influence of other data is excluded in the periphery of the high importance peak the performance of this proposed model was verified in the present study by numerical analysis of a semi submersible type floating wind turbine the contents of this paper are as follows in section 2 the ann model s input and output variables are introduced and its optimal structure is determined by comparing several models section 3 summarizes the procedure for constructing the ann model and applying it in the frequency domain to a fatigue analysis on offshore wind turbine support structures finally section 4 provides a numerical example of the proposed method in a semi submersible type structure 2 artificial neural network ann approximation for stress transfer function according to the nonlinearity of turbine responses to different mean wind speeds a wind induced stress transfer function varies obtaining the stress transfer function from time simulations in fatigue analysis requires dozens of simulations to handle thousands of environmental conditions this is also time consuming work as a fully coupled time simulation entails estimation of the stress transfer function with each mean wind speed within a wind scatter diagram s range which process takes a couple of days to perform as a means of reducing the required number of simulations regression analysis can be effective one of useful tools for estimation of a function that depends on many input variables is the ann model indeed it has been widely adopted to solve problems in the field of ocean engineering the time series of an fpso s motions was calculated by mazaheri 2006 using an ann model uddin et al 2015 introduced various offshore fixed platform applications of ann models ranging from damage detection to jacket controls 2 1 correction factor for stress transfer function by wind load in frequency domain fatigue analysis of wind turbine support structures several inputs and outputs are needed fig 1 for example a stress response amplitude operator rao or a stress transfer function is a structural response to unit wave amplitude or wind speed if the structural response has a linear relationship to wave amplitude or wind speed it is possible to obtain the structural response also for different waves and winds the stress transfer function plays an important role in the frequency domain approach because by multiplying the stress transfer function by the wind or wave spectra the stress response spectra which are used to estimate the probability density function of the hot spot stress range can be computed in the case of wave force the linearized wave theory can be effectively applied to describe the motions of floating structures and wave induced structural responses however the relationship between wind speed and wind force has a strong non linearity therefore the transfer function between wind speed and corresponding structural responses varies with different wind speeds to obtain the stress transfer function by wind load with specific wind speeds time simulation is required in order to obtain wind load and hot spot stress time series unfortunately it is impossible to obtain in a scatter diagram sufficient information on stress transfer functions by wind load for every wind speed because in real engineering settings hundreds of fatigue bins would have to be considered in the estimation of the fatigue life of an offshore wind turbine thus instead the stress transfer functions are calculated for limited wind speeds while fatigue damage is calculated by means of stress transfer functions that are calculated according to the closest wind speed to each bin in the present study ann models were applied so as to reflect the effect of mean wind speed in the fatigue analysis results it is important to determine the input and output variables of the ann model properly as mean wind speed and frequency are assumed to be the inputs of the ann models possible outputs are the stress transfer function the stress spectrum and the fatigue damage itself if the fatigue damage is considered as an output variable a fatigue analysis should be performed with a specific wind speed in order to obtain one sample point this means that fatigue analysis should be repeated many times so that the number of sample points required to construct the ann model can be obtained also it provides only the fatigue damage it cannot show detailed information such as the stress spectrum and the problem about summing two fatigue damages induced by wind and wave loads should occur thus in the present study the fatigue damage was excluded from the output of the ann model sudden changes are observed in stress transfer functions and stress spectra near natural frequencies precise description of such changes is difficult as in general regression models focus on expressing the overall shape of original data so the important information such as the amplitude of stress rao near peak frequencies for these reasons a correction factor is introduced for smoothing the shape of stress transfer functions so the regression model could predict the exact solution stable and exactly fig 2 the correction factor c is defined in eq 1 as the ratio of the stress transfer function for a specific wind speed to the rated wind speed at a specific frequency since the correction factors are defined for each frequency a set of correction factors at all frequencies must be considered in order to calculate the stress transfer function at a specific speed finally the ann model is used to fit the correction factor which is expressed as a function of mean wind speed v w and frequency f 1 c v w f ln s t r e s s r a o v w f s t r e s s r a o v r a t e d f 2 2 determination of number of neurons in hidden layer with regard to the number of hidden layers one is sufficient panchal et al 2011 more than two hidden layers are needed only to model data with discontinuities in fact application of two hidden layers rarely improves the ann model and might lead to convergence to the local minima usually some empirical formulas are used to determine the number of hidden neurons but such determinations are not always accurate because many factors such as the complexity of the activation functions or the training samples database can have a huge effect on the number of hidden neurons panchal et al 2011 it is recommended that cross validation be utilized to determine the number of hidden layer neurons in other words the performances of different ann architectures should be compared in order to determine the best model among them for such comparison akaike s information criterion aic a measure of the goodness of an estimated statistical model akaike 1974 panchal et al 2010 is widely employed moreover a quantitative index of ann architecture performance is required this index does not test a model itself but rather is measure for model selection the aic can be expressed according to the residual sums of squares rss which is the sum of the squares of residuals between the actual data and an estimated value and is obtained based on the rss as 2 a i c n l n r s s n 2 k where n the number of data points k the number of free parameters in the model the ann model for the correction factor consists of two inputs v w f and one output c to determine the number of neurons in a hidden layer the aics of five different architectures are compared the number of hidden neurons ranges from 2 to 10 at intervals of 2 table 1 each ann model was constructed by the correction factor calculated from 11 different wind speed conditions which range from a cut in speed 4 m s to a cut out speed 25 m s at intervals of 2 m s in 10 mw class wave and offshore wind hybrid power generation wwhybrid system each time analysis was performed for 1 h and the each response spectrum calculated by fast fourier transform is composed of 410 frequency bins so 4510 samples were used in the model construction the models are trained using matlab toolbox the aics of each model are computed by eq 2 because the ann model that yields the lowest aic value among the five models is the best the number of hidden neurons is determined to be 8 in this problem 3 integrated frequency domain method for offshore wind turbine system using ann model the frequency domain approach is due to its high efficiency widely used to perform fatigue analyses on ships and offshore platforms however it cannot be applied to offshore wind turbines due to non linearities such as the combined wind wave effect and mooring force many researchers have studied representative methods and suggested approximate methods the present study is based on van der tempel s suggested integrated frequency domain method in addition the ann model was used to reflect the effect of mean wind speed in the stress transfer function and thereby estimate the fatigue damage of target wind turbine support structures 3 1 procedure for calculation of stress transfer function 3 1 1 stress spectrum induced by wind load van der tempel s proposed integrated frequency domain method assumed that wind and wave loads are independent considering the interaction effect between them only by aerodynamic damping based on this assumption the stress transfer functions induced by wind and wave loads are calculated separately the proposed method consists of two steps the first step is the construction of an ann model for stress transfer functions caused by wind loads fig 3 sample points consisting of mean wind speed frequency and correction factors are required for the training process which determines sampling issues such as the number of time simulations that should be performed and the wind speeds that should be included in those simulations the stress transfer functions required in order to obtain the correction factor can be derived through time simulations when time simulations are performed to obtain the stress transfer function caused by wind loads shear force and bending moment acting on tower base the support structure is modeled as a rigid structure to uncouple the turbine calculations from the behavior of the support structure the detailed time simulation procedure is summarized as follows 1 inlet wind speed and wind load time series are calculated by time simulation 2 the response spectra of the wind load are calculated by fast fourier transform fft of the time series data and smoothed with a proper window function 3 an amplitude of transfer function between wind speed and wind load h v f f is obtained by eq 3 3 h v f ω s f ω s v ω where h v f ω transfer function between wind speed and force s f ω force spectrum s v ω wind turbulence model 4 time series data on hot spot stress induced by wind load are obtained by multiplying the wind load histories by the stress effect factors 5 an amplitude of transfer function between wind load and hot spot stress h f σ f is obtained in the same manner as in 3 6 an amplitude of transfer function between wind speed and hot spot stress h v σ f is obtained by multiplying the two transfer functions as in eq 4 4 h v σ ω s σ ω s v ω s f ω s v ω s σ ω s f ω h v f ω h f σ ω where h v σ ω transfer function between wind speed and hot spot stress h v f ω transfer function between wind speed and force h f σ ω transfer function between force and hot spot stress s σ ω stress spectrum the next step is calculation of the stress response spectra according to the definition of correction factor in eq 1 a stress transfer function at a specific wind speed can be obtained by multiplying correction factors obtained from the ann models constructed in step 1 and the stress transfer function at the rated wind speed then the stress spectrum can be calculated by multiplying the square of the stress transfer function and the wind turbulence model 3 1 2 stress spectrum induced by wave load unlike the stress transfer function as induced by wind load the stress transfer function as induced by wave load does not change with different wave amplitudes if the transfer function is calculated based on the linear wave theory thus it is not necessary to apply the ann model in the case of wave loads the 6 dof motion of a floating platform y ω can be calculated by the linear equation of motion in eq 5 in frequency domain analysis linearized mooring force is reflected in the c matrix 5 m a ω y ω b ω y ω cy ω f ω where m mass matrix a ω a d d e d m a s s m a t r i x b ω d a m p i n g m a t r i x c r e s t o r i n g m a t r i x f ω f o r c e m a t r i x if it is possible to define the transfer functions h ζ y i ω 6 dof motion velocity y i ω and acceleration y i ω at the platform s cog could be expressed as 6 y i ω h ζ y i ω e i ω t y i ω i ω h ζ y i ω e i ω t y i ω ω 2 h ζ y i ω the inertial force acting at the tower s cog is computed by multiplying the accelerations at the tower s cog x i ω and lumped mass therefore the accelerations y i ω at the platform s cog should be transformed to accelerations at the tower s cog so as to obtain the response spectrum of inertial force f i n e r ω at the tower s cog the transformation between y i ω and x i ω is expressed as 7 x 1 y 1 z y 5 y y 6 x 2 y 2 x y 6 z y 4 x 3 y 3 y y 4 x y 5 finally the response spectrum of the hot spot stress induced by wave loads is obtained by multiplying f i n e r ω by the stress effect factors according to an assumption that wind and wave excitations are independent except for the aerodynamic damping the combined stress spectrum can be obtained simply by summing the two response spectra in case of a stress spectrum by wave loads it is possible to calculate the structural response by wave loads in the frequency domain based on the assumption that the structural responses of the support structure have a linear relationship to the wave amplitude as for the aerodynamic damping it should be reflected in the wave analysis and it is assumed to be taken as 4 in this study finally the combined stress spectrum can be expressed by adding the two stress spectra 8 s c o m b ω s w i n d ω s w a v e ω 3 2 superposition ann model in wind turbine response calculation an example of a stress spectrum induced by wind with rated wind speed is shown in fig 4 there are three peaks in the stress transfer function the first one which ranges from 0 005 to 0 05 hz is caused by slowly varying wind speed the second frequency components are 1p and 3p because the average rotor speed is about 8 rpm 0 133 hz the 1p and 3p frequency components lie between 0 13 and 0 4 hz the last one is about the 1st natural frequency of tower 0 5991 hz it seems that most power spectral densities are concentrated in this range this fact implies that the significances of correction factors are different and that the correction factors located near these peaks have a larger effect on the fatigue damage than do the other ones there are many local irregularities in correction factors in fact it is impossible for the ann model to describe all of these local peaks the ann model just expresses this irregular line as a smoothed line as shown in fig 5 this line results from the optimization that aims to minimize the error between the actual correction factors and the approximate values there is no consideration of the weights of each correction factor in the optimization this is reasonable if all of the correction factors have the same significance to fatigue damage however correction factors in this problem have different significances those located near peaks have much more importance than do others thus the superposition model concept is proposed to impart more significance to the correction factors near peaks and thus to improve the accuracy of the ann model the superposition model consists of two kinds of ann model one called the single model is made by using correction factors in all of the frequency ranges and the other named the partial model is constructed by utilizing only the correction factors near peaks fig 5 this second type of model can explain the correction factors near peaks well because it considers only error that occurs near to peaks in other words the superposition model can apply more weight to the correction factors located in adjacent peaks and thereby can provide better results than the single ann model in this problem there are three peaks in the stress spectrum and so the superposition model is composed of a total of 4 models one single model and three partial models 4 numerical simulation the ann model for computation of the correction factors of the stress transfer function was constructed to perform fatigue analysis on the tower base of wind turbines installed on a wave and offshore wind hybrid power generation wwhybrid system this system comprising four wind turbines and 24 wave energy converters converts wave and offshore wind energies to electricity 4 1 modeling of wwhybrid system the wwhybrid system in this study consists of long span beams fig 6 shows a configuration of this system the detailed information on which is summarized in tables 2 and 3 the pontoon structure located at the bottom consists of outer pontoons inner pontoons and diagonal pontoon braces the upper deck structure is formed in the same way as the pontoon structure the pontoon and upper deck structures are connected by 21 columns the four wind turbines are located at the corners of the upper deck structure respectively and at each side six wave energy converters are installed these wave energy converters are modeled as fixed bodies in the time and frequency analyses simply because they are outside the scope of the present study this system is moored at the corner columns by eight catenary mooring lines chains boundary condition should be applied to avoid rigid body motion of a structural model and at least 6 degree of freedom should be fixed statically determined boundary conditions addressed by dnv 2012 is applied to the target structure for structural analysis as shown in fig 7 the capacity of the wind turbine used in this simulation is 3 mw the cut in cut out and rated wind speeds of this turbine are 4 25 and 11 7 m s respectively because the four wind turbines are operated at the same time in this system the wake effect on turbines located behind can be significant as for the control system the configuration of turbine in this work was variable speed and fixed pitch vs fp this means that turbine responses such as power and rotational speed above the rated wind speed were managed by controlling the generator torque the power efficiency of this kind of turbine is generally maximized at low speeds and the rated power is only achieved at the rated wind speed 4 2 environmental condition this system was designed for installation on the coast of chagwido korea because wind wave and current were considered in the numerical simulation the corresponding information was reflected in the scatter diagram for this coast it was assumed that waves come only from the north northwest nnw for which the directional probability is the highest for that direction there are a total of 60 sea states in the sea scatter diagram in case of wind condition it was only considered that wind and wave were aligned this assumption also minimized the wake effect which was not considered in this study in general a joint probability function of mean wind speed and significant wave height is used to reflect the environmental conditions for wind turbine structures dnv 2010 associated statistical wind and wave data are required to define the coefficients of the joint probability function a lack of associated data renders use of the joint probability function problematic instead mean wind speeds having equal cumulative probabilities for significant wave heights were calculated and allocated to the corresponding sea states as shown in fig 8 because an operational wind turbine was of interest in this study 41 fatigue bins the mean wind speeds of which lie between the cut in and cut out speeds were selected from among 60 fatigue bins as the load cases in this study table 4 with regard to the current conditions the current was considered only as a constant value 0 14 m s which is the weighted average per year for all of the fatigue bins 4 3 time simulations time simulations were performed in all of the fatigue bins to obtain the exact fatigue damage of the hot spots mufowt developed by texas a m university was used to perform a coupled time domain analysis for the wwhybrid system this tool can handle wind wave and current at the same time by integrating fast for aerodynamic loads and charm3d for hydrodynamic loads bae et al 2014 kang et al 2013 this could provide a time series of wind loads acting on the tower base and 6 dof platform motions at the platform s cog considering all of the relevant loads the duration of the time simulation was 4000 s including the transient state the position of the hot spot was determined at the tower bases of the 1st turbine fig 9 in order to obtain the time series of hot spot stress fe analysis is required in every time step however instead of fe analysis a stress effect factor was used to calculate the hot spot stress induced by wind and wave loads efficiently the stress effect factors are the structural responses induced by unit force and moment if it is possible to assume that structural responses have a linear relationship to applied loads a time series of the hot spot stress induced by arbitrary loads can be computed simply by multiplying the stress effect factors by the time series of the loads wind load was computed at the tower base on the other hand the inertial force induced by the platform motion was computed at the tower s cog because the lumped mass of the tower was assumed to be concentrated at the tower s cog the acting point of the wind load was moved to the tower s cog to reduce the number of required stress effect factors thus it could be said that the stress effect factors in this simulation were the structural responses of the hot spot locations induced by unit force and moment applied at the tower s cog nastran solver was used to calculate the stress effect factors in this problem 4 4 frequency domain analysis if the interaction effect between winds and waves in platform motion is strong it is difficult to consider winds and waves separately pitch and roll spectra at three different wind speed conditions 10 15 20 m s in the mild sea condition hs 0 5 m tp 13s were compared to evaluate the effect of wind loads on the platform motion fig 10 fully coupled time simulation was performed through mufowt to extract the time series data of the motion of the platform in each environmental condition and convert it into motion spectra by fft all spectra were smoothed with a hanning window and the number of discrete fourier transform points is 2048 so the length of subrecord is 204 8s a small change in the pitch motion spectrum was observed at the low frequency of 20 m s but there was no significant difference in the calculated motion spectra in the three environmental conditions in other words it seems that the effect of wind on platform motion is quite small in the wwhybrid system thus it is possible to consider winds and waves separately as in van der tempel s assumption this means that the stress transfer functions induced by winds and waves can be estimated separately 4 4 1 sampling strategy for construction of ann model prior to performing time simulations the question of how to determine the set of wind speeds used as sample points in the training process should be answered this question is very meaningful because the accuracy of the ann model is highly dependent on it in the current study a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the optimal set of sample points yielding the most reasonable results compared with the time simulation and minimizing the number of required simulations a total of 6 sets of sample points were constructed and 8 ann models including 6 single models and 2 superposition models were additionally constructed from them table 5 the sample points of sets 1 4 consisted of the results of time simulations with equally spaced mean wind speeds this method which does not consider any of the physical aspects of the turbine responses is the simplest way to determine how to select the sets of sample points the sample points of sets 5 6 included the correction factors computed at the cut in v1 rated v2 and cut out v3 wind speeds also for enhancing ann model accuracy sets 5 6 included additional sample points at equal intervals between v1 and v3 table 6 six single ann models sm1 sm6 were constructed using the 6 sample sets and two superposition models sp1 sp2 were made using the 1st and 5th sample sets the levenberg marquardt algorithm which is widely used to solve non linear least square problems was selected as the training algorithm in this work the construction of the ann models for computation of correction factors was performed using matlab toolbox 4 4 2 estimation of total stress spectrum and fatigue damage after constructing the ann model for computation of correction factors the stress transfer functions induced by wind loads were calculated by applying the environmental condition of the 41 fatigue bin in table 4 these stress transfer functions were combined with wind turbulence models to obtain the stress spectra for each fatigue bin fig 11 shows examples of stress spectra calculated by the frequency domain approach using the 5th ann model sm5 its superposition model sp2 and time simulation the kaimal spectrum defined in eq 9 was employed the information on the parameters is summarized in table 7 9 f s k f σ k 2 4 f l k v h u b 1 6 f l k v h u b 5 3 where f frequency hz s k f kaimal spectrum in k th direction l k integral scale i k standard deviation of turbulence v h u b hub height wind speed m s the motion analysis was performed in the frequency domain using wamit to obtain the motion transfer functions of the wwhybrid system fig 12 shows examples of the stress response spectra induced by wave loads in the time and frequency domains in the frequency domain the motion responses calculated from the linear potential theory did not take into account the wind load and considered the linearized morison load thus the computation results from wamit exclude lowly varying resonant motion responses that may occur in floating wind turbines due to the effect of low varying resonant motion response the calculated stress spectrum induced by wave loads also has a maximum difference of 20 in the peak and the maximum error of the zero order moment of the stress spectrum due to the wave load is 8 compared to the time simulation results however in the whole stress spectrum this difference is about 2 so it is assumed that the motion performance calculated by the linear wave theory is used in the frequency domain technique pitch and roll motions greatly influenced the stress spectra and so the spectral densities were concentrated near the resonance frequency of pitch and roll motion 0 0557 hz in the stress spectra induced by wave loads a combined stress response spectrum was computed simply by adding two stress response spectra caused by winds and waves there are three stress components σ x σ y τ x y of hot spot stress because it can be seen as a plane stress problem among these stress components σ y was used to estimate fatigue damage in this study because it is much larger than the other components and is normal to the weld line as seen in fig 13 this spectrum has multiple peaks caused by slowly varying wind speed wave frequencies and the 1st natural frequency of the tower this went against the narrow band assumption and so it was not possible to assume that the probability density function of the amplitude of hot spot stress follows the rayleigh distribution function instead approximate models for representation of the wide band process should be applied to analyze this kind of stress spectrum the dirlik model is widely used to analyze the wide band process we modeled the probability density function p r f c d k s of stress amplitude as the superposition of two rayleigh distribution functions and an exponential distribution function as in eq 10 dirlik 1985 10 p r f c d k s 1 λ 0 d 1 q e z q d 2 z r 2 e z 2 2 r 2 d 3 z e z 2 2 where s stress amplitude

model was applied to estimate the probability density functions of the hot spot stress amplitude in the frequency domain analysis 4 5 results fatigue analyses are performed by applying both time simulation and the frequency domain approach in the case of the frequency domain approach two different methods for the stress transfer functions induced by wind are used the first one uses the ann models to modify the stress transfer functions induced by wind with different wind speeds the other is used as a reference method to compare the efficiency of the ann models the transfer functions are calculated in advance at intervals of 2 m s when fatigue analysis is performed for a specific fatigue bin a transfer function calculated at the speed closest to the wind speed of the fatigue bin is used this model is used as a criterion for evaluating the accuracy and efficiency of the ann models in this study fig 14 provides contour plot of the correction factors estimated by time simulation turbine responses such as rotor speed and thrust force change rapidly when the wind speed is lower than the rated wind speed at the rated wind speed the turbine responses also reach the rated values this means that all of the responses are stable because the configuration of the turbine is assumed to be vs fp the turbine responses are unstable above the rated wind speed these facts are also reflected in the correction factors the correction factors seem to be large in regions where wind speed is extremely small or large as in those regions the turbine responses are unstable on the other hand stable turbine responses make the correction factor small at the rated wind speed in the case of frequency correction factors increase when they reach the three peak frequencies and decrease rapidly when they exceed 0 8 hz the results for the sum of squared errors of prediction sse and the maximum error among all fatigue bin of every ann model defined as eq 11 were compared to quantify the accuracies of these models fig 15 the exact solutions were computed by applying the dirlik model to the stress response spectra obtained by fft of the time simulations this was done because the error between the time domain and the dirlik model could affect the accuracy of the results computed by applying the ann models 11 sse i 1 n d i d ˆ i 2 where d i fatigue damage calculated by time simulation in i th bin d ˆ i f a t i g u e d a m a g e c a l u l a t e d b y f r e q u e n c y d o m a i n a p p r o a c y i n i t h b i n sm1 to sm4 are single ann models based on samples calculated at uniform intervals the sm1 model which reflects the 22 samples of the largest number of samples among the models has the smallest sse as 37 of the reference model this model could estimate the fatigue damages in all fatigue bins within maximum 48 error compared to time simulation results in case of sm2 and sm3 the sample data used to construct each model were 11 and 8 respectively but the sses of these model are the same level in other words the accuracy of the two models is similar but sm3 is considered to be superior in terms of efficiency considering the required number of time simulations however the sm4 which takes the interval to 4 m s shows poor performance in terms of sse than the reference model which is considered to be disadvantageous in terms of accuracy based on the reference model the ann model can estimate fatigue damage in all fatigue bins with a maximum error of 53 with 8 simulations sm3 if the simulations are performed at equal intervals the results for sm5 and sm6 considering the design speeds such as cut in cut out and rated wind speed are also summarized in fig 15 these models provide interesting results these models reflect the results of seven or nine simulations which are the same level of sm3 or sm4 but they do not differ much from the results of sm1 which reflects total 22 simulation results in terms of accuracy in the case of sm6 the maximum error in all fatigue bins was 43 which is smaller than sm1 this means that the sampling strategy has a significant impact on the accuracy of the results when performing fatigue analysis of offshore wind turbines in particular it can be considered that there is a large difference in the accuracy of the model depending on whether or not the correction factors at the rated wind speed are reflected in the model configuration therefore when constructing the ann model it is desirable to reflect the results of simulations at the cut in cut out and rated wind speed the superposition model concept is proposed to enhance the accuracy of fatigue analysis using the ann model without increasing the neurons in hidden layer or sample data two superposition models that share the same sample points of the 1st and 5th models were built and compared with single models fig 16 for the sm1 and sp1 which required total 22 time simulations sse in sp1 decreased to 60 of sm1 in addition in aspect of the maximum error sp1 could give better results than sm1 by 14 as for sp2 sse was about 78 of sm5 and the maximum error was reduced by 8 as a results the superposition models yielded improved results ranging from 22 to 40 compared with the single model without using any additional sample points this implies that the sample points far from the peaks can make the ann model describe the actual data near the peaks which seems to lead to decreased accuracy of expected fatigue damage by the ann model this fact could be verified by drawing contour plots for the correction factors obtained from actual data and ann models fig 17 as can be seen the single model which considers the entire data with equal importance could describe the overall trend of the time simulation results but it seemed to underestimate the correction factors near the peaks due to distortion because the fatigue damage was dominated by that region simply modifying the predicted values in the peaks could greatly improve the results finally fatigue damages calculated by time simulation and three regression model the reference model the sp1 and sp2 in all of the fatigue bins were compared fig 18 shows the relative error between time simulation and each model in the fatigue bin from 1 to 20 which is relatively mild environmental condition the variance of the error through the superposition model is not large however from the 21st fatigue bin where the mean wind speed exceeds 17 m s the variation of the error also appears to increase because of the sharply change in the correction factors in addition since the significant wave height exceeds 2 m in this bin the influence on the lowly varying resonant motion which is not considered in the analysis may increase which is also considered as a reason for increasing the fluctuation range of the error however sp2 which only reflects the results of 7 time simulations can be used to evaluate fatigue damage in all fatigue bins within the range of 35 to 31 thus the proposed superposition model could reduce the number of time simulations 41 to 7 within 35 of maximum error it can be also seen that the accuracy of the superposition model is clearly improved when compared with the reference model 5 conclusion this paper proposes a fatigue analysis method that applies the ann model to reflect the effect of wind speed in the stress transfer function the application of ann models in turbine analysis could help to reduce the number of required simulations from 41 to 7 within the maximum error range of 35 in case of sp2 much discussion on the construction of the ann model used in wind turbine assessment is herein provided this issue should be given much attention with respect to any sampling strategy for the training process moreover the designed wind speeds such as cut in cut out and rated wind speeds are recommended to be included in the sample points a concept of a superposition model is also suggested in order to improve the predicted results without increasing sample data and the number of neurons in hidden layer indeed it is verified that the correction factors near the peaks in the stress spectrum dominate the predicted fatigue damage therefore it is expected that the superposition model which applies more weight to the correction factors located near the peaks could improve results and in fact this was proved in the present study through numerical simulation in this study pitch control system lowly varying resonant motion and directionality were not considered if pitch control system is considered the response of the turbine may change significantly depending on whether the control system is operating at rated speed since pitch control system make the turbine responses stable above the rated wind speed below the rated wind speed the stress transfer function changes largely depending on whether the pitch controller is operated or not when the design wind speed is higher than the rated wind speed the pitch control usually operates during simulation so the magnitude of stress transfer function could be small and there is no significant change in the stress transfer function depending on the wind speed therefore in this case sampling should be focused below the rated speed and a small number of samples above the rated speed are sufficient it is recommended that this is taken into consideration when constructing the ann model in a floating wind turbine system lowly varying resonant motion can be a problem due to the coupling effect between wind and wave although the effect on the fatigue damages was small so not handled in this work reflecting this effect in the ann model will be an interesting topic for future work acknowledgements the present work was supported by the
