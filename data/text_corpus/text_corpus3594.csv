freundii cav1857 enterobacter hormaechei cav1983 serratia marcescens cav1976 and klebsiella quasipneumoniae cav2018 previously isolated from the hospital sink drain or p trap were considered for the growth and biofilm assay experiments prior to experiments each strain was revived from 80 c frozen stocks by streaking onto tryptic soy agar single isolated colony was inoculated into 5 ml of tryptic soy broth tsb bd bacto incubated overnight at 37 c the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 12 000 g for 10 min at 4 c washed and suspended into 0 85 nacl solution the primary bacterial concentration was adjusted to od600 0 15 using a microplate reader versamax molecular devices company ca us and an aliquot 20 μl of each strain was inoculated into 180 μl of each of the different nutrient media listed in table 1 media without bacterial inoculum served as a negative control for growth assay absorbance of the liquid cultures at intervals was measured at 600 nm all isolates and media were tested in triplicate biofilm assay were performed in 96 well polystyrene microplates the plates with listed media were inoculated as above with kpce isolates and incubated without shaking at 37 c following incubation media was decanted and rinsed three times with sterile de ionized water one replicate set of wells were air dried for 30 min and stained with 200 μl of 0 25 w v crystal violet for 30 min the staining solution was then removed and rinsed three times with sterile de ionized water the crystal violet bound to the biofilm was then solubilized with 200 μl of 95 ethanol for 30 min the absorbance was measured at 570 nm another replicate set of wells were processed for quantification of kpce within the biofilm by adding 200 μl of sterile phosphate buffer saline with 0 02 tween 80 pbst and set on shaking platform for 30 min to allow resuspension of cells the pbst cell suspension was subsequently dilution plated on tryptic soy agar plates and incubated at 37 c overnight colony forming units cfus from each set of replicates were enumerated to determine bacterial abundance within the biofilm 2 5 metagenomic sequencing dna from sink drain biofilm samples was extracted using dneasy powersoil kit qiagen following manufacturer s protocol after quantification using picogreen the extracted dna was used to construct shotgun metagenomic libraries using the nextera xt kit following the manufacturer s protocols sequencing was performed using the illumina hiseq 4000 multiplexing six samples per lane to generate approximately 40 million paired end reads 150 bp per sample 2 6 bioinformatics analysis low quality portions of sequences were trimmed using trimgalore https github com felixkrueger trimgalore krueger 2015 specifically we discarded reads below average phred score of q25 and a length cut off of 75 bp and the first 13 bp of illumina adapters taxonomic composition of the metagenomics samples was estimated using kraken wood and salzberg 2014 against a reference database composed of ncbi s refseq bacterial and viral genomes accessed in february 2018 for each taxonomic level relative abundances were estimated using bracken lu et al 2017 to remove spurious and low abundance assignments only taxa with 0 01 relative abundance were considered for downstream diversity and statistical analysis for amr gene abundance estimation the filtered metagenomics reads were mapped using bbmap bushnell 2014 against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card v2 0 1 jia et al 2017 as short reads do not provide sufficient resolution to distinguish highly similar amr gene homologs we pre clustered the card database n 2 448 sequences at 90 identity and only retained one representative sequence for each cluster n 1 074 sequences the aligned bam files were used for gene counting normalization and abundance estimation using the approach implemented within respipe gweon et al 2019 briefly gene cluster counts were generated for reads that mapped with 100 sequence identity to representative sequence followed by pseudo abundance estimation by normalizing using the gene length as well as lateral coverage of the gene sequence by reads 2 7 statistical analysis within sample alpha diversity was measured at each taxonomic level by counting the distinct taxa community richness and calculating the shannon index community evenness that accounts for relative abundances of taxa compositional dissimilarities between samples was calculated using the bray curtis index and visualized by principal coordinates analysis taxonomic relative abundance profiles were converted to arcsine square root transformed proportions to calculate random effects model estimates using sinks as random effects to account for within sink heterogeneity p values obtained from the random effects models were corrected for multiple comparisons using fdr method with q values 0 1 considered statistically significant similarly resistance gene counts were analysed using random effects models directly on the pseudo counts 2 8 data availability the metagenomic sequences are available at ncbi s sequence read archive sra under the bioproject id prjna574189 3 results 3 1 effect of nutrient profiles on growth of kpce the effect of twelve nutrient combinations table 1 on the growth of four kpce species citrobacter freundii enterobacter hormaechei serratia marcescens and klebsiella qausipneumoniae predominantly detected in the hospital sinks was tested across all the four kpce tsb that provided substantially higher protein concentration in the form of tryptone and soy was clearly a better growth promoter followed by remodified r2a remodr2a and modified r2a modr2a fig 2 tsb spiked with 0 1 μg ml cefepime tsb cef was found to be most growth promoting across the four species tsb and tsb without dextrose tsb d had growth profiles comparable to tsb with cefepime dextrose appeared to have no or marginal effect in promoting the growth attributing to relatively higher peptone concentration remodr2a on an average was found to be a better growth promoter than modr2a nacl tap water or tap water spiked with soap that comprised negligible carbon c and nitrogen n were not found to promote growth of the kpce species tested 3 2 effect of nutrient profiles on biofilm formation of kpce similar trend was observed with the effect of nutrient categories on biofilm formation ability of kpce fig 3 a higher biofilm was quantified in case of tsb followed by remodified r2a and modified r2a relatively lesser biofilm was recorded in case nacl or tap water the average biofilm buildup od570 day1 to day7 was significantly higher in nutrients containing tsb compared to that in nutrients containing remodifiedr2a and modifiedr2a p 0 00026 and p 0 000032 respectively this was true in case of all the four kpce species tested bacterial abundance within the biofilm was also found to be significantly higher in nutrients containing tsb p 0 0002 fig 3b in summary biofilm buildup and bacterial population in the biofilms was higher in case of carbon and nitrogen rich nutrients than without nacl or tap water supported relatively lower biofilm buildup and 4 5 log lesser bacterial abundance biofilm formation ability and cell abundance was marginally higher in presence of cefepime dextrose or soap had no effect on either indices 3 3 microbiology in the initial sink transplants initially 8 sink p traps tested positive for kpce at the time or before the harvest were transplanted into the sink lab for testing this was done with the presumption that p traps were the key reservoirs of kpce and would allow for colonization of the previously unused plumbing once installed supplying water and soap alone 2h interval three of the seven sinks that were kpce positive at the time of harvest had no detectable kpce in the p trap water sampled the next day fig 4 by day 7 none of the p traps had detectable kpce in p trap water samples screened using enriched culture method when 25 ml tsb was added to these sinks on a daily basis by pouring over the drain with 3h dwell time before flushing kpce was again detected in all the p traps within one to two days average time between kpce becoming undetectable and then again detectable with nutrient exposure was 29 days range 19 40 days detectable levels of kpce in p trap water using an enriched culture method was maintained only with the exposure to nutrients after installation but prior to the introduction of nutrients kpce were detected in the biofilms formed on the luminal surface of the p traps fig 4 day 21 sinks 1 2 3 suggesting kpce could survive in the biofilm under nutrient deficit conditions and upon exposure to nutrients kpce was detected in the p trap water five unique kpce species enterobacter spp klebsiella oxytoca pantoea spp citrobacter freundii enterobacter asburiae data not shown were found to be colonized in these sinks and interestingly all of these species showed a similar trend of revival in their populations upon exposure to nutrients kpce was not detected in the negative control sink at any point of time 3 4 effect of delayed introduction of nutrients on sink microbiology in this phase of testing 18 sinks that were previously tested positive for kpce were transplanted into the sink lab sinks were randomly grouped for varying intervals of delay in introduction of nutrients tsb 0 1 2 and 3 months fig 5 when sinks were operated with soap and water alone following the install kpce were not detected either at the drain or p trap level in five of the six sinks fig 5 sink 1 2 3 5 and 6 in contrast all 12 sinks to which nutrients 25 ml tsb every day were supplied beginning day 0 of the transplant kpce were detected for 7 28 days fig 5 group 4 in two sinks fig 5 group 2 that had kpce below detectable limits for 3 months while operating with soap and water kpce were detected immediately after introduction of nutrients and were consistently detectable for 28 days interestingly both these sinks had kluyvera intermedia pantoea spp as the dominant kpce species before transplant and after introduction of nutrients in one sink however sink 7 kpce were detectable before and after introduction of nutrients 3 5 effect of nutrients on sink microbiome streamlined with the culture data whole shotgun metagenomic sequencing dataset from drain biofilms of six transplanted sinks 1 2 3 5 6 and 7 was collected and analysed three representative time points each before no nutrients and after with nutrients nutrient introduction in each sink were considered fig 6 a and b shows differentially abundant taxa at family level and genus level between samples collected before and after the introduction of nutrients there were no significant longitudinal changes in community richness and evenness seen across our samples data not shown ordination plots of between sample dissimilarity distances revealed community structure shifts in two of the 6 sinks fig 6c sinks 1 and 6 interestingly the longitudinal dynamics of microbial relative abundances are not in concordance with the upsurge in kpce population following introduction of nutrients as detected in the culture data relative abundance of enterobacteriaceae remained relatively constant data not shown there was an evident decrease in antimicrobial resistance gene carriage in the sink drain biofilms before introduction of nutrients but did not reach significance fig s1 decrease in abundance estimations of specific resistance gene clusters was seen in samples before and after nutrient introduction with genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides sulfonamides and beta lactams contributing to the overall decrease fig s2 4 discussion in the current study we found that nutrients appear to play a critical role in kpce abundance in real world hospital drain biofilms once transplanted into a sink lab we took advantage of having established a bsl 2 sink lab along with the enhanced understanding of hospital behaviors which may contribute to cpe persisting in hospital drains grabowski et al 2018 common interventions including chemical or complete exchange of the premise plumbing were proven to be temporary or ineffective carling 2018 decraene et al 2018 gordon et al 2017 it will be imperative that we seek sustainable solutions which decrease the bioburden of problematic pathogens in the drain biofilm which once established are challenging to eliminate while we demonstrate that with just soap and water the burden of kpce decreased to undetectable levels in transplanted sinks we do not know the threshold number of bacteria on a sink drain that are needed to cause a dispersion with a faucet event we speculate that a decrease in kpce would likely lead to less dissemination we also demonstrate that addition of nutrients results in a rapid increase in kpce to detectable levels even after a long period of undetected kpce this suggests that biofilms rather than the wastewater in the p traps act as a dormant reservoir allowing these drug resistant bacteria to integrate and survive in a viable state upon exposure to nutrients the kpce can regrow back to detectable levels plausibly as a result of detached kpce shed from the biofilm growing under nutrient rich conditions this would be consistent with the concept that once a drain biofilm is a reservoir it perpetually carries a greater risk for increased bacterial burden of enterobacterales this will require that hospital staff and patients remain vigilant about not disposing nutrient containing wastes into hand wash sinks it may also require regulations on nutrient disposal into sinks intended for hand washing should be added to guidelines keeping in mind the potential risk that kpce could surge after a single exposure of nutrient solutions new sink redesign may be necessary that take into account drain position drainage rate and other dynamics which promote droplet dispersion from a colonized drain aranega bou et al 2018 kotay et al 2019 retrospectively initial transplants in our sink lab involved only the p traps with an incomplete understanding that p traps were the sole source and reservoir of kpce contamination in the sinks the findings from first phase of transplant has redirected our focus on the biofilm as the potential reservoirs of these bacteria which can form and extended rapidly along the luminal surfaces of the plumbing and simultaneously may help them persist longer period while remaining undetectable protein rich nutrient was apparently the most preferred for growth of kpce species tsb is a commonly used nutrient media for culturing non fastidious bacteria and is a rich source of n and c r2a broth is primarily used for cultivation and maintenance of heterotrophic bacteria from potable waters by providing essential growth factors required for the metabolism even with the variations by supplementing additional protein remodr2a and or dextrose modr2a it was not sufficient to enhance growth of kpce rationale for the addition of 1 1 g l dextrose was to simulate its concentration in typical dialysis solution a commonly discarded liquid waste in icu sinks de geyter et al 2017 leitner et al 2015 lowe et al 2012 roux et al 2013 smolders et al 2018 in a recent study residues of antibiotics were regularly detected in sink p traps and drains at varying concentrations voigt et al 2019 cefepime is a commonly used broad spectrum cephalosporin we used 0 1 μg ml cefepime which is several dilutions below the mean inhibitory concentration mic allow growth and mimic potential selection pressure which may be encountered in a hospital environment a carbapenem was not selected for this experiment because of instability in solution this study is the first attempt to investigate sink drain biofilms using shotgun metagenomics to understand the dynamics of bacterial community and resistance gene compositions a closer inspection of the data did not reveal significant associations in response to nutrient introduction in the light of our paired kpce culture results it indicates that addition of nutrients possibly had a larger positive impact on the growth of other bacterial groups thereby resulting in a decreased relative abundance of kpce as well as total resistance load we observed a clear trend in the decrease in relative abundance of enterobacterales along with overall decrease in aggregate antimicrobial gene estimations in samples collected from transplanted sinks with no nutrients however due to the zero inflated nature of the compositional data combined with our limited sample size the observed trends did not reach statistical significance further research on the community dynamics on a longer term basis would be needed to understand how kpce responds to the changes in the sink microbiome and the implications it has on the overall resistance load the sink lab is an ex situ model which may not reflect the in situ dynamics of the actual premise plumbing even though we try to mimic the hospital environment as closely as possible this is an obvious limitation of the study due to the concern of nutrients promoting kpce in hospital sinks the ethics of performing the study in situ were prohibitive the sample size in this study was relatively small and therefore this work should be considered in that context lastly the biofilm and culture response to nutrients were based on mono microbial selective cultures and the behavior and response to nutrients may not be the same when considered in a mixed biofilm community 5 conclusions the study illuminates the role that nutrients play on the growth of cpe in real world ex situ harvested hospital wastewater premise plumbing transplanted into a sink lab further we demonstrate that drug resistant bacteria can persist with nutrient deficit conditions within the biofilms formed on the inside lumen of a sink p trap and can rapidly recover mobilize and spread via the wastewater up to sink drain or downstream this highlights the necessary diligence on avoidance of nutrient disposal and some of the likely challenges in elimination of kpce from wastewater premise plumbing entirely declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as

tween 80 pbst and set on shaking platform for 30 min to allow resuspension of cells the pbst cell suspension was subsequently dilution plated on tryptic soy agar plates and incubated at 37 c overnight colony forming units cfus from each set of replicates were enumerated to determine bacterial abundance within the biofilm 2 5 metagenomic sequencing dna from sink drain biofilm samples was extracted using dneasy powersoil kit qiagen following manufacturer s protocol after quantification using picogreen the extracted dna was used to construct shotgun metagenomic libraries using the nextera xt kit following the manufacturer s protocols sequencing was performed using the illumina hiseq 4000 multiplexing six samples per lane to generate approximately 40 million paired end reads 150 bp per sample 2 6 bioinformatics analysis low quality portions of sequences were trimmed using trimgalore https github com felixkrueger trimgalore krueger 2015 specifically we discarded reads below average phred score of q25 and a length cut off of 75 bp and the first 13 bp of illumina adapters taxonomic composition of the metagenomics samples was estimated using kraken wood and salzberg 2014 against a reference database composed of ncbi s refseq bacterial and viral genomes accessed in february 2018 for each taxonomic level relative abundances were estimated using bracken lu et al 2017 to remove spurious and low abundance assignments only taxa with 0 01 relative abundance were considered for downstream diversity and statistical analysis for amr gene abundance estimation the filtered metagenomics reads were mapped using bbmap bushnell 2014 against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card v2 0 1 jia et al 2017 as short reads do not provide sufficient resolution to distinguish highly similar amr gene homologs we pre clustered the card database n 2 448 sequences at 90 identity and only retained one representative sequence for each cluster n 1 074 sequences the aligned bam files were used for gene counting normalization and abundance estimation using the approach implemented within respipe gweon et al 2019 briefly gene cluster counts were generated for reads that mapped with 100 sequence identity to representative sequence followed by pseudo abundance estimation by normalizing using the gene length as well as lateral coverage of the gene sequence by reads 2 7 statistical analysis within sample alpha diversity was measured at each taxonomic level by counting the distinct taxa community richness and calculating the shannon index community evenness that accounts for relative abundances of taxa compositional dissimilarities between samples was calculated using the bray curtis index and visualized by principal coordinates analysis taxonomic relative abundance profiles were converted to arcsine square root transformed proportions to calculate random effects model estimates using sinks as random effects to account for within sink heterogeneity p values obtained from the random effects models were corrected for multiple comparisons using fdr method with q values 0 1 considered statistically significant similarly resistance gene counts were analysed using random effects models directly on the pseudo counts 2 8 data availability the metagenomic sequences are available at ncbi s sequence read archive sra under the bioproject id prjna574189 3 results 3 1 effect of nutrient profiles on growth of kpce the effect of twelve nutrient combinations table 1 on the growth of four kpce species citrobacter freundii enterobacter hormaechei serratia marcescens and klebsiella qausipneumoniae predominantly detected in the hospital sinks was tested across all the four kpce tsb that provided substantially higher protein concentration in the form of tryptone and soy was clearly a better growth promoter followed by remodified r2a remodr2a and modified r2a modr2a fig 2 tsb spiked with 0 1 μg ml cefepime tsb cef was found to be most growth promoting across the four species tsb and tsb without dextrose tsb d had growth profiles comparable to tsb with cefepime dextrose appeared to have no or marginal effect in promoting the growth attributing to relatively higher peptone concentration remodr2a on an average was found to be a better growth promoter than modr2a nacl tap water or tap water spiked with soap that comprised negligible carbon c and nitrogen n were not found to promote growth of the kpce species tested 3 2 effect of nutrient profiles on biofilm formation of kpce similar trend was observed with the effect of nutrient categories on biofilm formation ability of kpce fig 3 a higher biofilm was quantified in case of tsb followed by remodified r2a and modified r2a relatively lesser biofilm was recorded in case nacl or tap water the average biofilm buildup od570 day1 to day7 was significantly higher in nutrients containing tsb compared to that in nutrients containing remodifiedr2a and modifiedr2a p 0 00026 and p 0 000032 respectively this was true in case of all the four kpce species tested bacterial abundance within the biofilm was also found to be significantly higher in nutrients containing tsb p 0 0002 fig 3b in summary biofilm buildup and bacterial population in the biofilms was higher in case of carbon and nitrogen rich nutrients than without nacl or tap water supported relatively lower biofilm buildup and 4 5 log lesser bacterial abundance biofilm formation ability and cell abundance was marginally higher in presence of cefepime dextrose or soap had no effect on either indices 3 3 microbiology in the initial sink transplants initially 8 sink p traps tested positive for kpce at the time or before the harvest were transplanted into the sink lab for testing this was done with the presumption that p traps were the key reservoirs of kpce and would allow for colonization of the previously unused plumbing once installed supplying water and soap alone 2h interval three of the seven sinks that were kpce positive at the time of harvest had no detectable kpce in the p trap water sampled the next day fig 4 by day 7 none of the p traps had detectable kpce in p trap water samples screened using enriched culture method when 25 ml tsb was added to these sinks on a daily basis by pouring over the drain with 3h dwell time before flushing kpce was again detected in all the p traps within one to two days average time between kpce becoming undetectable and then again detectable with nutrient exposure was 29 days range 19 40 days detectable levels of kpce in p trap water using an enriched culture method was maintained only with the exposure to nutrients after installation but prior to the introduction of nutrients kpce were detected in the biofilms formed on the luminal surface of the p traps fig 4 day 21 sinks 1 2 3 suggesting kpce could survive in the biofilm under nutrient deficit conditions and upon exposure to nutrients kpce was detected in the p trap water five unique kpce species enterobacter spp klebsiella oxytoca pantoea spp citrobacter freundii enterobacter asburiae data not shown were found to be colonized in these sinks and interestingly all of these species showed a similar trend of revival in their populations upon exposure to nutrients kpce was not detected in the negative control sink at any point of time 3 4 effect of delayed introduction of nutrients on sink microbiology in this phase of testing 18 sinks that were previously tested positive for kpce were transplanted into the sink lab sinks were randomly grouped for varying intervals of delay in introduction of nutrients tsb 0 1 2 and 3 months fig 5 when sinks were operated with soap and water alone following the install kpce were not detected either at the drain or p trap level in five of the six sinks fig 5 sink 1 2 3 5 and 6 in contrast all 12 sinks to which nutrients 25 ml tsb every day were supplied beginning day 0 of the transplant kpce were detected for 7 28 days fig 5 group 4 in two sinks fig 5 group 2 that had kpce below detectable limits for 3 months while operating with soap and water kpce were detected immediately after introduction of nutrients and were consistently detectable for 28 days interestingly both these sinks had kluyvera intermedia pantoea spp as the dominant kpce species before transplant and after introduction of nutrients in one sink however sink 7 kpce were detectable before and after introduction of nutrients 3 5 effect of nutrients on sink microbiome streamlined with the culture data whole shotgun metagenomic sequencing dataset from drain biofilms of six transplanted sinks 1 2 3 5 6 and 7 was collected and analysed three representative time points each before no nutrients and after with nutrients nutrient introduction in each sink were considered fig 6 a and b shows differentially abundant taxa at family level and genus level between samples collected before and after the introduction of nutrients there were no significant longitudinal changes in community richness and evenness seen across our samples data not shown ordination plots of between sample dissimilarity distances revealed community structure shifts in two of the 6 sinks fig 6c sinks 1 and 6 interestingly the longitudinal dynamics of microbial relative abundances are not in concordance with the upsurge in kpce population following introduction of nutrients as detected in the culture data relative abundance of enterobacteriaceae remained relatively constant data not shown there was an evident decrease in antimicrobial resistance gene carriage in the sink drain biofilms before introduction of nutrients but did not reach significance fig s1 decrease in abundance estimations of specific resistance gene clusters was seen in samples before and after nutrient introduction with genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides sulfonamides and beta lactams contributing to the overall decrease fig s2 4 discussion in the current study we found that nutrients appear to play a critical role in kpce abundance in real world hospital drain biofilms once transplanted into a sink lab we took advantage of having established a bsl 2 sink lab along with the enhanced understanding of hospital behaviors which may contribute to cpe persisting in hospital drains grabowski et al 2018 common interventions including chemical or complete exchange of the premise plumbing were proven to be temporary or ineffective carling 2018 decraene et al 2018 gordon et al 2017 it will be imperative that we seek sustainable solutions which decrease the bioburden of problematic pathogens in the drain biofilm which once established are challenging to eliminate while we demonstrate that with just soap and water the burden of kpce decreased to undetectable levels in transplanted sinks we do not know the threshold number of bacteria on a sink drain that are needed to cause a dispersion with a faucet event we speculate that a decrease in kpce would likely lead to less dissemination we also demonstrate that addition of nutrients results in a rapid increase in kpce to detectable levels even after a long period of undetected kpce this suggests that biofilms rather than the wastewater in the p traps act as a dormant reservoir allowing these drug resistant bacteria to integrate and survive in a viable state upon exposure to nutrients the kpce can regrow back to detectable levels plausibly as a result of detached kpce shed from the biofilm growing under nutrient rich conditions this would be consistent with the concept that once a drain biofilm is a reservoir it perpetually carries a greater risk for increased bacterial burden of enterobacterales this will require that hospital staff and patients remain vigilant about not disposing nutrient containing wastes into hand wash sinks it may also require regulations on nutrient disposal into sinks intended for hand washing should be added to guidelines keeping in mind the potential risk that kpce could surge after a single exposure of nutrient solutions new sink redesign may be necessary that take into account drain position drainage rate and other dynamics which promote droplet dispersion from a colonized drain aranega bou et al 2018 kotay et al 2019 retrospectively initial transplants in our sink lab involved only the p traps with an incomplete understanding that p traps were the sole source and reservoir of kpce contamination in the sinks the findings from first phase of transplant has redirected our focus on the biofilm as the potential reservoirs of these bacteria which can form and extended rapidly along the luminal surfaces of the plumbing and simultaneously may help them persist longer period while remaining undetectable protein rich nutrient was apparently the most preferred for growth of kpce species tsb is a commonly used nutrient media for culturing non fastidious bacteria and is a rich source of n and c r2a broth is primarily used for cultivation and maintenance of heterotrophic bacteria from potable waters by providing essential growth factors required for the metabolism even with the variations by supplementing additional protein remodr2a and or dextrose modr2a it was not sufficient to enhance growth of kpce rationale for the addition of 1 1 g l dextrose was to simulate its concentration in typical dialysis solution a commonly discarded liquid waste in icu sinks de geyter et al 2017 leitner et al 2015 lowe et al 2012 roux et al 2013 smolders et al 2018 in a recent study residues of antibiotics were regularly detected in sink p traps and drains at varying concentrations voigt et al 2019 cefepime is a commonly used broad spectrum cephalosporin we used 0 1 μg ml cefepime which is several dilutions below the mean inhibitory concentration mic allow growth and mimic potential selection pressure which may be encountered in a hospital environment a carbapenem was not selected for this experiment because of instability in solution this study is the first attempt to investigate sink drain biofilms using shotgun metagenomics to understand the dynamics of bacterial community and resistance gene compositions a closer inspection of the data did not reveal significant associations in response to nutrient introduction in the light of our paired kpce culture results it indicates that addition of nutrients possibly had a larger positive impact on the growth of other bacterial groups thereby resulting in a decreased relative abundance of kpce as well as total resistance load we observed a clear trend in the decrease in relative abundance of enterobacterales along with overall decrease in aggregate antimicrobial gene estimations in samples collected from transplanted sinks with no nutrients however due to the zero inflated nature of the compositional data combined with our limited sample size the observed trends did not reach statistical significance further research on the community dynamics on a longer term basis would be needed to understand how kpce responds to the changes in the sink microbiome and the implications it has on the overall resistance load the sink lab is an ex situ model which may not reflect the in situ dynamics of the actual premise plumbing even though we try to mimic the hospital environment as closely as possible this is an obvious limitation of the study due to the concern of nutrients promoting kpce in hospital sinks the ethics of performing the study in situ were prohibitive the sample size in this study was relatively small and therefore this work should be considered in that context lastly the biofilm and culture response to nutrients were based on mono microbial selective cultures and the behavior and response to nutrients may not be the same when considered in a mixed biofilm community 5 conclusions the study illuminates the role that nutrients play on the growth of cpe in real world ex situ harvested hospital wastewater premise plumbing transplanted into a sink lab further we demonstrate that drug resistant bacteria can persist with nutrient deficit conditions within the biofilms formed on the inside lumen of a sink p trap and can rapidly recover mobilize and spread via the wastewater up to sink drain or downstream this highlights the necessary diligence on avoidance of nutrient disposal and some of the likely challenges in elimination of kpce from wastewater premise plumbing entirely declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as

17971,graphene oxide go sheets are unstable in aqueous environments and the effect of photo transformation on go toxicity to freshwater algae chlorella pyrenoidosa was investigated our results demonstrated that go underwent photo reduction under 25 day sunlight irradiation and the transformation was generally completed at day 8 the toxicological investigation showed that 8 day sunlight irradiation significantly increased growth inhibition of go 25 mg l to algal cells by 11 2 due to enhanced oxidative stress and stronger membrane damage low molecular weight lmw species were produced during the 8 day go transformation and they were identified as two types of aromatic compounds which played a crucial role in increasing toxicity the combined toxicity of go and cu2 ions before and after light irradiation was further investigated antagonistic effect was observed between the toxicity of pristine go and co existing cu2 ions after co irradiation of go and cu2 ions for 8 days their combined toxicity was unexpectedly lower or insignificant in comparison with the treatments of pristine go or pristine go in the presence of cu2 ions two mechanisms were revealed for this finding 1 cu2 ions suppressed the photo transformation of go 2 the toxicity of free cu2 ions was decreased through the adsorption retention of cu2 ions and formation of cu based nanoparticles e g cu2o and cu2s on the photo transformed go the provided data are helpful for better understanding the environmental process and risk of go under natural conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords graphene oxide photo transformation heavy metal combined toxicity membrane damage 1 introduction graphene oxide go as one of the most fascinating 2d nanomaterials has wide potential applications in the fields of photovoltaics energy storage biosensing biomedicine and wastewater treatments kim et al 2012 georgakilas et al 2016 the annual production of graphene materials 2000 tonnes year was much higher than other typical nanomaterials e g zno ag and carbon nanotubes arvidsson et al 2018 go materials are releasing into the environment during their life cycles goodwin et al 2018 doudrick et al 2015 zhao et al 2014 but there is scare information on the environmental concentration of go goodwin et al 2018 numerous works reported that go exhibited significant toxicity to various aquatic organisms such as algae invertebrates and fish under laboratory conditions zhao et al 2017 souza et al 2018 jeong et al 2015 it should be noted that go sheets are not stable chemically in aqueous environments and could be readily transformed under sunlight hou et al 2015 han et al 2019 the reduced go rgo is a main photo transformation product with significant changes in both graphitic structure and surface oxygen content it is reported that toxicity of go materials was highly dependent on their degree of reduction from chemical reductants e g hydrazine barrios et al 2019 therefore photo transformation and the associated changes in surface properties of go should be given adequate consideration when assessing the toxicity of go in natural environments however current research about the effect of photo transformation on go toxicity is rather limited hou et al 2017 indicated that photo transformation increased the go toxicity to escherichia coli due to enhanced membrane damage and oxidative stress however gao et al 2019 reported that the toxicity of go to e coli was irradiation time dependent short time 1 3 h uv irradiation enhanced the toxicity while long time irradiation 12 60 h decreased bacteria inactivation interestingly the cytotoxicity of go to murine macrophage cells j774a 1 decreased first during short time irradiation 4 8 12 h and increased after long time irradiation 72 168 h zhang et al 2018 these findings suggested that how photo transformation of go changes its toxicity is complicated it is reported that the changes in structure and surface oxygen content of go became gradually insignificant after continuous sunlight irradiation matsumoto et al 2011 thus the endpoint of photo transformation should be crucial for assessing go toxicity in natural environments in addition there is no report on the effect of photo transformation on go toxicity toward algae to the best of our knowledge considering that algae are sensitive to go exposure zhao et al 2017 and growing in light abundant systems photo transformation is more important for algae than other organisms such as bacteria and animal cells during go exposure therefore the effect of sunlight induced transformation on go toxicity to algae was investigated at the photo transformation endpoint and the roles of transformed products including residual transformed go and low molecular weight lmw species on total toxicity were determined go in aqueous environments inevitably co exposes with other contaminants heavy metals e g cu cd are the most reported contaminants for the combined toxicity investigations on go hu et al 2016 2018 deng et al 2017 in which antagonistic effect was observed for most of organisms due to the adsorption and precipitation of heavy metals on go surface it is noted that these go heavy metal interactions could be influenced by light irradiation and the toxicity is expected to be altered accordingly however the effect of light irradiation on the combined toxicity of go and heavy metals is unknown fe2 was reported to inhibit the photo transformation of go zhang et al 2018 while ag ions increased the reduction of go under light irradiation cao et al 2019 suggesting that go photo transformation could be regulated by heavy metals the adsorption of heavy metals on reduced go was lower than go due to reduced surface oxygen contents zhao et al 2014 therefore the bioavailable heavy metals after go photo transformation may be increased for organisms in addition ag ions were partially reduced to ag nanoparticles in the presence of go under light irradiation 400 650 nm cao et al 2019 but whether other metals e g cu2 could undergo similar reduction process is unknown therefore it is hypothesized that photo transformation could increase the combined toxicity of go and heavy metals and the mechanisms are related to 1 the regulation of co existing heavy metals on go photo transformation 2 the adsorption precipitation of heavy metals on go surface as affected by photo transformation and 3 possible transformation of heavy metals on go during light irradiation and its contribution on total toxicity overall freshwater algae chlorella pyrenoidesa was selected as a model organism and cu2 was selected for the co exposure contaminants in the present work our objectives were to 1 investigate the effect of photo transformation process on go toxicity to algal cells 2 identify the role of photo transformed go residuals and lmw species on the toxicity to algal cells and 3 assess the combined toxicity of go and cu2 ions as affected by light irradiation and reveal related mechanisms the obtained findings in the present work will provide new insight into the environmental process and risk of go in natural systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 photo transformation of go and characterization of pristine and transformed go go was purchased from nanjing xfnano china which was synthesized by the modified hummers method after sonication 100 w 40 khz for 30 min the prepared go suspensions 150 mg l were added into 100 ml quartz tubes 100 ml tube and then placed into photoreactor bl ghx v china with 1 kw xenon lamp 280 1100 nm as the simulated sunlight source the go photo transformation experiments were carried out at 25 c for 1 2 3 5 8 12 17 20 and 25 days the go suspensions at each irradiation time were sampled then the transformed go tgo along with pristine go in suspensions were characterized with raman spectroscopy dxr raman microscope thermo usa the collected residual tgo was examined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps k alpha usa and the xps data were analyzed by the xpspeak41 program based on these data the optimal reaction time for go photo transformation 8 days was obtained the newly prepared go suspensions 150 mg l were then irradiated for 8 days and the tgo suspensions were filtered with 0 45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride membrane jinteng china the obtained residual tgo on the membrane and soluble lmw species in the filtrate were stored for further characterization pristine go and residual tgo were further characterized by xps x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 advance germany transmission electron microscopy tem h 7650 hitachi japan and scanning electronic microscopy sem s 4800 hitachi japan were used for morphological characterization mass spectrometer agilent 6430 usa was used to identify the composition of lmw species and specific structures of the detected lmw species hou et al 2015 the absorbances of go suspensions under different light irradiation time 0 1 2 3 5 8 days were characterized by a uv visible spectrometer lambda 35 perkinelmer usa in addition zeta potentials of go and residual tgo 25 mg l in algal medium 1 10 se medium table s1 ph 6 95 7 05 were determined by a zetasizer nano series zs90 malvern britain the generated reactive oxygen species ros including oh 1o2 and o2 during go photo transformation under light irradiation were detected by electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer epr bruker a300 germany 2 2 effect of photo transformation on the toxicity of go to algal cells freshwater algae chlorella pyrenoidesa were purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of science china the algae were cultured in algal medium 1 10 se medium table s1 under light intensity of 216 μmol m2 s 14 10 light dark cycle at 24 c the 72 h growth inhibition of algal cells 5 105 cells ml was investigated as a function of go concentrations 5 10 15 20 30 40 and 50 mg l and the algal numbers in each treatment were counted with a light microscope jnoec china the 72 h median effective concentration 72 h ec50 was determined by linear regression analysis after logarithmic transformation of go concentrations in relation to the inhibition rates on algae the toxicity of go before and after light irradiation was further investigated and five treatments including un exposed control pristine go 25 mg l 72 h ec50 residual tgo 25 mg l lmw species corresponding to residual tgo at 25 mg l and tgo including both residual tgo and lmw species were performed after 72 h exposure the membrane integrity was detected by flow cytometry bd biosciences sanjose usa malina et al 2019 the generation of reactive oxygen species ros in algal cells was detected using 2 7 dichlorofluorescin diacetate h2dcfda as the ros indicator by fluorescence spectrophotometer f4600 hitachi japan in addition the effect of nutrient depletion from adsorption by go before and after photo transformation was studied zhao et al 2017 more specific details on the procedures for membrane damage ros detection and nutrient depletion were described in the supporting information si experiments s1 s2 and s3 2 3 combined toxicity of go and cu2 ions to algae the 72 h growth inhibition of algal cells 5 105 cells ml was investigated as a function of cu2 ions supplemented by cucl2 2h2o concentrations 0 005 0 01 0 03 0 05 0 07 0 1 and 0 5 mg l and the 72 h ec50 value of cu2 ions was calculated by linear regression analysis after logarithmic transformation of cu2 ions concentrations the combined toxicity of algae was investigated by following the additive index ai method marking and dawson 1975 zhao et al 2019a based on the ec50 ratio of go 25 0 mg l and cu2 ions 0 10 mg l the algal cells 5 105 cells ml were co exposed to a series of concentrations of go and cu2 ions at a fixed concentration ratio of 250 ec50 go ec50 cu ⅱ 250 for 72 h the ec50 value of go cu2 was calculated based on the obtained concentration response relationship the combined toxicity was calculated by equations 1 and 2 as follows 1 a m a i b m b i s 2 a i 1 s 1 s 1 0 o r a i 1 s 1 s 1 0 where a i or b i is the ec50 value of go or cu2 ions individually a m or b m is the ec50 value of go or cu2 ions in mixture s is the sum of biological activity and ai is defined as additive index ai 0 indicates that the combined toxicity of go and cu2 ions is simply additive ai 0 indicates the synergistic effect between go and cu2 ions ai 0 indicates the antagonistic effect between go and cu2 ions 2 4 photo transformation of go in the presence of cu2 ions and their combined toxicity to algae the go suspensions 150 mg l in the presence of cu2 ions 0 6 mg l concentration ratio go cu2 250 were irradiated for 8 days and the tgo suspensions tgo cu were obtained partial tgo cu suspensions were filtered with 0 45 μm membrane and the residual tgo cu was collected for further characterization simultaneously another treatment with the same concentrations of go and cu2 ions as in the suspensions go cu were conducted and incubated in dark for 8 days for comparison then the effect of light irradiation on go toxicity was investigated and five treatments were performed go 25 mg l cu2 ions 0 1 mg l go cu 25 mg l go and 0 1 mg l cu2 ions after 8 day incubation in dark tgo 25 mg l go after 8 day irradiation and tgo cu 25 mg l go and 0 1 mg l cu2 ions after 8 day light irradiation after 72 h exposure algal numbers were counted and growth inhibition for each treatment was obtained moreover the membrane damage of algal cells was assessed by flow cytometry 2 5 cu ii adsorption by pristine go and photo transformed go and characterization of go cu ii after photo transformation the adsorption of cu2 ions by pristine go 25 mg l and residual tgo 25 mg l in algal medium were investigated the suspensions of pristine go 25 mg l and residual tgo 25 mg l in the presence of cu2 ions 0 1 mg l were prepared in algal medium 1 10 se medium after shaken for 72 h at 25 c the suspensions were filtered with 0 22 μm membrane and the concentration of cu2 ions in the filtrates were determined by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms nexion 350x perkinelmer uk to investigate the effect of cu2 ions on go photo transformation the go suspensions after different irradiation time 0 1 2 3 5 8 days were characterized by a uv visible spectrometer and the obtained residual tgo cu was characterized by xps it is reported that ag ions could be transformed to particulate ag on go surface under light irradiation cao et al 2019 therefore high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem was used to identify possible formation of cu based nanoparticles during the light irradiation of go cu ii briefly residual tgo cu sample was placed onto a grid under ambient conditions and the measurement was carried out under 200 kv using hrtem jeol jem 2200fs japan 2 6 statistical analysis all the experiments were run at least three replicates the significant difference among different treatments for both photo transformation and toxicological investigations was performed by spss with lsd method we used p 0 05 for the statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 photo transformation of go the raman and xps spectra of go after light irradiation 0 25 days are shown in figure 1a and s2 the relative intensity ratio of d peak and g peak id ig from raman spectra represents the disorder and defect extent of go and is an important indicator for the photo transformation degree of go du et al 2017 during 8 day irradiation the id ig values were increased from 0 963 to 1 067 and then id ig values remained stable or slightly decreased with continuous irradiation 8 25 days figs 1a and s1 the increase in id ig values suggested that there were increasing graphene domains as well as less oxygen groups on go sheets after light irradiation thakur and karak 2012 therefore go underwent a photo reduction reaction and go had the highest reduction degree at day 8 xps spectra demonstrated that oxygen to carbon atom ratio o c ratio of go was obviously decreased after light irradiation confirming the occurrence of photo reduction on go sheets fig s2 the lowest o c ratio 0 192 was observed at the 8th day which was consistent with the raman data fig 1 a this is probably because continuous irradiation could further lead to the oxidization of the graphitic structure radich et al 2014 therefore go after 8 day irradiation was further characterized fig s3 exhibited that the color of go suspensions became much darker after 8 day irradiation uv visible absorbance of go suspensions increased from 1 15 to 1 53 with the maximum absorption peak λ max red shifted from 228 nm to 237 nm under light irradiation for 8 days fig 1b the optical properties of go were related to o containing groups on the surface of go and the red shifts of λ max and increased absorbance were attributed to the reduction of go zhu et al 2010 xps spectra showed that o c ratio of residual tgo significantly decreased in comparison with pristine go with the carbon content increasing from 36 3 to 57 9 and the o containing groups content decreasing from 63 7 to 42 1 figs 1c and s4 and table s2 therefore it is again confirmed that go underwent photo reduction after 8 day irradiation for xrd patterns go showed the diffraction peak 2θ 10 97 with the interlayer distance of go at 0 806 nm fig 1d after photo transformation the 2θ peak shifted to 13 60 with the interlayer distance of graphitic sheets decreased to 0 651 nm the main reason for the narrower interlayer distance was due to the reduction of o containing groups and the enhancement of π π interactions guex et al 2017 tem images fig 1e 1f indicated that go and residual tgo all existed in sheet like shapes broad lateral size visible wrinkles and the lateral sizes of go and residual tgo were around 2 μm residual tgo had much more wrinkles and edges than go the main reason was that the photo reduction of go firstly occurred at the edges and led to more edge defects du et al 2017 sem images indicated that the edges of residual tgo became more irregular than go fig s5 which was in agreement with tem observation fig 1e 1f 3 2 toxicity alteration of go from photo transformation and related mechanisms after 72 h go exposure the growth of algal cells was suppressed and the growth inhibition was increased with increasing go concentrations 0 50 mg l fig s6 the 72 h ec50 of go was calculated as approximately 25 0 mg l after light irradiation the obtained tgo suspensions caused significantly higher growth inhibition 66 1 than pristine go 54 9 fig 2 a suggesting that photo transformation increased the toxicity of go to algal cells after photo transformation residual tgo and the dissolved lmw byproducts are the main constituents in tgo suspensions therefore growth inhibition induced by residual tgo and lmw species was examined it is observed that residual tgo 25 mg l showed significantly lower toxicity than go and tgo p 0 05 indicating that lmw species may also play an important role in the growth inhibition in tgo suspensions indeed lmw species significantly inhibited the growth of algae by 34 fig 2a hou et al 2017 also detected the released lmw species but observed no effect of lmw species on bacteria growth there are two possible reasons for the above different findings 1 the production of lmw species was increased with continuous light irradiation hou et al 2015 and irradiation time in the present work 8 days was much longer than in the study by hou et al 2017 10 h thus producing more lmw species 2 the toxicity of lmw species is organism species dependent other reports did not consider the contribution of lmw species in total toxicity towards different organisms such as bacteria gao et al 2019 zhao et al 2019b and animal cells zhang et al 2018 for the first time the important role of lmw species in the toxicity of go to algae from photo transformation was observed in the present work membrane damage a crucial indicator for graphene induced toxicity to algae was investigated using flow cytometry fig 2b showed that the degrees of membrane damage followed the order of tgo residual tgo go lmw control tgo caused the strongest membrane damage to algal cells which was in agreement with the growth inhibition results fig 2a interestingly membrane damage induced by residual tgo was higher than pristine go over generation of intracellular ros and physical membrane damage are two possible mechanisms for the observed membrane damage zhao et al 2017 fig 2c showed that the accumulation of intracellular ros followed an order of tgo residual tgo go lmw which was positively related to the order on membrane damage therefore the over generation of intracellular ros could be a major reason for membrane damage in addition fig s7 showed that algal cells were aggregated with residual tgo sheets while there was no go algae aggregate in the images residual tgo sheets had lower o containing groups table s2 and less negative surface charges fig s8 than pristine go the surface of residual tgo became much more hydrophobic after photo transformation as indicated by lower o c ratio fig s2 therefore weaker electrostatic repulsion and stronger hydrophobic interaction are two reasons for the observed stronger aggregation of algae with residual tgo than pristine go aggregation induced direct attachment could lead to physical damage on algal membrane which is likely another reason for the higher membrane damage caused by residual tgo in comparison to pristine go zhao et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 it is revealed that go could adsorb nutrient elements in the medium and then result in nutrient depletion induced indirect toxicity to algae zhao et al 2017 fig 3 a showed that the growth of algal cells was significantly suppressed in both go and residual tgo removed media demonstrating the occurrence of nutrient depletion during the exposure of go and residual tgo moreover residual tgo 22 3 caused significantly lower nutrient depletion than go 34 9 fig 3a which could explain the weaker toxicity of residual tgo than go although residual tgo resulted in stronger membrane damage due to the high sensitivity of algal cells on the depletion of n p ca and mg zhao et al 2017 the adsorption of these four macro elements by go and residual tgo was further investigated fig 3b showed that both go and residual tgo could adsorb n p ca2 and mg2 the decrease in the adsorption of n and p was not observed for residual tgo in comparison with go therefore n and p did not play important role in the observed suppression on nutrient depletion during go photo transformation obviously residual tgo significantly increased the concentration of ca2 and mg2 than go the lower adsorption of ca2 and mg2 by residual tgo was due to lower o containing groups and more positive zeta potentials fig 1c s4 and s8 mg2 and ca2 play significant role in the growth and metabolism of algae esakkimuthu et al 2016 gorain et al 2013 therefore the lower depletion of ca2 and mg2 by residual tgo than go could be responsible for the decrease in nutrient depletion induced indirect toxicity of go after photo transformation fig 3a the dissolved byproducts lmw species during go photo transformation were identified from the mass spectrum fig 3c two types of dominant lmw species with the m z ratios of 149 0 and 155 2 were obtained the proposed structures of these two aromatic compounds are exhibited in fig 3c which belong to phthalic anhydride and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah derivatives respectively a large number of ros oh 1o2 and o2 could generate under go photo transformation fig s9 and induced the formation of lmw species in the present work through the above two possible processes 1 ros e g oh attacked go surface thus inducing the formation of oh groups and the oxidation of c oh to co and cooh groups du et al 2018 2 ros attacked the cc bonds and resulted in the ring opening of aromatic rings and fragmentation of go sheets radich and kamat 2013 similar oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives were reported as the oxidized products during the photo transformation of go driven by a photo fenton reaction zhou et al 2012 hou et al 2015 aromatic compounds including pah compounds are recognized to be toxic to aquatic organisms pah compounds were reported to induce conformational changes of algal membranes which would then lead to algal membrane damage mccann and solomon 2000 in addition pah compounds could adsorb visible light 400 800 nm and then generate 1o2 for further oxidative damage to membrane fu et al 2012 croxton et al 2015 therefore membrane damage of algae is an important target for pah exposure which is in good agreement with the finding on the membrane damage caused by lmw species fig 2b 3 3 combined toxicity of go and cu2 ions as affected by photo transformation growth inhibition was investigated first in the presence of cu2 ions fig s10 cu2 ions showed strong toxicity to algae with the ec50 value at 0 10 mg l cu2 ions could accelerate ros generation and cause oxidative stress to algae chen et al 2016 which were recognized as the toxicity mechanism of cu2 ions combined toxicity of go and cu2 ions concentration ratio 250 was studied based on an ai method fig 4 a growth inhibition was increased with increasing exposure concentrations of go and cu2 ions when the concentrations of go 25 mg l and cu2 ions 0 1 mg l were at their respective ec50 values the growth inhibition was only 47 8 after co exposure to go and cu2 ions fig 4a suggesting the antagonistic effect of go and cu2 ions the ai value was calculated as 1 56 ai 0 confirming that the combined toxic processes were antagonistic in addition the antagonistic effect of go and cu2 ions was observed after different exposure times 24 48 72 and 96 h fig s11 sunlight is an important environmental factor during the interaction of go and cu2 ions in natural environments therefore go suspensions in the presence of cu2 ions were irradiated at simulated sunlight for 8 days and then exposed to algal cells for the combined toxicological investigation fig 4b go sheets and cu2 ions after co irradiation tgo cu exhibited significantly lower toxicity than go or tgo demonstrating strong antagonism towards algae there was no significant difference between the growth inhibition of tgo cu and go cu although tgo had much stronger toxicity than go fig 2a flow cytometry results also showed that tgo cu had significantly lower membrane damage to algal cells than tgo fig 4c thus the reduction in membrane damage was a possible mechanism for the relieved toxicity of tgo cu moreover insignificant difference was observed on the membrane damage of tgo cu and go cu fig 4c which is consistent with the growth inhibition result fig 4b unexpectedly tgo cu showed lower or insignificant toxicity in comparison with go go cu and tgo from both growth inhibition and membrane damage results there are two hypothesized mechanisms for this finding 1 cu2 ions suppressed the photo transformation of go mechanism i and ii the toxicity of cu2 ions was decreased during go photo transformation mechanism ii the detailed mechanisms are investigated in the following section 3 4 toxicity mechanisms of go and cu2 ions after photo transformation under light irradiation the uv visible absorbance of go suspensions in the presence of cu2 ions increased from 1 15 at 228 nm to 1 37 at 241 nm fig 4d suggesting the occurrence of photo transformation on go sheets this increase in absorbance of tgo cu 1 37 at 241 nm was less than go 1 53 at 237 nm alone after light irradiation fig 1b higher absorbance of tgo suggested stronger transformation degree of tgo than tgo cu hou et al 2015 the xps spectra showed that residual tgo cu contained more o containing groups 49 1 and less carbon contents 50 9 than residual tgo 42 1 of o containing groups 57 9 of carbon contents figs 4e and 1c thus it can be concluded that cu2 ions suppressed the photo transformation of go and more o containing groups remained on the surface of residual tgo cu go is regarded as a photo reactive semiconductor and could generate electron e hole pair h and ros under light irradiation fig s9 it is well known that photo transformation of go was mediated by the separation of e h pairs hou et al 2015 and the standard redox potential of e h pairs was 0 7 v jiang et al 2016 while the standard redox potential of cu ⅱ i was 0 15 v therefore cu2 ions could compete with go for e thus suppressing the photo reduction of go in the system due to weaker photo transformation the amount of the produced lmw species from tgo cu would be lower and mechanism i as mentioned above for the observed insignificant difference between tgo cu and go cu is confirmed the adsorption of cu2 ions by residual tgo and go were shown in fig s12 cu2 ions were strongly adsorbed by pristine go 41 4 which should be the main mechanism for the observed antagonistic effect between go and cu2 ions fig 4a the residual tgo showed much lower cu2 ions adsorption than go owing to the removal of o containing groups e g cooh tgo cu also showed much lower oxygen contents than go table s2 therefore the adsorption retention of cu2 ions on the surface of residual tgo cu should be lower than go this is inconsistent with our finding that there is no significant difference for the combined toxicity of go cu2 before and after transformation fig 4b it is thus hypothesized that additional cu ii species may be immobilized on the graphitic surface during photo transformation therefore residual tgo cu was further characterized using hrtem interestingly nanosized particles 5 10 nm with high electron density were observed on the surface of the graphitic sheets fig 5 a 5b the lattice fringes of ⅰ and ⅱ with the interplanar spacing at 0 198 nm and 0 241 nm were identified as 110 and 002 planes of cu2s nanocrystals the lattice fringe of ⅲ with 0 244 nm interplanar spacing was identified as 111 plane of cu2o nanocrystals fig 5c 5d xps spectra confirmed that most of cu on the surface of tgo cu was in the form of cu i fig s13 hence cu2 ions were transformed to cu2o and cu2s nanoparticles on go surface under light irradiation wang et al 2019 demonstrated that cu2 ions were transformed to cu2o particles and grown on the surface of g c3n4 sheets under light irradiation which could support the finding in the present study it is known that go could generate e h and a series of ros 1o2 o2 oh under sunlight irradiation fig s9 therefore cu ⅱ on the surface of go sheets could trap e generated by go and be reduced to cu ⅰ during photo transformation cu2o nanoparticles were thus formed from cu ⅰ with the assistance of ros on the surface of graphitic sheets wang et al 2019 however the reduction of cu ⅱ to cu0 was infeasible because of the redox potentials of cu ii 0 0 34 v was much higher than that of cu ⅱ ⅰ 0 15 v moreover e was easily to recombine with h foster et al 1995 therefore cu ⅱ cannot be reduced to cu0 in our case which was confirmed by the hrtem results that cu0 nanoparticles were not found on the surface of graphitic sheets fig 5 to our knowledge this is the first report that cu2 ions were transformed to cu2o nanoparticles on the surface of go sheets under light irradiation in addition go as prepared from hummers method contained 2 0 of s fig s14 it is not surprising that cu2s was formed from cu i and cu2o by sulfidation because the solubility product value k sp of cu2s 2 5 10 48 25 c was significantly lower than cu2o 2 0 10 15 25 c the above chemical reactions were shown in equations 3 6 vinu and madras 2008 wang et al 2019 3 go cu 2 go cu ⅱ 4 go cu ⅱ h v go e h cu ⅱ e go cu ⅰ 5 go cu ⅰ r o s go cu 2 o s 6 2 go cu 2 o s 2 s 2 2 go cu 2 s s o 2 it is reported that cu2o nanoparticles had lower toxicity than soluble cu2 ions towards aquatic organisms e g zebrafish chen et al 2011 although there is no report on cu2s toxicity the toxicity of cu2 ions should be much lower after sulfidation dharsana et al 2015 moreover the observed cu2o and cu2s nanoparticles were bound on the surface of residual tgo cu which should limit the direct contact and uptake by algal cells therefore toxicity of cu2 ions was decreased during go photo transformation through cu2 ions adsorption and the formation of cu based nanoparticles on graphitic surface mechanism ii 4 conclusions and environmental implications go is chemically unstable in aquatic environments which brings difficulties in accessing its toxicity under natural conditions our work revealed that go underwent photo transformation during 25 day sunlight irradiation with the highest transformation reduction at day 8 go after photo transformation exhibited stronger toxicity to algal cells the released byproducts lmw species identified as aromatic compounds played an important role in the increased toxicity this is the first time that significant contribution of lmw species was reported to the best of our knowledge it should be noted that go also underwent biotransformation in mammal animals qi et al 2018 and have a great potential in biomedical applications georgakilas et al 2016 the subsequent toxicity of lmw species should be paid more attention because the long term exposure of the produced aromatic compounds is harmful to human health interestingly it is found that the toxicity of co irradiated go and cu2 ions did not show stronger toxicity than pristine go the mechanisms are revealed as 1 the suppression of go transformation by cu2 ions and 2 the adsorption retention of cu2 ions and the formation of cu2o and cu2s nanoparticles on tgo surface this finding suggested that the combined toxicity of go and cu2 ions was antagonism under sunlight irradiation the formation of cu2o and cu2s nanoparticles on tgo could provide new insight in the fate and geochemical process of cu2 ions in aqueous environments in addition to cu2 ions other ionic species e g fe3 cl br and natural organic matter could also regulate photo transformation of go du et al 2017 liu et al 2017 therefore the toxicity of go as well as combined toxicity with other contaminants could be changed in natural waters which deserves further investigations in addition to algae various other organisms e g invertebrates fish in aquatic environments were also sensitive to go exposure souza et al 2018 jeong et al 2015 and the toxicity mechanisms towards these organisms were similar e g oxidative stress souza et al 2017 therefore the revealed mechanism as mediated by photo transformation in

17971,graphene oxide go sheets are unstable in aqueous environments and the effect of photo transformation on go toxicity to freshwater algae chlorella pyrenoidosa was investigated our results demonstrated that go underwent photo reduction under 25 day sunlight irradiation and the transformation was generally completed at day 8 the toxicological investigation showed that 8 day sunlight irradiation significantly increased growth inhibition of go 25 mg l to algal cells by 11 2 due to enhanced oxidative stress and stronger membrane damage low molecular weight lmw species were produced during the 8 day go transformation and they were identified as two types of aromatic compounds which played a crucial role in increasing toxicity the combined toxicity of go and cu2 ions before and after light irradiation was further investigated antagonistic effect was observed between the toxicity of pristine go and co existing cu2 ions after co irradiation of go and cu2 ions for 8 days their combined toxicity was unexpectedly lower or insignificant in comparison with the treatments of pristine go or pristine go in the presence of cu2 ions two mechanisms were revealed for this finding 1 cu2 ions suppressed the photo transformation of go 2 the toxicity of free cu2 ions was decreased through the adsorption retention of cu2 ions and formation of cu based nanoparticles e g cu2o and cu2s on the photo transformed go the provided data are helpful for better understanding the environmental process and risk of go under natural conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords graphene oxide photo transformation heavy metal combined toxicity membrane damage 1 introduction graphene oxide go as one of the most fascinating 2d nanomaterials has wide potential applications in the fields of photovoltaics energy storage biosensing biomedicine and wastewater treatments kim et al 2012 georgakilas et al 2016 the annual production of graphene materials 2000 tonnes year was much higher than other typical nanomaterials e g zno ag and carbon nanotubes arvidsson et al 2018 go materials are releasing into the environment during their life cycles goodwin et al 2018 doudrick et al 2015 zhao et al 2014 but there is scare information on the environmental concentration of go goodwin et al 2018 numerous works reported that go exhibited significant toxicity to various aquatic organisms such as algae invertebrates and fish under laboratory conditions zhao et al 2017 souza et al 2018 jeong et al 2015 it should be noted that go sheets are not stable chemically in aqueous environments and could be readily transformed under sunlight hou et al 2015 han et al 2019 the reduced go rgo is a main photo transformation product with significant changes in both graphitic structure and surface oxygen content it is reported that toxicity of go materials was highly dependent on their degree of reduction from chemical reductants e g hydrazine barrios et al 2019 therefore photo transformation and the associated changes in surface properties of go should be given adequate consideration when assessing the toxicity of go in natural environments however current research about the effect of photo transformation on go toxicity is rather limited hou et al 2017 indicated that photo transformation increased the go toxicity to escherichia coli due to enhanced membrane damage and oxidative stress however gao et al 2019 reported that the toxicity of go to e coli was irradiation time dependent short time 1 3 h uv irradiation enhanced the toxicity while long time irradiation 12 60 h decreased bacteria inactivation interestingly the cytotoxicity of go to murine macrophage cells j774a 1 decreased first during short time irradiation 4 8 12 h and increased after long time irradiation 72 168 h zhang et al 2018 these findings suggested that how photo transformation of go changes its toxicity is complicated it is reported that the changes in structure and surface oxygen content of go became gradually insignificant after continuous sunlight irradiation matsumoto et al 2011 thus the endpoint of photo transformation should be crucial for assessing go toxicity in natural environments in addition there is no report on the effect of photo transformation on go toxicity toward algae to the best of our knowledge considering that algae are sensitive to go exposure zhao et al 2017 and growing in light abundant systems photo transformation is more important for algae than other organisms such as bacteria and animal cells during go exposure therefore the effect of sunlight induced transformation on go toxicity to algae was investigated at the photo transformation endpoint and the roles of transformed products including residual transformed go and low molecular weight lmw species on total toxicity were determined go in aqueous environments inevitably co exposes with other contaminants heavy metals e g cu cd are the most reported contaminants for the combined toxicity investigations on go hu et al 2016 2018 deng et al 2017 in which antagonistic effect was observed for most of organisms due to the adsorption and precipitation of heavy metals on go surface it is noted that these go heavy metal interactions could be influenced by light irradiation and the toxicity is expected to be altered accordingly however the effect of light irradiation on the combined toxicity of go and heavy metals is unknown fe2 was reported to inhibit the photo transformation of go zhang et al 2018 while ag ions increased the reduction of go under light irradiation cao et al 2019 suggesting that go photo transformation could be regulated by heavy metals the adsorption of heavy metals on reduced go was lower than go due to reduced surface oxygen contents zhao et al 2014 therefore the bioavailable heavy metals after go photo transformation may be increased for organisms in addition ag ions were partially reduced to ag nanoparticles in the presence of go under light irradiation 400 650 nm cao et al 2019 but whether other metals e g cu2 could undergo similar reduction process is unknown therefore it is hypothesized that photo transformation could increase the combined toxicity of go and heavy metals and the mechanisms are related to 1 the regulation of co existing heavy metals on go photo transformation 2 the adsorption precipitation of heavy metals on go surface as affected by photo transformation and 3 possible transformation of heavy metals on go during light irradiation and its contribution on total toxicity overall freshwater algae chlorella pyrenoidesa was selected as a model organism and cu2 was selected for the co exposure contaminants in the present work our objectives were to 1 investigate the effect of photo transformation process on go toxicity to algal cells 2 identify the role of photo transformed go residuals and lmw species on the toxicity to algal cells and 3 assess the combined toxicity of go and cu2 ions as affected by light irradiation and reveal related mechanisms the obtained findings in the present work will provide new insight into the environmental process and risk of go in natural systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 photo transformation of go and characterization of pristine and transformed go go was purchased from nanjing xfnano china which was synthesized by the modified hummers method after sonication 100 w 40 khz for 30 min the prepared go suspensions 150 mg l were added into 100 ml quartz tubes 100 ml tube and then placed into photoreactor bl ghx v china with 1 kw xenon lamp 280 1100 nm as the simulated sunlight source the go photo transformation experiments were carried out at 25 c for 1 2 3 5 8 12 17 20 and 25 days the go suspensions at each irradiation time were sampled then the transformed go tgo along with pristine go in suspensions were characterized with raman spectroscopy dxr raman microscope thermo usa the collected residual tgo was examined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps k alpha usa and the xps data were analyzed by the xpspeak41 program based on these data the optimal reaction time for go photo transformation 8 days was obtained the newly prepared go suspensions 150 mg l were then irradiated for 8 days and the tgo suspensions were filtered with 0 45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride membrane jinteng china the obtained residual tgo on the membrane and soluble lmw species in the filtrate were stored for further characterization pristine go and residual tgo were further characterized by xps x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 advance germany transmission electron microscopy tem h 7650 hitachi japan and scanning electronic microscopy sem s 4800 hitachi japan were used for morphological characterization mass spectrometer agilent 6430 usa was used to identify the composition of lmw species and specific structures of the detected lmw species hou et al 2015 the absorbances of go suspensions under different light irradiation time 0 1 2 3 5 8 days were characterized by a uv visible spectrometer lambda 35 perkinelmer usa in addition zeta potentials of go and residual tgo 25 mg l in algal medium 1 10 se medium table s1 ph 6 95 7 05 were determined by a zetasizer nano series zs90 malvern britain the generated reactive oxygen species ros including oh 1o2 and o2 during go photo transformation under light irradiation were detected by electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer epr bruker a300 germany 2 2 effect of photo transformation on the toxicity of go to algal cells freshwater algae chlorella pyrenoidesa were purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of science china the algae were cultured in algal medium 1 10 se medium table s1 under light intensity of 216 μmol m2 s 14 10 light dark cycle at 24 c the 72 h growth inhibition of algal cells 5 105 cells ml was investigated as a function of go concentrations 5 10 15 20 30 40 and 50 mg l and the algal numbers in each treatment were counted with a light microscope jnoec china the 72 h median effective concentration 72 h ec50 was determined by linear regression analysis after logarithmic transformation of go concentrations in relation to the inhibition rates on algae the toxicity of go before and after light irradiation was further investigated and five treatments including un exposed control pristine go 25 mg l 72 h ec50 residual tgo 25 mg l lmw species corresponding to residual tgo at 25 mg l and tgo including both residual tgo and lmw species were performed after 72 h exposure the membrane integrity was detected by flow cytometry bd biosciences sanjose usa malina et al 2019 the generation of reactive oxygen species ros in algal cells was detected using 2 7 dichlorofluorescin diacetate h2dcfda as the ros indicator by fluorescence spectrophotometer f4600 hitachi japan in addition the effect of nutrient depletion from adsorption by go before and after photo transformation was studied zhao et al 2017 more specific details on the procedures for membrane damage ros detection and nutrient depletion were described in the supporting information si experiments s1 s2 and s3 2 3 combined toxicity of go and cu2 ions to algae the 72 h growth inhibition of algal cells 5 105 cells ml was investigated as a function of cu2 ions supplemented by cucl2 2h2o concentrations 0 005 0 01 0 03 0 05 0 07 0 1 and 0 5 mg l and the 72 h ec50 value of cu2 ions was calculated by linear regression analysis after logarithmic transformation of cu2 ions concentrations the combined toxicity of algae was investigated by following the additive index ai method marking and dawson 1975 zhao et al 2019a based on the ec50 ratio of go 25 0 mg l and cu2 ions 0 10 mg l the algal cells 5 105 cells ml were co exposed to a series of concentrations of go and cu2 ions at a fixed concentration ratio of 250 ec50 go ec50 cu ⅱ 250 for 72 h the ec50 value of go cu2 was calculated based on the obtained concentration response relationship the combined toxicity was calculated by equations 1 and 2 as follows 1 a m a i b m b i s 2 a i 1 s 1 s 1 0 o r a i 1 s 1 s 1 0 where a i or b i is the ec50 value of go or cu2 ions individually a m or b m is the ec50 value of go or cu2 ions in mixture s is the sum of biological activity and ai is defined as additive index ai 0 indicates that the combined toxicity of go and cu2 ions is simply additive ai 0 indicates the synergistic effect between go and cu2 ions ai 0 indicates the antagonistic effect between go and cu2 ions 2 4 photo transformation of go in the presence of cu2 ions and their combined toxicity to algae the go suspensions 150 mg l in the presence of cu2 ions 0 6 mg l concentration ratio go cu2 250 were irradiated for 8 days and the tgo suspensions tgo cu were obtained partial tgo cu suspensions were filtered with 0 45 μm membrane and the residual tgo cu was collected for further characterization simultaneously another treatment with the same concentrations of go and cu2 ions as in the suspensions go cu were conducted and incubated in dark for 8 days for comparison then the effect of light irradiation on go toxicity was investigated and five treatments were performed go 25 mg l cu2 ions 0 1 mg l go cu 25 mg l go and 0 1 mg l cu2 ions after 8 day incubation in dark tgo 25 mg l go after 8 day irradiation and tgo cu 25 mg l go and 0 1 mg l cu2 ions after 8 day light irradiation after 72 h exposure algal numbers were counted and growth inhibition for each treatment was obtained moreover the membrane damage of algal cells was assessed by flow cytometry 2 5 cu ii adsorption by pristine go and photo transformed go and characterization of go cu ii after photo transformation the adsorption of cu2 ions by pristine go 25 mg l and residual tgo 25 mg l in algal medium were investigated the suspensions of pristine go 25 mg l and residual tgo 25 mg l in the presence of cu2 ions 0 1 mg l were prepared in algal medium 1 10 se medium after shaken for 72 h at 25 c the suspensions were filtered with 0 22 μm membrane and the concentration of cu2 ions in the filtrates were determined by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms nexion 350x perkinelmer uk to investigate the effect of cu2 ions on go photo transformation the go suspensions after different irradiation time 0 1 2 3 5 8 days were characterized by a uv visible spectrometer and the obtained residual tgo cu was characterized by xps it is reported that ag ions could be transformed to particulate ag on go surface under light irradiation cao et al 2019 therefore high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem was used to identify possible formation of cu based nanoparticles during the light irradiation of go cu ii briefly residual tgo cu sample was placed onto a grid under ambient conditions and the measurement was carried out under 200 kv using hrtem jeol jem 2200fs japan 2 6 statistical analysis all the experiments were run at least three replicates the significant difference among different treatments for both photo transformation and toxicological investigations was performed by spss with lsd method we used p 0 05 for the statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 photo transformation of go the raman and xps spectra of go after light irradiation 0 25 days are shown in figure 1a and s2 the relative intensity ratio of d peak and g peak id ig from raman spectra represents the disorder and defect extent of go and is an important indicator for the photo transformation degree of go du et al 2017 during 8 day irradiation the id ig values were increased from 0 963 to 1 067 and then id ig values remained stable or slightly decreased with continuous irradiation 8 25 days figs 1a and s1 the increase in id ig values suggested that there were increasing graphene domains as well as less oxygen groups on go sheets after light irradiation thakur and karak 2012 therefore go underwent a photo reduction reaction and go had the highest reduction degree at day 8 xps spectra demonstrated that oxygen to carbon atom ratio o c ratio of go was obviously decreased after light irradiation confirming the occurrence of photo reduction on go sheets fig s2 the lowest o c ratio 0 192 was observed at the 8th day which was consistent with the raman data fig 1 a this is probably because continuous irradiation could further lead to the oxidization of the graphitic structure radich et al 2014 therefore go after 8 day irradiation was further characterized fig s3 exhibited that the color of go suspensions became much darker after 8 day irradiation uv visible absorbance of go suspensions increased from 1 15 to 1 53 with the maximum absorption peak λ max red shifted from 228 nm to 237 nm under light irradiation for 8 days fig 1b the optical properties of go were related to o containing groups on the surface of go and the red shifts of λ max and increased absorbance were attributed to the reduction of go zhu et al 2010 xps spectra showed that o c ratio of residual tgo significantly decreased in comparison with pristine go with the carbon content increasing from 36 3 to 57 9 and the o containing groups content decreasing from 63 7 to 42 1 figs 1c and s4 and table s2 therefore it is again confirmed that go underwent photo reduction after 8 day irradiation for xrd patterns go showed the diffraction peak 2θ 10 97 with the interlayer distance of go at 0 806 nm fig 1d after photo transformation the 2θ peak shifted to 13 60 with the interlayer distance of graphitic sheets decreased to 0 651 nm the main reason for the narrower interlayer distance was due to the reduction of o containing groups and the enhancement of π π interactions guex et al 2017 tem images fig 1e 1f indicated that go and residual tgo all existed in sheet like shapes broad lateral size visible wrinkles and the lateral sizes of go and residual tgo were around 2 μm residual tgo had much more wrinkles and edges than go the main reason was that the photo reduction of go firstly occurred at the edges and led to more edge defects du et al 2017 sem images indicated that the edges of residual tgo became more irregular than go fig s5 which was in agreement with tem observation fig 1e 1f 3 2 toxicity alteration of go from photo transformation and related mechanisms after 72 h go exposure the growth of algal cells was suppressed and the growth inhibition was increased with increasing go concentrations 0 50 mg l fig s6 the 72 h ec50 of go was calculated as approximately 25 0 mg l after light irradiation the obtained tgo suspensions caused significantly higher growth inhibition 66 1 than pristine go 54 9 fig 2 a suggesting that photo transformation increased the toxicity of go to algal cells after photo transformation residual tgo and the dissolved lmw byproducts are the main constituents in tgo suspensions therefore growth inhibition induced by residual tgo and lmw species was examined it is observed that residual tgo 25 mg l showed significantly lower toxicity than go and tgo p 0 05 indicating that lmw species may also play an important role in the growth inhibition in tgo suspensions indeed lmw species significantly inhibited the growth of algae by 34 fig 2a hou et al 2017 also detected the released lmw species but observed no effect of lmw species on bacteria growth there are two possible reasons for the above different findings 1 the production of lmw species was increased with continuous light irradiation hou et al 2015 and irradiation time in the present work 8 days was much longer than in the study by hou et al 2017 10 h thus producing more lmw species 2 the toxicity of lmw species is organism species dependent other reports did not consider the contribution of lmw species in total toxicity towards different organisms such as bacteria gao et al 2019 zhao et al 2019b and animal cells zhang et al 2018 for the first time the important role of lmw species in the toxicity of go to algae from photo transformation was observed in the present work membrane damage a crucial indicator for graphene induced toxicity to algae was investigated using flow cytometry fig 2b showed that the degrees of membrane damage followed the order of tgo residual tgo go lmw control tgo caused the strongest membrane damage to algal cells which was in agreement with the growth inhibition results fig 2a interestingly membrane damage induced by residual tgo was higher than pristine go over generation of intracellular ros and physical membrane damage are two possible mechanisms for the observed membrane damage zhao et al 2017 fig 2c showed that the accumulation of intracellular ros followed an order of tgo residual tgo go lmw which was positively related to the order on membrane damage therefore the over generation of intracellular ros could be a major reason for membrane damage in addition fig s7 showed that algal cells were aggregated with residual tgo sheets while there was no go algae aggregate in the images residual tgo sheets had lower o containing groups table s2 and less negative surface charges fig s8 than pristine go the surface of residual tgo became much more hydrophobic after photo transformation as indicated by lower o c ratio fig s2 therefore weaker electrostatic repulsion and stronger hydrophobic interaction are two reasons for the observed stronger aggregation of algae with residual tgo than pristine go aggregation induced direct attachment could lead to physical damage on algal membrane which is likely another reason for the higher membrane damage caused by residual tgo in comparison to pristine go zhao et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 it is revealed that go could adsorb nutrient elements in the medium and then result in nutrient depletion induced indirect toxicity to algae zhao et al 2017 fig 3 a showed that the growth of algal cells was significantly suppressed in both go and residual tgo removed media demonstrating the occurrence of nutrient depletion during the exposure of go and residual tgo moreover residual tgo 22 3 caused significantly lower nutrient depletion than go 34 9 fig 3a which could explain the weaker toxicity of residual tgo than go although residual tgo resulted in stronger membrane damage due to the high sensitivity of algal cells on the depletion of n p ca and mg zhao et al 2017 the adsorption of these four macro elements by go and residual tgo was further investigated fig 3b showed that both go and residual tgo could adsorb n p ca2 and mg2 the decrease in the adsorption of n and p was not observed for residual tgo in comparison with go therefore n and p did not play important role in the observed suppression on nutrient depletion during go photo transformation obviously residual tgo significantly increased the concentration of ca2 and mg2 than go the lower adsorption of ca2 and mg2 by residual tgo was due to lower o containing groups and more positive zeta potentials fig 1c s4 and s8 mg2 and ca2 play significant role in the growth and metabolism of algae esakkimuthu et al 2016 gorain et al 2013 therefore the lower depletion of ca2 and mg2 by residual tgo than go could be responsible for the decrease in nutrient depletion induced indirect toxicity of go after photo transformation fig 3a the dissolved byproducts lmw species during go photo transformation were identified from the mass spectrum fig 3c two types of dominant lmw species with the m z ratios of 149 0 and 155 2 were obtained the proposed structures of these two aromatic compounds are exhibited in fig 3c which belong to phthalic anhydride and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah derivatives respectively a large number of ros oh 1o2 and o2 could generate under go photo transformation fig s9 and induced the formation of lmw species in the present work through the above two possible processes 1 ros e g oh attacked go surface thus inducing the formation of oh groups and the oxidation of c oh to co and cooh groups du et al 2018 2 ros attacked the cc bonds and resulted in the ring opening of aromatic rings and fragmentation of go sheets radich and kamat 2013 similar oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives were reported as the oxidized products during the photo transformation of go driven by a photo fenton reaction zhou et al 2012 hou et al 2015 aromatic compounds including pah compounds are recognized to be toxic to aquatic organisms pah compounds were reported to induce conformational changes of algal membranes which would then lead to algal membrane damage mccann and solomon 2000 in addition pah compounds could adsorb visible light 400 800 nm and then generate 1o2 for further oxidative damage to membrane fu et al 2012 croxton et al 2015 therefore membrane damage of algae is an important target for pah exposure which is in good agreement with the finding on the membrane damage caused by lmw species fig 2b 3 3 combined toxicity of go and cu2 ions as affected by photo transformation growth inhibition was investigated first in the presence of cu2 ions fig s10 cu2 ions showed strong toxicity to algae with the ec50 value at 0 10 mg l cu2 ions could accelerate ros generation and cause oxidative stress to algae chen et al 2016 which were recognized as the toxicity mechanism of cu2 ions combined toxicity of go and cu2 ions concentration ratio 250 was studied based on an ai method fig 4 a growth inhibition was increased with increasing exposure concentrations of go and cu2 ions when the concentrations of go 25 mg l and cu2 ions 0 1 mg l were at their respective ec50 values the growth inhibition was only 47 8 after co exposure to go and cu2 ions fig 4a suggesting the antagonistic effect of go and cu2 ions the ai value was calculated as 1 56 ai 0 confirming that the combined toxic processes were antagonistic in addition the antagonistic effect of go and cu2 ions was observed after different exposure times 24 48 72 and 96 h fig s11 sunlight is an important environmental factor during the interaction of go and cu2 ions in natural environments therefore go suspensions in the presence of cu2 ions were irradiated at simulated sunlight for 8 days and then exposed to algal cells for the combined toxicological investigation fig 4b go sheets and cu2 ions after co irradiation tgo cu exhibited significantly lower toxicity than go or tgo demonstrating strong antagonism towards algae there was no significant difference between the growth inhibition of tgo cu and go cu although tgo had much stronger toxicity than go fig 2a flow cytometry results also showed that tgo cu had significantly lower membrane damage to algal cells than tgo fig 4c thus the reduction in membrane damage was a possible mechanism for the relieved toxicity of tgo cu moreover insignificant difference was observed on the membrane damage of tgo cu and go cu fig 4c which is consistent with the growth inhibition result fig 4b unexpectedly tgo cu showed lower or insignificant toxicity in comparison with go go cu and tgo from both growth inhibition and membrane damage results there are two hypothesized mechanisms for this finding 1 cu2 ions suppressed the photo transformation of go mechanism i and ii the toxicity of cu2 ions was decreased during go photo transformation mechanism ii the detailed mechanisms are investigated in the following section 3 4 toxicity mechanisms of go and cu2 ions after photo transformation under light irradiation the uv visible absorbance of go suspensions in the presence of cu2 ions increased from 1 15 at 228 nm to 1 37 at 241 nm fig 4d suggesting the occurrence of photo transformation on go sheets this increase in absorbance of tgo cu 1 37 at 241 nm was less than go 1 53 at 237 nm alone after light irradiation fig 1b higher absorbance of tgo suggested stronger transformation degree of tgo than tgo cu hou et al 2015 the xps spectra showed that residual tgo cu contained more o containing groups 49 1 and less carbon contents 50 9 than residual tgo 42 1 of o containing groups 57 9 of carbon contents figs 4e and 1c thus it can be concluded that cu2 ions suppressed the photo transformation of go and more o containing groups remained on the surface of residual tgo cu go is regarded as a photo reactive semiconductor and could generate electron e hole pair h and ros under light irradiation fig s9 it is well known that photo transformation of go was mediated by the separation of e h pairs hou et al 2015 and the standard redox potential of e h pairs was 0 7 v jiang et al 2016 while the standard redox potential of cu ⅱ i was 0 15 v therefore cu2 ions could compete with go for e thus suppressing the photo reduction of go in the system due to weaker photo transformation the amount of the produced lmw species from tgo cu would be lower and mechanism i as mentioned above for the observed insignificant difference between tgo cu and go cu is confirmed the adsorption of cu2 ions by residual tgo and go were shown in fig s12 cu2 ions were strongly adsorbed by pristine go 41 4 which should be the main mechanism for the observed antagonistic effect between go and cu2 ions fig 4a the residual tgo showed much lower cu2 ions adsorption than go owing to the removal of o containing groups e g cooh tgo cu also showed much lower oxygen contents than go table s2 therefore the adsorption retention of cu2 ions on the surface of residual tgo cu should be lower than go this is inconsistent with our finding that there is no significant difference for the combined toxicity of go cu2 before and after transformation fig 4b it is thus hypothesized that additional cu ii species may be immobilized on the graphitic surface during photo transformation therefore residual tgo cu was further characterized using hrtem interestingly nanosized particles 5 10 nm with high electron density were observed on the surface of the graphitic sheets fig 5 a 5b the lattice fringes of ⅰ and ⅱ with the interplanar spacing at 0 198 nm and 0 241 nm were identified as 110 and 002 planes of cu2s nanocrystals the lattice fringe of ⅲ with 0 244 nm interplanar spacing was identified as 111 plane of cu2o nanocrystals fig 5c 5d xps spectra confirmed that most of cu on the surface of tgo cu was in the form of cu i fig s13 hence cu2 ions were transformed to cu2o and cu2s nanoparticles on go surface under light irradiation wang et al 2019 demonstrated that cu2 ions were transformed to cu2o particles and grown on the surface of g c3n4 sheets under light irradiation which could support the finding in the present study it is known that go could generate e h and a series of ros 1o2 o2 oh under sunlight irradiation fig s9 therefore cu ⅱ on the surface of go sheets could trap e generated by go and be reduced to cu ⅰ during photo transformation cu2o nanoparticles were thus formed from cu ⅰ with the assistance of ros on the surface of graphitic sheets wang et al 2019 however the reduction of cu ⅱ to cu0 was infeasible because of the redox potentials of cu ii 0 0 34 v was much higher than that of cu ⅱ ⅰ 0 15 v moreover e was easily to recombine with h foster et al 1995 therefore cu ⅱ cannot be reduced to cu0 in our case which was confirmed by the hrtem results that cu0 nanoparticles were not found on the surface of graphitic sheets fig 5 to our knowledge this is the first report that cu2 ions were transformed to cu2o nanoparticles on the surface of go sheets under light irradiation in addition go as prepared from hummers method contained 2 0 of s fig s14 it is not surprising that cu2s was formed from cu i and cu2o by sulfidation because the solubility product value k sp of cu2s 2 5 10 48 25 c was significantly lower than cu2o 2 0 10 15 25 c the above chemical reactions were shown in equations 3 6 vinu and madras 2008 wang et al 2019 3 go cu 2 go cu ⅱ 4 go cu ⅱ h v go e h cu ⅱ e go cu ⅰ 5 go cu ⅰ r o s go cu 2 o s 6 2 go cu 2 o s 2 s 2 2 go cu 2 s s o 2 it is reported that cu2o nanoparticles had lower toxicity than soluble cu2 ions towards aquatic organisms e g zebrafish chen et al 2011 although there is no report on cu2s toxicity the toxicity of cu2 ions should be much lower after sulfidation dharsana et al 2015 moreover the observed cu2o and cu2s nanoparticles were bound on the surface of residual tgo cu which should limit the direct contact and uptake by algal cells therefore toxicity of cu2 ions was decreased during go photo transformation through cu2 ions adsorption and the formation of cu based nanoparticles on graphitic surface mechanism ii 4 conclusions and environmental implications go is chemically unstable in aquatic environments which brings difficulties in accessing its toxicity under natural conditions our work revealed that go underwent photo transformation during 25 day sunlight irradiation with the highest transformation reduction at day 8 go after photo transformation exhibited stronger toxicity to algal cells the released byproducts lmw species identified as aromatic compounds played an important role in the increased toxicity this is the first time that significant contribution of lmw species was reported to the best of our knowledge it should be noted that go also underwent biotransformation in mammal animals qi et al 2018 and have a great potential in biomedical applications georgakilas et al 2016 the subsequent toxicity of lmw species should be paid more attention because the long term exposure of the produced aromatic compounds is harmful to human health interestingly it is found that the toxicity of co irradiated go and cu2 ions did not show stronger toxicity than pristine go the mechanisms are revealed as 1 the suppression of go transformation by cu2 ions and 2 the adsorption retention of cu2 ions and the formation of cu2o and cu2s nanoparticles on tgo surface this finding suggested that the combined toxicity of go and cu2 ions was antagonism under sunlight irradiation the formation of cu2o and cu2s nanoparticles on tgo could provide new insight in the fate and geochemical process of cu2 ions in aqueous environments in addition to cu2 ions other ionic species e g fe3 cl br and natural organic matter could also regulate photo transformation of go du et al 2017 liu et al 2017 therefore the toxicity of go as well as combined toxicity with other contaminants could be changed in natural waters which deserves further investigations in addition to algae various other organisms e g invertebrates fish in aquatic environments were also sensitive to go exposure souza et al 2018 jeong et al 2015 and the toxicity mechanisms towards these organisms were similar e g oxidative stress souza et al 2017 therefore the revealed mechanism as mediated by photo transformation in this work could be helpful for better understanding the toxicity of go to different aquatic organisms in natural environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

17972,the addition of sludge alkaline fermentation liquid safl to biological nutrient removal bnr processes has been widely shown to reduce the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din in the effluent however knowledge regarding the effect of using safl in a bnr as an additional carbon source on the characteristics of dissolved organic nitrogen don in the effluent is limited this study investigated the effect of safl addition on effluent don features and microbial community dynamics in a bnr process treating municipal wastewater the performance of safl was compared with other two reactors i e without an external carbon source and with the addition of sodium acetate the results showed that the addition of safl can significantly reduce effluent don p 0 05 the effluent don was slightly higher with safl than with sodium acetate but the bioavailable don of the two reactors was similar 1 06 0 11 vs 1 04 0 12 mg l respectively p 0 05 the safl addition led to a decreased percentage of low molecular weight don p 0 05 as well as an increased ratio of fulvic like and humic like substances to proteins like substances moreover the safl addition resulted in a lower percentage of substances resembling proteins amino sugars and a higher percentage of lignin like molecules than sodium acetate these features accounted for the low don bioavailability the safl promoted the increased abundance of bacteroidetes chloroflexi comamonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae which could be associated with the decreased effluent don and its bioavailability this study indicates that using safl as a bnr carbon source not only improves the removal of din but also reduces effluent don and specifically don bioavailability these results facilitate the acquisition of comprehensive knowledge regarding the use of safl as an alternative external carbon source in the bnr process graphical abstract image 1 keywords sludge alkaline fermentation liquid external carbon source dissolved organic nitrogen molecular

treatment plants 1 introduction the nitrogen discharged from sewage is one key reason for the eutrophication of aquatic environments price et al 2018 with more and more stringent regulations regarding wastewater effluent control efficient biological nitrogen removal bnr from municipal wastewater has been one of the most important tasks in wastewater treatment plants wwtps the biodegradable carbon sources are often insufficient for bnr particularly in south china zhang and chen 2009 which could result in poor nitrogen removal efficiency generally an additional carbon source is needed to achieve efficient nitrogen removal guo et al 2017 therefore it is essential to identify an economical and effective carbon source for the bnr process due to the high levels of biodegradable carbon and the economic feasibility sludge alkaline fermentation liquid safl has been considered as an alternative carbon source for the bnr process li et al 2011 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 safl which is the filtered liquid from the sewage sludge alkaline fermentation mixture contains quantities of volatile fatty acids vfas which are an excellent carbon source for the bnr process cao et al 2019b huang et al 2019 sun et al 2016 simultaneously the large quantity of sewage sludge generated in wwtps can also be reduced via bnr zhang and chen 2009 many studies have been performed that investigated the effect of using safl as a carbon source on nitrogen removal during the bnr process particularly on the removal of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din liu et al 2018 tong and chen 2009 zhang and chen 2009 even compared with sodium acetate or acetic acid using safl as a carbon source for the bnr process can more efficiently reduce effluent ammonia nitrite and nitrate and thus enhance total nitrogen tn removal efficiency zhu et al 2011 reported that compared with acetic acid using safl can improve the tn removal efficiency from 65 3 to 77 5 the use of safl can also promote shortcut nitrification denitrification and denitrifying phosphorus removal via nitrite and reduce nitrous oxide generation during the bnr process ji and chen 2010 zhu and chen 2011 notably effluent nitrogen consists of inorganic and organic nitrogen dissolved organic nitrogen don becomes more important as it can account for approximately 52 80 of effluent tn in wwtps with a high tn removal efficiency hu et al 2018b simsek et al 2013 don is related to the precursors of disinfection by products and membrane fouling and can play an important role in nitrogen cycling and water quality liao et al 2019 a portion of don bioavailable don abdon can be utilized by algae and plankton thereby increasing the risk of eutrophication qin et al 2015 moreover a significant amount of n containing organic matter i e proteins and a broad diversity n containing molecules that are difficult to biodegrade could be present in safl lu et al 2018 ma et al 2019a those n containing compounds could adversely affect the effluent quality therefore understanding the transformation of don particularly the characteristics of effluent don and abdon in a bnr process using safl is of great interest however our understanding of the characteristics of effluent don and abdon in a bnr process using safl as a carbon source is still limited previous studies have suggested that the bioavailability of don is related to the chemical characteristics of don bolyard and reinhart 2017 liu et al 2012 liu et al 2012 reported that effluent don with a higher fluorescence ratio of tryptophan to humic substances was more bioavailable and hence more likely accelerate algae growth additionally hu et al 2018a revealed that the bioavailability of effluent don increased with an increase in molecular weight for don 1 kda the addition of safl can greatly impact the dissolved organic matter in effluent in a bnr process cao et al 2019b found that using safl as an external carbon source in a denitrification process led to an accumulation of humic like substances and high molecular weight proteins thus the addition of safl as a bnr carbon source is expected to influence the characteristics of effluent don detailed information on effluent don characteristics is essential to assess the feasibility of using safl as an alternative source of additional carbon for the bnr process due to the complexity and diversity of wastewater don a multi method analytical characterization is required hu et al 2019 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms a robust analytical tool has been successfully used to provide novel insight and greater recognition of the molecular characteristics of complex organic matter valle et al 2018 kamjunke et al 2017 the transformation of don in the bnr process relies on microorganisms the microbial community dynamics are associated with the characteristics of effluent don lusk and toor 2016 sattayatewa et al 2009 simsek et al 2016 liao et al 2019 reported that the formation of abdon at low temperature is significantly influenced by microbial community structure as is known changes in carbon source can lead to a distinctly different microbial population distribution in the biological wastewater treatment process lu et al 2014 yuan et al 2016 found that ammonium oxidizing bacteria and denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms were enriched during the bnr process using sludge alkaline fermentation products therefore investigations on microbial community structure could further advance our understanding of the effluent don characteristics in the bnr process using safl as an external carbon source this study aimed to investigate the characteristics of effluent don in a bnr process using safl as an external carbon source during the treatment of municipal wastewater two other reactors one with no external carbon source and one with sodium acetate were also evaluated to compare their performance with the reactor using safl the bioavailability fluorescent components and molecular composition of effluent don as well as the microbial community were analysed with the goal of providing better insight into the impact of using safl as a carbon source on the effluent don in the bnr process these results provide essential information for evaluating the feasibility of using safl as an alternative carbon source for the bnr process 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of sludge alkaline fermentation liquid the sludge total solids ts and volatile solids vs of 17 68 0 96 and 10 91 0 42 g l respectively used for the

evaluate the degree of influence of microorganisms on effluent don a higher grey relational grade γ represents greater influence 3 results and discussion 3 1 profiles of the sbrs using different carbon sources the effluent cod of r1 r2 and r3 was 20 69 1 84 mg l 25 34 1 88 mg l and 36 68 3 01 mg l with removal efficiencies of 83 01 90 61 and 86 41 respectively fig s1 and table 1 the effluent tn decreased from 14 71 1 72 mg l r1 to 6 59 0 79 mg l r2 and 6 82 0 51 mg l r3 with the addition of sodium acetate and safl fig s1 these results are consistent with previous studies tong and chen 2009 implying that using safl as an additional carbon source in the bnr process can significantly reduce the effluent tn while slightly increasing the effluent cod zhu and chen 2011 reported that when using the bnr process to treat synthetic wastewater safl can lead to a lower effluent tn than using acetic acid this discrepancy could be attributed to the differences in influent wastewater in a full scale study treating municipal wastewater liu et al 2018 found that using safl as a carbon source led to a slightly higher effluent tn than using acetic acid the removal efficiencies of nh4 n in the reactors were greater than 94 indicating that nitrification was not influenced by the addition of safl however the effluent no2 n in r3 1 37 0 21 mg l was significantly higher than in r1 0 26 0 08 mg l and r2 0 34 0 05 mg l p 0 05 t test previous studies have also found that the addition of safl to the bnr process can led to an increase in effluent no2 n yuan et al 2016 ji and chen 2010 reported that using safl as an additional carbon source in bnr can improve the accumulation of no2 n and enhance shortcut nitrification denitrification effluent no3 n also significantly decreased in r2 and r3 using safl as the bnr carbon source has been shown to clearly increase the removal of din which favours the reduction of tn when effluent tn is low don will become more significant environmental risk therefore it was our objective to investigate the don features in this study 3 2 effluent don abdon and don bioavailability of the reactors the effluent don and abdon of the three sbrs are presented in fig 1 r1 had the highest effluent don 3 36 0 41 mg l average removal efficiency 57 41 the addition of sodium acetate r2 and safl r3 significantly decreased the effluent don resulting in a lower don concentration of 1 79 0 17 mg l and 2 04 0 22 mg l with an average removal efficiency of 77 31 and 79 52 respectively p 0 05 this finding agrees with our previous study hu et al 2018a and indicates that an adequate external carbon source is needed for don removal the addition of safl in the bnr process can also improve the removal of don however the effluent don of r3 was slightly higher than the don of r2 after safl addition the influent don of r3 increased from 7 89 0 63 mg l to 9 96 0 62 mg l previous studies have demonstrated that safl also contains a large quantity and broad diversity of n containing organic matter that is difficult to biodegrade lu et al 2018 ma et al 2019a due to their refractory nature these nitrogenous organic compounds might be rarely or partially degraded in the reactor thus their presence may result in an increase in effluent don compared with the r2 reactor it can be concluded that both the removal of din and a reduction in don can be improved in a bnr process using safl as an external carbon source which further increased the removal efficiency of tn the reduction in effluent abdon is highly desirable in wwtps because these compounds are bioavailable to algae and thus can facilitate eutrophication in the receiving waters liu et al 2012 vaquer sunyer et al 2015 significant differences in the effluent abdon were observed between r1 and r2 and between r1 and r3 p 0 05 however there was no significant difference in effluent abdon between r2 1 04 0 12 mg l and r3 1 06 0 11 mg l p 0 05 this finding illustrates that using safl as a carbon source can efficiently enhance the removal of abdon hu et al 2018a found that effluent abdon generally decreased with increased c n ratios in post denitrification biofilters the proportion of bioavailable don abdon don in the reactors ranged from 51 96 to 58 10 table 2 which is consistent with previously reported values 18 61 in r2 the proportion of bioavailable effluent don was 58 10 6 41 which was higher than r1 55 07 6 85 p 0 05 using safl as a carbon source led to the lowest bioavailability of effluent don 51 96 5 72 p 0 05 t test the changes in abdon and the proportion of bioavailable don is related to the different chemical characteristics of don hu et al 2018a liu et al 2012 using safl as a bnr carbon source can lead to changes in the soluble proteins of the effluent cao et al 2019a and it is known that proteins are a typical component of don the decrease in effluent abdon and the proportion of bioavailable don could reflect the variation in chemical characteristics of don this hypothesis will be explored further in the following sections the results imply that using safl as a bnr carbon source can significantly reduce the effluent abdon and its bioavailability furthermore compared with sodium acetate using safl as an additional carbon source can more efficiently reduce the bioavailability of effluent don in the bnr process 3 3 chemical characteristics of effluent don in the reactors 3 3 1 molecular weight distribution of effluent don the molecular weight distribution of effluent don from the three sbrs is shown in fig 2 in all the reactors don of mw 30 kda represented the main portion of the effluent don 71 08 78 21 this finding is consistent with previous studies hu et al 2018a pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 and indicates that effluent don in wastewater is dominated by low mw compounds i e 62 92 the percentage of don with an mw 1 kda was lower in r3 40 20 4 26 than in r1 45 24 6 31 and r2 51 96 6 11 p 0 05 r3 had the highest proportion of don with an mw 30 kda whereas r2 had the lowest proportion cao et al 2019 a b found that high mw pn and ps in safl was relatively difficult to degrade and could account for 13 37 17 39 and 12 84 15 9 respectively in the effluent of safl driven denitrification the presence of this dissolved organic matter could account for the increased percentage of high mw don in r3 it has been reported that the bioavailability of wastewater don is positively correlated with low mw don eom et al 2017 in addition don with an mw 1 kda has a greater potential to facilitate phytoplankton production than don with an mw 1 kda and thus may increase the risk of eutrophication in receiving waters eom et al 2017 hu et al 2018a found that the increase in don with an mw 1 kda led to an increase in don bioavailability in the effluent of post denitrification biofilters treating municipal wastewater therefore it is likely that using safl as a bnr carbon source could result in a decreased percentage of low mw don which accounts for the low bioavailability of effluent don 3 3 2 fluorescent components in reactor effluent the fluorescent components of the influent and effluent from the three sbrs were analysed using eem parafac the eem parafac modelling generated a three component model fig 3 a and table 3 consisting of a tryptophan like component c1 a fulvic like component c2 and a humic like component c3 li et al 2014 shutova et al 2014 within the effluent of the reactors the highest intensity of fluorescence of the three components was observed in r3 fed with safl this finding is consistent with previous studies cao et al 2019b and indicates that the addition of safl can lead to an increase in effluent dissolved organic matter as shown in fig 3a the addition of safl increased the intensity of fluorescence of c1 c2 and c3 in the influent of r3 both easily degraded compounds e g proteins and vfas and some refractory organic matter such as humic acid and fulvic acid can be generated during sludge alkaline fermentation cao et al 2019b moreover high mw proteins and humic like and fulvic like substances increased in the effluent from the safl driven denitrification process the average percentage of tryptophan like substances in the effluent of r2 38 21 was higher than in the effluent of r1 36 13 the total percentage of fulvic like and humic like substances decreased from 63 88 to 61 78 on average however with the addition of safl the average percentage of tryptophan like substances in the effluent of r3 34 32 was lower than in r1 and r2 in addition the total percentage of fulvic like and humic like substances in the effluent of r3 was the highest of the three reactors tong and chen 2009 also found that the addition of safl to the bnr process increased the percentage of humic acid in the effluent from 41 to 57 it is known that protein like substances in the effluent are bioavailable but fulvic like and humic like substances are generally refractory compounds and are resistant to biodegradation previous studies have reported that a higher ratio of protein like compounds to humic like and fulvic like substances in effluent can result in higher bioavailability of effluent don hu et al 2018b liu et al 2012 therefore it can be concluded that the effluent don in r3 are more refractory than in r2 this may account for the similar abdon between r2 and r3 despite the effluent don in r3 being higher than in r2 nevertheless using safl as a bnr carbon source resulted in an increase in protein like humic like and fulvic like substances in the effluent therefore additional studies are needed to remove those compounds from the safl or the effluent of the bnr process 3 3 3 molecular composition of effluent don in the reactors van krevelen plots can display the molar h c hydrogen carbon and o c oxygen carbon ratios for individual peaks and cluster elemental formulae according to their functional group yekta et al 2012 fig 4 as shown in fig s2 a complex composition of effluent don molecules from the reactors was observed in addition the effluent don of the three sbrs had a distinctly different molecular composition to distinguish the molecular composition of the effluent don the differences in n containing molecular formulas between r1 and r2 and between r1 and r3 were analysed fig 4 the addition of sodium acetate or safl to the bnr process simultaneously increased the diversity of effluent don molecules particularly the compounds resembling proteins amino sugars h c of 1 5 2 2 and o c of 0 2 0 6 and lignin like h c of 0 7 1 5 and o c of 0 1 0 6 don molecules the safl contained many proteins some of which were found in the effluent of the safl driven denitrification process ma et al 2019a found that large quantities of n containing molecules were found in safl and most were located in the lignin like and tannins like regions moreover the eem parafac results indicated that a large proportion of the proteins was degraded in r3 and the degradation of proteins can also lead to an increase in lignin like compounds yekta et al 2012 this could contribute to the increase in effluent don diversity in r3 furthermore the addition of a carbon source can produce variations in the microbial community which could also influence the features of the effluent don nevertheless the increase in the diversity of molecules resembling proteins amino sugars between r2 and r3 was similar although the increase in lignin like don formulas in r3 was substantially higher than in r2 fig 4 the percentage of molecules resembling proteins amino sugars in r1 r2 and r3 was 16 68 19 38 and 15 44 respectively molecules resembling proteins amino sugars represent readily bioavailable don however lignin like substances are potentially aromatic and difficult to degrade and these properties likely limit their bioavailability hertkorn et al 2006 previous studies have found that wastewater effluent don with more molecules resembling proteins amino sugars and fewer lignin like formulas tended to be more bioavailable hu et al 2018a b therefore the effluent don in r2 probably had the highest bioavailability and r3 most likely had the minimum bioavailability which could account for the highest proportion of bioavailable don and the lowest proportion of bioavailable don in r2 and r3 respectively however using safl as a bnr carbon source led to a substantial increase in the diversity of effluent don molecules fig 4 and fig s2 further studies should be conducted to determine efficient removal methods for reducing the diversity of effluent don in the bnr process using safl as a carbon source particularly when considering the reuse of treated wastewater in wwtps 3 4 microbial community dynamics and their influence on don and don bioavailability the microbial communities of the reactors primarily consisted of proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi nitrospira planctomycetes verrucomicrobia and acidobacteria fig 5 a which is consistent with previous studies tang et al 2018 yuan et al 2016 at the genus level the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria i e zoogloea flavobacterium dechloromonas thauera in r2 and r3 was higher than in r1 fig s3 which contributed to the removal of nitrate this finding is consistent with yuan et al 2016 and implies that the addition of safl can promote the accumulation of denitrifying bacteria and thus improve the removal of din in r3 nitrospira was less abundant than in r2 and r1 which could contribute to the increased no2 n in the effluent of r3 moreover dechloromonas which removes phosphorus through a denitrifying polyphosphate via nitrite dprn was more abundant in r2 and r3 ji and chen 2010 have reported that using safl as a carbon source can improve dprn in the bnr process few studies have investigated the relationship between microbes and don and abdon particularly in comparison with din liao et al 2019 previous studies have reported that bacteroidetes plays an important role in the degradation of the high molecular mass fraction of dom such as protein and chitin ma et al 2013 bacteroidetes was more abundant in r3 29 65 3 61 than in r2 28 72 2 79 and r1 25 28 1 32 which could contribute to the removal of n containing organic matter higher recalcitrant don in the effluent of pre chlorinated raw water distribution systems is associated with bacteroidetes chloroflexi is responsible for the degradation of soluble microbial products smp and other complicated substrates and was also more abundant in r3 comamonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae can use refractory organics as carbon sources and increased from 1 65 to 8 94 r1 to 2 89 and 13 81 r2 and 2 32 and 11 62 r3 respectively this phenomenon could contribute to the higher cod and don removal efficiencies in r2 and r3 tang et al 2018 found that comamonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae were the main taxa in a bnr process acclimated with fermentation liquid from food waste therefore the increased abundance of these microorganisms might account for the higher don removal efficiencies in r2 and r3 to further evaluate the influence of microorganisms on don removal efficiency and don bioavailability gra was used to identify the key microbes fig 5b with regard to the don removal efficiencies bacteroidetes exhibited the highest grey relational grades γ 0 916 followed by proteobacteria chloroflexi od1 and chlorobi γ 0 903 0 889 0 871 and 0 859 respectively at the genus level dechloromonas exhibited the highest γ 0 881 followed by terrimonas zoogloea and gp4 γ 0 854 0 829 and 0 806 respectively the microbial community is generally considered consumers of don these microbes showing high γ play important roles in the degradation of dom ma et al 2013 zhao et al 2019 therefore the higher don removal efficiencies in r2 and r3 could be attributed to biotic factors with regard to effluent don bioavailability proteobacteria showed the highest γ 0 944 and bacteroidetes and chloroflexi also had a relatively high γ microorganisms can also be producers e g smp of don and microorganism derived don is more bioavailable than influent derived don hu et al 2018b proteobacteria is able to create low mw compounds in r2 the both the proportion of don with an mw 1 kda and the relative abundance of proteobacteria were the highest among the reactors this phenomenon could account for the increased don bioavailability in the effluent of r2 moreover variation in the microbial community can also result in different microbe derived don and abdon in the effluent liao et al 2019 additionally an rda was also used to investigate the relationship between the microbial community and don removal efficiency and don bioavailability fig s4 some microorganisms i e bacteroidetes proteobacteria chloroflexi planctomycetes acidobacteria and od1 were closely related to don removal efficiency and or don bioavailability therefore these findings indicate that the decreased effluent don and variability in its bioavailability in the reactors are mainly associated with bacteroidetes proteobacteria and chloroflexi in this study 4 conclusions this paper investigated the effects of safl addition on the effluent don in a bnr process treating municipal wastewater the don don bioavailability chemical characteristics molecular weight distribution fluorescence components and molecular compositions of don and microbial community dynamics were analysed the results showed that safl can significantly reduce the effluent don p 0 05 although the effluent don was slightly higher with safl than with sodium acetate the bioavailable don of the two reactors was similar 1 06 0 11 vs 1 04 0 12 mg l respectively p 0 05 a lower proportion of low mw don p 0 05 and a higher ratio of fulvic like and humic like substances to proteins like substances was observed in the reactor using safl furthermore the safl led to a decreased percentage of molecules resembling proteins amino sugars and an increased percentage of lignin like molecules compared with sodium acetate these findings explain the low effluent don bioavailability in the reactor using safl using safl increased the relative abundances of bacteroidetes chloroflexi comamonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae which could relate to the enhanced removal of don these results indicate that using safl as a bnr carbon source not only improves din removal but also reduces effluent don particularly bioavailable don however using safl also led to an increase in effluent dissolved organic matter and a high diversity of don further studies are required to reduce the effluent organics and the diverse don molecules declaration of competing interest

17972,the addition of sludge alkaline fermentation liquid safl to biological nutrient removal bnr processes has been widely shown to reduce the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din in the effluent however knowledge regarding the effect of using safl in a bnr as an additional carbon source on the characteristics of dissolved organic nitrogen don in the effluent is limited this study investigated the effect of safl addition on effluent don features and microbial community dynamics in a bnr process treating municipal wastewater the performance of safl was compared with other two reactors i e without an external carbon source and with the addition of sodium acetate the results showed that the addition of safl can significantly reduce effluent don p 0 05 the effluent don was slightly higher with safl than with sodium acetate but the bioavailable don of the two reactors was similar 1 06 0 11 vs 1 04 0 12 mg l respectively p 0 05 the safl addition led to a decreased percentage of low molecular weight don p 0 05 as well as an increased ratio of fulvic like and humic like substances to proteins like substances moreover the safl addition resulted in a lower percentage of substances resembling proteins amino sugars and a higher percentage of lignin like molecules than sodium acetate these features accounted for the low don bioavailability the safl promoted the increased abundance of bacteroidetes chloroflexi comamonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae which could be associated with the decreased effluent don and its bioavailability this study indicates that using safl as a bnr carbon source not only improves the removal of din but also reduces effluent don and specifically don bioavailability these results facilitate the acquisition of comprehensive knowledge regarding the use of

treatment plants 1 introduction the nitrogen discharged from sewage is one key reason for the eutrophication of aquatic environments price et al 2018 with more and more stringent regulations regarding wastewater effluent control efficient biological nitrogen removal bnr from municipal wastewater has been one of the most important tasks in wastewater treatment plants wwtps the biodegradable carbon sources are often insufficient for bnr particularly in south china zhang and chen 2009 which could result in poor nitrogen removal efficiency generally an additional carbon source is needed to achieve efficient nitrogen removal guo et al 2017 therefore it is essential to identify an economical and effective carbon source for the bnr process due to the high levels of biodegradable carbon and the economic feasibility sludge alkaline fermentation liquid safl has been considered as an alternative carbon source for the bnr process li et al 2011 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 safl which is the filtered liquid from the sewage sludge alkaline fermentation mixture contains quantities of volatile fatty acids vfas which are an excellent carbon source for the bnr process cao et al 2019b huang et al 2019 sun et al 2016 simultaneously the large quantity of sewage sludge generated in wwtps can also be reduced via bnr zhang and chen 2009 many studies have been performed that investigated the effect of using safl as a carbon source on nitrogen removal during the bnr process particularly on the removal of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din liu et al 2018 tong and chen 2009 zhang and chen 2009 even compared with sodium acetate or acetic acid using safl as a carbon source for the bnr process can more efficiently reduce effluent ammonia nitrite and nitrate and thus enhance total nitrogen tn removal efficiency zhu et al 2011 reported that compared with acetic acid using safl can improve the tn removal efficiency from 65 3 to 77 5 the use of safl can also promote shortcut nitrification denitrification and denitrifying phosphorus removal via nitrite and reduce nitrous oxide generation during the bnr process ji and chen 2010 zhu and chen 2011 notably effluent nitrogen consists of inorganic and organic nitrogen dissolved organic nitrogen don becomes more important as it can account for approximately 52 80 of effluent tn in wwtps with a high tn removal efficiency hu et al 2018b simsek et al 2013 don is related to the precursors of disinfection by products and membrane fouling and can play an important role in nitrogen cycling and water quality liao et al 2019 a portion of don bioavailable don abdon can be utilized by algae and plankton thereby increasing the risk of eutrophication qin et al 2015 moreover a significant amount of n containing organic matter i e proteins and a broad diversity n containing molecules that are difficult to biodegrade could be present in safl lu et al 2018 ma et al 2019a those n containing compounds could adversely affect the effluent quality therefore understanding the transformation of don particularly the characteristics of effluent don and abdon in a bnr process using safl is of great interest however our understanding of the characteristics of effluent don and abdon in a bnr process using safl as a carbon source is still limited previous studies have suggested that the bioavailability of don is related to the chemical characteristics of don bolyard and reinhart 2017 liu et al 2012 liu et al 2012 reported that effluent don with a higher fluorescence ratio of tryptophan to humic substances was more bioavailable and hence more likely accelerate algae growth additionally hu et al 2018a revealed that the bioavailability of effluent don increased with an increase in molecular weight for don 1 kda the addition of safl can greatly impact the dissolved organic matter in effluent in a bnr process cao et al 2019b found that using safl as an external carbon source in a denitrification process led to an accumulation of humic like substances and high molecular weight proteins thus the addition of safl as a bnr carbon source is expected to influence the characteristics of effluent don detailed information on effluent don characteristics is essential to assess the feasibility of using safl as an alternative source of additional carbon for the bnr process due to the complexity and diversity of wastewater don a multi method analytical characterization is required hu et al 2019 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms a robust analytical tool has been successfully used to provide novel insight and greater recognition of the molecular characteristics of complex organic matter valle et al 2018 kamjunke et al 2017 the transformation of don in the bnr process relies on microorganisms the microbial community dynamics are associated with the characteristics of effluent don lusk and toor 2016 sattayatewa et al 2009 simsek et al 2016 liao et al 2019 reported that the formation of abdon at low temperature is significantly influenced by microbial community structure as is known changes in carbon source can lead to a distinctly different microbial population distribution in the biological wastewater treatment process lu et al 2014 yuan et al 2016 found that ammonium oxidizing bacteria and denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms were enriched during the bnr process using sludge alkaline fermentation products therefore investigations on microbial community structure could further advance our understanding of the effluent don characteristics in the bnr process using safl as an external carbon source this study aimed to investigate the characteristics of effluent don in a bnr process using safl as an external carbon source during the treatment of municipal wastewater two other reactors one with no external carbon source and one with sodium acetate were also evaluated to compare their performance with the reactor using safl the bioavailability fluorescent components and molecular composition of effluent don as well as the microbial community were analysed with the goal of providing better insight into the impact of using safl as a carbon source on the effluent don in the bnr process these results provide essential information for evaluating the feasibility of using safl as an alternative carbon source for the bnr process 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of sludge alkaline fermentation liquid the sludge total solids ts and volatile solids vs of 17 68 0 96 and 10 91 0 42 g l respectively used for the

carbon sources the effluent cod of r1 r2 and r3 was 20 69 1 84 mg l 25 34 1 88 mg l and 36 68 3 01 mg l with removal efficiencies of 83 01 90 61 and 86 41 respectively fig s1 and table 1 the effluent tn decreased from 14 71 1 72 mg l r1 to 6 59 0 79 mg l r2 and 6 82 0 51 mg l r3 with the addition of sodium acetate and safl fig s1 these results are consistent with previous studies tong and chen 2009 implying that using safl as an additional carbon source in the bnr process can significantly reduce the effluent tn while slightly increasing the effluent cod zhu and chen 2011 reported that when using the bnr process to treat synthetic wastewater safl can lead to a lower effluent tn than using acetic acid this discrepancy could be attributed to the differences in influent wastewater in a full scale study treating municipal wastewater liu et al 2018 found that using safl as a carbon source led to a slightly higher effluent tn than using acetic acid the removal efficiencies of nh4 n in the reactors were greater than 94 indicating that nitrification was not influenced by the addition of safl however the effluent no2 n in r3 1 37 0 21 mg l was significantly higher than in r1 0 26 0 08 mg l and r2 0 34 0 05 mg l p 0 05 t test previous studies have also found that the addition of safl to the bnr process can led to an increase in effluent no2 n yuan et al 2016 ji and chen 2010 reported that using safl as an additional carbon source in bnr can improve the accumulation of no2 n and enhance shortcut nitrification denitrification effluent no3 n also significantly decreased in r2 and r3 using safl as the bnr carbon source has been shown to clearly increase the removal of din which favours the reduction of tn when effluent tn is low don will become more significant environmental risk therefore it was our objective to investigate the don features in this study 3 2 effluent don abdon and don bioavailability of the reactors the effluent don and abdon of the three sbrs are presented in fig 1 r1 had the highest effluent don 3 36 0 41 mg l average removal efficiency 57 41 the addition of sodium acetate r2 and safl r3 significantly decreased the effluent don resulting in a lower don concentration of 1 79 0 17 mg l and 2 04 0 22 mg l with an average removal efficiency of 77 31 and 79 52 respectively p 0 05 this finding agrees with our previous study hu et al 2018a and indicates that an adequate external carbon source is needed for don removal the addition of safl in the bnr process can also improve the removal of don however the effluent don of r3 was slightly higher than the don of r2 after safl addition the influent don of r3 increased from 7 89 0 63 mg l to 9 96 0 62 mg l previous studies have demonstrated that safl also contains a large quantity and broad diversity of n containing organic matter that is difficult to biodegrade lu et al 2018 ma et al 2019a due to their refractory nature these nitrogenous organic compounds might be rarely or partially degraded in the reactor thus their presence may result in an increase in effluent don compared with the r2 reactor it can be concluded that both the removal of din and a reduction in don can be improved in a bnr process using safl as an external carbon source which further increased the removal efficiency of tn the reduction in effluent abdon is highly desirable in wwtps because these compounds are bioavailable to algae and thus can facilitate eutrophication in the receiving waters liu et al 2012 vaquer sunyer et al 2015 significant differences in the effluent abdon were observed between r1 and r2 and between r1 and r3 p 0 05 however there was no significant difference in effluent abdon between r2 1 04 0 12 mg l and r3 1 06 0 11 mg l p 0 05 this finding illustrates that using safl as a carbon source can efficiently enhance the removal of abdon hu et al 2018a found that effluent abdon generally decreased with increased c n ratios in post denitrification biofilters the proportion of bioavailable don abdon don in the reactors ranged from 51 96 to 58 10 table 2 which is consistent with previously reported values 18 61 in r2 the proportion of bioavailable effluent don was 58 10 6 41 which was higher than r1 55 07 6 85 p 0 05 using safl as a carbon source led to the lowest bioavailability of effluent don 51 96 5 72 p 0 05 t test the changes in abdon and the proportion of bioavailable don is related to the different chemical characteristics of don hu et al 2018a liu et al 2012 using safl as a bnr carbon source can lead to changes in the soluble proteins of the effluent cao et al 2019a and it is known that proteins are a typical component of don the decrease in effluent abdon and the proportion of bioavailable don could reflect the variation in chemical characteristics of don this hypothesis will be explored further in the following sections the results imply that using safl as a bnr carbon source can significantly reduce the effluent abdon and its bioavailability furthermore compared with sodium acetate using safl as an additional carbon source can more efficiently reduce the bioavailability of effluent don in the bnr process 3 3 chemical characteristics of effluent don in the reactors 3 3 1 molecular weight distribution of effluent don the molecular weight distribution of effluent don from the three sbrs is shown in fig 2 in all the reactors don of mw 30 kda represented the main portion of the effluent don 71 08 78 21 this finding is consistent with previous studies hu et al 2018a pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 and indicates that effluent don in wastewater is dominated by low mw compounds i e 62 92 the percentage of don with an mw 1 kda was lower in r3 40 20 4 26 than in r1 45 24 6 31 and r2 51 96 6 11 p 0 05 r3 had the highest proportion of don with an mw 30 kda whereas r2 had the lowest proportion cao et al 2019 a b found that high mw pn and ps in safl was relatively difficult to degrade and could account for 13 37 17 39 and 12 84 15 9 respectively in the effluent of safl driven denitrification the presence of this dissolved organic matter could account for the increased percentage of high mw don in r3 it has been reported that the bioavailability of wastewater don is positively correlated with low mw don eom et al 2017 in addition don with an mw 1 kda has a greater potential to facilitate phytoplankton production than don with an mw 1 kda and thus may increase the risk of eutrophication in receiving waters eom et al 2017 hu et al 2018a found that the increase in don with an mw 1 kda led to an increase in don bioavailability in the effluent of post denitrification biofilters treating municipal wastewater therefore it is likely that using safl as a bnr carbon source could result in a decreased percentage of low mw don which accounts for the low bioavailability of effluent don 3 3 2 fluorescent components in reactor effluent the fluorescent components of the influent and effluent from the three sbrs were analysed using eem parafac the eem parafac modelling generated a three component model fig 3 a and table 3 consisting of a tryptophan like component c1 a fulvic like component c2 and a humic like component c3 li et al 2014 shutova et al 2014 within the effluent of the reactors the highest intensity of fluorescence of the three components was observed in r3 fed with safl this finding is consistent with previous studies cao et al 2019b and indicates that the addition of safl can lead to an increase in effluent dissolved organic matter as shown in fig 3a the addition of safl increased the intensity of fluorescence of c1 c2 and c3 in the influent of r3 both easily degraded compounds e g proteins and vfas and some refractory organic matter such as humic acid and fulvic acid can be generated during sludge alkaline fermentation cao et al 2019b moreover high mw proteins and humic like and fulvic like substances increased in the effluent from the safl driven denitrification process the average percentage of tryptophan like substances in the effluent of r2 38 21 was higher than in the effluent of r1 36 13 the total percentage of fulvic like and humic like substances decreased from 63 88 to 61 78 on average however with the addition of safl the average percentage of tryptophan like substances in the effluent of r3 34 32 was lower than in r1 and r2 in addition the total percentage of fulvic like and humic like substances in the effluent of r3 was the highest of the three reactors tong and chen 2009 also found that the addition of safl to the bnr process increased the percentage of humic acid in the effluent from 41 to 57 it is known that protein like substances in the effluent are bioavailable but fulvic like and humic like substances are generally refractory compounds and are resistant to biodegradation previous studies have reported that a higher ratio of protein like compounds to humic like and fulvic like substances in effluent can result in higher bioavailability of effluent don hu et al 2018b liu et al 2012 therefore it can be concluded that the effluent don in r3 are more refractory than in r2 this may account for the similar abdon between r2 and r3 despite the effluent don in r3 being higher than in r2 nevertheless using safl as a bnr carbon source resulted in an increase in protein like humic like and fulvic like substances in the effluent therefore additional studies are needed to remove those compounds from the safl or the effluent of the bnr process 3 3 3 molecular composition of effluent don in the reactors van krevelen plots can display the molar h c hydrogen carbon and o c oxygen carbon ratios for individual peaks and cluster elemental formulae according to their functional group yekta et al 2012 fig 4 as shown in fig s2 a complex composition of effluent don molecules from the reactors was observed in addition the effluent don of the three sbrs had a distinctly different molecular composition to distinguish the molecular composition of the effluent don the differences in n containing molecular formulas between r1 and r2 and between r1 and r3 were analysed fig 4 the addition of sodium acetate or safl to the bnr process simultaneously increased the diversity of effluent don molecules particularly the compounds resembling proteins amino sugars h c of 1 5 2 2 and o c of 0 2 0 6 and lignin like h c of 0 7 1 5 and o c of 0 1 0 6 don molecules the safl contained many proteins some of which were found in the effluent of the safl driven denitrification process ma et al 2019a found that large quantities of n containing molecules were found in safl and most were located in the lignin like and tannins like regions moreover the eem parafac results indicated that a large proportion of the proteins was degraded in r3 and the degradation of proteins can also lead to an increase in lignin like compounds yekta et al 2012 this could contribute to the increase in effluent don diversity in r3 furthermore the addition of a carbon source can produce variations in the microbial community which could also influence the features of the effluent don nevertheless the increase in the diversity of molecules resembling proteins amino sugars between r2 and r3 was similar although the increase in lignin like don formulas in r3 was substantially higher than in r2 fig 4 the percentage of molecules resembling proteins amino sugars in r1 r2 and r3 was 16 68 19 38 and 15 44 respectively molecules resembling proteins amino sugars represent readily bioavailable don however lignin like substances are potentially aromatic and difficult to degrade and these properties likely limit their bioavailability hertkorn et al 2006 previous studies have found that wastewater effluent don with more molecules resembling proteins amino sugars and fewer lignin like formulas tended to be more bioavailable hu et al 2018a b therefore the effluent don in r2 probably had the highest bioavailability and r3 most likely had the minimum bioavailability which could account for the highest proportion of bioavailable don and the lowest proportion of bioavailable don in r2 and r3 respectively however using safl as a bnr carbon source led to a substantial increase in the diversity of effluent don molecules fig 4 and fig s2 further studies should be conducted to determine efficient removal methods for reducing the diversity of effluent don in the bnr process using safl as a carbon source particularly when considering the reuse of treated wastewater in wwtps 3 4 microbial community dynamics and their influence on don and don bioavailability the microbial communities of the reactors primarily consisted of proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi nitrospira planctomycetes verrucomicrobia and acidobacteria fig 5 a which is consistent with previous studies tang et al 2018 yuan et al 2016 at the genus level the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria i e zoogloea flavobacterium dechloromonas thauera in r2 and r3 was higher than in r1 fig s3 which contributed to the removal of nitrate this finding is consistent with yuan et al 2016 and implies that the addition of safl can promote the accumulation of denitrifying bacteria and thus improve the removal of din in r3 nitrospira was less abundant than in r2 and r1 which could contribute to the increased no2 n in the effluent of r3 moreover dechloromonas which removes phosphorus through a denitrifying polyphosphate via nitrite dprn was more abundant in r2 and r3 ji and chen 2010 have reported that using safl as a carbon source can improve dprn in the bnr process few studies have investigated the relationship between microbes and don and abdon particularly in comparison with din liao et al 2019 previous studies have reported that bacteroidetes plays an important role in the degradation of the high molecular mass fraction of dom such as protein and chitin ma et al 2013 bacteroidetes was more abundant in r3 29 65 3 61 than in r2 28 72 2 79 and r1 25 28 1 32 which could contribute to the removal of n containing organic matter higher recalcitrant don in the effluent of pre chlorinated raw water distribution systems is associated with bacteroidetes chloroflexi is responsible for the degradation of soluble microbial products smp and other complicated substrates and was also more abundant in r3 comamonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae can use refractory organics as carbon sources and increased from 1 65 to 8 94 r1 to 2 89 and 13 81 r2 and 2 32 and 11 62 r3 respectively this phenomenon could contribute to the higher cod and don removal efficiencies in r2 and r3 tang et al 2018 found that comamonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae were the main taxa in a bnr process acclimated with fermentation liquid from food waste therefore the increased abundance of these microorganisms might account for the higher don removal efficiencies in r2 and r3 to further evaluate the influence of microorganisms on don removal efficiency and don bioavailability gra was used to identify the key microbes fig 5b with regard to the don removal efficiencies bacteroidetes exhibited the highest grey relational grades γ 0 916 followed by proteobacteria chloroflexi od1 and chlorobi γ 0 903 0 889 0 871 and 0 859 respectively at the genus level dechloromonas exhibited the highest γ 0 881 followed by terrimonas zoogloea and gp4 γ 0 854 0 829 and 0 806 respectively the microbial community is generally considered consumers of don these microbes showing high γ play important roles in the degradation of dom ma et al 2013 zhao et al 2019 therefore the higher don removal efficiencies in r2 and r3 could be attributed to biotic factors with regard to effluent don bioavailability proteobacteria showed the highest γ 0 944 and bacteroidetes and chloroflexi also had a relatively high γ microorganisms can also be producers e g smp of don and microorganism derived don is more bioavailable than influent derived don hu et al 2018b proteobacteria is able to create low mw compounds in r2 the both the proportion of don with an mw 1 kda and the relative abundance of proteobacteria were the highest among the reactors this phenomenon could account for the increased don bioavailability in the effluent of r2 moreover variation in the microbial community can also result in different microbe derived don and abdon in the effluent liao et al 2019 additionally an rda was also used to investigate the relationship between the microbial community and don removal efficiency and don bioavailability fig s4 some microorganisms i e bacteroidetes proteobacteria chloroflexi planctomycetes acidobacteria and od1 were closely related to don removal efficiency and or don bioavailability therefore these findings indicate that the decreased effluent don and variability in its bioavailability in the reactors are mainly associated with bacteroidetes proteobacteria and chloroflexi in this study 4 conclusions this paper investigated the effects of safl addition on the effluent don in a bnr process treating municipal wastewater the don don bioavailability chemical characteristics molecular weight distribution fluorescence components and molecular compositions of don and microbial community dynamics were analysed the results showed that safl can significantly reduce the effluent don p 0 05 although the effluent don was slightly higher with safl than with sodium acetate the bioavailable don of the two reactors was similar 1 06 0 11 vs 1 04 0 12 mg l respectively p 0 05 a lower proportion of low mw don p 0 05 and a higher ratio of fulvic like and humic like substances to proteins like substances was observed in the reactor using safl furthermore the safl led to a decreased percentage of molecules resembling proteins amino sugars and an increased percentage of lignin like molecules compared with sodium acetate these findings explain the low effluent don bioavailability in the reactor using safl using safl increased the relative abundances of bacteroidetes chloroflexi comamonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae which could relate to the enhanced removal of don these results indicate that using safl as a bnr carbon source not only improves din removal but also reduces effluent don particularly bioavailable don however using safl also led to an increase in effluent dissolved organic matter and a high diversity of don further studies are required to reduce the effluent organics and the diverse don molecules declaration of competing interest

17973,the development of green water disinfection technology utilizing solar energy is highly desired but remains challenging in this study sulfate radical so4 mediated bacterial inactivation was first attempted by using fe3o4 based magnetic hydrochar mhc as a recyclable catalyst for persulfate ps activation under visible light vl irradiation complete treatment of 8 0 log e coli cells was reached within 40 min in vl ps mhc system compared with that of only 2 0 log reduction was obtained in the ps mhc system under the same conditions the system was applicable in wide range of ph 3 0 9 0 and increasing dissolved o2 could further promote the efficiency a three route mechanism was proposed in which the ps activation by fe ii of fe3o4 and photo generated electron captured by ps were the major processes the bacterial cell lesion process was found to be triggered directly via so4 which caused the damage of outer membrane followed by up regulation of intracellular ross and destroy of chromosomal dna finally leading to irreversible cell death moreover the vl ps mhc system is also effective to inactivate versatile pathogenic bacteria including p aeruginosa and s aureus as a proof of concept our study provides meaningful information to advance the areas of green water disinfection technology which can be realized by recyclable photocatalytic systems using solar energy graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacterial inactivation photocatalysis persulfate activation visible light magnetic hydrochar 1 introduction pathogenic microorganisms transmitted via drinking water have been recognized as the major sources causing waterborne diseases and deaths in developing world li et al 2008 with rapid urbanization of society there is an increasing microbial contaminated wastewater generation which leads to outbreaks of waterborne diseases occurring at high level ashbolt 2004 therefore effective elimination of pathogens in drinking water is crucial and this calls for efficient disinfection technologies although conventional water disinfection technologies like ozonation chlorination and uv have been extensively used there are growing concerns about their adverse effects including carcinogenic disinfection by products high energy input and bacterial re colonization dalrymple et al 2010 wang et al 2015 developing alternative green and cost effective disinfection technologies with low energy consumption and high efficiency is urgent but still challengeable in scientific community an et al 2016 you et al 2019 solar disinfection sodis uses the inexhaustible solar energy to eliminate pathogens in water which has been practiced as low cost disinfection method in ancient cultures for centuries it has been recently emphasized by united nations un as a sustainable and transferrable technology which needs preferential development as alternative for chlorination keane et al 2014 however the major challenge of sodis technology remains the low efficiency and the treated water volume is small keane et al 2014 mcguigan et al 2012 in this regard photocatalytic disinfection have received enormous attention as it uses a photocatalyst to accelerate the sodis process which can remarkably promote the disinfection efficiency ganguly et al 2018 li et al 2015 2019 wang et al 2017 however the identified photocatalysts are mostly uv responsive which is ineffective to use the whole solar spectrum although a number of excellent visible light vl driven photocatalysts have been developed for bacterial inactivation noble metals i e pt ag are often loaded as co catalysts feng et al 2018 ma et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 and these powdery photocatalysts suffer from difficulties in recovery from aqueous environment wang et al 2018b photo fenton like processes e g h2o2 uv persulfate uv peroxymonosulfate uv have attracted increasing attention for their use in organic pollutants degradation pablos et al 2013 rehman et al 2018 wu et al 2017 in which the uvc persulfate ps system has been promising for e coli inactivation michael kordatou et al 2015 unfortunately these systems also used uv as the light source to catalyze ps decomposition fortunately we have recently found that ps can also be sensitized with vl irradiation for e coli elimination wang et al 2019 however the efficiency of bacterial inactivation is yet not satisfactory for practical use thus additional technologies are needed to accelerate the ps decomposition process generally transition metal based catalysts liu et al 2019a waclawek et al 2017 wu et al 2019 and metal free carbon based materials duan et al 2015 2016 olmez hanci et al 2018 can be applied to activate ps without light irradiation in addition it is reported that photo generated electrons from semiconductor photocatalysts can also be used to promote ps decomposition gao et al 2017 in turn the electron trapping by ps can suppress the undesired electrons hole recombination however the possible synergistic effect of catalytic ps activation and photocatalysis has not been well studied for bacterial inactivation therefore it is attractive to develop green catalysts that can catalyze the ps decomposition and can also be served as a photocatalyst for bacterial inactivation the ideal photocatalysts should also be environmental benign active under vl irradiation as well as facile recycling one of such choice is magnetite fe3o4 which is widely used in constructing composite catalysts with magnetic separable ability owing to its small band gap eg 0 1 ev zhang et al 2009 it has high vl absorption but its photocatalytic activity is restrained by fast electron hole recombination on the other hand fe3o4 is also an excellent heterogeneous catalysts to activate ps for degradation of pollutants du et al 2019 however fe3o4 nanoparticles suffer from aggregation in aqueous solution leading to decreased catalytic and magnetic properties one solution is to load the magnetic particles to carbonous materials to prevent particle aggregation liu et al 2019b zhu et al 2014 2016 in this regard biochar produced from waste biomass either by pyrolysis pyrochar or by hydrothermal carbonization hydrochar has received growing interests as absorbents and catalysts supports kambo and dutta 2015 qin et al 2018 chen et al 2017 has found that compared with porochar hydrochar possesses more oxygen functional groups making it preferable for being utilized as catalyst supports however the use of magnetic hydrochar as dual functional catalyst for ps activation and photocatalysis to inactivate bacteria in water has not been studied yet its underling inactivation mechanisms are also by far understandable herein magnetic hydrochar was fabricated using a one step hydrothermal method the physicochemical properties of the as prepared sample were characterized by multiple technologies the bacterial inactivation performances in the presence of magnetic hydrochar and ps were studied in detail under vl irradiation moreover the mechanisms of bacterial inactivation in terms of main reactive species cell morphology change antioxidant enzyme activity and chromosomal dna destruction were all systematically investigated furthermore the universality of this system to inactivate two more pathogenic bacteria was also investigated this work may provide innovative information to develop low cost magnetic hydrochar catalysts for recyclable bacterial inactivation under vl thus finally accomplishing the aim of green water disinfection technology using inexhaustible solar energy 2 experimental 2 1 synthesis of materials hydrochar hc was synthesized via a hydrothermal carbonization process briefly 8 0 g glucose aladdin ar grade was put into a beaker followed by adding 80 ml distilled water then the obtained solution in autoclave was subjected to hydrothermal treatment for 10 h at 180 c after reaction the precipitates of hc were collected by centrifugation washing and drying in vacuum at 60 c for 24 h before use magnetic hydrochar mhc were produced by a modified method using fecl3 as precursor of magnetic particles and zncl2 as porogen zhu et al 2014 typically 1 0 g anhydrous fecl3 aladdin ar grade and 2 0 g zncl2 aladdin ar grade were mixed in 12 5 ml distilled water then 2 0 g hc were added to the solution the mixtures were vigorously stirred for 24 h and then dried for 4 h at 80 c in air the dried products were then activated at 600 c for 90 min in n2 flow of 1 l min 1 the final products of mhc were washed with 0 1 m hcl ethanol and water several times before drying for 4 h at 80 c the characterization details of the samples were provided in supporting information 2 2 experiments for bacterial inactivation and analysis the bacterial inactivation capability of the mhc with ps under vl irradiation were tested using e coli as the model bacteria the bacterial culture and testing procedures can be found in our previous study wang et al 2019 briefly 20 mg mhc was put into 100 ml bacterial cell solution in a flask under vigorous stirring followed by adding ps 2 mm under vl irradiation to start the reaction two other pathogenic bacterial strains i e pseudomonas aeruginosa staphylococcus aureus were also utilized for the testing the details for analytical methods can be found in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of catalysts in this study hydrochar was produced by hydrothermal methods according to previous study hu et al 2017 then magnetic particles were incorporated into the hydrochar by pre impregnation with iron salts followed by thermal activation as shown in fig 1 a the xrd of the samples show that the pure hydrochar hc is amorphous in nature as there is only a broad peak of 20 30 corresponding to graphite in contrast the obtained magnetic hydrochar mhc shows strong diffraction peaks at 30 1 35 4 56 9 43 1 and 62 5 which can be assigned to crystal planes of fe3o4 in cubic phase jcpds 19 0629 space group fd3m suggesting fe3o4 nanoparticles are successfully fabricated onto hc without other impurities the uv vis absorption spectra show that the pristine hc exhibits semiconductor like absorption with cutoff wavelength up to 800 nm fig 1b which is due to delocalized π electrons in hc hu et al 2017 after incorporation with fe3o4 the mhc exhibits obviously enhanced vl absorption because of the narrow band gap of fe3o4 eg 0 1 ev zhang et al 2009 the magnetization curve in fig 1c indicates the mhc has superparamagnetic property with zero resonance and coercivity the saturated magnetization value of mhc reached 7 5 emu g such superparamagnetic property favors the rapid separation of the catalysts from aqueous solution qin et al 2015 as demonstrated in the inset of fig 1c the mhc powders can be tightly attracted on the vessel by external magnet suggesting its good magnetic recyclability the fe3o4 weight ratio determined by icp oes was 9 17 in the mhc composites the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of mhc shown in fig 1d demonstrates a type i isotherm with microporous structure kyotani et al 2003 the pore sized distribution inset of fig 1d confirms the microporosity with pore size below 3 nm as shown in table s1 the degree of microporosity demonstrated by the ratio of micropore volume total volume vmic vt was calculated to be 81 4 the surface area bet was obtained as over 1072 m2 g 1356 m2 g when using langmuir model in contrast the pristine hc shows a type iv isotherm with hysteresis loop fig s1 indicating a mesoporous structure the proportion of microporosity decreased to be 1 and the bet surface area was only 9 18 m2 g table s1 the remarkably increased surface area and microporosity on mhc would be benefit for ps absorption thus promoting subsequent ps decomposition and bacterial inactivation efficiencies the morphology of mhc was analyzed using tem and sem fig s2 a typical sem image of the as prepared mhc exhibits microsphere morphology with particle diameters of 200 400 nm the spherical morphology is not changed suggesting fe3o4 loading would not change the microstructure of hc the tem image clearly demonstrates that fe3o4 with sizes of 20 50 nm were anchored on the amorphous carbon sphere in addition the hrtem further shows clear crystal lattice fringe with interplanar distance to be 0 253 nm which corresponds to the 311 crystal plane of fe3o4 the haadf stem image and corresponding edx elemental mapping at the atomic scale further confirms the existence of c o and fe elements the surface fe content was determined to be 12 7 these results confirm the successful synthesis of fe3o4 loaded hydrochar with large surface area and high porosity 3 2 bacterial inactivation efficiency as a microbiological indicator in drinking water e coli was used to test the catalytic inactivation activity of the mhc sample to test the applicability in heavily microbial contaminated water a relative high cell concentration of 108 cfu ml was applied hereafter as fig 2 a shows with vl ps or vl mhc almost no bacterial inactivation efficiency was observed suggesting ps activation by vl alone and photocatalytic activity of mhc by vl alone are not effective for high concentration bacterial inactivation although we have previously found that the vl ps system can inactivate bacterial cells with much lower concentration of 107 cfu ml within 120 min wang et al 2019 in case of ps mhc it was found that about 2 0 log reduction of e coli cells was inactivated after 40 min suggesting that the ps could be activated by fe3o4 loaded into mhc to cause moderate cell inactivation interestingly in vl ps mhc system the bacterial inactivation efficiency was remarkably enhanced and complete inactivation of 8 log viable cells was accomplished within 40 min the bacterial inactivation kinetic was studied according to the log linear shoulder model geeraerd et al 2005 the obtained specific inactivation rate constant k max r2 0 99 was calculated to be 0 19 and 0 99 min 1 for bacterial inactivation in the ps mhc and vl ps mhc system respectively therefore the bacterial inactivation efficiency by the vl ps mhc system is about 5 21 times higher than that of ps mhc system in addition when the concentration of cells was decreased to normal levels of 107 and 106 cfu ml the complete inactivation was achieved within 20 min and 10 min respectively fig 2b it should be noted that this bacterial inactivation efficiency exceeds most of the vl driven photocatalytic systems reported so far except some ag based phocatalysts table s2 since the possible released ag is toxic to environment and would cause secondary pollution thus the mhc is more environmental benign and low cost which shows promise for large scale applications the ps decomposition kinetics was studied according to first order kinetics model fig 2c the obtained apparent reaction constant k r2 0 99 was 6 32 10 3 2 27 10 3 and 6 93 10 4 min 1 for vl ps mhc ps mhc and vl ps system respectively it is clear that the vl ps mhc system exhibits the highest ps decomposition efficiency which matches well with the above bacterial inactivation efficiency the ps concentration was deceased from 2 mm to 1 484 mm after completed 40 min reaction which indicates that 0 516 mm ps was decomposed corresponding to a so4 2 release concentration of 99 1 mg l theoretically this value was significantly lower than the pollution limit of so4 2 250 mg l in drinking water suggested by the world health organization who ioannidi et al 2018 therefore the released so4 2 concentration is low and would not cause significant secondary pollution the possible released fe content was also measured to be only about 1 31 mg l after completed 40 min reaction fig s3 the addition of equivalent amount of fe2 1 5 mg l or fe3 1 5 mg l in the vl ps system without catalysts would not cause significant bacterial inactivation fig 2a therefore the homogeneous reaction by fe vl ps could be excluded due to the low amount of fe ions which cannot trigger sufficient ross to cause bacterial inactivation the effect of ph on bacterial inactivation efficiency was studied fig 3 a the control experiments show that the ph variation in the range of 3 0 9 0 will not cause obvious bacterial inactivation suggesting ph value alone has negligible effect on the inactivation efficiency in the test period fig s4 the ph variation in the vl ps mhc system was monitored which shows that all the ph values are decreased a little under different initial ph and the ph is decreased more significantly under alkaline condition fig s5a generally it is known that basic ph could accelerate ps decomposition to produce oh thus enhancing the degradation efficiency towards organic pollutants furman et al 2010 nevertheless in the present work it was recognized that when ph value was increased to 9 0 only about 3 0 log reduction of viable cells was found in 40 min of treatment in contrast when the ph was decreased to 3 0 total inactivation of 8 0 log cells could be completed within 30 min suggesting acidic ph would favor the disinfection activity fig 3a this can be partially due to the fact that the surface of e coli cells is negatively charged which results in the electrostatic repulsion between the cells and s2o8 2 the adsorption of ps onto the cells is hindered with higher ph value thus reducing the bacterial inactivation activity nevertheless compared with traditional homogeneous photo fenton methods in which only strong acidic ph can be applied the vl ps mhc system can be applied in a wide ph range of 3 0 9 0 for water disinfection the effect of dissolved o2 on the disinfection efficiency was investigated by pumping with o2 or n2 in the reaction mixture as shown in figs 3b and 8 0 log reduction of e coli cells is reached within 30 min which is much faster than that of normal air equilibrium conditions indicating dissolved o2 is crucial to obtain high inactivation efficiency this was further confirmed by n2 bubbling experiments that n2 bubbling was found to significantly inhibit the bacterial inactivation process the ph variation was also monitored which shows that the ph is decreased more significantly with o2 bubbling fig s5b it has been reported the fe ii could reduce dissolved molecular o2 to produce h2o2 via generation of o2 eqs 1 and 2 harrington et al 2012 which can further promote the ps decomposition to generate so4 eqs 3 and 4 zhang et al 2017 to support this conclusion the generation of h2o2 was monitored fig s6 results evidenced that the h2o2 was produced with reaction time and the concentrations followed the order of o2 bubbling 6 36 μm air equilibrium 4 85 μm n2 bubbling 2 88 μm therefore increasing dissolved o2 could promote h2o2 generation leading to acceleration of ps decomposition and enhanced bacterial inactivation efficiency in addition the increased dissolved o2 was also supposed to trap the photo generated electrons thus preventing the undesired charge recombination on mhc photocatalysts which further improving the disinfection efficiency 1 fe ii o2 fe iii o2 2 fe ii o2 2h fe iii h2o2 3 s2o8 2 o2 so4 2 so4 o2 4 s2o8 2 2h2o2 2 so4 o2 2h2o the reusability and regeneration of photocatalyst is vital for practical applications to test the recyclability the used photocatalysts were simply recovered by external magnetic field the treated effluent was drawn out followed by directly adding another set of bacterial suspension with cell concentrations of 8 0 log cfu ml as demonstrated in fig 4 a in the first run all of the bacterial cells were inactivated within 40 min of vl irradiation generally the bacterial inactivation efficiency remains stable in the repeated experiments while slightly decreases in the 3rd and 4th run the bacterial inactivation efficiency could still reach more than 5 0 log reduction in the 4th run corresponding to 99 999 disinfection efficiency in addition the efficiency was found to be completely recovered in the 5th run after the catalyst was regenerated simply by washing with distill water fig 4a suggesting the mhc can be reused without activity deterioration to evaluate the effect of dark absorption the dark absorption of the bacteria using the mhc sample after reaction and washing was studied and compared with the 1st dark absorption before the reaction the results indicated that the dark absorption of the bacteria was low and there was no significant difference between the 1st dark absorption and 2nd dark absorption fig s7 suggesting the recovery of the bacterial inactivation efficiency was not due to dark absorption moreover the xrd before and after the reactions illustrated in fig 4b demonstrates there is no detectable crystal structure change of the mhc sample in addition xps of the fe spectrum clearly shows the co exists of fe ii and fe iii the bind energy peak located at 710 8 and 723 8 ev can be assigned to fe ii while the bind energy peak located at 715 0 and 728 0 ev can be attributed to fe iii respectively fig 4c it is found that the surface contents of fe ii fe iii decreases slightly from 51 8 48 2 to 48 3 51 7 after the reaction suggesting only limited amount of surface fe ii is oxidized to fe iii during the reaction this results further confirms the high photo stability and recyclability which is essential for low cost applications 3 3 bacterial inactivation mechanism the possible main reactive species in the system of ps vl mhc were investigated by using specific scavengers to trap potential reactive species methanol tert butyl alcohol tba furfuryl alcohol ffa and tempol were applied as scavengers for so4 oh 1o2 and o2 respectively wang et al 2011 xia et al 2018 as fig 5 a shows with the addition of 1 mm tba ffa and tempol there is no obvious effect on the bacterial inactivation efficiency suggesting that oh 1o2 and o2 were not the main species during the bacterial inactivation process methanol is known to trap both oh and so4 radicals rastogi et al 2009 the addition of methanol was found to significantly inhibit the cell inactivation efficiency indicating that the main species is so4 to further confirm the dominant role of so4 epr characterization using dmpo as spin trapping reagent was conducted to distinguish different radicals cai et al 2019 as fig 5b shows the epr spectra with seven main peaks can be assigned to dmpox adduct which was originated from the oxidation of dmpo by so4 as the so4 dmpo adduct is reported to be not stable and would transformed to dmpox immediately du et al 2019 in addition the esr signal of dmpox was also found in ps mhc system with much smaller intensity suggesting the so4 was also the major reactive species but the so4 concentration was significant smaller than that in vl ps mhc system which is consistent with the above cell inactivation performances fig 2a however in the cases of vl ps and vl mhc only weak signals of dmpo oh was observed since the so4 will further transform to oh ahmad et al 2013 this result indicates only small amount of so4 was produced and immediately annihilated to produce trace amount of oh resulting in low cell inactivation ratio in vl ps and vl mhc systems all these confirm that the main active species for the vl ps mhc is so4 rather than oh large amounts of so4 is produced and directly cause the loss of bacterial cells viability to further investigate the cell lesions mechanism caused by so4 several intracellular enzymatic activities were also analyzed during the treatment process catalase cat is a typical enzyme which catalyze the decomposition of h2o2 it is found in fig 6 a that the cat level increases promptly in the first 10 min and reaches the highest value in 15 min and then decreases gradually with the complete of bacterial inactivation this indicates the bacterial cells were encountering significant oxidative stress and high level of enzyme was induced to annihilate the ross leading to the slow bacterial inactivation rate at the initial stage after the bacterial defending system was overwhelmed by continuous ross attacking the cell apoptosis occurred compared with the vl ps mhc system the induced cat level was much lower in the vl ps and ps mhc system suggesting the reduced oxidative stress in the systems which results in low inactivation efficiency similar phenomenon was also observed in the case of superoxide dismutase sod activity fig 6b these results indicate the attacking of so4 is associated with up regulation of intracellular ross including h2o2 o2 and oh which can initiate the chain oxidation reaction inside cell as reported in previous studies sun et al 2014 to further confirm this conclusion total intracellular ross was also examined using fluorescent probe dcfh da fig 6c the intracellular ros level increased with time and intensity on vl ps mhc system was the highest suggesting the oxidation process is like a self propagating progress induced by up regulation of intracellular ross the intracellular ross would then lead to the cytoplasm oxidation and destruction of genomic dna fig 6d finally resulting in the irreversible cell death to test the bacterial re growth activity the cell lesions process was also examined by sem observation as indicated in fig 6e the cell structure was intact at the initial stage while the cell outer membrane was ruptured and lots of holes were observed after 10 min of vl irradiation suggesting the first attacking site by so4 is the cell membrane which is consistent with oh mediated disinfection process chen et al 2019 liang et al 2018 wang et al 2018a with prolonged reaction time the cell was completely destructed leaving only cell debris after 40 min therefore there is no bacterial re colonization after dark repair since the cell structure is oxidized into pieces the released organic bio molecules would then be further oxidized and mineralized as confirmed by toc analysis fig s8 the bulk toc was increased at the initial stage due to the release of intracellular components and then decreased gradually suggesting the subsequent elimination of the released organics based on the above results a tentative mechanism of the bacterial inactivation was proposed in fig 7 when mhc was irradiated by vl in the presence of ps three major processes were occurred 1 the ps was directly sensitized by vl to generate so4 which subsequently transformed to oh eqs 5 and 6 as confirmed in fig 5b and also evidenced in our prior study wang et al 2019 2 the surface or lattice fe ii in fe3o4 could absorb ps to form fe ii o3so oso3 complex xia et al 2018 which then trigger the homolytic dissociation of o o bonds in ps and then produce fe iii and so4 eqs 7 and 8 this route is supported by the moderate bacterial inactivation activity in ps mhc system fig 2a 3 the photo excitation of fe3o4 generated photo electrons on the conduction band cb of the photocatalysts eq 9 the cb electrons then transfer to the adsorbed ps and lead to the sensitization of ps to generate so4 eq 10 the cb electron trapping by ps could further promote the separation of electron hole recombination thus increasing the quantum efficiency of photocatalysis the three route reactions occurred simultaneously in which the latter two are more important exhibiting a synergistic effect it is noted that in normal photocatalytic reaction process the cb electrons could be captured by o2 to generate o2 ribao et al 2019 however in the ps mediated photocatalytic process the cb electrons were captured more efficiently by ps rather than o2 as evidenced in fig 5a that the tempol a o2 scavenger has no effect on the bacterial inactivation performance therefore the main species in vl ps mhc system is assumed as so4 which cause the cell membrane oxidation and trigger chain reactions including up regulation of intracellular ross finally leading to the cell death 5 route 1 s2o8 2 vl 2 so4 6 so4 h2o so4 2 oh h 7 route 2 fe ii o3so oso3 fe ii o3so oso3 8 fe ii o3so oso3 fe iii so4 so4 2 9 route 3 mhc vl ecb hvb 10 s2o8 2 ecb so4 oh 3 4 versatility for water disinfection one major concern to develop novel water disinfection technology is the feasibility for pathogenic microorganism inactivation however most of the previous studies only used one model bacterium such as e coli to characterize the water disinfection activity he et al 2019 to further test the versatility of using vl ps mhc system for water disinfection several other pathogenic bacterial strains were also used as the targets staphylococcus aureus s aureus is a pathogen causing skin infections and food borne disease while pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa is a pathogen with multidrug resistance which is responsible for hospital acquired infections hai fig 8 shows the cell inactivation rate towards p aeruginosa and s aureus in the ps vl mhc system for p aeruginosa total inactivation of 8 log cells was reached after 90 min which was much longer than that for e coli for s aeruginosa the complete inactivation time was extended to 120 min suggesting that the sensitivity of different bacteria responding to the so4 mediated process follows the order of s aureus p aeruginosa e coli this phenomenon can be partially attributed to the different structure of cell wall of the tested bacteria as a gram positive bacterium s aureus has much thicker peptidoglycan layer 20 80 nm than that of gram negative bacterium 10 nm chen et al 2013 which results in higher oxidation resistant to so4 attacking as a gram negative bacterium p aeruginosa possesses multidrug resistant genes which makes it has higher resistance than gram negative e coli nevertheless these results indicate that the present system is effective to inactivate both gram negative gram positive as well as drug resistant pathogenic bacteria exhibiting prospect for versatile disinfection applications 4 conclusions in this study magnetic separable hydrochar was synthesized and applied for bacterial inactivation under vl through so4 mediated processes complete inactivation of 8 0 log e coli cells could be achieved after 40 min and 7 0 log cells could be treated within 20 min in which the efficiency was much higher than most of the traditional photocatalytic disinfection process the major reactive species was found to be so4 rather than oh or o2 which caused the damage of outer membrane and triggered the up regulation of intracellular ross the fe ii complex in the mhc could catalyze the decomposition of ps while the photo generated electrons from mhc could be captured by ps for generating so4 which cooperatively promote the ps activation for bacterial inactivation moreover the mhc could be easily recycled and used for universal treatment of pathogenic bacteria including p aeruginosa and s aureus these results were expected to provide advanced information not only for advancing the areas of water disinfection using recyclable catalysts and solar energy but also for further studying the cell inactivation mechanism in so4

17973,the development of green water disinfection technology utilizing solar energy is highly desired but remains challenging in this study sulfate radical so4 mediated bacterial inactivation was first attempted by using fe3o4 based magnetic hydrochar mhc as a recyclable catalyst for persulfate ps activation under visible light vl irradiation complete treatment of 8 0 log e coli cells was reached within 40 min in vl ps mhc system compared with that of only 2 0 log reduction was obtained in the ps mhc system under the same conditions the system was applicable in wide range of ph 3 0 9 0 and increasing dissolved o2 could further promote the efficiency a three route mechanism was proposed in which the ps activation by fe ii of fe3o4 and photo generated electron captured by ps were the major processes the bacterial cell lesion process was found to be triggered directly via so4 which caused the damage of outer membrane followed by up regulation of intracellular ross and destroy of chromosomal dna finally leading to irreversible cell death moreover the vl ps mhc system is also effective to inactivate versatile pathogenic bacteria including p aeruginosa and s aureus as a proof of concept our study provides meaningful information to advance the areas of green water disinfection technology which can be realized by recyclable photocatalytic systems using solar energy graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacterial inactivation photocatalysis persulfate activation visible light magnetic hydrochar 1 introduction pathogenic microorganisms transmitted via drinking water have been recognized as the major sources causing waterborne diseases and deaths in developing world li et al 2008 with rapid urbanization of society there is an increasing microbial contaminated wastewater generation which leads to outbreaks of waterborne diseases occurring at high level ashbolt 2004 therefore effective elimination of pathogens in drinking water is crucial and this calls for efficient disinfection technologies although conventional water disinfection technologies like ozonation chlorination and uv have been extensively used there are growing concerns about their adverse effects including carcinogenic disinfection by products high energy input and bacterial re colonization dalrymple et al 2010 wang et al 2015 developing alternative green and cost effective disinfection technologies with low energy consumption and high efficiency is urgent but still challengeable in scientific community an et al 2016 you et al 2019 solar disinfection sodis uses the inexhaustible solar energy to eliminate pathogens in water which has been practiced as low cost disinfection method in ancient cultures for centuries it has been recently emphasized by united nations un as a sustainable and transferrable technology which needs preferential development as alternative for chlorination keane et al 2014 however the major challenge of sodis technology remains the low efficiency and the treated water volume is small keane et al 2014 mcguigan et al 2012 in this regard photocatalytic disinfection have received enormous attention as it uses a photocatalyst to accelerate the sodis process which can remarkably promote the disinfection efficiency ganguly et al 2018 li et al 2015 2019 wang et al 2017 however the identified photocatalysts are mostly uv responsive which is ineffective to use the whole solar spectrum although a number of excellent visible light vl driven photocatalysts have been developed for bacterial inactivation noble metals i e pt ag are often loaded as co catalysts feng et al 2018 ma et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 and these powdery photocatalysts suffer from difficulties in recovery from aqueous environment wang et al 2018b photo fenton like processes e g h2o2 uv persulfate uv peroxymonosulfate uv have attracted increasing attention for their use in organic pollutants degradation pablos et al 2013 rehman et al 2018 wu et al 2017 in which the uvc persulfate ps system has been promising for e coli inactivation michael kordatou et al 2015 unfortunately these systems also used uv as the light source to catalyze ps decomposition fortunately we have recently found that ps can also be sensitized with vl irradiation for e coli elimination wang et al 2019 however the efficiency of bacterial inactivation is yet not satisfactory for practical use thus additional technologies are needed to accelerate the ps decomposition process generally transition metal based catalysts liu et al 2019a waclawek et al 2017 wu et al 2019 and metal free carbon based materials duan et al 2015 2016 olmez hanci et al 2018 can be applied to activate ps without light irradiation in addition it is reported that photo generated electrons from semiconductor photocatalysts can also be used to promote ps decomposition gao et al 2017 in turn the electron trapping by ps can suppress the undesired electrons hole recombination however the possible synergistic effect of catalytic ps activation and photocatalysis has not been well studied for bacterial inactivation therefore it is attractive to develop green catalysts that can catalyze the ps decomposition and can also be served as a photocatalyst for bacterial inactivation the ideal photocatalysts should also be environmental benign active under vl irradiation as well as facile recycling one of such choice is magnetite fe3o4 which is widely used in constructing composite catalysts with magnetic separable ability owing to its small band gap eg 0 1 ev zhang et al 2009 it has high vl absorption but its photocatalytic activity is restrained by fast electron hole recombination on the other hand fe3o4 is also an excellent heterogeneous catalysts to activate ps for degradation of pollutants du et al 2019 however fe3o4 nanoparticles suffer from aggregation in aqueous solution leading to decreased catalytic and magnetic properties one solution is to load the magnetic particles to carbonous materials to prevent particle aggregation liu et al 2019b zhu et al 2014 2016 in this regard biochar produced from waste biomass either by pyrolysis pyrochar or by hydrothermal carbonization hydrochar has received growing interests as absorbents and catalysts supports kambo and dutta 2015 qin et al 2018 chen et al 2017 has found that compared with porochar hydrochar possesses more oxygen functional groups making it preferable for being utilized as catalyst supports however the use of magnetic hydrochar as dual functional catalyst for ps activation and photocatalysis to inactivate bacteria in water has not been studied yet its underling inactivation mechanisms are also by far understandable herein magnetic hydrochar was fabricated using a one step hydrothermal method the physicochemical properties of the as prepared sample were characterized by multiple technologies the bacterial inactivation performances in the presence of magnetic hydrochar and ps were studied in detail under vl irradiation moreover the mechanisms of bacterial inactivation in terms of main reactive species cell morphology change antioxidant enzyme activity and chromosomal dna destruction were all systematically investigated furthermore the universality of this system to inactivate two more pathogenic bacteria was also investigated this work may provide innovative information to develop low cost magnetic hydrochar catalysts for recyclable bacterial inactivation under vl thus finally accomplishing the aim of green water disinfection technology using inexhaustible solar energy 2 experimental 2 1 synthesis of materials hydrochar hc was synthesized via a hydrothermal carbonization process briefly 8 0 g glucose aladdin ar grade was put into a beaker followed by adding 80 ml distilled water then the obtained solution in autoclave was subjected to hydrothermal treatment for 10 h at 180 c after reaction the precipitates of hc were collected by centrifugation washing and drying in vacuum at 60 c for 24 h before use magnetic hydrochar mhc were produced by a modified method using fecl3 as precursor of magnetic particles and zncl2 as porogen zhu et al 2014 typically 1 0 g anhydrous fecl3 aladdin ar grade and 2 0 g zncl2 aladdin ar grade were mixed in 12 5 ml distilled water then 2 0 g hc were added to the solution the mixtures were vigorously stirred for 24 h and then dried for 4 h at 80 c in air the dried products were then activated at 600 c for 90 min in n2 flow of 1 l min 1 the final products of mhc were washed with 0 1 m hcl ethanol and water several times before drying for 4 h at 80 c the characterization details of the samples were provided in supporting information 2 2 experiments for bacterial inactivation and analysis the bacterial inactivation capability of the mhc with ps under vl irradiation were tested using e coli as the model bacteria the bacterial culture and testing procedures can be found in our previous study wang et al 2019 briefly 20 mg mhc was put into 100 ml bacterial cell solution in a flask under vigorous stirring followed by adding ps 2 mm under vl irradiation to start the reaction two other pathogenic bacterial strains i e pseudomonas aeruginosa staphylococcus aureus were also utilized for the testing the details for analytical methods can be found in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of catalysts in this study hydrochar was produced by hydrothermal methods according to previous study hu et al 2017 then magnetic particles were incorporated into the hydrochar by pre impregnation with iron salts followed by thermal activation as shown in fig 1 a the xrd of the samples show that the pure hydrochar hc is amorphous in nature as there is only a broad peak of 20 30 corresponding to graphite in contrast the obtained magnetic hydrochar mhc shows strong diffraction peaks at 30 1 35 4 56 9 43 1 and 62 5 which can be assigned to crystal planes of fe3o4 in cubic phase jcpds 19 0629 space group fd3m suggesting fe3o4 nanoparticles are successfully fabricated onto hc without other impurities the uv vis absorption spectra show that the pristine hc exhibits semiconductor like absorption with cutoff wavelength up to 800 nm fig 1b which is due to delocalized π electrons in hc hu et al 2017 after incorporation with fe3o4 the mhc exhibits obviously enhanced vl absorption because of the narrow band gap of fe3o4 eg 0 1 ev zhang et al 2009 the magnetization curve in fig 1c indicates the mhc has superparamagnetic property with zero resonance and coercivity the saturated magnetization value of mhc reached 7 5 emu g such superparamagnetic property favors the rapid separation of the catalysts from aqueous solution qin et al 2015 as demonstrated in the inset of fig 1c the mhc powders can be tightly attracted on the vessel by external magnet suggesting its good magnetic recyclability the fe3o4 weight ratio determined by icp oes was 9 17 in the mhc composites the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of mhc shown in fig 1d demonstrates a type i isotherm with microporous structure kyotani et al 2003 the pore sized distribution inset of fig 1d confirms the microporosity with pore size below 3 nm as shown in table s1 the degree of microporosity demonstrated by the ratio of micropore volume total volume vmic vt was calculated to be 81 4 the surface area bet was obtained as over 1072 m2 g 1356 m2 g when using langmuir model in contrast the pristine hc shows a type iv isotherm with hysteresis loop fig s1 indicating a mesoporous structure the proportion of microporosity decreased to be 1 and the bet surface area was only 9 18 m2 g table s1 the remarkably increased surface area and microporosity on mhc would be benefit for ps absorption thus promoting subsequent ps decomposition and bacterial inactivation efficiencies the morphology of mhc was analyzed using tem and sem fig s2 a typical sem image of the as prepared mhc exhibits microsphere morphology with particle diameters of 200 400 nm the spherical morphology is not changed suggesting fe3o4 loading would not change the microstructure of hc the tem image clearly demonstrates that fe3o4 with sizes of 20 50 nm were anchored on the amorphous carbon sphere in addition the hrtem further shows clear crystal lattice fringe with interplanar distance to be 0 253 nm which corresponds to the 311 crystal plane of fe3o4 the haadf stem image and corresponding edx elemental mapping at the atomic scale further confirms the existence of c o and fe elements the surface fe content was determined to be 12 7 these results confirm the successful synthesis of fe3o4 loaded hydrochar with large surface area and high porosity 3 2 bacterial inactivation efficiency as a microbiological indicator in drinking water e coli was used to test the catalytic inactivation activity of the mhc sample to test the applicability in heavily microbial contaminated water a relative high cell concentration of 108 cfu ml was applied hereafter as fig 2 a shows with vl ps or vl mhc almost no bacterial inactivation efficiency was observed suggesting ps activation by vl alone and photocatalytic activity of mhc by vl alone are not effective for high concentration bacterial inactivation although we have previously found that the vl ps system can inactivate bacterial cells with much lower concentration of 107 cfu ml within 120 min wang et al 2019 in case of ps mhc it was found that about 2 0 log reduction of e coli cells was inactivated after 40 min suggesting that the ps could be activated by fe3o4 loaded into mhc to cause moderate cell inactivation interestingly in vl ps mhc system the bacterial inactivation efficiency was remarkably enhanced and complete inactivation of 8 log viable cells was accomplished within 40 min the bacterial inactivation kinetic was studied according to the log linear shoulder model geeraerd et al 2005 the obtained specific inactivation rate constant k max r2 0 99 was calculated to be 0 19 and 0 99 min 1 for bacterial inactivation in the ps mhc and vl ps mhc system respectively therefore the bacterial inactivation efficiency by the vl ps mhc system is about 5 21 times higher than that of ps mhc system in addition when the concentration of cells was decreased to normal levels of 107 and 106 cfu ml the complete inactivation was achieved within 20 min and 10 min respectively fig 2b it should be noted that this bacterial inactivation efficiency exceeds most of the vl driven photocatalytic systems reported so far except some ag based phocatalysts table s2 since the possible released ag is toxic to environment and would cause secondary pollution thus the mhc is more environmental benign and low cost which shows promise for large scale applications the ps decomposition kinetics was studied according to first order kinetics model fig 2c the obtained apparent reaction constant k r2 0 99 was 6 32 10 3 2 27 10 3 and 6 93 10 4 min 1 for vl ps mhc ps mhc and vl ps system respectively it is clear that the vl ps mhc system exhibits the highest ps decomposition efficiency which matches well with the above bacterial inactivation efficiency the ps concentration was deceased from 2 mm to 1 484 mm after completed 40 min reaction which indicates that 0 516 mm ps was decomposed corresponding to a so4 2 release concentration of 99 1 mg l theoretically this value was significantly lower than the pollution limit of so4 2 250 mg l in drinking water suggested by the world health organization who ioannidi et al 2018 therefore the released so4 2 concentration is low and would not cause significant secondary pollution the possible released fe content was also measured to be only about 1 31 mg l after completed 40 min reaction fig s3 the addition of equivalent amount of fe2 1 5 mg l or fe3 1 5 mg l in the vl ps system without catalysts would not cause significant bacterial inactivation fig 2a therefore the homogeneous reaction by fe vl ps could be excluded due to the low amount of fe ions which cannot trigger sufficient ross to cause bacterial inactivation the effect of ph on bacterial inactivation efficiency was studied fig 3 a the control experiments show that the ph variation in the range of 3 0 9 0 will not cause obvious bacterial inactivation suggesting ph value alone has negligible effect on the inactivation efficiency in the test period fig s4 the ph variation in the vl ps mhc system was monitored which shows that all the ph values are decreased a little under different initial ph and the ph is decreased more significantly under alkaline condition fig s5a generally it is known that basic ph could accelerate ps decomposition to produce oh thus enhancing the degradation efficiency towards organic pollutants furman et al 2010 nevertheless in the present work it was recognized that when ph value was increased to 9 0 only about 3 0 log reduction of viable cells was found in 40 min of treatment in contrast when the ph was decreased to 3 0 total inactivation of 8 0 log cells could be completed within 30 min suggesting acidic ph would favor the disinfection activity fig 3a this can be partially due to the fact that the surface of e coli cells is negatively charged which results in the electrostatic repulsion between the cells and s2o8 2 the adsorption of ps onto the cells is hindered with higher ph value thus reducing the bacterial inactivation activity nevertheless compared with traditional homogeneous photo fenton methods in which only strong acidic ph can be applied the vl ps mhc system can be applied in a wide ph range of 3 0 9 0 for water disinfection the effect of dissolved o2 on the disinfection efficiency was investigated by pumping with o2 or n2 in the reaction mixture as shown in figs 3b and 8 0 log reduction of e coli cells is reached within 30 min which is much faster than that of normal air equilibrium conditions indicating dissolved o2 is crucial to obtain high inactivation efficiency this was further confirmed by n2 bubbling experiments that n2 bubbling was found to significantly inhibit the bacterial inactivation process the ph variation was also monitored which shows that the ph is decreased more significantly with o2 bubbling fig s5b it has been reported the fe ii could reduce dissolved molecular o2 to produce h2o2 via generation of o2 eqs 1 and 2 harrington et al 2012 which can further promote the ps decomposition to generate so4 eqs 3 and 4 zhang et al 2017 to support this conclusion the generation of h2o2 was monitored fig s6 results evidenced that the h2o2 was produced with reaction time and the concentrations followed the order of o2 bubbling 6 36 μm air equilibrium 4 85 μm n2 bubbling 2 88 μm therefore increasing dissolved o2 could promote h2o2 generation leading to acceleration of ps decomposition and enhanced bacterial inactivation efficiency in addition the increased dissolved o2 was also supposed to trap the photo generated electrons thus preventing the undesired charge recombination on mhc photocatalysts which further improving the disinfection efficiency 1 fe ii o2 fe iii o2 2 fe ii o2 2h fe iii h2o2 3 s2o8 2 o2 so4 2 so4 o2 4 s2o8 2 2h2o2 2 so4 o2 2h2o the reusability and regeneration of photocatalyst is vital for practical applications to test the recyclability the used photocatalysts were simply recovered by external magnetic field the treated effluent was drawn out followed by directly adding another set of bacterial suspension with cell concentrations of 8 0 log cfu ml as demonstrated in fig 4 a in the first run all of the bacterial cells were inactivated within 40 min of vl irradiation generally the bacterial inactivation efficiency remains stable in the repeated experiments while slightly decreases in the 3rd and 4th run the bacterial inactivation efficiency could still reach more than 5 0 log reduction in the 4th run corresponding to 99 999 disinfection efficiency in addition the efficiency was found to be completely recovered in the 5th run after the catalyst was regenerated simply by washing with distill water fig 4a suggesting the mhc can be reused without activity deterioration to evaluate the effect of dark absorption the dark absorption of the bacteria using the mhc sample after reaction and washing was studied and compared with the 1st dark absorption before the reaction the results indicated that the dark absorption of the bacteria was low and there was no significant difference between the 1st dark absorption and 2nd dark absorption fig s7 suggesting the recovery of the bacterial inactivation efficiency was not due to dark absorption moreover the xrd before and after the reactions illustrated in fig 4b demonstrates there is no detectable crystal structure change of the mhc sample in addition xps of the fe spectrum clearly shows the co exists of fe ii and fe iii the bind energy peak located at 710 8 and 723 8 ev can be assigned to fe ii while the bind energy peak located at 715 0 and 728 0 ev can be attributed to fe iii respectively fig 4c it is found that the surface contents of fe ii fe iii decreases slightly from 51 8 48 2 to 48 3 51 7 after the reaction suggesting only limited amount of surface fe ii is oxidized to fe iii during the reaction this results further confirms the high photo stability and recyclability which is essential for low cost applications 3 3 bacterial inactivation mechanism the possible main reactive species in the system of ps vl mhc were investigated by using specific scavengers to trap potential reactive species methanol tert butyl alcohol tba furfuryl alcohol ffa and tempol were applied as scavengers for so4 oh 1o2 and o2 respectively wang et al 2011 xia et al 2018 as fig 5 a shows with the addition of 1 mm tba ffa and tempol there is no obvious effect on the bacterial inactivation efficiency suggesting that oh 1o2 and o2 were not the main species during the bacterial inactivation process methanol is known to trap both oh and so4 radicals rastogi et al 2009 the addition of methanol was found to significantly inhibit the cell inactivation efficiency indicating that the main species is so4 to further confirm the dominant role of so4 epr characterization using dmpo as spin trapping reagent was conducted to distinguish different radicals cai et al 2019 as fig 5b shows the epr spectra with seven main peaks can be assigned to dmpox adduct which was originated from the oxidation of dmpo by so4 as the so4 dmpo adduct is reported to be not stable and would transformed to dmpox immediately du et al 2019 in addition the esr signal of dmpox was also found in ps mhc system with much smaller intensity suggesting the so4 was also the major reactive species but the so4 concentration was significant smaller than that in vl ps mhc system which is consistent with the above cell inactivation performances fig 2a however in the cases of vl ps and vl mhc only weak signals of dmpo oh was observed since the so4 will further transform to oh ahmad et al 2013 this result indicates only small amount of so4 was produced and immediately annihilated to produce trace amount of oh resulting in low cell inactivation ratio in vl ps and vl mhc systems all these confirm that the main active species for the vl ps mhc is so4 rather than oh large amounts of so4 is produced and directly cause the loss of bacterial cells viability to further investigate the cell lesions mechanism caused by so4 several intracellular enzymatic activities were also analyzed during the treatment process catalase cat is a typical enzyme which catalyze the decomposition of h2o2 it is found in fig 6 a that the cat level increases promptly in the first 10 min and reaches the highest value in 15 min and then decreases gradually with the complete of bacterial inactivation this indicates the bacterial cells were encountering significant oxidative stress and high level of enzyme was induced to annihilate the ross leading to the slow bacterial inactivation rate at the initial stage after the bacterial defending system was overwhelmed by continuous ross attacking the cell apoptosis occurred compared with the vl ps mhc system the induced cat level was much lower in the vl ps and ps mhc system suggesting the reduced oxidative stress in the systems which results in low inactivation efficiency similar phenomenon was also observed in the case of superoxide dismutase sod activity fig 6b these results indicate the attacking of so4 is associated with up regulation of intracellular ross including h2o2 o2 and oh which can initiate the chain oxidation reaction inside cell as reported in previous studies sun et al 2014 to further confirm this conclusion total intracellular ross was also examined using fluorescent probe dcfh da fig 6c the intracellular ros level increased with time and intensity on vl ps mhc system was the highest suggesting the oxidation process is like a self propagating progress induced by up regulation of intracellular ross the intracellular ross would then lead to the cytoplasm oxidation and destruction of genomic dna fig 6d finally resulting in the irreversible cell death to test the bacterial re growth activity the cell lesions process was also examined by sem observation as indicated in fig 6e the cell structure was intact at the initial stage while the cell outer membrane was ruptured and lots of holes were observed after 10 min of vl irradiation suggesting the first attacking site by so4 is the cell membrane which is consistent with oh mediated disinfection process chen et al 2019 liang et al 2018 wang et al 2018a with prolonged reaction time the cell was completely destructed leaving only cell debris after 40 min therefore there is no bacterial re colonization after dark repair since the cell structure is oxidized into pieces the released organic bio molecules would then be further oxidized and mineralized as confirmed by toc analysis fig s8 the bulk toc was increased at the initial stage due to the release of intracellular components and then decreased gradually suggesting the subsequent elimination of the released organics based on the above results a tentative mechanism of the bacterial inactivation was proposed in fig 7 when mhc was irradiated by vl in the presence of ps three major processes were occurred 1 the ps was directly sensitized by vl to generate so4 which subsequently transformed to oh eqs 5 and 6 as confirmed in fig 5b and also evidenced in our prior study wang et al 2019 2 the surface or lattice fe ii in fe3o4 could absorb ps to form fe ii o3so oso3 complex xia et al 2018 which then trigger the homolytic dissociation of o o bonds in ps and then produce fe iii and so4 eqs 7 and 8 this route is supported by the moderate bacterial inactivation activity in ps mhc system fig 2a 3 the photo excitation of fe3o4 generated photo electrons on the conduction band cb of the photocatalysts eq 9 the cb electrons then transfer to the adsorbed ps and lead to the sensitization of ps to generate so4 eq 10 the cb electron trapping by ps could further promote the separation of electron hole recombination thus increasing the quantum efficiency of photocatalysis the three route reactions occurred simultaneously in which the latter two are more important exhibiting a synergistic effect it is noted that in normal photocatalytic reaction process the cb electrons could be captured by o2 to generate o2 ribao et al 2019 however in the ps mediated photocatalytic process the cb electrons were captured more efficiently by ps rather than o2 as evidenced in fig 5a that the tempol a o2 scavenger has no effect on the bacterial inactivation performance therefore the main species in vl ps mhc system is assumed as so4 which cause the cell membrane oxidation and trigger chain reactions including up regulation of intracellular ross finally leading to the cell death 5 route 1 s2o8 2 vl 2 so4 6 so4 h2o so4 2 oh h 7 route 2 fe ii o3so oso3 fe ii o3so oso3 8 fe ii o3so oso3 fe iii so4 so4 2 9 route 3 mhc vl ecb hvb 10 s2o8 2 ecb so4 oh 3 4 versatility for water disinfection one major concern to develop novel water disinfection technology is the feasibility for pathogenic microorganism inactivation however most of the previous studies only used one model bacterium such as e coli to characterize the water disinfection activity he et al 2019 to further test the versatility of using vl ps mhc system for water disinfection several other pathogenic bacterial strains were also used as the targets staphylococcus aureus s aureus is a pathogen causing skin infections and food borne disease while pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa is a pathogen with multidrug resistance which is responsible for hospital acquired infections hai fig 8 shows the cell inactivation rate towards p aeruginosa and s aureus in the ps vl mhc system for p aeruginosa total inactivation of 8 log cells was reached after 90 min which was much longer than that for e coli for s aeruginosa the complete inactivation time was extended to 120 min suggesting that the sensitivity of different bacteria responding to the so4 mediated process follows the order of s aureus p aeruginosa e coli this phenomenon can be partially attributed to the different structure of cell wall of the tested bacteria as a gram positive bacterium s aureus has much thicker peptidoglycan layer 20 80 nm than that of gram negative bacterium 10 nm chen et al 2013 which results in higher oxidation resistant to so4 attacking as a gram negative bacterium p aeruginosa possesses multidrug resistant genes which makes it has higher resistance than gram negative e coli nevertheless these results indicate that the present system is effective to inactivate both gram negative gram positive as well as drug resistant pathogenic bacteria exhibiting prospect for versatile disinfection applications 4 conclusions in this study magnetic separable hydrochar was synthesized and applied for bacterial inactivation under vl through so4 mediated processes complete inactivation of 8 0 log e coli cells could be achieved after 40 min and 7 0 log cells could be treated within 20 min in which the efficiency was much higher than most of the traditional photocatalytic disinfection process the major reactive species was found to be so4 rather than oh or o2 which caused the damage of outer membrane and triggered the up regulation of intracellular ross the fe ii complex in the mhc could catalyze the decomposition of ps while the photo generated electrons from mhc could be captured by ps for generating so4 which cooperatively promote the ps activation for bacterial inactivation moreover the mhc could be easily recycled and used for universal treatment of pathogenic bacteria including p aeruginosa and s aureus these results were expected to provide advanced information not only for advancing the areas of water disinfection using recyclable catalysts and solar energy but also for further studying the cell inactivation mechanism in so4

17974,eutrophication and climate change scenarios engender the need to develop good predictive models for harmful cyanobacterial blooms cyanohabs nevertheless modeling cyanobacterial biomass is a challenging task due to strongly skewed distributions that include many absences as well as extreme values dense blooms most modeling approaches alter the natural distribution of the data by splitting them into zeros absences and positive values assuming that different processes underlie these two components our objectives were 1 to develop a probabilistic model relating cyanobacterial biovolume to environmental variables in the río de la plata estuary 35 s 56 w n 205 observations considering all biovolume values zeros and positive biomass as part of the same process and 2 to use the model to predict cyanobacterial biovolume under different risk level scenarios using water temperature and conductivity as explanatory variables we developed a compound poisson gamma cpg regression model an approach that has not previously been used for modeling phytoplankton biovolume within a bayesian hierarchical framework posterior predictive checks showed that the fitted model had a good overall fit to the observed cyanobacterial biovolume and to more specific features of the data such as the proportion of samples crossing three threshold risk levels 0 2 1 and 2 mm³ l 1 at different water temperatures and conductivities the cpg model highlights the strong control of cyanobacterial biovolume by nonlinear and interactive effects of water temperature and conductivity the highest probability of crossing the three biovolume levels occurred at 22 2 c and at the lowest observed conductivity 0 1 ms cm 1 cross validation of the fitted model using out of sample observations n 72 showed the model s potential to be used in situ as it enabled prediction of cyanobacterial biomass based on two readily measured variables temperature and conductivity making it an interesting tool for early alert systems and management strategies furthermore this novel application demonstrates the potential of the bayesian cpg approach for predicting cyanobacterial dynamics in response to environmental change graphical abstract image 1 keywords alert levels bayesian modeling brackish ecosystems hab management risk thresholds salinity 1 introduction harmful cyanobacterial blooms cyanohabs have been registered with increasing frequency in many aquatic habitats worldwide during recent decades carey et al 2012 huisman et al 2018 eutrophication and climate change are the major factors underlying the escalation of the extent and duration of cyanohabs bonilla and pick 2017 o neil et al 2012 the toxins that may be contained in these blooms threaten supplies of drinking water endanger human activities and have negative effects on fish populations that can imperil fisheries dodds et al 2009 steffensen 2008 consequently the prediction of cyanobacterial occurrence and biomass has become critical both to developing strategies preventing cyanohab formation and to reducing the impact of blooms already underway glibert et al 2010 however modeling cyanobacteria is a challenging task due to the dynamic nature of their biomass which changes rapidly in space and time oliver et al 2012 the dominance of cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton of freshwater and brackish ecosystems is related to climate hydrology and eutrophication favorable conditions that may trigger blooms include high water temperature beaulieu et al 2013 elliott 2010 haakonsson et al 2017 paerl and huisman 2008 low salinity engström öst et al 2011 high nutrient concentrations downing et al 2001 gobler et al 2016 smith 1986 smith and schindler 2009 high light penetration davis and koop 2006 and water column stability carey et al 2012 wagner and adrian 2009 however the variables that best explain occurrence are not always those that best predict it shmueli 2010 in eutrophic ecosystems nutrients phosphorus p and nitrogen n are major determinants of cyanohabs lancelot and muylaert 2011 lehman et al 2010 but other variables such as water temperature salinity and hydrological features can be more effective as predictors of bloom dynamics olli et al 2015 robson and hamilton 2004 taş et al 2006 measuring nutrient concentrations is time consuming which limits their utility as predictors for early warning systems ideally such systems would include environmental features that can be measured rapidly prediction of planktonic cyanobacterial biomass and abundance has traditionally relied on a variety of quantitative methods such as linear and nonlinear regression downing et al 2001 kosten et al 2012 persaud et al 2015 additive models beaulieu et al 2013 taranu et al 2012 regression trees ghaffar and stevenson 2016 simulation models elliott 2010 and artificial neural networks ahn et al 2011 yang et al 2016 more recent approaches include fully probabilistic models such as bayesian networks johnson et al 2010 rigosi et al 2015 and bayesian regression analysis cha et al 2014 hamilton et al 2009 obenour et al 2014 bayesian approaches have high predictive power and allow for realistic quantification of uncertainty and separation of measurement and process errors franks 2018 hamilton et al 2009 which are key features for prediction a bayesian probabilistic approach is useful for risk management applications such as for example predicting cyanobacterial biovolume exceedance of different risk exposure levels cha et al 2014 cell abundance is the most used response variable in predictive cyanohab models e g cha et al 2017 ghaffar and stevenson 2016 whereas biovolume a more accurate indicator of biomass has been less frequently used dolman et al 2012 kosten et al 2012 the reasons behind this trend likely include the lesser availability of biovolume data as a result of the great effort involved in measuring the volume of each taxon additionally biovolume is a continuous variable with a skewed distribution that includes many zeros as well as extreme values all of which pose challenges for modeling species data often contain a large proportion of zeros fletcher et al 2005 to deal with this problem there are two common approaches adding a small arbitrary value to eliminate the zeros e g x 0 1 or using two part hurdle models one for the zeros the other for the positive values the latter approach requires an artificial split in the distribution of the data hurdle models have been used to predict microcystin concentrations in lakes and reservoirs taranu et al 2017 an alternative approach based on the compound poisson gamma cpg distribution allows for joint modeling of zeros and strictly positive values of a continuous variable and for extreme values such as those arising from blooms lecomte et al 2013a pennington 1996 the cpg distribution has been used by ecologists to model biomass of fishery catches foster and bravington 2013 lecomte et al 2013a and benthic macroinvertebrates lecomte et al 2013b despite its suitability for dealing with ecological data to our knowledge the cpg approach has not yet been used to model phytoplankton biovolume the selection of a suitable indicator is critical to a successful risk prediction most regulatory and advisory guidelines for drinking and recreational waters define levels or risk exposure to cyanobacteria based on some kind of concentration indicator chorus and bartram 1999 the most commonly used indicators are chlorophyll a concentration and cyanobacterial cell abundance or biovolume chorus and bartram 1999 among these three variables biovolume is the most accurate for estimating population biomass since cell size can vary more than one order of magnitude within species and more than two between species chorus and cavalieri 2000 and toxin concentration is better correlated with biomass than with cell counts ibelings et al 2015 for example the world health organization proposed two biovolume alert levels for drinking water 0 2 and 10 mm3 l 1 chorus and bartram 1999 while many countries have implemented two or three guide levels varying from 0 5 to 15 mm3 l 1 for recreational waters with associated consequent actions ibelings et al 2015 the río de la plata estuary one of the largest in the world 35000 km2 is located in the subtropical region of southern south america fig 1 the estuary provides multiple ecosystem services such as transportation fisheries and tourism and is the main drinking water supply for buenos aires 20 million inhabitants giannuzzi et al 2012 nagy et al 2002 the estuary has shown symptoms of eutrophication for decades nagy et al 2002 and blooms of toxic cyanobacteria have been reported since 1999 de león and yunes 2001 the blooms occur with high frequency especially in summer along both the south aguilera et al 2017 giannuzzi et al 2009 gómez 2014 sathicq et al 2014 and the north shores bonilla et al 2015 brena et al 2006 de león and yunes 2001 kruk et al 2015 including recently 2019 observed massive blooms kruk et al 2019 changes in physical variables such as temperature and salinity appear to be directly related to these blooms and thus the development of predictive models based on these variables should lead to improved water monitoring programs our objectives were to develop a compound poisson gamma regression model relating cyanobacterial biovolume to readily measured environmental variables and to use the model within a full bayesian framework to predict the probabilities of reaching three biovolume thresholds 0 2 mm3 l 1 1 mm3 l 1 and 2 mm3 l 1 because there is no current regulatory framework for recreational waters in uruguay we selected these thresholds based on globally accepted risk exposure levels chorus and bartram 1999 ibelings et al 2015 and observed cyanobacterial dynamics in the study region bonilla et al 2015 haakonsson et al 2017 we examined cyanobacterial abundances over a five year period at three sampling points n 277 observations located on the shore and 500 m offshore in the río del plata estuary 2 material and methods 2 1 data acquisition phytoplankton and environmental variables were sampled at punta del tigre in the río de la plata estuary uruguay 35 45 56 0 s 56 33 27 7 w on a bimonthly spring and summer and trimonthly autumn and winter basis between october 2014 and july 2019 2014 2018 n 205 observations used to calibrate the model 2018 2019 n 72 observations used for cross validation the study area is shallow 4 m depth oligohaline and meso

for salinity dissolved oxygen ph and light penetration were measured at each sampling site phytoplankton samples were taken in triplicate at most sites and dates mean number of replicates 2 71 from the subsurface at each site in 0 5 l bottles and fixed in lugol s solution algae and cyanobacteria taxa were identified to the lowest possible taxonomical level and counted cells ml 1 in sedimentation chambers using an inverted microscope olympus ckx41 and a standard quantification method sournia 1978 utermöhl 1958 taxa volumes μm3 were calculated from geometric shape approximations hillebrand et al 1999 using cell measurements at least 10 cells per taxon per sample to obtain the biovolume of each taxon mm3 l 1 2 2 model development the compound poisson gamma cpg variables are sums of random variables arising from a common gamma distribution in which the number of terms entering the sums has a poisson distribution in our application the total cyanobacterial biovolume in a sample y is viewed as a collection of m cyanobacterial aggregations groups of organisms viewed as statistical events the number of which is sampled from a poisson distribution having biovolumes r which follow a gamma distribution lecomte et al 2013a more formally y r 1 r 2 r 3 r m where m has a poisson distribution with mean λ and the r are identically distributed random variables sampled from a gamma distribution with shape α and rate β withers and nadarajah 2011 this implies that there may be samples with no cyanobacteria m 0 regression models can be cast in this framework by modeling the poisson mean as a function of covariates lecomte et al 2013a smyth 1996 in these models the information in both the zero and positive observations can contribute to the estimation of all parts of the model smyth 1996 we developed a cpg regression model within a full bayesian framework using cyanobacterial biovolume as the response variable the model includes two environmental variables that strongly influence cyanobacterial biomass in coastal ecosystems surface water temperature and conductivity a proxy for salinity previous studies in coastal ecosystems worldwide olli et al 2015 robson and hamilton 2004 taş et al 2006 and in the río de la plata estuary kruk et al 2019 martínez de la escalera et al 2017 have revealed the importance of these two variables for bloom prediction preliminary tests with models including ph flow and depth as possible predictors indicated that these variables had no discernible effect on cyanobacterial biovolume prediction these variables were thus omitted from further analyses our model assumes that the biovolume observations y arise from a cpg distribution characterized by three parameters the poisson mean λ and the gamma shape α and rate β y ijk cpg λ ijk α β where the indices correspond to replicate i i 1 n jk at site j j 1 2 3 and time k k 1 26 the number of replicates n jk is indexed by site and date because samples were not collected in triplicate at all sites and dates see 2 1 data acquisition the poisson mean λ ijk was modeled on the log scale as log λ ijk ϕ 0 ϕ 1 x 1ijk ϕ 2 x 2ijk ϕ p x pijk η ij ν ik ε ijk where ϕ 0 is an intercept and ϕ 1 ϕ p are slope parameters for p covariates x 1ijk x pijk η ij are spatial random effects associated with differences among sites ν ik are temporal random effects associated with differences among dates and ε ijk are observation level errors our model included four covariate terms that captured additive and multiplicative effects of the explanatory variables temperature and conductivity linear and quadratic terms for water temperature a linear term for conductivity and a term for the interaction between temperature and conductivity inclusion of a quadratic term for temperature allows for dome shaped relationships between biovolume and temperature including a thermal optimum at intermediate temperatures whereas the temperature conductivity interaction allows the effect of either variable to be affected by the level of the other temperature and conductivity were standardized to zero mean and unit variance to facilitate comparisons of effects and improve computational stability we used the following diffuse prior distributions for the model parameters regression coefficients ϕ i normal 0 100 gamma shape and rate parameters α gamma 0 01 0 01 β gamma 0

the information gained from the data relative to the vague priors we used posterior predictive checks which compare the observed data to the posterior predictive distribution gelman et al 1996 2014 to assess both the overall goodness of fit of the model and its ability to predict specific aspects of the data which are of particular interest for management to conduct these tests we devised three data dependent test quantities calculated as the proportion of samples that exceeded each of three selected cyanobacterial biovolume thresholds 0 2 mm³ l 1 1 mm³ l 1 and 2 mm³ l 1 the first threshold corresponds to the alert level 1 for drinking waters and the last to the guidance level 1 for recreational waters of the who alert level framework chorus and bartram 1999 the intermediate threshold value 1 mm³ l 1 used in different countries for recreational waters ibelings et al 2015 corresponds to a biomass typically found prior to visible accumulations i e 2 mm³ l 1 and beyond and is therefore useful for developing early warning systems the three test quantities calculated from the observed data were compared to those generated by simulations from the posterior predictive distribution we calculated variance components for the random terms in the model to quantify the relative contribution of spatial and temporal variation to fluctuations in biovolume the fitted model was also used to obtain the probability of exceeding each of the selected biovolume thresholds at different combinations of temperature and conductivity taken as the proportion of mcmc samples from the posterior distribution of biovolume that had values greater than the threshold all analyses were carried out in the r environment r core team 2018 using the rjags interface plummer 2014 to jags plummer 2003 which uses a mcmc algorithm to sample from the posterior distribution of the parameters an initial adaptive phase was run for 1 000 mcmc iterations to optimize sampler efficiency by tuning the proposal distribution we ran 5 chains for 2 000 000 iterations discarded the first half burn in and retained 1 in 1 000 samples thinning of the second half to obtain a total of 5 000 mcmc samples posterior distributions of individual parameters were summarized as medians and 95 credible intervals convergence of the chains was assessed using visual inspection of trace plots and the univariate and multivariate gelman rubin diagnostics potential scale reduction factors psrf in the coda package plummer et al 2006 in addition to the posterior predictive checks we cross validated the fitted model against out of sample observations 2018 2019 n 72 which were not used to fit the model the model fitted to the first set of observations 2014 2018 was used to predict cyanobacterial biovolume from temperature and conductivity in the second set of observations 2018 2019 predictions for new observations were obtained after setting all random effects to zero these are conditional responses for observations in a hypothetical sampling group skrondal 2009 3 results 3 1 dynamics of cyanobacteria and main predictive variables the three sampling sites were similar in their limnological characteristics during the study period table 1 fig 2 temperature ranged from 9 5 to 29 2 c showing a clear seasonal trend whereas conductivity ranged from 0 1 to 8 7 ms cm 1 and showed no clear temporal trend fig 2 cyanobacterial biovolume ranged from 0 mm3 l 1 101 of 205 samples to 60 mm3 l 1 fig 3 at low biovolume 0 2 mm3 l 1 the phytoplankton assemblage was mainly dominated by diatoms such as aulacoseira granulata and actinocyclus normanii followed by dinoflagellates cryptophytes and chlorophytes during the warm season when the total biovolume was moderate to high 1 mm3 l 1 the assemblage was characterized by cyanobacteria 60 of total phytoplankton biovolume the most dominant species were the colonial microcystis aeruginosa and m protocystis and the filamentous dolichospermum uruguayensis and d circinale a complete list of cyanobacterial taxa is presented in the supplementary material table s1 3 2 fit and parameter estimates of the cpg model neither the multivariate 1 07 nor the univariate gelman rubin diagnostics 1 04 for all parameters indicated potential problems with convergence i e chains seemed to mix adequately as the gelman rubin diagnostic was 1 1 gelman et al 2014 the posterior predictive distribution of cyanobacterial biovolumes showed a good overall fit to the observed data fig 4 a fig s1 supplementary material posterior predictive checks showed that model predictions were within a few percentage points of the observed values for the three alert level thresholds although the model may be slightly underestimating the proportion of samples exceeding the lowest threshold 0 2 mm3 l 1 fig 4b comparison of prior and posterior distributions fig 5 showed that the data provided substantial information on the parameters of interest and that parameter estimates were not determined primarily by the prior distribution the parameter estimates associated with the covariates in our model surface temperature ϕ1 surface temperature2 ϕ2 conductivity ϕ3 and the interaction between surface temperature and conductivity ϕ4 showed a clear effect of all covariates on cyanobacterial biovolume fig 5 and point to the presence of nonlinear responses to temperature and conductivity the components of variance yielded by the model for biovolume indicated that temporal variation was substantially stronger than spatial variation supplementary material table s2 matching the patterns observed earlier for the environmental predictors fig 2 the cross validation showed that the model captured the main seasonal trends at the three study sites although the wide credible intervals point to substantial variability in the predicted values fig 6 with the exception of the mid summer nov dec samples there appears to be no systematic over or under estimation of mean biovolume across sites the coefficients of determination for observed and predicted values at the three sites were r2 0 37 for site 1 r2 0 34 for site 2 and r2 0 92 for site 3 n 8 observations at each site for all sites combined site means n 8 observations it was r2 0 87 3 3 predicting cyanobacterial exceedance probabilities and biovolume the joint structuring effects of water temperature and conductivity on cyanobacteria were visualized by constructing contour plots of the probability of exceeding the three biovolume threshold levels fig 7 as expected the exceedance probability declined as threshold levels increased fig 7 for the three tiers the model predicted the highest probability at a temperature of 22 2 c and at the lowest observed values for conductivity 0 1 ms cm 1 fig 7 overall exceedance probabilities decreased with rising conductivity and at the highest conductivity the temperature at which the maximum probability occurred was shifted upwards to 27 c fig 7 the nonlinearity in cyanobacterial responses to temperature and conductivity yielded a sharp increase in exceedance probabilities when conductivity falls below 0 5 ms cm 1 temperature effects such an increase from 20 to 25 c were most pronounced for the lowest threshold fig 8 at 20 c cyanobacterial biovolume will most likely not reach any threshold when conductivity is greater than 2 ms cm 1 whereas at 25 c even the highest tier has a substantial chance to be surpassed even at high conductivity fig 9 4 discussion we presented a novel cpg approach to modeling cyanobacterial biovolume within a bayesian probabilistic framework this approach provides a full accounting of uncertainty in predictions as it incorporates variation which originates from both sampling error and uncertainty in parameter values using two environmental variables which are readily measured in situ we were able to predict the probability of cyanobacterial biovolume exceeding three threshold values relevant to management the risk of exposure expressed in probabilities can be a useful tool for early warning systems particularly for coastal eutrophic environments that are susceptible to develop cyanohabs cyanohabs can occur within a very short period of time shifting rapidly from undetected levels to peak biomass values blooms our approach overcomes one of the problems inherent to statistical modeling of these organisms the presence of a large proportion of zeros in data sets franks 2018 for count data such as cell abundance hurdle models e g cha et al 2014 assume that zeros occur from one process and the positive values from another whereas zero inflated models assume that extra zeros come from a second process cusack et al 2015 however for continuous data such as biovolume this artificial categorization can impose an unwanted discontinuity in the data because in natural environments the same drivers often simultaneously influence absence zeros and presence nonzero biomass lecomte et al 2013a contrary to most models for habs which use cell abundance as the response variable e g cha et al 2014 cusack et al 2015 our approach is based on biovolume which is the best indicator of phytoplankton biomass chorus and cavalieri 2000 reynolds 2006 furthermore the use of biovolume instead of other biological indicators can change model outputs and improve predictions of lake ecological status moe et al 2016 we found clear nonlinear interactive effects of water temperature and conductivity on cyanobacterial biovolume growth of freshwater cyanobacteria is generally favored at higher temperatures with well defined thermal optima for growth at temperatures ranging between 20 and 30 c e g fig 5 3 in reynolds 2006 whereas high salinity tends to limit or inhibit cyanobacterial growth reynolds 2006 the importance of these drivers for cyanobacterial blooms in estuaries has been well documented temperature cha et al 2014 lehman et al 2008 robson and hamilton 2003 salinity hall et al 2013 robson and hamilton 2003 taş et al 2006 models of cyanobacterial biomass have included interactions between environmental predictors e g between temperature and nutrients in lentic water bodies taranu et al 2012 but we found no previous examples of models including an interaction between temperature and conductivity we suggest that inclusion of this interaction may lead to improvements in models for cyanohabs in coastal environments our model predicts that the probability of crossing the three threshold levels is greatest at 22 2 c species from the genera microcystis and dolichospermum co occur at our study site and frequently bloom together in the region aguilera et al 2017 haakonsson et al 2017 o farrell et al 2012 and elsewhere li et al 2010 te and gin 2011 in lentic ecosystems mixed microcystis dolichospermum blooms are commonly observed between 25 and 30 c krienitz et al 2002 o farrell et al 2012 te and gin 2011 however in estuaries and coastal areas such as the baltic sea and san francisco bay cyanobacterial blooms are more frequent at temperatures nearer to 20 c lehman et al 2010 pliński et al 2007 a similar trend is found for coastal blooms in the río de la plata estuary 5 out of 7 coastal blooms were registered between 21 and 23 c haakonsson et al 2017 on the southern side of the estuary cyanobacteria above who guidance level 1 based on microcystis cells have been reported between 20 and 24 c giannuzzi et al 2012 supplementary material fig s2 these findings and our own results allow us to highlight the potential of our new model to detect changes in cyanobacterial biovolume in temperature ranges commonly found for cyanohabs in the studied region the two explanatory variables in our model temperature and conductivity measured in situ are normally recorded in basic monitoring programs and can be obtained in real time which potentially allows for instantaneous on site determination of exceedance probabilities this is a comparative advantage over models that require time consuming laboratory measurements of predictors such as nutrients our model can therefore be a useful tool for early warning of cyanohab events in monitoring programs in eutrophic coastal waters furthermore the conductivity values covered in the present study are in the salinity range of the

https www dinama gub uy oan datos abiertos https www dinama gub uy oan datos abiertos should promote the use of this type of model our results suggest that the probability of cyanobacterial bloom occurrence at the study site and possibly in most coastal areas in the río de la plata estuary is strongly dependent on two physical variables directly related to climate annual precipitation annual and seasonal means is projected to increase in this region ipcc 2007 which should lower the conductivity and favor the proliferation of cyanobacteria reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 when extreme rainfall occurs in the río de la plata basin during summer blooms are likely to appear in the estuary kruk et al 2019 furthermore freshwater discharge from two large rivers uruguay and paraná enters the estuary resulting in reduced conductivity and increased temperature and thus favoring cyanobacterial blooms kruk et al 2019 cyanobacterial biomass is also flushed from reservoirs upstream into the estuary where it continues to grow and proliferate kruk et al 2019 extreme rainfall events in the southern río de la plata basin are projected take place through the twenty first century barros et al 2013 and therefore cyanobacterial blooms are expected to increase in intensity and duration in the future haakonsson et al 2017 despite the fact that nutrient concentrations can be major determinants of cyanobacterial growth they may not be primary predictors of biomass in nutrient rich estuaries robson and hamilton 2004 taş et al 2006 although strong reductions in nutrient loads phosphorus and

17974,eutrophication and climate change scenarios engender the need to develop good predictive models for harmful cyanobacterial blooms cyanohabs nevertheless modeling cyanobacterial biomass is a challenging task due to strongly skewed distributions that include many absences as well as extreme values dense blooms most modeling approaches alter the natural distribution of the data by splitting them into zeros absences and positive values assuming that different processes underlie these two components our objectives were 1 to develop a probabilistic model relating cyanobacterial biovolume to environmental variables in the río de la plata estuary 35 s 56 w n 205 observations considering all biovolume values zeros and positive biomass as part of the same process and 2 to use the model to predict cyanobacterial biovolume under different risk level scenarios using water temperature and conductivity as explanatory variables we developed a compound poisson gamma cpg regression model an approach that has not previously been used for modeling phytoplankton biovolume within a bayesian hierarchical framework posterior predictive checks showed that the fitted model had a good overall fit to the observed cyanobacterial biovolume and to more specific features of the data such as the proportion of samples crossing three threshold risk levels 0 2 1 and 2 mm³ l 1 at different water temperatures and conductivities the cpg model highlights the strong control of cyanobacterial biovolume by nonlinear and interactive effects of water temperature and conductivity the highest probability of crossing the three biovolume levels occurred at 22 2 c and at the lowest observed conductivity 0 1 ms cm 1 cross validation of the fitted model using out of sample observations n 72 showed the model s potential to be used in situ as it enabled prediction of cyanobacterial biomass based on two readily measured variables temperature and conductivity making it an interesting tool for early alert systems and management strategies furthermore this novel application demonstrates the potential of the bayesian cpg approach for predicting cyanobacterial dynamics in response to environmental change graphical abstract image 1 keywords alert levels bayesian modeling brackish ecosystems hab management risk thresholds salinity 1 introduction harmful cyanobacterial blooms cyanohabs have been registered with increasing frequency in many aquatic habitats worldwide during recent decades carey et al 2012 huisman et al 2018 eutrophication and climate change are the major factors underlying the escalation of the extent and duration of cyanohabs bonilla and pick 2017 o neil et al 2012 the toxins that may be contained in these blooms threaten supplies of drinking water endanger human activities and have negative effects on fish populations that can imperil fisheries dodds et al 2009 steffensen 2008 consequently the prediction of cyanobacterial occurrence and biomass has become critical both to developing strategies preventing cyanohab formation and to reducing the impact of blooms already underway glibert et al 2010 however modeling cyanobacteria is a challenging task due to the dynamic nature of their biomass which changes rapidly in space and time oliver et al 2012 the dominance of cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton of freshwater and brackish ecosystems is related to climate hydrology and eutrophication favorable conditions that may trigger blooms include high water temperature beaulieu et al 2013 elliott 2010 haakonsson et al 2017 paerl and huisman 2008 low salinity engström öst et al 2011 high nutrient concentrations downing et al 2001 gobler et al 2016 smith 1986 smith and schindler 2009 high light penetration davis and koop 2006 and water column stability carey et al 2012 wagner and adrian 2009 however the variables that best explain occurrence are not always those that best predict it shmueli 2010 in eutrophic ecosystems nutrients phosphorus p and nitrogen n are major determinants of cyanohabs lancelot and muylaert 2011 lehman et al 2010 but other variables such as water temperature salinity and hydrological features can be more effective as predictors of bloom dynamics olli et al 2015 robson and hamilton 2004 taş et al 2006 measuring nutrient concentrations is time consuming which limits their utility as predictors for early warning systems ideally such systems would include environmental features that can be measured rapidly prediction of planktonic cyanobacterial biomass and abundance has traditionally relied on a variety of quantitative methods such as linear and nonlinear regression downing et al 2001 kosten et al 2012 persaud et al 2015 additive models beaulieu et al 2013 taranu et al 2012 regression trees ghaffar and stevenson 2016 simulation models elliott 2010 and artificial neural networks ahn et al 2011 yang et al 2016 more recent approaches include fully probabilistic models such as bayesian networks johnson et al 2010 rigosi et al 2015 and bayesian regression analysis cha et al 2014 hamilton et al 2009 obenour et al 2014 bayesian approaches have high predictive power and allow for realistic quantification of uncertainty and separation of measurement and process errors franks 2018 hamilton et al 2009 which are key features for prediction a bayesian probabilistic approach is useful for risk management applications such as for example predicting cyanobacterial biovolume exceedance of different risk exposure levels cha et al 2014 cell abundance is the most used response variable in predictive cyanohab models e g cha et al 2017 ghaffar and stevenson 2016 whereas biovolume a more accurate indicator of biomass has been less frequently used dolman et al 2012 kosten et al 2012 the reasons behind this trend likely include the lesser availability of biovolume data as a result of the great effort involved in measuring the volume of each taxon additionally biovolume is a continuous variable with a skewed distribution that includes many zeros as well as extreme values all of which pose challenges for modeling species data often contain a large proportion of zeros fletcher et al 2005 to deal with this problem there are two common approaches adding a small arbitrary value to eliminate the zeros e g x 0 1 or using two part hurdle models one for the zeros the other for the positive values the latter approach requires an artificial split in the distribution of the data hurdle models have been used to predict microcystin concentrations in lakes and reservoirs taranu et al 2017 an alternative approach based on the compound poisson gamma cpg distribution allows for joint modeling of zeros and strictly positive values of a continuous variable and for extreme values such as those arising from blooms lecomte et al 2013a pennington 1996 the cpg distribution has been used by ecologists to model biomass of fishery catches foster and bravington 2013 lecomte et al 2013a and benthic macroinvertebrates lecomte et al 2013b despite its suitability for dealing with ecological data to our knowledge the cpg approach has not yet been used to model phytoplankton biovolume the selection of a suitable indicator is critical to a successful risk prediction most regulatory and advisory guidelines for drinking and recreational waters define levels or risk exposure to cyanobacteria based on some kind of concentration indicator chorus and bartram 1999 the most commonly used indicators are chlorophyll a concentration and cyanobacterial cell abundance or biovolume chorus and bartram 1999 among these three variables biovolume is the most accurate for estimating population biomass since cell size can vary more than one order of magnitude within species and more than two between species chorus and cavalieri 2000 and toxin concentration is better correlated with biomass than with cell counts ibelings et al 2015 for example the world health organization proposed two biovolume alert levels for drinking water 0 2 and 10 mm3 l 1 chorus and bartram 1999 while many countries have implemented two or three guide levels varying from 0 5 to 15 mm3 l 1 for recreational waters with associated consequent actions ibelings et al 2015 the río de la plata estuary one of the largest in the world 35000 km2 is located in the subtropical region of southern south america fig 1 the estuary provides multiple ecosystem services such as transportation fisheries and tourism and is the main drinking water supply for buenos aires 20 million inhabitants giannuzzi et al 2012 nagy et al 2002 the estuary has shown symptoms of eutrophication for decades nagy et al 2002 and blooms of toxic cyanobacteria have been reported since 1999 de león and yunes 2001 the blooms occur with high frequency especially in summer along both the south aguilera et al 2017 giannuzzi et al 2009 gómez 2014 sathicq et al 2014 and the north shores bonilla et al 2015 brena et al 2006 de león and yunes 2001 kruk et al 2015 including recently 2019 observed massive blooms kruk et al 2019 changes in physical variables such as temperature and salinity appear to be directly related to these blooms and thus the development of predictive models based on these variables should lead to improved water monitoring programs our objectives were to develop a compound poisson gamma regression model relating cyanobacterial biovolume to readily measured environmental variables and to use the model within a full bayesian framework to predict the probabilities of reaching three biovolume thresholds 0 2 mm3 l 1 1 mm3 l 1 and 2 mm3 l 1 because there is no current regulatory framework for recreational waters in uruguay we selected these thresholds based on globally accepted risk exposure levels chorus and bartram 1999 ibelings et al 2015 and observed cyanobacterial dynamics in the study region bonilla et al 2015 haakonsson et al 2017 we examined cyanobacterial abundances over a five year period at three sampling points n 277 observations located on the shore and 500 m offshore in the río del plata estuary 2 material and methods 2 1 data acquisition phytoplankton and environmental variables were sampled at punta del tigre in the río de la plata estuary uruguay 35 45 56 0 s 56 33 27 7 w on a bimonthly spring and summer and trimonthly autumn and winter basis between

chambers using an inverted microscope olympus ckx41 and a standard quantification method sournia 1978 utermöhl 1958 taxa volumes μm3 were calculated from geometric shape approximations hillebrand et al 1999 using cell measurements at least 10 cells per taxon per sample to obtain the biovolume of each taxon mm3 l 1 2 2 model development the compound poisson gamma cpg variables are sums of random variables arising from a common gamma distribution in which the number of terms entering the sums has a poisson distribution in our application the total cyanobacterial biovolume in a sample y is viewed as a collection of m cyanobacterial aggregations groups of organisms viewed as statistical events the number of which is sampled from a poisson distribution having biovolumes r which follow a gamma distribution lecomte et al 2013a more formally y r 1 r 2 r 3 r m where m has a poisson distribution with mean λ and the r are identically distributed random variables sampled from a gamma distribution with shape α and rate β withers and nadarajah 2011 this implies that there may be samples with no cyanobacteria m 0 regression models can be cast in this framework by modeling the poisson mean as a function of covariates lecomte et al 2013a smyth 1996 in these models the information in both the zero and positive observations can contribute to the estimation of all parts of the model smyth 1996 we developed a cpg regression model within a full bayesian framework using cyanobacterial biovolume as the response variable the model includes two environmental variables that strongly influence cyanobacterial biomass in coastal ecosystems surface water temperature and conductivity a proxy for salinity previous studies in coastal ecosystems worldwide olli et al 2015 robson and hamilton 2004 taş et al 2006 and in the río de la plata estuary kruk et al 2019 martínez de la escalera et al 2017 have revealed the importance of these two variables for bloom prediction preliminary tests with models including ph flow and depth as possible predictors indicated that these variables had no discernible effect on cyanobacterial biovolume prediction these variables were thus omitted from further analyses our model assumes that the biovolume observations y arise from a cpg distribution characterized by three parameters the poisson mean λ and the gamma shape α and rate β y ijk cpg λ ijk α β where the indices correspond to replicate i i 1 n jk at site j j 1 2 3 and time k k 1 26 the number of replicates n jk is indexed by site and date because samples were not collected in triplicate at all sites and dates see 2 1 data acquisition the poisson mean λ ijk was modeled on the log scale as log λ ijk ϕ 0 ϕ 1 x 1ijk ϕ 2 x 2ijk ϕ p x pijk η ij ν ik ε ijk where ϕ 0 is an intercept and ϕ 1 ϕ p are slope parameters for p covariates x 1ijk x pijk η ij are spatial random effects associated with differences among sites ν ik are temporal random effects associated with differences among dates and ε ijk are observation level errors our model included four covariate terms that captured additive and multiplicative effects of the explanatory variables temperature and conductivity linear and quadratic terms for water temperature a linear term for conductivity and a term for the interaction between temperature and conductivity inclusion of a quadratic term for temperature allows for dome shaped relationships between biovolume and temperature including a thermal optimum at intermediate temperatures whereas the temperature conductivity interaction allows the effect of either variable to be affected by the level of the other temperature and conductivity were standardized to zero mean and unit variance to facilitate comparisons of effects and improve computational stability we used the following diffuse prior distributions for the model parameters regression coefficients ϕ i normal 0 100 gamma shape and rate parameters α gamma 0 01 0 01 β gamma 0

the information gained from the data relative to the vague priors we used posterior predictive checks which compare the observed data to the posterior predictive distribution gelman et al 1996 2014 to assess both the overall goodness of fit of the model and its ability to predict specific aspects of the data which are of particular interest for management to conduct these tests we devised three data dependent test quantities calculated as the proportion of samples that exceeded each of three selected cyanobacterial biovolume thresholds 0 2 mm³ l 1 1 mm³ l 1 and 2 mm³ l 1 the first threshold corresponds to the alert level 1 for drinking waters and the last to the guidance level 1 for recreational waters of the who alert level framework chorus and bartram 1999 the intermediate threshold value 1 mm³ l 1 used in different countries for recreational waters ibelings et al 2015 corresponds to a biomass typically found prior to visible accumulations i e 2 mm³ l 1 and beyond and is therefore useful for developing early warning systems the three test quantities calculated from the observed data were compared to those generated by simulations from the posterior predictive distribution we calculated variance components for the random terms in the model to quantify the relative contribution of spatial and temporal variation to fluctuations in biovolume the fitted model was also used to obtain the probability of exceeding each of the selected biovolume thresholds at different combinations of temperature and conductivity taken as the proportion of mcmc samples from the posterior distribution of biovolume that had values greater than the threshold all analyses were carried out in the r environment r core team 2018 using the rjags interface plummer 2014 to jags plummer 2003 which uses a mcmc algorithm to sample from the posterior distribution of the parameters an initial adaptive phase was run for 1 000 mcmc iterations to optimize sampler efficiency by tuning the proposal distribution we ran 5 chains for 2 000 000 iterations discarded the first half burn in and retained 1 in 1 000 samples thinning of the second half to obtain a total of 5 000 mcmc samples posterior distributions of individual parameters were summarized as medians and 95 credible intervals convergence of the chains was assessed using visual inspection of trace plots and the univariate and multivariate gelman rubin diagnostics potential scale reduction factors psrf in the coda package plummer et al 2006 in addition to the posterior predictive checks we cross validated the fitted model against out of sample observations 2018 2019 n 72 which were not used to fit the model the model fitted to the first set of observations 2014 2018 was used to predict cyanobacterial biovolume from temperature and conductivity in the second set of observations 2018 2019 predictions for new observations were obtained after setting all random effects to zero these are conditional responses for observations in a hypothetical sampling group skrondal 2009 3 results 3 1 dynamics of cyanobacteria and main predictive variables the three sampling sites were similar in their limnological characteristics during the study period table 1 fig 2 temperature ranged from 9 5 to 29 2 c showing a clear seasonal trend whereas conductivity ranged from 0 1 to 8 7 ms cm 1 and showed no clear temporal trend fig 2 cyanobacterial biovolume ranged from 0 mm3 l 1 101 of 205 samples to 60 mm3 l 1 fig 3 at low biovolume 0 2 mm3 l 1 the phytoplankton assemblage was mainly dominated by diatoms such as aulacoseira granulata and actinocyclus normanii followed by dinoflagellates cryptophytes and chlorophytes during the warm season when the total biovolume was moderate to high 1 mm3 l 1 the assemblage was characterized by cyanobacteria 60 of total phytoplankton biovolume the most dominant species were the colonial microcystis aeruginosa and m protocystis and the filamentous dolichospermum uruguayensis and d circinale a complete list of cyanobacterial taxa is presented in the supplementary material table s1 3 2 fit and parameter estimates of the cpg model neither the multivariate 1 07 nor the univariate gelman rubin diagnostics 1 04 for all parameters indicated potential problems with convergence i e chains seemed to mix adequately as the gelman rubin diagnostic was 1 1 gelman et al 2014 the posterior predictive distribution of cyanobacterial biovolumes showed a good overall fit to the observed data fig 4 a fig s1 supplementary material posterior predictive checks showed that model predictions were within a few percentage points of the observed values for the three alert level thresholds although the model may be slightly underestimating the proportion of samples exceeding the lowest threshold 0 2 mm3 l 1 fig 4b comparison of prior and posterior distributions fig 5 showed that the data provided substantial information on the parameters of interest and that parameter estimates were not determined primarily by the prior distribution the parameter estimates associated with the covariates in our model surface temperature ϕ1 surface temperature2 ϕ2 conductivity ϕ3 and the interaction between surface temperature and conductivity ϕ4 showed a clear effect of all covariates on cyanobacterial biovolume fig 5 and point to the presence of nonlinear responses to temperature and conductivity the components of variance yielded by the model for biovolume indicated that temporal variation was substantially stronger than spatial variation supplementary material table s2 matching the patterns observed earlier for the environmental predictors fig 2 the cross validation showed that the model captured the main seasonal trends at the three study sites although the wide credible intervals point to substantial variability in the predicted values fig 6 with the exception of the mid summer nov dec samples there appears to be no systematic over or under estimation of mean biovolume across sites the coefficients of determination for observed and predicted values at the three sites were r2 0 37 for site 1 r2 0 34 for site 2 and r2 0 92 for site 3 n 8 observations at each site for all sites combined site means n 8 observations it was r2 0 87 3 3 predicting cyanobacterial exceedance probabilities and biovolume the joint structuring effects of water temperature and conductivity on cyanobacteria were visualized by constructing contour plots of the probability of exceeding the three biovolume threshold levels fig 7 as expected the exceedance probability declined as threshold levels increased fig 7 for the three tiers the model predicted the highest probability at a temperature of 22 2 c and at the lowest observed values for conductivity 0 1 ms cm 1 fig 7 overall exceedance probabilities decreased with rising conductivity and at the highest conductivity the temperature at which the maximum probability occurred was shifted upwards to 27 c fig 7 the nonlinearity in cyanobacterial responses to temperature and conductivity yielded a sharp increase in exceedance probabilities when conductivity falls below 0 5 ms cm 1 temperature effects such an increase from 20 to 25 c were most pronounced for the lowest threshold fig 8 at 20 c cyanobacterial biovolume will most likely not reach any threshold when conductivity is greater than 2 ms cm 1 whereas at 25 c even the highest tier has a substantial chance to be surpassed even at high conductivity fig 9 4 discussion we presented a novel cpg approach to modeling cyanobacterial biovolume within a bayesian probabilistic framework this approach provides a full accounting of uncertainty in predictions as it incorporates variation which originates from both sampling error and uncertainty in parameter values using two environmental variables which are readily measured in situ we were able to predict the probability of cyanobacterial biovolume exceeding three threshold values relevant to management the risk of exposure expressed in probabilities can be a useful tool for early warning systems particularly for coastal eutrophic environments that are susceptible to develop cyanohabs cyanohabs can occur within a very short period of time shifting rapidly from undetected levels to peak biomass values blooms our approach overcomes one of the problems inherent to statistical modeling of these organisms the presence of a large proportion of zeros in data sets franks 2018 for count data such as cell abundance hurdle models e g cha et al 2014 assume that zeros occur from one process and the positive values from another whereas zero inflated models assume that extra zeros come from a second process cusack et al 2015 however for continuous data such as biovolume this artificial categorization can impose an unwanted discontinuity in the data because in natural environments the same drivers often simultaneously influence absence zeros and presence nonzero biomass lecomte et al 2013a contrary to most models for habs which use cell abundance as the response variable e g cha et al 2014 cusack et al 2015 our approach is based on biovolume which is the best indicator of phytoplankton biomass chorus and cavalieri 2000 reynolds 2006 furthermore the use of biovolume instead of other biological indicators can change model outputs and improve predictions of lake ecological status moe et al 2016 we found clear nonlinear interactive effects of water temperature and conductivity on cyanobacterial biovolume growth of freshwater cyanobacteria is generally favored at higher temperatures with well defined thermal optima for growth at temperatures ranging between 20 and 30 c e g fig 5 3 in reynolds 2006 whereas high salinity tends to limit or inhibit cyanobacterial growth reynolds 2006 the importance of these drivers for cyanobacterial blooms in estuaries has been well documented temperature cha et al 2014 lehman et al 2008 robson and hamilton 2003 salinity hall et al 2013 robson and hamilton 2003 taş et al 2006 models of cyanobacterial biomass have included interactions between environmental predictors e g between temperature and nutrients in lentic water bodies taranu et al 2012 but we found no previous examples of models including an interaction between temperature and conductivity we suggest that inclusion of this interaction may lead to improvements in models for cyanohabs in coastal environments our model predicts that the probability of crossing the three threshold levels is greatest at 22 2 c species from the genera microcystis and dolichospermum co occur at our study site and frequently bloom together in the region aguilera et al 2017 haakonsson et al 2017 o farrell et al 2012 and elsewhere li et al 2010 te and gin 2011 in lentic ecosystems mixed microcystis dolichospermum blooms are commonly observed between 25 and 30 c krienitz et al 2002 o farrell et al 2012 te and gin 2011 however in estuaries and coastal areas such as the baltic sea and san francisco bay cyanobacterial blooms are more frequent at temperatures nearer to 20 c lehman et al 2010 pliński et al 2007 a similar trend is found for coastal blooms in the río de la plata estuary 5 out of 7 coastal blooms were registered between 21 and 23 c haakonsson et al 2017 on the southern side of the estuary cyanobacteria above who guidance level 1 based on microcystis cells have been reported between 20 and 24 c giannuzzi et al 2012 supplementary material fig s2 these findings and our own results allow us to highlight the potential of our new model to detect changes in cyanobacterial biovolume in temperature ranges commonly found for cyanohabs in the studied region the two explanatory variables in our model temperature and conductivity measured in situ are normally recorded in basic monitoring programs and can be obtained in real time which potentially allows for instantaneous on site determination of exceedance probabilities this is a comparative advantage over models that require time consuming laboratory measurements of predictors such as nutrients our model can therefore be a useful tool for early warning of cyanohab events in monitoring programs in eutrophic coastal waters furthermore the conductivity values covered in the present study are in the salinity range of the

nitrogen may help control cyanobacterial growth boesch 2002 harke et al 2016 implementing an on site nutrient monitoring system with adequate instrumentation and spatio temporal coverage remains a challenging task in a large ecosystem such as the río de la plata estuary 5 conclusions the proposed cpg approach to modeling cyanobacterial biovolume successfully handled the high proportion of zeros
