13400,drinking water treatment under rural conditions often require compactness and portability to address this the present study developed a pilot scale helical tubular biological contact oxidation bco reactor filled with annular porous biofilm carriers fillers to determine the drinking water treatment efficiency and microbial characteristics the system was investigated for 212 days at 24 1 3 4 c under different flow rates 1 86 l h 1 3 72 l h 1 and 7 2 l h 1 to treat simulated rural drinking water the results show that 62 7 9 3 of ammonium nh4 n and 19 5 5 4 of uv254 absorbance were removed by the bco reactor after entering the stable operation period it is shown that shorter hydraulic retention time hrt weakened the removals of tryptophan like substances and fulvic acid according to the three dimension fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy with the removal ratios decreased from 90 to 0 when the hrt declined from 16 8 h to 4 2 h despite operating at regular room temperature 24 1 3 4 c the drinking water bco reactor underwent a long start up period 5 5 months to reach a steady state in terms of biofilm concentration and pollutant removal performance genus xanthobacter and methylobacterium might significantly contribute to the removal of nom in the bco reactor while genus pedomicrobium and bradyrhizobium were speculated to be responsible for nitrogen conversion the present study provides new insights into the application of bco reactors for ammonium and nom removal from rural drinking water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords tubing

health in rural areas the sustainable development goals in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development by the united nations include a target of progressively reducing inequalities related to water supply sanitation and hygiene and achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 28 even though there was an increase in the rural population using basic drinking water services between 2000 and 2017 with the availability percentage of drinking water treatment services to rural population from 69 to 81 this growth rate is not adequate to fulfil universal provision of safe drinking water 35 rural drinking water supplies face an increasing number of potential problems and challenges due to suboptimal water infrastructure operation maintenance and financial sustainability 6 24 34 39 although water purification facilities are already available in some rural areas a lack of technical support and professional basic knowledge creates a considerable barrier to operating these facilities effectively thus it is necessary to develop water purification equipment which is easier to operate manage and maintain for rural areas due to economical and efficient advantages biological contact oxidation bco processes have been widely used for treatment of wastewater containing non biodegradable organic matters 10 32 43 the bco process can also achieve good ammonium and organic pollutants removal efficiencies from source water and has been applied for pretreatment of drinking water 12 20 33 biodegradation within biofilm attached on the surface of fillers plays an important role in micro pollutants removal in bco reactors over prolonged operation 27 31 33 47 selection of filler is the core of bco reactor design which directly affects the biomass and microbial community composition in the reactor and in turn influences the removal efficiency of targeted pollutants 45 the bco process has strong adaptability to different water quality low cost and convenience thus it might be applied to decentralized water supply in rural areas however most bco reactors are pool like concrete structures at present featuring large land requirement and a lack of mobility 14 31 41 43 47 as a result these reactors are not ideal for small scale water distribution systems and drinking water treatment in rural areas given the increasing demand for compact water supply systems in those areas 18 it is necessary to develop a highly portable easily detachable small scale integrated bco reactor for rural drinking water treatment with the rapid development of the existing pipeline manufacturing industry it is of great practical significance to build a tubular pipeline type bco reactor by using portable cheap and easy to dismantle pipelines and pipe fittings for example unplasticized polyvinyl chloride upvc tubes have been increasingly used in municipal water supplies due to their rigidness durability and safety for transporting drinking water the price of upvc pipe 1 0mpa with a diameter of 40 to 300 mm is us 1 2 48 0 per meter it is anticipated that the bco reactor built with these upvc are well suited for the terrain conditions in rural areas while having a low space requirement for equipment installation it should be emphasized that in the field of point use decentralized water supply automatic chlorine disinfection 48 membrane systems 51 or electrochemical oxidation 18 should be applied to remove pathogens after bco reactor in this context the present study developed a novel pilot scale folded tubular biological contact oxidation bco reactor with parallel run upvc pipes connected with various fittings i e t joint inscribed elbows loose joint and valves and filled with annular porous biofilm carriers fillers with the total cost of us 117 6 the primary goal is to test the practicability of using the bco reactor to treat micro polluted source water presenting the characteristics that referred to ammonium and organic pollutants with concentration in the order of mg l 33 42 46 in a decentralized treatment system in a rural area the ammonium and organic pollutants removal efficiencies of the bco reactor were monitored for 212 days to investigate the performance of the bco reactor for treating simulated drinking water in order to optimize operating conditions effects of multiple hydraulic retention times hrt corresponding different flow rates 1 86 l h 1 3 72 l h 1 and 7 2 l h 1 on pollutants removal were studied the microbial communities and temporal dynamics of biomass on the fillers were also assessed to investigate the biodegradation mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup the biological contact oxidation bco reactor in this study was a pilot scale tubing reactor which was made of unplasticized polyvinyl chloride upvc tube the specific structure diagram of the novel detachable tubular bco reactor and the process flow chart are shown in fig 1 and fig 2 respectively the tubing reactor consisted of 20 upvc tubes with an inner diameter of 40 mm us 1 2 per meter which were connected by 32 elbows us 0 5 each 20 loose joints us 1 0 each and 3

fillers of which the ratio of the two types of fillers was 1 1 the total cost of the bco reactor was us 117 6 the length width and height of the bco reactor was 1 22 m 0 62 m and 0 82 m respectively so the effective volume occupied by the reactor was 0 62 m3 the flow rate of the bco reactor was controlled by a submersible pump lp 547 and a valve three hrts 16 8 h 8 4 h and 4 4 h were evaluated in different periods the corresponding flow rates were 1 86 l h 1 3 72 l h 1 7 2 l h 1 respectively 2 2 composition of synthetic feedwater and operational conditions the synthetic feedwater was to simulate the drinking water source in rural areas in this study including natural organic carbon nitrogen suspended particles and color synthetic feedwater was prepared using tap water in order to avoid the influence of residual chlorine in tap water on the reactor the tap water was left to stand for 24 h before using to simulate the water quality of micro polluted source water humic acid macklin h811077 china http www macklin cn products h811077 was used to adjust the chemical demand of the synthetic feedwater with the values of permanganate index codmn uv254 absorbance and toc in influent were adjusted respectively to 3 0 6 0 mg l 1 0 100 0 250 au cm 1 and 2 22 5 71 mg l 1 ammonium concentrations in the synthetic feedwater were adjusted to 1 00 2 50 mg l 1 by addition of ammonium chloride nh4cl sodium acetate ch3coona was added to the synthetic feedwater in order to adjust influent biodegradability during the operation of the bco reactor the measured influent dissolved oxygen do concentrations turbidity ph and water temperature were 5 7 2 0 mg l 1 9 3 ntu 7 49 0 22 and 24 1 3 4 c respectively supplementary information fig s1 to s4 the bco reactor was monitored for 212 days from november 2 2018 to june 1 2019 operational periods for which the reactor was continuously implemented were composed of six stages from day 1 to day 212 denoted as periods a

biofilm in bco reactor during period b to f the ratio of sodium acetate and humic acid was set to 1 5 to simulate the water quality of micro polluted source water in order to investigate the effect of hrt on pollutants removal the hrts in period d e and f were set to 16 8 h 8 4 h and 4 2 h respectively 2 3 sampling water samples were collected approximately once every 2 days n 60 from influent and effluent of the bco reactor during the 212 day operational time for water quality analysis the influent water sample were taken from the feed tank while the effluent water samples were taken from the outflow pipes the influent sample for eems analysis was taken on period d day 163 and the effluent samples were collected on period d day 163 hrt 16 8 h period e day 180 hrt 8 4 h and period f day 212 hrt 4 2 h respectively the annular porous filler samples of the bco reactor were collected respectively from 0 5 m a01 10 m a02 and 20 m a03 behind the entrance of the bco reactor using 50 ml sterile polypropylene centrifuge tubes on period c day 63 period e day 180 and period f day 212 the mixture of annular porous filler samples a01 a02 and a03 on period c day 63 were obtained for microbial

analysis the water samples were used to test the nh4 n codmn uv254 absorbance three dimension excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy eem do concentration turbidity ph temperature nitrate no3 n and nitrite no2 n nh4 n was determined by nessler s reagent colorimetric method after filtration using a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane codmn was analyzed using acid potassium permanganate method according to the state environmental protection administration of china ministry of environmental protection of the people s republic of 5 5 uv254 absorbance was determined by a uv visible spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 254 nm t6 new century beijing china eem measurements were collected using excitation wavelengths from 220 to 400 nm in 5 nm increment and the emission wavelengths from 280 to 550 nm using a fluorescence spectrophotometer fs5 edinburgh uk at ambient temperature the integration time was 1 0 s the scan slit was 4 0 nm and the scanning speed excitation emission was 80 nm s the results of eem were processed with inner filter correction and rayleigh scattering elimination the quinine sulfate nation of slit half validation function the position of fluorescence maxima obtained by parallel factor anlaysis were located at λex λem 220 375 nm peak b and λex λem 220 430 nm peak f respectively these peaks identified from the profile of eem spectra are named as tryptophan like peak and fulvic acid like peak respectively the quantitative analysis of eem was conducted by the ratio of the fluorescence intensity in effluent fi to the fluorescence intensity in influent fi0 i e fi fi0 no3 n and no2 n were detected using uv spectrophotometry and diazo coupling spectrophotometry respectively the formula of nh4 n uv254 absorbance and codmn removal amount is s0 st the formula of pollutants removal ratio percentage is s0 st s0 the formula of pollutants removal rate is s0 st t in these formulas s0 represents the initial concentration of nh4 n codmn or uv254 absorbance t represents hrt and st represents the concentration of nh4 n codmn or uv254 absorbance at the set hrt the nitrification ratios were calculated using total amount of no3 n and no2 n produced divided by the amount of removed nh4 n 3 results and discussion 3 1 ammonium and organic pollutants removal performance 3 1 1 ammonium removal performance in the flow through bco reactor influent and effluent nh4 n concentration dynamics were monitored over time fig 3 illustrates the influent nh4 n concentrations and its removal ratios in the bco reactor during 212 days of operation during this period a very clear shift in the ammonium removal performance was observed in period a and b the nh4 n removal reached the lowest level which was of 6 0 4 0 and 4 5 2 8 respectively while 27 9 2 3 period a and 42 1 2 6 period b removed nh4 n was converted to no3 n 70 7 3 0 period a and 49 4 1 7 period b removed nh4 n was converted to no2 n supplementary information fig s5 these results showed that above 90 0 removed nh4 n were nitrified at the beginning of operation of the bco reactor after 40 days of operation the nh4 n removal increased gradually in period c and d the nh4 n removal rose to 27 6 12 5 and 51 5 3 8 with a high amplitude of fluctuation during these two periods 85 4 2 6 and 80 6 0 6 removed nh4 n were nitrified fig 3 and fig s5 then the nh4 n removal maintained at relatively stable stage during period e and f that a steady state in nh4 n removal with the values of 63 3 9 7 and 61 2 9 1 the nitrification ratios also maintained at the values of 81 3 3 8 fig 3 and fig s5 stable pollutants removal performance was speculated to be due to the formation of a stable bacterial community in the reactor the increment of ammonium removal performance became negligible starting from period e therefore it is speculated that stable biofilm formed on the filler surface after 165 days of operation at 24 1 3 4 c indicating that a long start up period for biofilm even in the condition of regular room temperature the biofilm biomass dynamics and microbial community were further discussed in section 3 2 and section 3 3 3 1 2 organic pollutants removal performance in the flow through bco reactor influent and effluent organic pollutants concentration dynamics were monitored over time in this study codmn rather than doc was chosen to indicate the service condition of the bco reactor since codmn was the surrogate parameter of organic matter in drinking water in the latest national standard gb5749 2006 of china the influent codmn concentrations and its removal of the bco reactor during 212 days of operation are presented in fig 4 in the operation time the codmn removal performance of the bco reactor reduced gradually which presented an opposite trend compared with ammonium removal this result might be due to resource utilization competition for growth niche between autotrophic nitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria which was defined as selection 19 29 the organic carbon composition ratio in the influent was adjusted in different periods acetate as easily degradable organic carbon by heterotrophic bacteria was added in the influent with high ratio of ch3coona and humic acid 9 1 in period a but with low ratio of ch3coona and humic acid 1 5 in period b f heterotrophic bacteria would grow rapidly and occupy the new niche on surface of the fillers while autotrophic bacteria grew slowly at the beginning of operation of the reactor period a thus the highest codmn removal in this study occurred in period a with more acetate in influent reaching at 26 9 3 9 coinciding with the lowest ammonium removal in period b to f the biodegradability of organic carbon sources became much poorer the growth and metabolism of heterotrophic bacteria would slow down that is inhibited resulting in a decrease in the codmn removal performance of the bco reactor instead during these periods autotrophic bacteria nitrifying bacteria would continue to grow and gradually occupy a dominant position and exert their advantages which led to a gradual increase in ammonium removal performance of the bco reactor the competition between heterotrophic bacteria and autotrophic bacteria was actually competition for growth niche the resource carbon source composition will change the dominance of different kinds of bacteria in the same microbial communities and shape community dynamics acetate as easily degradable organic carbon promoted the growth of heterotrophic bacteria in period a and however inhibited autotrophic nitrification from period b to f the large proportion of hardly degradable organic carbon humic acid in influent limited the growth of heterotrophic bacteria thus promoted autotrophic nitrification in addition there was positive significant correlation between the effluent cod mn concentrations and influent cod mn concentrations r2 0 808 supplementary material fig s6 a but not significant correlation between cod mn removal ratios and influent cod mn concentrations r2 0 246 supplementary material fig s6 b the results indicated that the cod mn removal ratios were not affected by the initial cod mn concentrations uv254 absorbance can be used to represent organic compounds with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 8 11 in this study the uv254 value in influent mainly derived from the humic acid added into the influent which represented natural organic matter nom the influent uv254 absorbance and its removal of the bco reactor during 212 days of operation are shown in fig 4 consistent with the trend of codmn removal uv254 absorbance removal decreased with operation time in period a uv254 absorbance removal reached 40 7 6 7 which was the highest in all periods subsequently uv254 absorbance removal fell respectively to 30 9 6 4 23 6 10 1 21 1 1 8 20 2 5 9 and 17 5 3 7 in period b c d e and f which nevertheless were higher than the previous study with average value of 16 by a biofilter process 38 the nom removal during the start up period is comparable with that found in the conventional treatment process that typically consists of flocculation filtration and disinfection 25 this suggests that acetate an easily degradable organic carbon could promote the removal of nom it might be attributed to co metabolism mechanism of carbon source 1 13 23 3 1 3 effects of hrt on pollutants removal effects of hrt on ammomium codmn uv254 absorbance removal performance and composition of organic pollutants by the bco reactor were investigated during period d e and f hrt 16 8 h 8 4 h and 4 2 h in these three periods the effluent dissolved oxygen do concentrations were greater than 2 mg l see supplementary information fig s1 indicating that the bco reactor was in an aerobic state even if the hrt was as long as 16 8 h in terms of ammonium removal performance the influence of hrt on ammonium removal ratio was not qualitatively apparent 51 5 3 8 63 3 9 7 and 61 2 9 1 in period d e and f however the ammonium removal rates were 0 04 0 01 mg l 1 h 1 0 13 0 02 mg l 1 h 1 and 0 22 0 11 mg l 1 h 1 in period d e and f respectively the result indicated that the ammonium removal rates increased with the decrease of the hrt the reason of this behavior might be that the stable and benign biofilm formed from period e which was the same speculation as that in the section 3 1 1 ammonium removal performance the stable mature biofilm in the bco reactor could perform high pollutants removal and strong anti shock loading capability therefore the ammonium removal rates increased even with the decrease of the hrt codmn removal were approximately 10 when hrt was 16 8 h and 8 4 h and decreased slightly to 6 7 1 1 when hrt decreased to 4 2 h uv254 absorbance removal had the same pattern with codmn with the uv254 absorbance removal ratios of 21 1 1 8 20 2 5 9 and 17 5 3 7 when hrt was 16 8 h 8 4 h and 4 2 h respectively similar to the effect of hrt on the ammonium removal rates the codmn and uv254 absorbance removal rates increased with the decrease of the hrt these results indicated that the bco reactor had strong anti shock loading capability from period d suggesting that mature biofilm in the reactor had formed the hrt could be appropriately reduced after the formation of steady biofilm in the bco reactor to increase water production in this study three dimension fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy was applied to indicate the change of organic pollutants composition of the bco reactor fig 5 illustrates the three dimension fluorescence eem spectroscopy of influent and effluent of the bco reactor in different hrt in terms of spectrum characteristic the fluorescence spectrum of the effluent at hrt 16 8 h is visibly different from that of the influent but the spectra of the remaining two hrts 8 4 h and 4 2 h are similar to the influent there are 14 distinct fluorescence peaks in the three dimensional fluorescence eem spectrum of the influent fig 5 a a m the fluorescence peaks a and b were located in the fluorescence region ii and the centers of the fluorescence peaks were respectively located in λex λem 225 365 nm and λex λem 220 375 nm which belong to the fluorescence peak of the tryptophan like substances 4 the other 12 fluorescence peaks c m were located in the fluorescence region iii which belonged to the fluorescence peak of the fulvic acid in ultraviolet region 2 4 36 in influent the position of fluorescence maxima was located at the peak b 1 16 107 the second largest peak was located at peak f 7 37 106 fig 5 a the fluorescence intensity fi indicated that the tryptophan like substance and fulvic acid like substance were the main components of the dissolved organic matters in the influent water of the bco reactor when hrt was set to 16 8 h in period d fig 5 b the fi fi0 of peak b and peak f was respectively 0 06 and 0 07 indicating most tryptophan like 94 and fulvic acid like substance 93 had been removed when hrt was set to 8 4 h in period e fig 5 c the fi fi0 of peak b and peak f was respectively 0 80 and 0 77 respectively i e 20 tryptophan like substance and 23 fulvic acid like substance were removed when hrt was set to 4 2 h in period f fig 5 d the fi of peak a g and k decreased but the fi fi0 of peak b and peak f was about 1 0 indicating that the main dissolved organic matters in the influent water were not removed in a short hrt the results above suggested that the dissolved organic matters removals by the bco reactor declined with the decrease of hrt tryptophan like substances belong to aromatic protein and fulvic acid is also a kind of hardly degradable organic carbon source 16 the results above indicated that tryptophan like substances and fulvic acid could only be removed effectively by the bco reactor at a higher hrt more than 8 4 h it might be the reason that the main components of the dissolved organic matter in the influent water of the bco reactor had poor biodegradability 3 2 dynamics of the biofilm biomass in the flow through bco reactor the biofilm biomass dynamics was monitored over time fig 6 illustrates the biomass on the annular porous fillers from 0 5 m a01 10 m a02 and 20 m a03 behind the entrance of the bco reactor in different periods the biofilm biomass in the bco reactor increased with the extension of operation time on the first day of the operation the initial biomass in the bco reactor were close to zero because the reactor was not inoculated with bacteria on the operation day of 63 period c the values of biomass of a01 a02 and a03 only had a slight increase of 38 3 29 2 and 24 2 cell cm 2 respectively compared with the values in period c the biomass on the operation day of 180 period e rose to approximately 4 104 cell cm 2 with an increase of at least three orders of magnitude which had the same pattern as the increasing trend of ammonium removal performance on the operation day of 212 period f the biomass in the bco reactor increased to around 106 cell cm 2 comparing the biomass of filler samples at a01 a02 and a03 positions in the bco reactor on the same day it was found that the biomass presented a decline but still fell in the same order of magnitude in the direction of water flow the reason for this result may be that nutrients for growth of microbes were gradually reduced in the direction of water flow in other words the nutrient concentration of the intake of the bco reactor was the highest along the flow of the water the nutrients were gradually consumed leaving a lower substrate concentration for the microbes close to the exit the growth trend of biomass was consistent with that of nh4 n removal but contrary to the trend of organic pollutants removal the results indicated that the higher biomass concentration in the bco reactor promoted the nh4 n removal performance but did not contribute to the removal of organic pollutants this may be because the increase amount of biomass was mainly autotrophic nitrifying bacteria the biomass dynamics results above showed that the biomass of the samples taken at day 180 and 212 differed by two orders of magnitude and the ammonium removal percentages 63 3 9 7 and 61 2 9 1 did not visibly change between the two dates however the ammonium removal rates increased from 0 13 0 02 mg l 1 h 1 to 0 22 0 11 mg l 1 h 1 from day 180 period e hrt 8 4 h to day 212 period f hrt 4 2 h suggesting that increase in biomass could enhance the ammonium removal rates removal amount per unit time although the biomass increased by two orders of magnitude and the ammonium removal rate was enhanced by two times the decrease in hrt by 4 2 h would limit the apparent ammonium removal percentages therefore the apparent ammonium removal percentages in period e and f did not visibly change even with the increase in biomass in addition the apparent physical characteristics on the surface of fillers is shown on fig 7 the sem photographs indicated that a benign biofilm was formed on the surface of the fillers in which rod shaped bacteria was the dominant bacteria fig 7 b particle precipitates were observed on the surface of the fillers fig 7 a due to the solid interception effect of the fillers leading to a turbidity removal of 57 2 10 5 see supplementary information fig s2 these surface precipitates provide a rough surface for the growth of microorganisms 3 3 microbial community microbial diversity of the bco reactor was investigated during operation time fig 8 shows the abundances of various genus species in the biofilm of the bco reactor on the operation day of 63 period c there were mainly 4 phyla detected in the biofilm of the bco reactor phylum proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in the bco reactor accounting for 90 5 of the total effective bacterial sequences this was followed by phylum planctomycetes 3 5 the proportions of phylum armatimonadetes and phylum actinobacteria were 2 7 and 2 2 respectively the finding is consistent with those of previous studies that found that phylum proteobacteria played a dominant role in biofilm in drinking water treatment 21 44 the analysis on the genus level could better explain the community structure of biofilm from the perspective of bacterial function at the level of genus xanthobacter methylobacterium pedomicrobium and bradyrhizobium accounted for 63 8 11 3 4 1 and 1 0 respectively it was confirmed that xanthobacter played a significant role in aromatic compounds removal in previous studies 15 22 37 yu et al found that genus methylobacterium enriched with the present of fulvic acid 40 thus genus xanthobacter and methylobacterium might make significant contribution to the removal of organic pollutants in this study in addition pedomicrobium sp could utilize ammonia salt as n source and conducted nitrate reduction to nitrite 7 17 it reported that pedomicrobium would not affect nitrification despite significant hco3 uptake 9 bradyrhizobium affiliating to nitrous oxide reductase nosz was a key group of denitrifiers 3 26 hence nitrogen conversion in the bco reactor in this study was speculated to be attributed to genus pedomicrobium and bradyrhizobium in comparison with genera that can degrade fulvic acid and aromatic substances the abundance of genus genera capable of nitrogen conversion was much lower which could explain the phenomenon of relatively high organic pollutants removal and poor nh4 n removal before day 63 period c 3 4 practical implications the findings of this study demonstrated that the novel pilot scale tubing bco reactor obtained significant ammonium and organic pollutants removal performance for simulated rural source water with the final effluent concentrations of codmn 2 5 0 2 mg l 1 nh4 n 0 5 0 1 mg l 1 no3 n 2 5 0 3 mg l 1 and no2 n 0 08 0 05 mg l 1 in period f which almost reached the final target values for water quality standard for drinking water of national standard of the people s republic of china the pollutants removal performance was attributed to the biofilm on the fillers in the tubing bco reactor fig 9 bco reactors are commonly used for removal of micro pollutants from drinking water and wastewater 10 20 31 33 43 however at present bco reactors feature pool like structures and large footprints 14 31 33 41 43 47 which are not suitable for small scale distributed water supply systems comparing with the pool like bco reactors the novel tubing bco reactor developed in this study offers significant advantages in terms of portability detachability maintainability land requirement and pollutants removal performance moreover the construction cost of the novel tubing bco reactor is much lower us 117 6 for the pilot scale reactor in the rural areas where mountain spring water is used as the water source the gravity potential energy of the water can be directly exploited to replace the use of the water pump and create operating cost savings therefore the novel pilot scale tubing bco reactor has the potential to provide cost effective water treatment in rural areas for practical applications our further studies will focus on evaluating a range of fillers for accelerated biofilm formation and reduced reactor start up time the reactor will be operated for a longer time under different conditions e g temperature pollutant concentrations and coupling with other treatment treating natural real rural drinking water source in further study except for ammonia and harmful organic matter undesirable pathogenic is still a main concern for potable use and microbiologically impacted water should be paid more attention thus disinfectants usually need to be added to treated water to prevent further microbial contamination over a prolonged duration 50 for example semi automatic chlorine disinfection enabled to produce potable water 48 and also membrane systems are attractive since they provide an absolute barrier for pathogens and exhibited good prospects for decentralized water supply 51 additionally electrochemical oxidation has the merits of no chemical dosage easily trained

investigated after bco reactor in our future work 4 conclusion nh4 n and uv254 absorbance removal performance in the bco reactor reached a steady state after 165 days of operation at 24 1 3 4 c with the values of 62 7 9 3 and 19 5 5 4 and were not significantly affected by the reduction of hrt in terms of nom removal tryptophan like substances and fulvic acid could be removed by the bco reactor only at a higher hrt more than 8 4 h with the removal ratios of approximately 94 20 and 0 respectively when hrt was set to 16 8 h 8 4 h and 4 2 h even at a regular room temperature an extended start up time was needed to achieve biofilm maturation and stable pollutant removal which warrants further research to identify optimal conditions and fillers for biofilm growth genus xanthobacter and

13400,drinking water treatment under rural conditions often require compactness and portability to address this the present study developed a pilot scale helical tubular biological contact oxidation bco reactor filled with annular porous biofilm carriers fillers to determine the drinking water treatment efficiency and microbial characteristics the system was investigated for 212 days at 24 1 3 4 c under different flow rates 1 86 l h 1 3 72 l h 1 and 7 2 l h 1 to treat simulated rural drinking water the results show that 62 7 9 3 of ammonium nh4 n and 19 5 5 4 of uv254 absorbance were removed by the bco reactor after entering the stable operation period it is shown that shorter hydraulic retention time hrt weakened the removals of tryptophan like substances and fulvic acid according to the three dimension fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy with the removal ratios decreased from 90 to 0 when the hrt declined from 16 8 h to 4 2 h despite operating at regular room temperature 24 1 3 4 c the drinking water bco reactor underwent a long start up period 5 5 months to reach a steady state in terms of biofilm concentration and pollutant removal performance genus xanthobacter and methylobacterium might significantly contribute to the removal of nom in the bco reactor while genus pedomicrobium and bradyrhizobium were speculated to be responsible for nitrogen conversion the present study provides new insights into the application of bco reactors for ammonium and nom removal from rural drinking water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords tubing biological contact oxidation reactor rural drinking water natural organic matter nom ammonium microbial community 1 introduction improving access to clean and safe drinking water benefits the public health in rural areas the sustainable development goals in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development by the united nations include a target of progressively reducing inequalities related to water supply sanitation and hygiene and achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 28 even though there was an increase in the rural population using basic drinking water services between 2000 and 2017 with the availability percentage of drinking water treatment services to rural population from 69 to 81 this growth rate is not adequate to fulfil universal provision of safe drinking water 35 rural drinking water supplies face an increasing number of potential problems and challenges due to suboptimal water infrastructure operation maintenance and financial sustainability 6 24 34 39 although water purification facilities are already available in some rural areas a lack of technical support and professional basic knowledge creates a considerable barrier to operating these facilities effectively thus it is necessary to develop water purification equipment which is easier to operate manage and maintain for rural areas due to economical and efficient advantages biological contact oxidation bco processes have been widely used for treatment of wastewater containing non biodegradable organic matters 10 32 43 the bco process can also achieve good ammonium and organic pollutants removal efficiencies from source water and has been applied for pretreatment of drinking water 12 20 33 biodegradation within biofilm attached on the surface of fillers plays an important role in micro pollutants removal in bco reactors over prolonged operation 27 31 33 47 selection of filler is the core of bco reactor design which directly affects the biomass and microbial community composition in the reactor and in turn influences the removal efficiency of targeted pollutants 45 the bco process has strong adaptability to different water quality low cost and convenience thus it might be applied to decentralized water supply in rural areas however most bco reactors are pool like concrete structures at present featuring large land requirement and a lack of mobility 14 31 41 43 47 as a result these reactors are not ideal for small scale water distribution systems and drinking water treatment in rural areas given the increasing demand for compact water supply systems in those areas 18 it is necessary to develop a highly portable easily detachable small scale integrated bco reactor for rural drinking water treatment with the rapid development of the existing pipeline manufacturing industry it is of great practical significance to build a tubular pipeline type bco reactor by using portable cheap and easy to dismantle pipelines and pipe fittings for example unplasticized polyvinyl chloride upvc tubes have been increasingly used in municipal water supplies due to their rigidness durability and safety for transporting drinking water the price of upvc pipe 1 0mpa with a diameter of 40 to 300 mm is us 1 2 48 0 per meter it is anticipated that the bco reactor built with these upvc are well suited for the terrain conditions in rural areas while having a low space requirement for equipment installation it should be emphasized that in the field of point use decentralized water supply automatic chlorine disinfection 48 membrane systems 51 or electrochemical oxidation 18 should be applied to remove pathogens after bco reactor in this context the present study developed a novel pilot scale folded tubular biological contact oxidation bco reactor with parallel run upvc pipes connected with various fittings i e t joint inscribed elbows loose joint and valves and filled with annular porous biofilm carriers fillers with the total cost of us 117 6 the primary goal is to test the practicability of using the bco reactor to treat micro polluted source water presenting the characteristics that referred to ammonium and organic pollutants with concentration in the order of mg l 33 42 46 in a decentralized treatment system in a rural area the ammonium and organic pollutants removal efficiencies of the bco reactor were monitored for 212 days to investigate the performance of the bco reactor for treating simulated drinking water in order to optimize operating conditions effects of multiple hydraulic retention times hrt corresponding different flow rates 1 86 l h 1 3 72 l h 1 and 7 2 l h 1 on pollutants removal were studied the microbial communities and temporal dynamics of biomass on the fillers were also assessed to investigate the biodegradation mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup the biological contact oxidation bco reactor in this study was a pilot scale tubing reactor which was made of unplasticized polyvinyl chloride upvc tube the specific structure diagram of the novel detachable tubular bco reactor and the process flow chart are shown in fig 1 and fig 2 respectively the tubing reactor consisted of 20 upvc tubes with an inner diameter of 40 mm us 1 2 per meter which were connected by 32 elbows us 0 5 each 20 loose joints us 1 0 each and 3 valves us 1 2 each the effective length and volume of the reactor were 25 m and 31 4 10 3 m3 respectively the bco reactor was filled evenly with annular porous fillers of different sizes us 1 6 per kg the specific surface area of the two fillers were 800 m2 m 3 and 1000 m2 m 3 respectively and with 0 96 g cm 3 in specific gravity the reactor was filled with a total of 30 kg of the two types of fillers of which the ratio of the two types of fillers was 1 1 the total cost of the bco reactor was us 117 6 the length width and height of the bco reactor was 1 22 m 0 62 m and 0 82 m respectively so the effective volume occupied by the reactor was 0 62 m3 the flow rate of the bco reactor was controlled by a submersible pump lp 547 and a valve three hrts 16 8 h 8 4 h and 4 4 h were evaluated in different periods the corresponding flow rates were 1 86 l h 1 3 72 l h 1 7 2 l h 1 respectively 2 2 composition of synthetic feedwater and operational conditions the synthetic feedwater was to simulate the drinking water source in rural areas in this study including natural organic carbon nitrogen suspended particles and color synthetic feedwater was prepared using tap water in order to avoid the influence of residual chlorine in tap water on the reactor the tap water was left to stand for 24 h before using to simulate the water quality of micro polluted source water humic acid macklin h811077 china http www macklin cn products h811077 was used to adjust the chemical demand of the synthetic feedwater with the values of permanganate index codmn uv254 absorbance and toc in influent were adjusted respectively to 3 0 6 0 mg l 1 0 100 0 250 au cm 1 and 2 22 5 71 mg l 1 ammonium concentrations in the synthetic feedwater were adjusted to 1 00 2 50 mg l 1 by addition of ammonium chloride nh4cl sodium acetate ch3coona was added to the synthetic feedwater in order to adjust influent biodegradability during the operation of the bco reactor the measured influent dissolved oxygen do concentrations turbidity ph and water temperature were 5 7 2 0 mg l 1 9 3 ntu 7 49 0 22 and 24 1 3 4 c respectively supplementary information fig s1 to s4 the bco reactor was monitored for 212 days from november 2 2018 to june 1 2019 operational periods for which the reactor was continuously implemented were composed of six stages from day 1 to day 212 denoted as periods a f the details of experimental setup are displayed in table 1 in period a as the start up period the ratio of the addition amounts of ch3coona and humic acid was set to 9 1 to promote formation of biofilm in bco reactor during period b to f the ratio of sodium acetate and humic acid was set to 1 5 to simulate the water quality of micro polluted source water in order to investigate the effect of hrt on pollutants removal the hrts in period d e and f were set to 16 8 h 8 4 h and 4 2 h respectively 2 3 sampling water samples were collected approximately once every 2 days n 60 from influent and effluent of the bco reactor during the 212 day operational time for water quality analysis the influent water sample were taken from the feed tank while the effluent water samples were taken from the outflow pipes the influent sample for eems analysis was taken on period d day 163 and the effluent samples were collected on period d day 163 hrt 16 8 h period e day 180 hrt 8 4 h and period f day 212 hrt 4 2 h respectively the annular porous filler samples of the bco reactor were collected respectively from 0 5 m a01 10 m a02 and 20 m a03 behind the entrance of the bco reactor using 50 ml sterile polypropylene centrifuge tubes on period c day 63 period e day 180 and period f day 212 the mixture of annular porous filler samples a01 a02 and a03 on period c day 63 were obtained for microbial diversity analysis other annular porous fillers obtained from different periods were subjected to biomass quantification and scanning electron microscope sem su8220 hitach japan observation 2 4

control otus clustering was performed with uparse version 7 1 http drive5 com uparse with an identity cutoff of 97 the chimeric sequences were identified and removed using uchime 2 6 water quality analysis the water samples were used to test the nh4 n codmn uv254 absorbance three dimension excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy eem do concentration turbidity ph temperature nitrate no3 n and nitrite no2 n nh4 n was determined by nessler s reagent colorimetric method after filtration using a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane codmn was analyzed using acid potassium permanganate method according to the state environmental protection administration of china ministry of environmental protection of the people s republic of 5 5 uv254 absorbance was determined by a uv visible spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 254 nm t6 new century beijing china eem measurements were collected using excitation wavelengths from 220 to 400 nm in 5 nm increment and the emission wavelengths from 280 to 550 nm using a fluorescence spectrophotometer fs5 edinburgh uk at ambient temperature the integration time was 1 0 s the scan slit was 4 0 nm and the scanning speed excitation emission was 80 nm s the results of eem were processed with inner filter correction and rayleigh scattering elimination the quinine sulfate nation of slit half validation function the position of fluorescence maxima obtained by parallel factor anlaysis were located at λex λem 220 375 nm peak b and λex λem 220 430 nm peak f respectively these peaks identified from the profile of eem spectra are named as tryptophan like peak and fulvic acid like peak respectively the quantitative analysis of eem was conducted by the ratio of the fluorescence intensity in effluent fi to the fluorescence intensity in influent fi0 i e fi fi0 no3 n and no2 n were detected using uv spectrophotometry and diazo coupling spectrophotometry respectively the formula of nh4 n uv254 absorbance and codmn removal amount is s0 st the formula of pollutants removal ratio percentage is s0 st s0 the formula of pollutants removal rate is s0 st t in these formulas s0 represents the initial concentration of nh4 n codmn or uv254 absorbance t represents hrt and st represents the concentration of nh4 n codmn or uv254 absorbance at the set hrt the nitrification ratios were calculated using total amount of no3 n and no2 n produced divided by the amount of removed nh4 n 3 results and discussion 3 1 ammonium and organic pollutants removal performance 3 1 1 ammonium removal performance in the flow through bco reactor influent and effluent nh4 n concentration dynamics were monitored over time fig 3 illustrates the influent nh4 n concentrations and its removal ratios in the bco reactor during 212 days of operation during this period a very clear shift in the ammonium removal performance was observed in period a and b the nh4 n removal reached the lowest level which was of 6 0 4 0 and 4 5 2 8 respectively while 27 9 2 3 period a and 42 1 2 6 period b removed nh4 n was converted to no3 n 70 7 3 0 period a and 49 4 1 7 period b removed nh4 n was converted to no2 n supplementary information fig s5 these results showed that above 90 0 removed nh4 n were nitrified at the beginning of operation of the bco reactor after 40 days of operation the nh4 n removal increased gradually in period c and d the nh4 n removal rose to 27 6 12 5 and 51 5 3 8 with a high amplitude of fluctuation during these two periods 85 4 2 6 and 80 6 0 6 removed nh4 n were nitrified fig 3 and fig s5 then the nh4 n removal maintained at relatively stable stage during period e and f that a steady state in nh4 n removal with the values of 63 3 9 7 and 61 2 9 1 the nitrification ratios also maintained at the values of 81 3 3 8 fig 3 and fig s5 stable pollutants removal performance was speculated to be due to the formation of a stable bacterial community in the reactor the increment of ammonium removal performance became negligible starting from period e therefore it is speculated that stable biofilm formed on the filler surface after 165 days of operation at 24 1 3 4 c indicating that a long start up period for biofilm even in the condition of regular room temperature the biofilm biomass dynamics and microbial community were further discussed in section 3 2 and section 3 3 3 1 2 organic pollutants removal performance in the flow through bco reactor influent and effluent organic pollutants concentration dynamics were monitored over time in this study codmn rather than doc was chosen to indicate the service condition of the bco reactor since codmn was the surrogate parameter of organic matter in drinking water in the latest national standard gb5749 2006 of china the influent codmn concentrations and its removal of the bco reactor during 212 days of operation are presented in fig 4 in the operation time the codmn removal performance of the bco reactor reduced gradually which presented an opposite trend compared with ammonium removal this result might be due to resource utilization competition for growth niche between autotrophic nitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria which was defined as selection 19 29 the organic carbon composition ratio in the influent was adjusted in different periods acetate as easily degradable organic carbon by heterotrophic bacteria was added in the influent with high ratio of ch3coona and humic acid 9 1 in period a but with low ratio of ch3coona and humic acid 1 5 in period b f heterotrophic bacteria would grow rapidly and occupy the new niche on surface of the fillers while autotrophic bacteria grew slowly at the beginning of operation of the reactor period a thus the highest codmn removal in this study occurred in period a with more acetate in influent reaching at 26 9 3 9 coinciding with the lowest ammonium removal in period b to f the biodegradability of organic carbon sources became much poorer the growth and metabolism of heterotrophic bacteria would slow down that is inhibited resulting in a decrease in the codmn removal performance of the bco reactor instead during these periods autotrophic bacteria nitrifying bacteria would continue to grow and gradually occupy a dominant position and exert their advantages which led to a gradual increase in ammonium removal performance of the bco reactor the competition between heterotrophic bacteria and autotrophic bacteria was actually competition for growth niche the resource carbon source composition will change the dominance of different kinds of bacteria in the same microbial communities and shape community dynamics acetate as easily degradable organic carbon promoted the growth of heterotrophic bacteria in period a and however inhibited autotrophic nitrification from period b to f the large proportion of hardly degradable organic carbon humic acid in influent limited the growth of heterotrophic bacteria thus promoted autotrophic nitrification in addition there was positive significant correlation between the effluent cod mn concentrations and influent cod mn concentrations r2 0 808 supplementary material fig s6 a but not significant correlation between cod mn removal ratios and influent cod mn concentrations r2 0 246 supplementary material fig s6 b the results indicated that the cod mn removal ratios were not affected by the initial cod mn concentrations uv254 absorbance can be used to represent organic compounds with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 8 11 in this study the uv254 value in influent mainly derived from the humic acid added into the influent which represented natural organic matter nom the influent uv254 absorbance and its removal of the bco reactor during 212 days of operation are shown in fig 4 consistent with the trend of codmn removal uv254 absorbance removal decreased with operation time in period a uv254 absorbance removal reached 40 7 6 7 which was the highest in all periods subsequently uv254 absorbance removal fell respectively to 30 9 6 4 23 6 10 1 21 1 1 8 20 2 5 9 and 17 5 3 7 in period b c d e and f which nevertheless were higher than the previous study with average value of 16 by a biofilter process 38 the nom removal during the start up period is comparable with that found in the conventional treatment process that typically consists of flocculation filtration and disinfection 25 this suggests that acetate an easily degradable organic carbon could promote the removal of nom it might be attributed to co metabolism mechanism of carbon source 1 13 23 3 1 3 effects of hrt on pollutants removal effects of hrt on ammomium codmn uv254 absorbance removal performance and composition of organic pollutants by the bco reactor were investigated during period d e and f hrt 16 8 h 8 4 h and 4 2 h in these three periods the effluent dissolved oxygen do concentrations were greater than 2 mg l see supplementary information fig s1 indicating that the bco reactor was in an aerobic state even if the hrt was as long as 16 8 h in terms of ammonium removal performance the influence of hrt on ammonium removal ratio was not qualitatively apparent 51 5 3 8 63 3 9 7 and 61 2 9 1 in period d e and f however the ammonium removal rates were 0 04 0 01 mg l 1 h 1 0 13 0 02 mg l 1 h 1 and 0 22 0 11 mg l 1 h 1 in period d e and f respectively the result indicated that the ammonium removal rates increased with the decrease of the hrt the reason of this behavior might be that the stable and benign biofilm formed from period e which was the same speculation as that in the section 3 1 1 ammonium removal performance the stable mature biofilm in the bco reactor could perform high pollutants removal and strong anti shock loading capability therefore the ammonium removal rates increased even with the decrease of the hrt codmn removal were approximately 10 when hrt was 16 8 h and 8 4 h and decreased slightly to 6 7 1 1 when hrt decreased to 4 2 h uv254 absorbance removal had the same pattern with codmn with the uv254 absorbance removal ratios of 21 1 1 8 20 2 5 9 and 17 5 3 7 when hrt was 16 8 h 8 4 h and 4 2 h respectively similar to the effect of hrt on the ammonium removal rates the codmn and uv254 absorbance removal rates increased with the decrease of the hrt these results indicated that the bco reactor had strong anti shock loading capability from period d suggesting that mature biofilm in the reactor had formed the hrt could be appropriately reduced after the formation of steady biofilm in the bco reactor to increase water production in this study three dimension fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy was applied to indicate the change of organic pollutants composition of the bco reactor fig 5 illustrates the three dimension fluorescence eem spectroscopy of influent and effluent of the bco reactor in different hrt in terms of spectrum characteristic the fluorescence spectrum of the effluent at hrt 16 8 h is visibly different from that of the influent but the spectra of the remaining two hrts 8 4 h and 4 2 h are similar to the influent there are 14 distinct fluorescence peaks in the three dimensional fluorescence eem spectrum of the influent fig 5 a a m the fluorescence peaks a and b were located in the fluorescence region ii and the centers of the fluorescence peaks were respectively located in λex λem 225 365 nm and λex λem 220 375 nm which belong to the fluorescence peak of the tryptophan like substances 4 the other 12 fluorescence peaks c m were located in the fluorescence region iii which belonged to the fluorescence peak of the fulvic acid in ultraviolet region 2 4 36 in influent the position of fluorescence maxima was located at the peak b 1 16 107 the second largest peak was located at peak f 7 37 106 fig 5 a the fluorescence intensity fi indicated that the tryptophan like substance and fulvic acid like substance were the main components of the dissolved organic matters in the influent water of the bco reactor when hrt was set to 16 8 h in period d fig 5 b the fi fi0 of peak b and peak f was respectively 0 06 and 0 07 indicating most tryptophan like 94 and fulvic acid like substance 93 had been removed when hrt was set to 8 4 h in period e fig 5 c the fi fi0 of peak b and peak f was respectively 0 80 and 0 77 respectively i e 20 tryptophan like substance and 23 fulvic acid like substance were removed when hrt was set to 4 2 h in period f fig 5 d the fi of peak a g and k decreased but the fi fi0 of peak b and peak f was about 1 0 indicating that the main dissolved organic matters in the influent water were not removed in a short hrt the results above suggested that the dissolved organic matters removals by the bco reactor declined with the decrease of hrt tryptophan like substances belong to aromatic protein and fulvic acid is also a kind of hardly degradable organic carbon source 16 the results above indicated that tryptophan like substances and fulvic acid could only be removed effectively by the bco reactor at a higher hrt more than 8 4 h it might be the reason that the main components of the dissolved organic matter in the influent water of the bco reactor had poor biodegradability 3 2 dynamics of the biofilm biomass in the flow through bco reactor the biofilm biomass dynamics was monitored over time fig 6 illustrates the biomass on the annular porous fillers from 0 5 m a01 10 m a02 and 20 m a03 behind the entrance of the bco reactor in different periods the biofilm biomass in the bco reactor increased with the extension of operation time on the first day of the operation the initial biomass in the bco reactor were close to zero because the reactor was not inoculated with bacteria on the operation day of 63 period c the values of biomass of a01 a02 and a03 only had a slight increase of 38 3 29 2 and 24 2 cell cm 2 respectively compared with the values in period c the biomass on the operation day of 180 period e rose to approximately 4 104 cell cm 2 with an increase of at least three orders of magnitude which had the same pattern as the increasing trend of ammonium removal performance on the operation day of 212 period f the biomass in the bco reactor increased to around 106 cell cm 2 comparing the biomass of filler samples at a01 a02 and a03 positions in the bco reactor on the same day it was found that the biomass presented a decline but still fell in the same order of magnitude in the direction of water flow the reason for this result may be that nutrients for growth of microbes were gradually reduced in the direction of water flow in other words the nutrient concentration of the intake of the bco reactor was the highest along the flow of the water the nutrients were gradually consumed leaving a lower substrate concentration for the microbes close to the exit the growth trend of biomass was consistent with that of nh4 n removal but contrary to the trend of organic pollutants removal the results indicated that the higher biomass concentration in the bco reactor promoted the nh4 n removal performance but did not contribute to the removal of organic pollutants this may be because the increase amount of biomass was mainly autotrophic nitrifying bacteria the biomass dynamics results above showed that the biomass of the samples taken at day 180 and 212 differed by two orders of magnitude and the ammonium removal percentages 63 3 9 7 and 61 2 9 1 did not visibly change between the two dates however the ammonium removal rates increased from 0 13 0 02 mg l 1 h 1 to 0 22 0 11 mg l 1 h 1 from day 180 period e hrt 8 4 h to day 212 period f hrt 4 2 h suggesting that increase in biomass could enhance the ammonium removal rates removal amount per unit time although the biomass increased by two orders of magnitude and the ammonium removal rate was enhanced by two times the decrease in hrt by 4 2 h would limit the apparent ammonium removal percentages therefore the apparent ammonium removal percentages in period e and f did not visibly change even with the increase in biomass in addition the apparent physical characteristics on the surface of fillers is shown on fig 7 the sem photographs indicated that a benign biofilm was formed on the surface of the fillers in which rod shaped bacteria was the dominant bacteria fig 7 b particle precipitates were observed on the surface of the fillers fig 7 a due to the solid interception effect of the fillers leading to a turbidity removal of 57 2 10 5 see supplementary information fig s2 these surface precipitates provide a rough surface for the growth of microorganisms 3 3 microbial community microbial diversity of the bco reactor was investigated during operation time fig 8 shows the abundances of various genus species in the biofilm of the bco reactor on the operation day of 63 period c there were mainly 4 phyla detected in the biofilm of the bco reactor phylum proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in the bco reactor accounting for 90 5 of the total effective bacterial sequences this was followed by phylum planctomycetes 3 5 the proportions of phylum armatimonadetes and phylum actinobacteria were 2 7 and 2 2 respectively the finding is consistent with those of previous studies that found that phylum proteobacteria played a dominant role in biofilm in drinking water treatment 21 44 the analysis on the genus level could better explain the community structure of biofilm from the perspective of bacterial function at the level of genus xanthobacter methylobacterium pedomicrobium and bradyrhizobium accounted for 63 8 11 3 4 1 and 1 0 respectively it was confirmed that xanthobacter played a significant role in aromatic compounds removal in previous studies 15 22 37 yu et al found that genus methylobacterium enriched with the present of fulvic acid 40 thus genus xanthobacter and methylobacterium might make significant contribution to the removal of organic pollutants in this study in addition pedomicrobium sp could utilize ammonia salt as n source and conducted nitrate reduction to nitrite 7 17 it reported that pedomicrobium would not affect nitrification despite significant hco3 uptake 9 bradyrhizobium affiliating to nitrous oxide reductase nosz was a key group of denitrifiers 3 26 hence nitrogen conversion in the bco reactor in this study was speculated to be attributed to genus pedomicrobium and bradyrhizobium in comparison with genera that can degrade fulvic acid and aromatic substances the abundance of genus genera capable of nitrogen conversion was much lower which could explain the phenomenon of relatively high organic pollutants removal and poor nh4 n removal before day 63 period c 3 4 practical implications the findings of this study demonstrated that the novel pilot scale tubing bco reactor obtained significant ammonium and organic pollutants removal performance for simulated rural source water with the final effluent concentrations of codmn 2 5 0 2 mg l 1 nh4 n 0 5 0 1 mg l 1 no3 n 2 5 0 3 mg l 1 and no2 n 0 08 0 05 mg l 1 in period f which almost reached the final target values for water quality standard for drinking water of national standard of the people s republic of china the pollutants removal performance was attributed to the biofilm on the fillers in the tubing bco reactor fig 9 bco reactors are commonly used for removal of micro pollutants from drinking water and wastewater 10 20 31 33 43 however at present bco reactors feature pool like structures and large footprints 14 31 33 41 43 47 which are not suitable for small scale distributed water supply systems comparing with the pool like bco reactors the novel tubing bco reactor developed in this study offers significant advantages in terms of portability detachability maintainability land requirement and pollutants removal performance moreover the construction cost of the novel tubing bco reactor is much lower us 117 6 for the pilot scale reactor in the rural areas where mountain spring water is used as the water source the gravity potential energy of the water can be directly exploited to replace the use of the water pump and create operating cost savings therefore the novel pilot scale tubing bco reactor has the potential to provide cost effective water treatment in rural areas for practical applications our further studies will focus on evaluating a range of fillers for accelerated biofilm formation and reduced reactor start up time the reactor will be operated for a longer time under different conditions e g temperature pollutant concentrations and coupling with other treatment treating natural real rural drinking water source in further study except for ammonia and harmful organic matter undesirable pathogenic is still a main concern for potable use and microbiologically impacted water should be paid more attention thus disinfectants usually need to be added to treated water to prevent further microbial contamination over a prolonged duration 50 for example semi automatic chlorine disinfection enabled to produce potable water 48 and also membrane systems are attractive since they provide an absolute barrier for pathogens and exhibited good prospects for decentralized water supply 51 additionally electrochemical oxidation has the merits of no chemical dosage easily trained and maintenance and environmental friendly for point use decentralized water supply 18 and electrochemical method has the potential to be driven by solar energy 21 49 thus disinfection unit will be investigated after bco reactor in our future work 4 conclusion nh4 n and uv254 absorbance removal performance in the bco reactor reached a steady state after 165 days of operation at 24 1 3 4 c with the values of 62 7 9 3 and 19 5 5 4 and were not significantly affected by the reduction of hrt in terms of nom removal tryptophan like substances and fulvic acid could be removed by the bco reactor only at a higher hrt more than 8 4 h with the removal ratios of approximately 94 20 and 0 respectively when hrt was set to 16 8 h 8 4 h and 4 2 h even at a regular room temperature an extended start up time was needed to achieve biofilm maturation and stable pollutant removal which warrants further research to identify optimal conditions and fillers for biofilm growth genus xanthobacter and methylobacterium might make a significant contribution to the removal of organic pollutants in the bco reactor while genus pedomicrobium and bradyrhizobium were speculated to play a major role in nitrogen conversion the novel tubing bco reactor with low construction and operating cost offers significant advantages in terms of portability detachability maintainability land requirement and

13401,activated carbon with a large surface area was synthesized from bambusa vulgaris striata via two stage koh naoh mixture activation functional properties of the produced activated carbon were investigated optimum conditions in activated carbon production were obtained from an impregnation ratio of char to koh naoh mixture of 1 3 w w at 800 c with a surface area and total pore volume of 1108 m2 g and 0 634 cm3 g respectively the optimized activated carbon was employed in mercury ion hg2 adsorption through a continuous flow experiment at 25 c its large surface area and pristine mineral elements were responsible for a high adsorption capacity of 312 7 mg g the results showed the superior feasibility of bambusa vulgaris striata as a low cost and abundant biomass precursor for the production of highly porous activated carbon that can be employed for hg2 removal hence the produced activated carbon represents a promising adsorbent for the treatment of contaminated and polluted water as well as wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords activated carbon adsorption bambusa vulgaris striata mercury koh naoh mixture continuous flow 1 introduction environmental pollution triggered by envenomed heavy metal ions has become a global issue and a fundamental consideration of many stakeholders in recent decades mercury ii or hg2 is a significant threat to humans health plants and aquatic life 1 industrial sources that involve the mobilization and discharge of mercury of geological provenance along with other anthropogenic activities that entail the deliberate use of mercury in commercial manufacturing are the prime contributors to mercury pollution which negatively impacts the environment and human well being 2 artisanal and small scale gold mining yields the highest fraction of mercury to the environment with approximately 727 tons annually reaching inland freshwater hg2 discharge with of 880 tons per annum 1 3 kg hg to produce 1 kg au 3 walters et al 4 reported that the lowest average hg2 concentration in surface water was 1 87 ng l and the highest reached 29 13 ng l the united states environment protection agency reported that the maximum acceptable level of hg2 in aquatic life is 12 ng l 5 the environmental pollution caused by hg2 in an ecosystem involves the instability and the quick spread of hg2 to environmental media such as water atmosphere soil and plants hg2 can accumulate through the food chain system many reported cases of hg2 poisoning have been due to the consumption of food contamination 6 this noxious ion can be absorbed into the bloodstream and spread to whole tissues the bioaccumulation in the responsive sites can stimulate various acute conditions including decreased central nervous system function potent neurotoxicity pulmonary disease nephritic damage chest pain a decline in fertility birth malformations and blood vessel congestion 6 7 the removal of hg2 from water is thus obligatory many strict regulations have been endorsed concerning the release of mercury in the environment hence researchers are devoted to developing techniques to manage and reduce the negative impacts of hg2 8 various technologies have been established to remove hg2 from aqueous media e g coagulation chemical precipitation cementation solvent extraction ultrafiltration photocatalysis ion exchange reverse osmosis adsorption and combinations of these 9 adsorption using activated carbon ac in particular has been investigated as an effective technique for the removal of heavy metal ions from industrial wastewater or aqueous solution ac offers a high adsorption capacity and rate high removal efficiency the ability for selective removal economic viability ease of operation low cost and a wide range of available precursors 8 10 ac is a porous material acknowledged as an outstanding adsorbent because of its large surface area chemical properties acidic stability large total pore volume and high mechanical strength 11 in the synthesis process researchers carefully select precursors and methods to produce high quality ac moreover ac can be manufactured from various raw materials with different structures and origins by prime activation methods physical chemical or a combination physiochemical the production of more efficient surface modified ac for many applications remains a research topic for further development an activation process using a pyrolysis procedure is extensively used in ac production generally requiring a long process time ranging from 1 5 to 4 h 12 13 this leads to high energy consumption that increases production cost hence quicker ac production is required to minimize energy usage in this sense physical or chemical activation is commonly used to develop ac although the former method uses less chemicals yet chemical activation is more versatile since it provides the synthesis of ac with surface chemistry and tunable porosity with micro mesopores 14 among the chemical activators alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide naoh and potassium hydroxide koh were reported to synthesize high surface area ac and improve the oh functional group formations on the surface of ac 15 16 lam et al 17 found that the utilization of a combination of alkali hydroxides koh and naoh as the chemical activator enhanced the surface area and porosity of the ac the development of the pore structure was promoted through an intercalation effect provided by the interaction of k and na atoms with the carbon formation of the ac the authors also revealed that the combination of koh and naoh rendered the development of a micro mesoporosity structure this provided desirable properties as an adsorbent since the pore formation could allow the adsorbate access to the micropores situated within the mesopores thus giving access to sites and pores for the adsorption process to take place in addition the impregnation ratio is a pivotal aspect of ac production kaur et al 18 and gao et al 19 used a wide range of weight ratios of precursor to alkali activating agent namely 1 1 1 4 and 1 1 1 5 respectively the authors reported that the optimum condition with the largest surface area of ac was observed with an impregnation ratio of 1 3 in line with the activation technique basta et al 20 reported that two stage chemical activation provided a larger surface area and adsorption capacity in comparison with one stage chemical activation the two stage chemical activation produces a lower ash content than the one stage chemical activation as the activating agent solely reacts with carbon not the lignocellulosic biomass hence the ac produced by two stage chemical activation is less blocked by the ash resulting in a larger surface area and adsorption capacity the availability of raw materials is vital in ac production bamboo is a lignocellulosic biomass a woody perennial plant grass family of poaceae subfamily bambusoideae this abundant biomass includes at least 100 genders with approximately 1100 1500 species 21 tropical regions such as latin america asia and africa have planted most bamboo species bamboo exploration has been limited to handicrafts and building materials despite its beneficial mechanical properties high degree of flexibility low weight rapid growth and low cost 22 the utilization of biomass in ac production reduces the cost and converts invaluable matter into useful precious adsorbents 23 24 the bamboo species bambusa vulgaris striata is a lignocellulosic material of natural and renewable resources previous studies reported the high potential of this bamboo to act as ac for heavy metal removal 25 27 recent studies reported on the hg2 removal using ac engineered from biomass feedstocks such as bagasse 28 spanish broom 9 corn straw 29 pistachio wood 30 xanthoceras sorbifolia 31 and rice straw 6 such prior publications focused on the analysis of the hg2 solution after the adsorption process however post adsorption characterizations of used ac have rarely been addressed this work aims to study the characteristics of ac synthesized from pyrolysis of bambusa vulgaris striata by two stage koh naoh mixture activation and investigate its performance for hg2 removal using a fixed bed column with continuous adsorption design the characteristics of ac before and after adsorption are also discussed in detail to confirm a high adsorption capacity performance for a breakthrough curve investigation the thomas model was employed since it is broadly applied in the continuous flow system 32 33 finally the thomas rate constant k t and the adsorption capacity q 0 are specified for the first time to the best of our knowledge the dynamic study of hg2 adsorption in continuous system design onto the novel derived ac through koh naoh mixture activation is studied the present work presents a comprehensive investigation of ac effluents and used ac which is required to confirm and support the adsorption capacity data therefore the interest of material scientists and researchers in all related fields will increase and the field of ac adsorption will advance 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the precursor bambusa vulgaris striata was gathered from a farm in banda aceh indonesia the data of the proximate ultimate and lignocellulosic analyses on this type of bamboo were reported in our previous work 26 the high volatility and low content of ash indicated that the final carbonaceous material structure would be conducive for the fabrication of ac in addition analytical grades of koh naoh mercury ii chloride hgcl2 nitric acid hno3 and hydrochloric acid hcl were obtained from merck distilled water of conductivity 1 μs cm and nitrogen n2 gas of purity 99 9 were also used in the present study 2 2 fabrication of ac in the first stage the bamboo was chopped into flinders roughly 10 10 mm in size they were subsequently washed with distilled water and dried in the open air the flinders were then carbonized in an electric tube furnace at 500 c and concurrently subjected to a flow of n2 at approximately 200 ml min for 120 min the chars were cooled and crushed by milling and then sieved resulting in sizes of 125 to 250 μm the chars were further mixed with koh naoh equal ratio of weights at impregnation ratios irs of 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 char hydroxides w w in distilled water for example 2 00 g of char was mixed with 6 00 g of the hydroxide mixture to produce a chemical ir of 1 3 and distilled water was added to the mixture to form a slurry 12 after stirring at 100 rpm for 120 min the samples were oven dried at 120 c for 240 min in the second stage the dried mixture was transferred in an electric tube furnace under pyrolysis with an n2 flow rate of 200 ml min and an activation temperature of 800 c for 60 min afterward they were cooled down to ambient temperature 25 c a 0 1 m hcl solution was used to wash the produced mixture at 85 c stirring for 30 min to eliminate hydroxide residue and other inorganic substances resulting from the activation the residing acid was purged with distilled water until neutral ph was obtained after separation using membrane filters 0 45 μm the sample was dried overnight at 110 c the yielded ac at char hydroxide ratios of 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 were tagged as ac 1 ac 2 and ac 3 accordingly 2 3 characterization of the synthesized ac the textural characteristics of the ac samples were determined by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 k using quantachrome instruments boynton beach fl usa according to the brunauer emmett teller bet equation the estimation of the liquid volume of n2 based on the number adsorbed at a high relative pressure p p o 0 99 was used to determine the total pore volume v t the dubinin radushkevich dr equation was used to identify micropore volume v μ while the difference between v t and v μ was employed to specify mesopore volume v m the average pore diameter dp was achieved through the equation dp 4v t s bet where s bet is the bet surface area while the barrett joyner halenda bjh technique was used to define the pore size distribution psd the morphological surface analysis was carried out in an argon atmosphere with a scanning electron microscope sem tm3000 hitachi japan operating at an accelerating voltage of 15 kv the specific surface organic functional group analysis was conducted by the kbr method employing ir prestige 21 fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer shimadzu japan the spectra were performed at from 4000 to 400 cm 1 2 4 adsorption performance of the synthesized ac the performance of synthesized ac was assessed based on the hg2 uptake and the amount of initial concentration the hg2 solution was pumped at 10 ml min in an up flow direction using a peristaltic type pump with initial concentrations of 50 and 100 mg l a standard solution with a hg2 concentration of 1000 mg l was first prepared by dissolving 0 1354 g of hgcl2 into 100 ml of distilled water and acidifying with concentrated hno3 the solution was then diluted into the amount of distilled water to obtain concentrations of hg2 of 50 and 100 mg l the process was conducted with 0 5 g of 125 250 μm ac 3 the highest bet surface area in this study filled in a fixed bed column the fixed bed column adsorption studies were performed in a glass column with a 3 5 cm height and 1 cm inner diameter we conducted this study in a laboratory at 25 c ambient environment the thomas model was employed to evaluate the characteristics of the hg2 adsorption process in a fixed bed column the model involves a langmuir isotherm with a rate expression of pseudo second order a previous study by basu et al 34 revealed that the model could be exerted in numerous flow systems by neglecting the dispersive consequences namely finite resistance to mass transfer and axial dispersion the thomas model is displayed in eq 1 1 c t c 0 1 1 exp k t q 0 m f k t c 0 t where c t is the effluent concentration of hg2 solution at time t mg l c 0 is the initial concentration of hg2 solution mg l k t is the rate constant of thomas model ml min mg q 0 is the adsorption capacity per gram of adsorbent mg g m is the mass of adsorbent in the column g f is the feed volumetric flow rate ml min and t is the time of the adsorption process min the plot of c t c 0 versus t results in the adsorption curve pattern ordinarily known as the breakthrough curve the model displayed in eq 1 can be converted to a linear form as depicted in eq 2 2 ln c 0 c t 1 k t q 0 m f k t c 0 t the linearized eq 2 can be applied to calculate two essential parameters the rate constant and adsorption capacity based on the plot of ln c 0 c t 1 against time t k t is the slope and q 0 is the intercept each experiment was performed three times and the averages of the data were plotted for the statistical analysis the error bars representing the corresponding standard deviations were calculated using the following expression 3 σ 1 n 1 i 1 n c t c 0 i c t c 0 2 where σ is the standard deviation n is the number of measurements c t c 0 i refers to the calculated data at corresponding time t and c t c 0 refers to the mean value of the calculated data 2 5 hg2 analysis the hg2 concentration was analyzed by sampling the effluent samples at a stipulated time interval the samples were measured by the cold vapor atomic absorption technique at ambient atmosphere using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer connected to a mercury analyzer mvu 1a aa 7000 shimadzu japan at a wavelength λ of 253 7 nm where hno3 acidified the samples prior to analysis per astm d3223 02 35 in detail 5 ml of h2so4 and 2 5 ml of hno3 were carefully poured into a reaction flask containing the liquid sample next 15 ml of kmno4 solution was added to the sample bottle which was shaken for 15 min until the purple color persisted thereafter 8 ml of k2s2o8 solution was added to the sample and heated in a 95 c water bath for 120 min and cooled to 25 c ambient environment the circulating system ran at 1 l min and 6 ml of sodium chloride hydroxylamine sulfate solution was subsequently added to the sample solution after 0 5 min 5 ml of snso4 solution was poured into the flask which was then attached to the aeration apparatus finally the concentration of hg2 was determined by the standard curve according to the maximum absorbance recorded of the peak height a three replicate measurement was carried out for the operating experimental variables 2 6 post adsorption characterizations of used activated carbon after the adsorption process the ac s morphological structure was analyzed in an argon atmosphere using an sem tm3000 hitachi japan at an accelerating voltage of 15 kv to record the desired peaks were recorded the elemental composition of the ac surface was synchronously assigned via energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds in conjunction with sem imaging 3 results and discussion 3 1 textural characteristics the textural properties of the ac were identified by the curve of adsorption desorption isotherms the porous structure of the ac is displayed in fig 1 according to the iupac classification all three curve patterns are of type i a widely known as langmuir 36 previous studies that used alkali activation in their ac production also reported curve patterns with the same type of physisorption isotherms 18 37 the figure shows the n2 uptake rising with increasing ir of char to koh naoh mixture from 1 1 to 1 3 at 800 c ac 1 to ac 3 indicating the steady inauguration of the porous carbon structure the patterns of isotherms were ascribed to the predominantly microporous contexture indicating that the porous carbons had a strong affinity 38 in detail the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms display typical three stage behavior with increments in relative pressure in the first stage the adsorption rapidly climbed at low relative pressures p p 0 0 02 which represents the condensation or adsorption process in the small microporous carbon 39 then the adsorption steadily rose with relative pressure in the absence of any significant hysteresis which indicates the progressive loading of large micro mesopores lastly the amount of n2 adsorption desorption increased slightly at the saturation pressure region owing to the active capillary condensation as also reported in the literature 40 the investigation of physisorption hysteresis is also essential in the pore structure analysis the presence of h4 hysteresis loops according to iupac classification inside relative pressure p p 0 range of 0 35 0 95 represents the existence of slit like mesopores along with micropores 18 type h4 hysteresis loops are ordinarily observed for n2 adsorption desorption at 77 k on ac containing narrow slit pore micropores this type of loop was achieved by many ac materials and some other nanoporous adsorbents 37 table 1 summarizes the textural characterization of all ac synthesized from bambusa vulgaris striata using koh naoh mixture activation the bet surface area s bet of the produced ac rose dramatically about twofold raising the impregnation ratio from 1 1 to 1 3 a similar trend was reported in the literature for a lignocellulosic biomass material 17 meanwhile the total pore volume v t of the produced ac nearly doubled from 0 394 to 0 634 cm3 g with an increasing impregnation ratio in which ac 3 was the optimum figure of the ac samples consistent with the trend reported by kamran and park 41 in the context of micro mesoporosity the synthesized ac also grew with the increasing impregnation ratio the microporosity v μ increased in the carbon samples ac 1 to ac 3 from 62 4 to 84 5 meanwhile the mesoporosity v m dwindled from 37 6 to 15 5 the alkali activation provides a large surface area and pore volume of ac having a microporous structure as also reported in many studies in the literature pore development also depends on the rate of the activating agent and temperature activation in this study the exertion of impregnated ac with koh naoh mixture yields the thermal degradation process and vaporization in the pyrolysis resulting in large surface area and pore formation of ac moreover the effect of the char to activator ratio on the development of the physical properties of ac was significant during the activation process the experimental results showed that synthesized ac was predominantly microporous still it also harbored mesopores which are fundamental for providing plenty of molecules to the inside of the carbon particle 42 a trend also revealed in previous work 43 gao et al 19 reported that three main stages develop during the activation period a riddling the initially impermeable pores b mintage of new pores and c expanse of the existent cavities stages a and b encourage micropore formation when the hydroxide proportion and activation temperature are low by increasing the activation temperature and hydroxide proportion micropore establishment and pore dilatation would be more extreme processes associated with the reaction of activation then stage c is typically instigated by the opened cavities internal reaction mainly developing after the first two stages therefore the chemical activation re forms the carbon contexture to generate a more ordered structural formation one essential substance in the characterization of structural heterogeneity is the psd which is the primary property regarding porous material characteristics psd provides a statistical distribution of the internal pore structure of a material and represents an equivalent model of the systematically shaped and non interacting design of pores that can depict the complex pores of the ac fig 2 indicates that psd of the ac samples was highly influenced by the hydroxide impregnation ratio a similar trend shown in table 1 is that the acquired ac was predominantly microporous with increased hydroxides which is consistent with the tendency observed by lam et al 17 the obtained ac showed a larger micropore structure with a slightly smaller pore size with the increasing weight of the activating agent in the activation process 3 2 surface morphologies characterization the sem micrographs for the char and synthesized ac of bambusa vulgaris striata are presented in fig 3 the precursor was confirmed to have a dense surface structure weak pore formation and smooth consistency fig 3a in contrast the ac by koh naoh chemical activation had well formed pores fig 3b e as shown in the figure ac 2 fig 3c presented greater pore development compared to ac 1 fig 3b ac 3 achieved optimized pore formation exhibiting a desirable porous carbon skeleton with a suitable micro mesoporosity framework fig 3d e the influence of the activator was significant particularly for developing micropores the micro mesoporosity and mesoporosity formed from the oxidative modification and reduction for the separation and derivation of graphitic layers in the reaction process the evolution of co2 h2 co and other reactions between the active intermediates and the ac surface are possible the possible reaction formulas are depicted in the following 44 45 4 2koh k 2 o h 2 o 5 2naoh na 2 o h 2 o 6 h 2 o c co h 2 7 co h 2 o co 2 h 2 8 co 2 k 2 o k 2 co 3 9 co 2 na 2 o na 2 co 3 10 k 2 co 3 k 2 o co 2 11 na 2 co 3 na 2 o co 2 12 co 2 c 2co 13 k 2 o 2c k 2co 14 na 2 o 2c na 2co 15 k 2 co 3 c 2 k 3co 16 na 2 co 3 c 2na 3co in the activation process the hydroxides activate the carbon matrix through three main processes 44 46 firstly the generation of co2 co and h2o allows pore development through carbon matrix gasification secondly the production of k2o k2co3 na2o and na2co3 at a temperature exceeding 700 c catalyzes the carbon framework to produce the pore structure by the redox reaction thirdly the formation of metallic na at roughly 800 c is the key aspect for producing the pore structure by diffusing and integrating into the graphitic layers in addition fig 3b d show that the surface of the produced ac contains many cavities created from the evaporation of the formation compounds of the impregnated koh naoh forsaking the space initially occupied by the activator these pores provide conduits for the plenteous molecules into the micro mesopores of carbon particles 47 in summary by increasing the amount of activating agent the activation process plays a pivotal role in pore establishment supplying a sustained rate of increase in both the surface area and pore volume 48 3 3 surface chemistry properties fig 4 illustrates representative data of ftir transmission spectra of the synthesized ac the assigned broad region at 3300 3600 cm 1 was ascribed to the oh hydroxyl groups stretching vibration a peak region at 2850 2950 cm 1 was associated with the asymmetric ch representing stretching vibration in methylene and methyl groups a region band around 2275 2375 cm 1 indicated the presence of cc alkynes groups the peak at 1700 1750 cm 1 was identified to the co carbonyl groups while a region band at 1500 1550 cm 1 was the indicator for cc carboxyl groups later the presence of co alkoxy groups stretching vibration appeared in the region transmittance of 1100 1125 cm 1 according to the ftir results no different functional group was appeared of the all obtained ac indicating the hydroxide activation uniformly developed active functional groups on the ac however the highest peak values of all functional groups were observed for ac 3 while the peaks of ac 2 were slightly higher than ac 1 this was probably due to the different irs of the activating agent that generated dissimilar peaks of surface chemistry on the ac the oh groups exhibited the highest transmittance compared to other functional groups indicating phenols were the predominant functional group in the lignocellulosic biomass precursor the presence of oh co and co functional groups is crucial in the adsorption process as they provide hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction between the surface of ac and adsorbate 49 3 4 performance of ac from bambusa vulgaris striata on the removal of hg2 3 4 1 breakthrough curves in industrial scale system design the column adsorption of a continuous system is typically employed the breakthrough curve of this experiment is displayed in fig 5 the adsorbed hg2 rose dramatically with time during the initial step of contiguity between the hg2 solution and the ac because of the substantial presence of active binding sites oh co and co on the ac then the rate of the adsorption process decelerated until nearly constant as the active binding sites were eliminated a similar tendency was also revealed by a previous researcher studying hg2 adsorption using ac prepared from spanish broom 9 the difference between the two hg2 initial concentrations is indicated in the breakthrough curves patterns and gradients as shown in fig 5a a lower influent hg2 concentration gradient caused a weaker mass transfer driving force consequently hg2 concentrations saturated the ac more slowly resulting in an increment of exhaust time on the other hand the higher initial concentration of hg2 in the aqueous solution resulted in a shorter breakthrough time fig 5b the breakthrough time decreased from approximately 300 to 160 min when the hg2 initial concentration increased from 50 to 100 mg l at a flow rate of hg2 solution of 10 ml min a greater mass transfer driving force was responsible for a reduction of exhaust time at the higher concentration which led to a shorter required time to saturation 3 4 2 linear curve and adsorption capacity the resulting hg2 adsorption is plotted in the breakthrough curves shape by linear regression fig 5 eq 2 aligns with the experimental data well the values for k t and q 0 thomas model parameters were determined using the linear regression technique of eq 2 the result of equilibrium hg2 uptake yielded the k t and q 0 values depicted in table 2 the obtained coefficient correlation r 2 varies at different initial hg2 concentrations a more suitable model data was presented at an initial hg2 concentration of 50 mg l with r 2 of 0 9182 indicating that chemisorption was the prime mechanism during this process 50 on the other hand the intraparticle diffusion model did not correspond well to hg2 adsorption at the initial concentration of 100 mg l r 2 0 7548 possibly with the increases of the metallic ion concentration the driving force within the hg2 prevented them from adsorbing onto ac which constrained the model to describe adsorption processes limited by diffusion 51 a similar phenomenon was also revealed in the adsorptive removal of a heavy metal ion in a continuous mode 52 a prevalent phenomenon for the hg2 adsorption was the decline in the k t with a rise in the hg2 initial concentration the initial concentration has two substantial effects on the kinetic adsorption rate first a rise in the hg2 initial concentration leads to diminished hg2 diffusion in the boundary layer or surface and increased diffusion in the solid matrix second a rise in the hg2 initial concentration causes a progressive decrease in covalent interactions relative to electrostatic interactions of the sites with a lower affinity for hg2 29 in addition the adsorption capacity of hg2 decreased with increasing adsorbate initial concentration at a lower initial concentration hg2 can easily dwell in the presence of active adsorption sites on the ac however an appropriate quantity of active adsorption sites for hg2 to occupy is not likely at higher initial concentrations the hg2 is consequently not thoroughly adsorbed onto ac probably because of the saturation of binding sites similar findings were also reported by previous studies that investigated hg2 adsorption onto composite from bone ash nzvi 53 and ac from fir wood sawdust 7 the values of k t are also affected by the flow rate employed in the continuous adsorption system adsorption capacity a crucial parameter in the adsorption process can elucidate the adsorbent performance table 3 summarizes the comparison of the adsorption capacity of ac with various precursors for mercury removal ac used in this study had a maximum adsorption capacity of 312 7 mg g the precursor characteristics preparation method textural properties and surface functional groups can affect the adsorption capacities of the adsorbents some adsorbents have higher adsorption capacity for mercury removal yet the acs might be arduous to produce in a previous study rice straw ac with an adsorption capacity of 500 mg g was activated for 300 min in a furnace followed by microwave power activation 6 meanwhile non renewable bituminous coal ac with an adsorption capacity of 578 mg g was generated using steam followed by a sulfurization process so2 activation 54 in this study the ac was produced by a simple technique from an inexpensive plenteous and readily available precursor which is also a renewable raw material these characteristics of bamboo are prime benefits of producing ac from bambusa vulgaris striata as a highly potential adsorbent for removing hg2 from contaminated water 3 4 3 sem analysis an sem morphological analysis was applied to observe the surface of the ac after the adsorption process and to confirm the existence of hg2 on the ac surface fig 6 displays the sem images of the ac from bambusa vulgaris striata after hg2 adsorption of two initial concentrations containing the heavy metal ions significant discrepancies on the surface of the ac skeleton after the hg2 adsorption process were evident assemblies of white cursors on the ac layer were observed which could be regarded as a complex structure of hg2 furthermore many extracellular lignocellulosic biomass materials of ac could quickly combine with the heavy metal ions to result in crystal and oxalate crystal for example which could be generated by the heavy metal ions and oxalic acid over the cell wall and outward matrix particle of ac 56 the conformable findings of the ac after the hg2 adsorption process at concentrations of 50 and 100 mg l were identified 3 4 4 eds analysis an eds analysis was performed to confirm the adsorption of hg2 and ensure the presence of hg2 on the cortex of ac the appropriate eds spectrum and the percentage composition table are shown in fig 7 the results revealed that carbon and hg2 become the prime constituents of the prepared ac surface this phenomenon was probably stimulated by physisorption and chemisorption on the surface of porous carbon fig 7 a depicts a notable content of hg2 on the ac surface that is adequately distributed fig 7 b shows the amount of hg2 at an initial concentration of 100 mg l was less compared to that of 50 mg l in fig 7 a this was likely because the hg2 involved greater chemisorption on the ac surface at the lower concentration the slow flow rates used in the present study increased the contact time between the hg2 and ac surface leading to the increased adsorption capacity furthermore the quantity of adsorbed hg2 decreased with an increasing initial concentration of hg2 the results indicate that the initial concentration of hg2 is a driving force for the transfer process to cope with the mass transfer resistance in the fixed bed column 57 therefore the eds analysis exhibits direct evidence for the specific hg2 adsorption onto the ac surface 3 4 5 mechanism of adsorption the investigation of adsorption kinetics presents an essential concept on the reaction mechanisms and the reaction pathways as shown in fig 8 the possible mechanism of the adsorption process of hg2 is typically controlled by three stages of diffusion 58 i carriage of the solute hg2 from the bulk solution to the film peripheral the adsorbent ac ii transport of the hg2 from the film to the ac surface and iii transfer of the hg2 from the ac surface to the internal pores of ac followed by the binding of the hg2 to the active sites all such stages can be observed in terms of the initial hg2 concentration affinity of hg2 for ac flow rate in the continuous adsorption system surface area and psd of ac 59 60 typically stages i and ii determine the overall rate in the adsorption process of hg2 since stage iii is rapid and ordinarily related to complexation coordination and chelating 61 in this study stage i can be distinctly identified by the up flow direction of the hg2 solution to a fixed bed column through a peristaltic type pump which was a selected experimental condition meanwhile stage ii is clearly indicated by the sem micrographs and eds data shown in figs 6 and 7 the porous structure of ac may result through the intra or inter molecular cross linking connections which can provide new binding sites in the micropores interior walls and promote homogeneous hg2 binding in line with the micrographs and eds of used ac a high amount of hg2 appeared to be distributed throughout the ac surface a possible explanation for this observation is that the hg2 diffuses into the ac and sticks to its layer in addition hg2 a cationic metal can be adsorbed by the electrostatic force of interaction onto the negative surface charges of the ac surface the oxygen containing functional groups such as oh co and co fig 4 allow bonding with the positive charge of the mercury ion another possible interaction involves hydrogen bonding between acceptor and donor groups on the ac hg2 system 62 the ac containing numerous oxygen surface complexes are the potential and effective sites for hg2 removal the functional active sites of the ac as achieved from the ftir result showed that the oh co and co functional groups supported an increased binding of cationic hg2 ions to the ac surface the major adsorption mechanism of ac in the hg2 adsorption process is based on a complexation reaction where the hydroxyl carbonyl and alkoxy groups react with hg2 to form o 2hg coo 2hg and co 2hg the possible reaction mechanisms are as follows 63 17 2 oh hg 2 o 2 hg 2h 18 2 cooh hg 2 coo 2 hg 2h 19 2 coh hg 2 co 2 hg 2h 4 conclusions this study presented the performance of ac synthesized from the bamboo species of bambusa vulgaris striata as a natural and renewable resource by two stage chemical activation with a koh naoh mixture for hg2 removal an assembly of oxidation reduction reactions using the hydroxides played a key role in the pore framework development of the carbon matrix particle the largest surface area and total pore volume were 1108 m2 g and 0 634 cm3 g respectively this was achieved from an impregnation ratio of char to koh naoh mixture of 1 3 at 800 c the unique pore structure and functional active sites of the prepared lignocellulosic based ac promoted the high adsorption capacity of 312 7 mg g of hg2 using a continuous flow system at room temperature the thomas model equations adequately depicted the equilibrium and adsorption dynamic and kinetic data

13401,activated carbon with a large surface area was synthesized from bambusa vulgaris striata via two stage koh naoh mixture activation functional properties of the produced activated carbon were investigated optimum conditions in activated carbon production were obtained from an impregnation ratio of char to koh naoh mixture of 1 3 w w at 800 c with a surface area and total pore volume of 1108 m2 g and 0 634 cm3 g respectively the optimized activated carbon was employed in mercury ion hg2 adsorption through a continuous flow experiment at 25 c its large surface area and pristine mineral elements were responsible for a high adsorption capacity of 312 7 mg g the results showed the superior feasibility of bambusa vulgaris striata as a low cost and abundant biomass precursor for the production of highly porous activated carbon that can be employed for hg2 removal hence the produced activated carbon represents a promising adsorbent for the treatment of contaminated and polluted water as well as wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords activated carbon adsorption bambusa vulgaris striata mercury koh naoh mixture continuous flow 1 introduction environmental pollution triggered by envenomed heavy metal ions has become a global issue and a fundamental consideration of many stakeholders in recent decades mercury ii or hg2 is a significant threat to humans health plants and aquatic life 1 industrial sources that involve the mobilization and discharge of mercury of geological provenance along with other anthropogenic activities that entail the deliberate use of mercury in commercial manufacturing are the prime contributors to mercury pollution which negatively impacts the environment and human well being 2 artisanal and small scale gold mining yields the highest fraction of mercury to the environment with approximately 727 tons annually reaching inland freshwater hg2 discharge with of 880 tons per annum 1 3 kg hg to produce 1 kg au 3 walters et al 4 reported that the lowest average hg2 concentration in surface water was 1 87 ng l and the highest reached 29 13 ng l the united states environment protection agency reported that the maximum acceptable level of hg2 in aquatic life is 12 ng l 5 the environmental pollution caused by hg2 in an ecosystem involves the instability and the quick spread of hg2 to environmental media such as water atmosphere soil and plants hg2 can accumulate through the food chain system many reported cases of hg2 poisoning have been due to the consumption of food contamination 6 this noxious ion can be absorbed into the bloodstream and spread to whole tissues the bioaccumulation in the responsive sites can stimulate various acute conditions including decreased central nervous system function potent neurotoxicity pulmonary disease nephritic damage chest pain a decline in fertility birth malformations and blood vessel congestion 6 7 the removal of hg2 from water is thus obligatory many strict regulations have been endorsed concerning the release of mercury in the environment hence researchers are devoted to developing techniques to manage and reduce the negative impacts of hg2 8 various technologies have been established to remove hg2 from aqueous media e g coagulation chemical precipitation cementation solvent extraction ultrafiltration photocatalysis ion exchange reverse osmosis adsorption and combinations of these 9 adsorption using activated carbon ac in particular has been investigated as an effective technique for the removal of heavy metal ions from industrial wastewater or aqueous solution ac offers a high adsorption capacity and rate high removal efficiency the ability for selective removal economic viability ease of operation low cost and a wide range of available precursors 8 10 ac is a porous material acknowledged as an outstanding adsorbent because of its large surface area chemical properties acidic stability large total pore volume and high mechanical strength 11 in the synthesis process researchers carefully select precursors and methods to produce high quality ac moreover ac can be manufactured from various raw materials with different structures and origins by prime activation methods physical chemical or a combination physiochemical the production of more efficient surface modified ac for many applications remains a research topic for further development an activation process using a pyrolysis procedure is extensively used in ac production generally requiring a long process time ranging from 1 5 to 4 h 12 13 this leads to high energy consumption that increases production cost hence quicker ac production is required to minimize energy usage in this sense physical or chemical activation is commonly used to develop ac although the former method uses less chemicals yet chemical activation is more versatile since it provides the synthesis of ac with surface chemistry and tunable porosity with micro mesopores 14 among the chemical activators alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide naoh and potassium hydroxide koh were reported to synthesize high surface area ac and improve the oh functional group formations on the surface of ac 15 16 lam et al 17 found that the utilization of a combination of alkali hydroxides koh and naoh as the chemical activator enhanced the surface area and porosity of the ac the development of the pore structure was promoted through an intercalation effect provided by the interaction of k and na atoms with the carbon formation of the ac the authors also revealed that the combination of koh and naoh rendered the development of a micro mesoporosity structure this provided desirable properties as an adsorbent since the pore formation could allow the adsorbate access to the micropores situated within the mesopores thus giving access to sites and pores for the adsorption process to take place in addition the impregnation ratio is a pivotal aspect of ac production kaur et al 18 and gao et al 19 used a wide range of weight ratios of precursor to alkali activating agent namely 1 1 1 4 and 1 1 1 5 respectively the authors reported that the optimum condition with the largest surface area of ac was observed with an impregnation ratio of 1 3 in line with the activation technique basta et al 20 reported that two stage chemical activation provided a larger surface area and adsorption capacity in comparison with one stage chemical activation the two stage chemical activation produces a lower ash content than the one stage chemical activation as the activating agent solely reacts with carbon not the lignocellulosic biomass hence the ac produced by two stage chemical activation is less blocked by the ash resulting in a larger surface area and adsorption capacity the availability of raw materials is vital in ac production bamboo is a lignocellulosic biomass a woody perennial plant grass family of poaceae subfamily bambusoideae this abundant biomass includes at least 100 genders with approximately 1100 1500 species 21 tropical regions such as latin america asia and africa have planted most bamboo species bamboo exploration has been limited to handicrafts and building materials despite its beneficial mechanical properties high degree of flexibility low weight rapid growth and low cost 22 the utilization of biomass in ac production reduces the cost and converts invaluable matter into useful precious adsorbents 23 24 the bamboo species bambusa vulgaris striata is a lignocellulosic material of natural and renewable resources previous studies reported the high potential of this bamboo to act as ac for heavy metal removal 25 27 recent studies reported on the hg2 removal using ac engineered from biomass feedstocks such as bagasse 28 spanish broom 9 corn straw 29 pistachio wood 30 xanthoceras sorbifolia 31 and rice straw 6 such prior publications focused on the analysis of the hg2 solution after the adsorption process however post adsorption characterizations of used ac have rarely been addressed this work aims to study the characteristics of ac synthesized from pyrolysis of bambusa vulgaris striata by two stage koh naoh mixture activation and investigate its performance for hg2 removal using a fixed bed column with continuous adsorption design the characteristics of ac before and after adsorption are also discussed in detail to confirm a high adsorption capacity performance for a breakthrough curve investigation the thomas model was employed since it is broadly applied in the continuous flow system 32 33 finally the thomas rate constant k t and the adsorption capacity q 0 are specified for the first time to the best of our knowledge the dynamic study of hg2 adsorption in continuous system design onto the novel derived ac through koh naoh mixture activation is studied the present work presents a comprehensive investigation of ac effluents and used ac which is required to confirm and support the adsorption capacity data therefore the interest of material scientists and researchers in all related fields will increase and the field of ac adsorption will advance 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the precursor bambusa vulgaris striata was gathered from a farm in banda aceh indonesia the data of the proximate ultimate and lignocellulosic analyses on this type of bamboo were reported in our previous work 26 the high volatility and low content of ash indicated that the final carbonaceous material structure would be conducive for the fabrication of ac in addition analytical grades of koh naoh mercury ii chloride hgcl2 nitric acid hno3 and hydrochloric acid hcl were obtained from merck distilled water of conductivity 1 μs cm and nitrogen n2 gas of purity 99 9 were also used in the present study 2 2 fabrication of ac in the first stage the bamboo was chopped into flinders roughly 10 10 mm in size they were subsequently washed with distilled water and dried in the open air the flinders were then carbonized in an electric tube furnace at 500 c and concurrently subjected to a flow of n2 at approximately 200 ml min for 120 min the chars were cooled and crushed by milling and then sieved resulting in sizes of 125 to 250 μm the chars were further mixed with koh naoh equal ratio of weights at impregnation ratios irs of 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 char hydroxides w w in distilled water for example 2 00 g of char was mixed with 6 00 g of the hydroxide mixture to produce a chemical ir of 1 3 and distilled water was added to the mixture to form a slurry 12 after stirring at 100 rpm for 120 min the samples were oven dried at 120 c for 240 min in the second stage the dried mixture was transferred in an electric tube furnace under pyrolysis with an n2 flow rate of 200 ml min and an activation temperature of 800 c for 60 min afterward they were cooled down to ambient temperature 25 c a 0 1 m hcl solution was used to wash the produced mixture at 85 c stirring for 30 min to eliminate hydroxide residue and other inorganic substances resulting from the activation the residing acid was purged with distilled water until neutral ph was obtained after separation using membrane filters 0 45 μm the sample was dried overnight at 110 c the yielded ac at char hydroxide ratios of 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 were tagged as ac 1 ac 2 and ac 3 accordingly 2 3 characterization of the synthesized ac the textural characteristics of the ac samples were determined by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 k using quantachrome instruments boynton beach fl usa according to the brunauer emmett teller bet equation the estimation of the liquid volume of n2 based on the number adsorbed at a high relative pressure p p o 0 99 was used to determine the total pore volume v t the dubinin radushkevich dr equation was used to identify micropore volume v μ while the difference between v t and v μ was employed to specify mesopore volume v m the average pore diameter dp was achieved through the equation dp 4v t s bet where s bet is the bet surface area while the barrett joyner halenda bjh technique was used to define the pore size distribution psd the morphological surface analysis was carried out in an argon atmosphere with a scanning electron microscope sem tm3000 hitachi japan operating at an accelerating voltage of 15 kv the specific surface organic functional group analysis was conducted by the kbr method employing ir prestige 21 fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer shimadzu japan the spectra were performed at from 4000 to 400 cm 1 2 4 adsorption performance of the synthesized ac the performance of synthesized ac was assessed based on the hg2 uptake and the amount of initial concentration the hg2 solution was pumped at 10 ml min in an up flow direction using a peristaltic type pump with initial concentrations of 50 and 100 mg l a standard solution with a hg2 concentration of 1000 mg l was first prepared by dissolving 0 1354 g of hgcl2 into 100 ml of distilled water and acidifying with concentrated hno3 the solution was then diluted into the amount of distilled water to obtain concentrations of hg2 of 50 and 100 mg l the process was conducted with 0 5 g of 125 250 μm ac 3 the highest bet surface area in this study filled in a fixed bed column the fixed bed column adsorption studies were performed in a glass column with a 3 5 cm height and 1 cm inner diameter we conducted this study in a laboratory at 25 c ambient environment the thomas model was employed to evaluate the characteristics of the hg2 adsorption process in a fixed bed column the model involves a langmuir isotherm with a rate expression of pseudo second order a previous study by basu et al 34 revealed that the model could be exerted in numerous flow systems by neglecting the dispersive consequences namely finite resistance to mass transfer and axial dispersion the thomas model is displayed in eq 1 1 c t c 0 1 1 exp k t q 0 m f k t c 0 t where c t is the effluent concentration of hg2 solution at time t mg l c 0 is the initial concentration of hg2 solution mg l k t is the rate constant of thomas model ml min mg q 0 is the adsorption capacity per gram of adsorbent mg g m is the mass of adsorbent in the column g f is the feed volumetric flow rate ml min and t is the time of the adsorption process min the plot of c t c 0 versus t results in the adsorption curve pattern ordinarily known as the breakthrough curve the model displayed in eq 1 can be converted to a linear form as depicted in eq 2 2 ln c 0 c t 1 k t q 0 m f k t c 0 t the linearized eq 2 can be applied to calculate two essential parameters the rate constant and adsorption capacity based on the plot of ln c 0 c t 1 against time t k t is the slope and q 0 is the intercept each experiment was performed three times and the averages of the data were plotted for the statistical analysis the error bars representing the corresponding standard deviations were calculated using the following expression 3 σ 1 n 1 i 1 n c t c 0 i c t c 0 2 where σ is the standard deviation n is the number of measurements c t c 0 i refers to the calculated data at corresponding time t and c t c 0 refers to the mean value of the calculated data 2 5 hg2 analysis the hg2 concentration was analyzed by sampling the effluent samples at a stipulated time interval the samples were measured by the cold vapor atomic absorption technique at ambient atmosphere using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer connected to a mercury analyzer mvu 1a aa 7000 shimadzu japan at a wavelength λ of 253 7 nm where hno3 acidified the samples prior to analysis per astm d3223 02 35 in detail 5 ml of h2so4 and 2 5 ml of hno3 were carefully poured into a reaction flask containing the liquid sample next 15 ml of kmno4 solution was added to the sample bottle which was shaken for 15 min until the purple color persisted thereafter 8 ml of k2s2o8 solution was added to the sample and heated in a 95 c water bath for 120 min and cooled to 25 c ambient environment the circulating system ran at 1 l min and 6 ml of sodium chloride hydroxylamine sulfate solution was subsequently added to the sample solution after 0 5 min 5 ml of snso4 solution was poured into the flask which was then attached to the aeration apparatus finally the concentration of hg2 was determined by the standard curve according to the maximum absorbance recorded of the peak height a three replicate measurement was carried out for the operating experimental variables 2 6 post adsorption characterizations of used activated carbon after the adsorption process the ac s morphological structure was analyzed in an argon atmosphere using an sem tm3000 hitachi japan at an accelerating voltage of 15 kv to record the desired peaks were recorded the elemental composition of the ac surface was synchronously assigned via energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds in conjunction with sem imaging 3 results and discussion 3 1 textural characteristics the textural properties of the ac were identified by the curve of adsorption desorption isotherms the porous structure of the ac is displayed in fig 1 according to the iupac classification all three curve patterns are of type i a widely known as langmuir 36 previous studies that used alkali activation in their ac production also reported curve patterns with the same type of physisorption isotherms 18 37 the figure shows the n2 uptake rising with increasing ir of char to koh naoh mixture from 1 1 to 1 3 at 800 c ac 1 to ac 3 indicating the steady inauguration of the porous carbon structure the patterns of isotherms were ascribed to the predominantly microporous contexture indicating that the porous carbons had a strong affinity 38 in detail the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms display typical three stage behavior with increments in relative pressure in the first stage the adsorption rapidly climbed at low relative pressures p p 0 0 02 which represents the condensation or adsorption process in the small microporous carbon 39 then the adsorption steadily rose with relative pressure in the absence of any significant hysteresis which indicates the progressive loading of large micro mesopores lastly the amount of n2 adsorption desorption increased slightly at the saturation pressure region owing to the active capillary condensation as also reported in the literature 40 the investigation of physisorption hysteresis is also essential in the pore structure analysis the presence of h4 hysteresis loops according to iupac classification inside relative pressure p p 0 range of 0 35 0 95 represents the existence of slit like mesopores along with micropores 18 type h4 hysteresis loops are ordinarily observed for n2 adsorption desorption at 77 k on ac containing narrow slit pore micropores this type of loop was achieved by many ac materials and some other nanoporous adsorbents 37 table 1 summarizes the textural characterization of all ac synthesized from bambusa vulgaris striata using koh naoh mixture activation the bet surface area s bet of the produced ac rose dramatically about twofold raising the impregnation ratio from 1 1 to 1 3 a similar trend was reported in the literature for a lignocellulosic biomass material 17 meanwhile the total pore volume v t of the produced ac nearly doubled from 0 394 to 0 634 cm3 g with an increasing impregnation ratio in which ac 3 was the optimum figure of the ac samples consistent with the trend reported by kamran and park 41 in the context of micro mesoporosity the synthesized ac also grew with the increasing impregnation ratio the microporosity v μ increased in the carbon samples ac 1 to ac 3 from 62 4 to 84 5 meanwhile the mesoporosity v m dwindled from 37 6 to 15 5 the alkali activation provides a large surface area and pore volume of ac having a microporous structure as also reported in many studies in the literature pore development also depends on the rate of the activating agent and temperature activation in this study the exertion of impregnated ac with koh naoh mixture yields the thermal degradation process and vaporization in the pyrolysis resulting in large surface area and pore formation of ac moreover the effect of the char to activator ratio on the development of the physical properties of ac was significant during the activation process the experimental results showed that synthesized ac was predominantly microporous still it also harbored mesopores which are fundamental for providing plenty of molecules to the inside of the carbon particle 42 a trend also revealed in previous work 43 gao et al 19 reported that three main stages develop during the activation period a riddling the initially impermeable pores b mintage of new pores and c expanse of the existent cavities stages a and b encourage micropore formation when the hydroxide proportion and activation temperature are low by increasing the activation temperature and hydroxide proportion micropore establishment and pore dilatation would be more extreme processes associated with the reaction of activation then stage c is typically instigated by the opened cavities internal reaction mainly developing after the first two stages therefore the chemical activation re forms the carbon contexture to generate a more ordered structural formation one essential substance in the characterization of structural heterogeneity is the psd which is the primary property regarding porous material characteristics psd provides a statistical distribution of the internal pore structure of a material and represents an equivalent model of the systematically shaped and non interacting design of pores that can depict the complex pores of the ac fig 2 indicates that psd of the ac samples was highly influenced by the hydroxide impregnation ratio a similar trend shown in table 1 is that the acquired ac was predominantly microporous with increased hydroxides which is consistent with the tendency observed by lam et al 17 the obtained ac showed a larger micropore structure with a slightly smaller pore size with the increasing weight of the activating agent in the activation process 3 2 surface morphologies characterization the sem micrographs for the char and synthesized ac of bambusa vulgaris striata are presented in fig 3 the precursor was confirmed to have a dense surface structure weak pore formation and smooth consistency fig 3a in contrast the ac by koh naoh chemical activation had well formed pores fig 3b e as shown in the figure ac 2 fig 3c presented greater pore development compared to ac 1 fig 3b ac 3 achieved optimized pore formation exhibiting a desirable porous carbon skeleton with a suitable micro mesoporosity framework fig 3d e the influence of the activator was significant particularly for developing micropores the micro mesoporosity and mesoporosity formed from the oxidative modification and reduction for the separation and derivation of graphitic layers in the reaction process the evolution of co2 h2 co and other reactions between the active intermediates and the ac surface are possible the possible reaction formulas are depicted in the following 44 45 4 2koh k 2 o h 2 o 5 2naoh na 2 o h 2 o 6 h 2 o c co h 2 7 co h 2 o co 2 h 2 8 co 2 k 2 o k 2 co 3 9 co 2 na 2 o na 2 co 3 10 k 2 co 3 k 2 o co 2 11 na 2 co 3 na 2 o co 2 12 co 2 c 2co 13 k 2 o 2c k 2co 14 na 2 o 2c na 2co 15 k 2 co 3 c 2 k 3co 16 na 2 co 3 c 2na 3co in the activation process the hydroxides activate the carbon matrix through three main processes 44 46 firstly the generation of co2 co and h2o allows pore development through carbon matrix gasification secondly the production of k2o k2co3 na2o and na2co3 at a temperature exceeding 700 c catalyzes the carbon framework to produce the pore structure by the redox reaction thirdly the formation of metallic na at roughly 800 c is the key aspect for producing the pore structure by diffusing and integrating into the graphitic layers in addition fig 3b d show that the surface of the produced ac contains many cavities created from the evaporation of the formation compounds of the impregnated koh naoh forsaking the space initially occupied by the activator these pores provide conduits for the plenteous molecules into the micro mesopores of carbon particles 47 in summary by increasing the amount of activating agent the activation process plays a pivotal role in pore establishment supplying a sustained rate of increase in both the surface area and pore volume 48 3 3 surface chemistry properties fig 4 illustrates representative data of ftir transmission spectra of the synthesized ac the assigned broad region at 3300 3600 cm 1 was ascribed to the oh hydroxyl groups stretching vibration a peak region at 2850 2950 cm 1 was associated with the asymmetric ch representing stretching vibration in methylene and methyl groups a region band around 2275 2375 cm 1 indicated the presence of cc alkynes groups the peak at 1700 1750 cm 1 was identified to the co carbonyl groups while a region band at 1500 1550 cm 1 was the indicator for cc carboxyl groups later the presence of co alkoxy groups stretching vibration appeared in the region transmittance of 1100 1125 cm 1 according to the ftir results no different functional group was appeared of the all obtained ac indicating the hydroxide activation uniformly developed active functional groups on the ac however the highest peak values of all functional groups were observed for ac 3 while the peaks of ac 2 were slightly higher than ac 1 this was probably due to the different irs of the activating agent that generated dissimilar peaks of surface chemistry on the ac the oh groups exhibited the highest transmittance compared to other functional groups indicating phenols were the predominant functional group in the lignocellulosic biomass precursor the presence of oh co and co functional groups is crucial in the adsorption process as they provide hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction between the surface of ac and adsorbate 49 3 4 performance of ac from bambusa vulgaris striata on the removal of hg2 3 4 1 breakthrough curves in industrial scale system design the column adsorption of a continuous system is typically employed the breakthrough curve of this experiment is displayed in fig 5 the adsorbed hg2 rose dramatically with time during the initial step of contiguity between the hg2 solution and the ac because of the substantial presence of active binding sites oh co and co on the ac then the rate of the adsorption process decelerated until nearly constant as the active binding sites were eliminated a similar tendency was also revealed by a previous researcher studying hg2 adsorption using ac prepared from spanish broom 9 the difference between the two hg2 initial concentrations is indicated in the breakthrough curves patterns and gradients as shown in fig 5a a lower influent hg2 concentration gradient caused a weaker mass transfer driving force consequently hg2 concentrations saturated the ac more slowly resulting in an increment of exhaust time on the other hand the higher initial concentration of hg2 in the aqueous solution resulted in a shorter breakthrough time fig 5b the breakthrough time decreased from approximately 300 to 160 min when the hg2 initial concentration increased from 50 to 100 mg l at a flow rate of hg2 solution of 10 ml min a greater mass transfer driving force was responsible for a reduction of exhaust time at the higher concentration which led to a shorter required time to saturation 3 4 2 linear curve and adsorption capacity the resulting hg2 adsorption is plotted in the breakthrough curves shape by linear regression fig 5 eq 2 aligns with the experimental data well the values for k t and q 0 thomas model parameters were determined using the linear regression technique of eq 2 the result of equilibrium hg2 uptake yielded the k t and q 0 values depicted in table 2 the obtained coefficient correlation r 2 varies at different initial hg2 concentrations a more suitable model data was presented at an initial hg2 concentration of 50 mg l with r 2 of 0 9182 indicating that chemisorption was the prime mechanism during this process 50 on the other hand the intraparticle diffusion model did not correspond well to hg2 adsorption at the initial concentration of 100 mg l r 2 0 7548 possibly with the increases of the metallic ion concentration the driving force within the hg2 prevented them from adsorbing onto ac which constrained the model to describe adsorption processes limited by diffusion 51 a similar phenomenon was also revealed in the adsorptive removal of a heavy metal ion in a continuous mode 52 a prevalent phenomenon for the hg2 adsorption was the decline in the k t with a rise in the hg2 initial concentration the initial concentration has two substantial effects on the kinetic adsorption rate first a rise in the hg2 initial concentration leads to diminished hg2 diffusion in the boundary layer or surface and increased diffusion in the solid matrix second a rise in the hg2 initial concentration causes a progressive decrease in covalent interactions relative to electrostatic interactions of the sites with a lower affinity for hg2 29 in addition the adsorption capacity of hg2 decreased with increasing adsorbate initial concentration at a lower initial concentration hg2 can easily dwell in the presence of active adsorption sites on the ac however an appropriate quantity of active adsorption sites for hg2 to occupy is not likely at higher initial concentrations the hg2 is consequently not thoroughly adsorbed onto ac probably because of the saturation of binding sites similar findings were also reported by previous studies that investigated hg2 adsorption onto composite from bone ash nzvi 53 and ac from fir wood sawdust 7 the values of k t are also affected by the flow rate employed in the continuous adsorption system adsorption capacity a crucial parameter in the adsorption process can elucidate the adsorbent performance table 3 summarizes the comparison of the adsorption capacity of ac with various precursors for mercury removal ac used in this study had a maximum adsorption capacity of 312 7 mg g the precursor characteristics preparation method textural properties and surface functional groups can affect the adsorption capacities of the adsorbents some adsorbents have higher adsorption capacity for mercury removal yet the acs might be arduous to produce in a previous study rice straw ac with an adsorption capacity of 500 mg g was activated for 300 min in a furnace followed by microwave power activation 6 meanwhile non renewable bituminous coal ac with an adsorption capacity of 578 mg g was generated using steam followed by a sulfurization process so2 activation 54 in this study the ac was produced by a simple technique from an inexpensive plenteous and readily available precursor which is also a renewable raw material these characteristics of bamboo are prime benefits of producing ac from bambusa vulgaris striata as a highly potential adsorbent for removing hg2 from contaminated water 3 4 3 sem analysis an sem morphological analysis was applied to observe the surface of the ac after the adsorption process and to confirm the existence of hg2 on the ac surface fig 6 displays the sem images of the ac from bambusa vulgaris striata after hg2 adsorption of two initial concentrations containing the heavy metal ions significant discrepancies on the surface of the ac skeleton after the hg2 adsorption process were evident assemblies of white cursors on the ac layer were observed which could be regarded as a complex structure of hg2 furthermore many extracellular lignocellulosic biomass materials of ac could quickly combine with the heavy metal ions to result in crystal and oxalate crystal for example which could be generated by the heavy metal ions and oxalic acid over the cell wall and outward matrix particle of ac 56 the conformable findings of the ac after the hg2 adsorption process at concentrations of 50 and 100 mg l were identified 3 4 4 eds analysis an eds analysis was performed to confirm the adsorption of hg2 and ensure the presence of hg2 on the cortex of ac the appropriate eds spectrum and the percentage composition table are shown in fig 7 the results revealed that carbon and hg2 become the prime constituents of the prepared ac surface this phenomenon was probably stimulated by physisorption and chemisorption on the surface of porous carbon fig 7 a depicts a notable content of hg2 on the ac surface that is adequately distributed fig 7 b shows the amount of hg2 at an initial concentration of 100 mg l was less compared to that of 50 mg l in fig 7 a this was likely because the hg2 involved greater chemisorption on the ac surface at the lower concentration the slow flow rates used in the present study increased the contact time between the hg2 and ac surface leading to the increased adsorption capacity furthermore the quantity of adsorbed hg2 decreased with an increasing initial concentration of hg2 the results indicate that the initial concentration of hg2 is a driving force for the transfer process to cope with the mass transfer resistance in the fixed bed column 57 therefore the eds analysis exhibits direct evidence for the specific hg2 adsorption onto the ac surface 3 4 5 mechanism of adsorption the investigation of adsorption kinetics presents an essential concept on the reaction mechanisms and the reaction pathways as shown in fig 8 the possible mechanism of the adsorption process of hg2 is typically controlled by three stages of diffusion 58 i carriage of the solute hg2 from the bulk solution to the film peripheral the adsorbent ac ii transport of the hg2 from the film to the ac surface and iii transfer of the hg2 from the ac surface to the internal pores of ac followed by the binding of the hg2 to the active sites all such stages can be observed in terms of the initial hg2 concentration affinity of hg2 for ac flow rate in the continuous adsorption system surface area and psd of ac 59 60 typically stages i and ii determine the overall rate in the adsorption process of hg2 since stage iii is rapid and ordinarily related to complexation coordination and chelating 61 in this study stage i can be distinctly identified by the up flow direction of the hg2 solution to a fixed bed column through a peristaltic type pump which was a selected experimental condition meanwhile stage ii is clearly indicated by the sem micrographs and eds data shown in figs 6 and 7 the porous structure of ac may result through the intra or inter molecular cross linking connections which can provide new binding sites in the micropores interior walls and promote homogeneous hg2 binding in line with the micrographs and eds of used ac a high amount of hg2 appeared to be distributed throughout the ac surface a possible explanation for this observation is that the hg2 diffuses into the ac and sticks to its layer in addition hg2 a cationic metal can be adsorbed by the electrostatic force of interaction onto the negative surface charges of the ac surface the oxygen containing functional groups such as oh co and co fig 4 allow bonding with the positive charge of the mercury ion another possible interaction involves hydrogen bonding between acceptor and donor groups on the ac hg2 system 62 the ac containing numerous oxygen surface complexes are the potential and effective sites for hg2 removal the functional active sites of the ac as achieved from the ftir result showed that the oh co and co functional groups supported an increased binding of cationic hg2 ions to the ac surface the major adsorption mechanism of ac in the hg2 adsorption process is based on a complexation reaction where the hydroxyl carbonyl and alkoxy groups react with hg2 to form o 2hg coo 2hg and co 2hg the possible reaction mechanisms are as follows 63 17 2 oh hg 2 o 2 hg 2h 18 2 cooh hg 2 coo 2 hg 2h 19 2 coh hg 2 co 2 hg 2h 4 conclusions this study presented the performance of ac synthesized from the bamboo species of bambusa vulgaris striata as a natural and renewable resource by two stage chemical activation with a koh naoh mixture for hg2 removal an assembly of oxidation reduction reactions using the hydroxides played a key role in the pore framework development of the carbon matrix particle the largest surface area and total pore volume were 1108 m2 g and 0 634 cm3 g respectively this was achieved from an impregnation ratio of char to koh naoh mixture of 1 3 at 800 c the unique pore structure and functional active sites of the prepared lignocellulosic based ac promoted the high adsorption capacity of 312 7 mg g of hg2 using a continuous flow system at room temperature the thomas model equations adequately depicted the equilibrium and adsorption dynamic and kinetic data

13402,in conventional water treatment coagulation and flocculation stages play a very important role once they are related to the success of the subsequent processes among the techniques applied to analyze these stages analysis of images that aims to provide information related to the formed particles such as parameters of particle size distribution psd and fractal dimension df stands out thus this study aimed to compare the evolution of these parameters and the df along coagulation and flocculation processes for different chemical coagulants and different conditions it was verified that the parameter β1 of psd tends to increase during time indicating formation of larger particles until the establishment of its stabilization level it was also observed that for higher coagulant dosages and especially when turbidity in water was higher and ferric chloride and aluminium polychloride were used the parameters β1 of psd after initial growth stage decrease for later dynamic stabilization as for df it was concluded that there is an initial tendency of growing followed by a stabilization of its value during most of the flocculation process indicating that the structural organization of the floc is not necessarily linked to the variations in its size these conclusions can help further investigations and studies on coagulation flocculation processes in order to understand how flocs behave over time under the different chemicals used keywords coagulation and flocculation analysis of images particle size distribution fractal dimension 1 introduction regarding water supply treatment the issues concerning the high turbidity of untreated water in watercourses can be solved by generating improvements in both coagulation and flocculation processes 1 the success of these processes is closely related to the efficiency of the subsequent solid liquid separation stages 2 3 in these processes coagulation is responsible for particle destabilization 4 which occurs through the addition of a chemical coagulant under rapid velocity gradient usually around 800 s 1 2 coagulation can be defined as a physical chemical process that neutralizes electrical charges on particles surfaces and also reduces colloids electrical double layer repulsion forces this allows microparticles to arrange into larger particles 5 through collisions 6 chemicals such as ferric chloride aluminium chloride aluminium sulfate and ferric sulfate are widely used as coagulants in coagulation processes 7 the mentioned flocs are formed during flocculation processes which occur under slow mixing usually below 80s 1 particles interact due to their untidy movement caused by three main factors perikinetic interactions thermal energy orthokinetic interactions average velocity gradients and differential sedimentation different sedimentation velocities presented by particles regarding water supply treatment particles have dimensions that allow not considering perikinetic interactions due to that in these situations the interactions of particles are governed by orthokinetic interactions and differential sedimentation 2 supply water treatment control has great focus on flocculation once in this stage important changes on flocs characteristics including quantity shape size and mass occur directly involved in particles separation stages 3 4 8 flocculation time is an important parameter once longer time can cause larger flocs rupture on the other hand shorter time can cause inefficient formation of flocs 1 besides that it is important to mention that reversibility phenomena are observed during flocculation which means that aggregation is also followed by rupture of flocs which later regroup themselves 9 thus the development of flocs is controlled by these aggregation and rupture processes followed by new aggregation 10 the diameter of these particles is associated with the balancing between aggregation and rupture processes under shear forces on the suspension 1 analysis of aggregates dimensions is a method of evaluating the development of coagulation flocculation processes 4 in general three dimension particles are found on water presenting different physical and chemical characteristics besides irregular shape 11 through analysis of changes on shape and size it is possible to evaluate process efficiency 3 the use of indirect measures such as turbidity and sedimentation velocity in order to evaluate coagulation flocculation processes is not recommended once important information regarding the efficiency of the processes is suppressed 3 8 in this case the use of direct and independent measures such as particle size distribution psd is indicated 2 β1 represents psd and is related to the hegemony of particles of smaller sizes over particles of larger sizes thus the higher this value is the lower the hegemony of these smaller particles will be besides water treatment processes psd analysis is also used to diagram water courses quality and control and modeling of urban drainage systems providing information about particles structure 11 in order to calculate parameter β1 several dimensions related to the flocs formed can be used 11 besides the most usual ones such as diameter and area it is also common to use feret diameter to analyze flocculation development this measure can be described as the maximum distance between particles limits perpendicular to the measured direction 12 another way of analyzing these processes is through fractal dimension df df is a measure that represents the structure of flocs indicating how particles that have agglomerated to form a larger particle are organized it can be defined as the degree of efficiency in which the smaller particles are organized in order to complete the space according to the size of the floc 13 more compact structures have greater ranges of fractal dimensions 14 15 both psd and df parameters can be determined by means of image acquisition and treatment techniques obtained in simulations of coagulation flocculation processes flocs aggregation mechanisms determine their fractal dimension that means aggregates can have the same size but different structures organizations due to different arrangements during aggregation larger aggregates tend to have larger fractal dimensions once aggregation factors related to aggregates formation become more complex as the flocs size increases 6 flocs structure is also related to aggregation rupture processes and denser flocs are formed after flocs restructuration 4 therefore this study aimed to monitor the evolution of df and representative parameters of psd for three different coagulants through nine experiments conducted for each one using three water samples with different turbidity values and three dosages of chemical coagulant the goal was to observe how the dimensions vary over time under different conditions and how this behavior differs from one coagulant to another through a nonintrusive method this will help further studies on coagulation flocculation processes to understand how flocs behave over time under the different chemicals used 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental execution before conducting the experiments tests were performed in order to determine the dosages for each coagulant required to establish the prevalence of sweeping mechanisms during coagulation this observation was visual and the chosen dosage was based on the smaller values of reminiscent turbidity and on the coagulation flocculation diagrams designed by dutra 16 mendes 17 and gonçalves 18 for the experiments ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o aluminium polychloride inorganic polymer based on polyaluminium chloride and aluminium sulfate al2 so4 3 16h2o were used as coagulants chosen based on the fact that they are some of the most used chemicals in water treatment the products were diluted in water in order to obtain solutions with 2 mg fe3 ml of ferric chloride and 2 mg of al3 ml of the two other coagulants in addition 0 5 m naoh was also used to correct the ph of the water once the coagulation only occurs for certain values of hydrogen potential the water sample was prepared using kaolinite to provide turbidity the solution was stirred for 8 h followed by decanting for 12 h after which the supernatant material was removed this solution was then added to the distilled water until the desired turbidity values of 10 50 and 100 nephelometric turbidity units ntu were reached the jar test equipment was used to simulate coagulation flocculation and sedimentation processes the equipment consisted of six 2 l jars equipped with mixing palettes under common rotation in order to obtain the images of the flocs only one jar was used according to the need for the experiment apparatus a laser light plane of approximately 1 mm thickness was established and a nikon d5500 digital camera was installed perpendicular to it the camera was then connected to a computer and the images acquisition process was performed the procedure happened as it is described the water sample was prepared and two liters of water sample were transferred to the jar then the ph was corrected and the coagulant added the rapid mixing stage coagulation started under an average velocity gradient of 800 s 1 for 10 s and subsequently the flocculation step started under an average velocity gradient of 20 s 1 for 20 min the images were obtained at flocculation times of 1 3 5 10 15 and 20 min in the final ten seconds of each time as 4 pictures per second were obtained at the end there was a group of 40 images for each flocculation time 2 2 image processing initially the photos were cut in order to limit the figures to a rectangle located in the upper left part of the jar then the photos were processed using the imagej 1 52ª software in a simplified way the objective of this step was to highlight the flocs that were brighter the ones located on the light plane created by the laser through this process the photos were treated in order to facilitate the identification of the flocs obtained after that the flocs were marked and the software provided information about these particles including number of flocs and dimensions such as area and diameters 2 3 psd definition in order to define the psd the parameters area equivalent diameter calculated using the inverse formula of the circle area and feret diameter defined by the imagej software manual as the maximum distance between any two points along the selection limit 19 were used for each of these parameters the flocs were divided into 15 size classes and then the cumulative and relative frequencies of each of these classes were calculated 2 4 β1 and df definition after classifying the particles by size ranges to determine the psd the parameter β1 representative of the distribution was determined according to crittenden et al 20 in which the frequency distribution of the number of particles can be expressed as the concentration of this number as a function of the incremental fraction in size generally the frequency of particle distribution decreases as the diameter increases so the larger the particle diameter is the less frequently it occurs in the flocculation process and this relation usually follows the distribution equation in the form of a power function as seen in eq 1 1 dn d dp a dp β 1 n dp where a is the coefficient of the power equation dp the particle diameter dn the concentration of the number of particles in terms of incremental change in the particle diameters d dp the incremental change in the particle diameters and β1 the slope coefficient of the power equation obtained by applying log on both sides of eq 1 as in this study psd was defined according to three different parameters three β1 values were obtained for each time the parameter related to the equivalent diameter β1 deq the parameter related to the area β1 area and the parameter related to the feret diameter β1 feret the morphological structure of the flocs was characterized using the fractal dimension which is defined in two dimensional terms according to jin et al 21 by a potential relationship between the area of a particle as its characteristic length l and the dimension of the fractal area df in the current study fractal dimension calculated for the entire population of flocs of each time tf was represented by the slope coefficient of the line that best fits the distribution of the points of eq 2 2 log a s log l d f 3 results and discussion 3 1 ferric chloride fig 1 shows the evolution of the psd β1 parameters and the df over the flocculation time for ferric chloride the β1 parameters calculated from the equivalent diameter area and feret diameter follow a similar pattern in practically all experiment conditions there is an initial increase in these parameters values which occurs between the 1st and the 3rd minute during the initial minutes of flocculation particle aggregation prevails over rupture with maximum values achieved after around 10 min of rapid mixing thereafter the stabilization level is reached with little variation in these parameters values in which the forces of aggregation and rupture are equivalent in situations which there is a significant decrease in these parameters values it can be assumed that this happens due to the formation of larger flocs which even during flocculation the flocs tend to settle because of their high density the small decrease in these parameters values from a maximum point before reaching the stabilization level can be explained by the dynamics of aggregation and rupture of particles as observed in the works of bouyer et al 9 and he et al 10 df presented sharped increase until the first 5 min of flocculation presenting values almost stable from this time the particles initially less organized and more branched are organized into larger and more compact flocs which justifies the increase in df it is observed that the influence of turbidity on the curves is not well clear for instance it is observed that for β1 deq and β1 area larger flocs were found for 50 ntu followed by conditions in which 10 ntu water sample was used however for β1 feret there is a competition on the greater ranges of size that in the middle of the process is occupied by flocs formed with 10 ntu water sample later being replaced by flocs formed with 50 ntu water sample similar to that flocs formed in this situation are the ones with the largest values of df 3 2 aluminium polychloride fig 2 shows the evolution of the psd β1 parameters and the df over the flocculation time for aluminium polychloride the graphs of β1 parameters related to the equivalent diameter and area presented a very similar behavior justified by the fact that the dimensions are related through the function of the area of a circle using the diameter as a calculation parameter it is observed that the values of these parameters have a similar evolutionary pattern for the different conditions over time the β1 values tend to increase in the first minutes indicating that there is a migration of particles from classes of smaller sizes to classes of larger sizes which means that these particles increase and therefore there is a decrease in the concentration of flocs in the first classes of size on the other hand it is clear that in most cases from the 5th minute on there is a decline in these parameters values indicating that the smaller classes return to be in greater hegemony this can be explained by the fact that when agglomerating into flocs of larger sizes particles tend to have their masses increased and therefore their density also increases making them from a certain moment start to settle heading towards the bottom of the jar this makes particles of smaller sizes and lower density remain in greater quantity in the uppermost part of the jar and therefore are captured by the camera that monitors the process regarding the graph that represents the evolution of parameter β1 feret there are great similarities between the different conditions of experiments there is a migration of particles from classes of smaller sizes to classes of larger sizes expressed by the increase in β1 which reaches its peak in up to 10 min of flocculation after reaching its maximum value β1 begins to decline indicating that the particles of larger sizes and densities are directed to the bottom of the jar after that particles belonging to the first classes of size are the ones that remain in more quantities on the submerged part of the fluid the evolution of df happens in a very similar way for all conditions it is observed that over time df increases reaching a peak that for the highest values of turbidity and higher doses of coagulant happens at the third minute this peak is reached in the first two experiment conditions after 10 min possibly indicating a greater difficulty on the formation of flocs in low turbidity waters after reaching this peak the value of fractal dimension remains practically stable as stated by x li et al 15 and t li et al 14 the larger the fractal dimension the more compact the floc is which means that it is less porous indicating a better organization of the smaller particles that agglomerated to form these final flocs it is also observed that the evolution during coagulation time for aluminium polychloride is similar to the ones observed for aluminium polychloride although the influence of turbidity is not clear as in the first chemical however for ferric chloride the competition on the larger ranges of sizes is observed for water samples of 50 and 100 ntu on the first two graphs and for all the three turbidites considered in the case of β1 feret at least until the middle of the process after that 50 ntu water sample flocs remain the larger ones in case of df flocs formed with the highest turbidity also represent the larger fractal dimensions 3 3 aluminium sulfate fig 3 shows the evolution of the psd β1 parameters and the df over the flocculation time for aluminium sulfate the graphs obtained for parameter β1 from the use of aluminium sulfate as a coagulant showed some discrepancy the parameters evolved in a less standardized way making it difficult to define the mechanisms that caused these variations a possible explanation for these phenomena is the limitation of the image acquisition method for use with this particular coagulant in addition another possible justification is that the coagulation with aluminium sulfate happens through more complex mechanisms that can vary according to the combination of coagulant dosage and turbidity that is one can suppose that from these different combinations differences in the flocs formation and growth are found however for this inference further investigation would be necessary some differences can be found on the evolution of fractal dimension in the experiments made with aluminium sulfate for the first two conditions with turbidity of 10 ntu and dosages of 2 5 and 5 mg l of al3 the maximum df value is reached only in the 10th minute for the other 7 situations the peak is reached just before in the 3 and 5 min of flocculation this happens due to the higher turbidity values of the water sample in addition to the higher concentration of the coagulant combined with the turbidity of 10 ntu in the 3rd experiment in which this water was used thus there was ease in the agglomeration of particles and their structural organization thus increasing the fractal dimension values upon reaching its maximum value df then remains practically stable until the end of the process although less patterns were observed for aluminium sulfate as coagulant it is clear the influence of turbidity in most cases flocs formed under higher turbidites represent the larger dimensions 4 conclusions this work aimed to analyze the behavior of psd parameters and df under some conditions of experiment it was found that the parameter β1 in general presents low values in the first minute of flocculation which indicates a greater hegemony of particles of small sizes since the process is still in its beginning then it is observed that this value tends to increase which indicates a decrease in this hegemony and therefore suggests agglomeration of smaller particles in larger flocs in some cases reversibility processes are observed as stated by he et al 10 and bouyer et al 9 it is observed that for higher dosages and mainly higher turbidity values flocculation process happens more quickly that is the increase of parameter β1 happens faster indicating ease of formation of these flocs it is also noticed that after a certain period of flocculation the values of β1 parameters tend to decline this suggests sedimentation of flocs of larger sizes and greater densities which returns to a greater hegemony of particles of smaller sizes submerged in the water these mentioned patterns are better observed for ferric chloride and polyaluminum sulfate flocs on the other hand for aluminium sulfate no evolutionary patterns were observed for parameter β1 when the different conditions of experiment were compared giving rise to the opportunity for further investigation regarding the growth evolution of flocs for this coagulant df shows a very similar behavior for the three coagulant chemicals used this value tends to increase in the first minutes of flocculation and later it tends to remain stable this indicates that the structure of these flocs is formed at the beginning and it remains during the process not necessarily related to the fluctuation in the size of these flocs it is also observed that larger flocs tend to have larger df as affirmed by vahedi gorczyca 6 for further studies investigations on evolutionary patterns of aluminium sulfate flocs during coagulation flocculation processes should be carried also it is recommended to investigate the turbidity influence on flocs dimension finally these conclusions can help further investigations in order to improve coagulation and flocculation

the increase in df it is observed that the influence of turbidity on the curves is not well clear for instance it is observed that for β1 deq and β1 area larger flocs were found for 50 ntu followed by conditions in which 10 ntu water sample was used however for β1 feret there is a competition on the greater ranges of size that in the middle of the process is occupied by flocs formed with 10 ntu water sample later being replaced by flocs formed with 50 ntu water sample similar to that flocs formed in this situation are the ones with the largest values of df 3 2 aluminium polychloride fig 2 shows the evolution of the psd β1 parameters and the df over the flocculation time for aluminium polychloride the graphs of β1 parameters related to the equivalent diameter and area presented a very similar behavior justified by the fact that the dimensions are related through the function of the area of a circle using the diameter as a calculation parameter it is observed that the values of these parameters have a similar evolutionary pattern for the different conditions over time the β1 values tend to increase in the first minutes indicating that there is a migration of particles from classes of smaller sizes to classes of larger sizes which means that these particles increase and therefore there is a decrease in the concentration of flocs in the first classes of size on the other hand it is clear that in most cases from the 5th minute on there is a decline in these parameters values indicating that the smaller classes return to be in greater hegemony this can be explained by the fact that when agglomerating into flocs of larger sizes particles tend to have their masses increased and therefore their density also increases making them from a certain moment start to settle heading towards the bottom of the jar this makes particles of smaller sizes and lower density remain in greater quantity in the uppermost part of the jar and therefore are captured by the camera that monitors the process regarding the graph that represents the evolution of parameter β1 feret there are great similarities between the different conditions of experiments there is a migration of particles from classes of smaller sizes to classes of larger sizes expressed by the increase in β1 which reaches its peak in up to 10 min of flocculation after reaching its maximum value β1 begins to decline indicating that the particles of larger sizes and densities are directed to the bottom of the jar after that particles belonging to the first classes of size are the ones that remain in more quantities on the submerged part of the fluid the evolution of df happens in a very similar way for all conditions it is observed that over time df increases reaching a peak that for the highest values of turbidity and higher doses of coagulant happens at the third minute this peak is reached in the first two experiment conditions after 10 min possibly indicating a greater difficulty on the formation of flocs in low turbidity waters after reaching this peak the value of fractal dimension remains practically stable as stated by x li et al 15 and t li et al 14 the larger the fractal dimension the more compact the floc is which means that it is less porous indicating a better organization of the smaller particles that agglomerated to form these final flocs it is also observed that the evolution during coagulation time for aluminium polychloride is similar to the ones observed for aluminium polychloride although the influence of turbidity is not clear as in the first chemical however for ferric chloride the competition on the larger ranges of sizes is observed for water samples of 50 and 100 ntu on the first two graphs and for all the three turbidites considered in the case of β1 feret at least until the middle of the process after that 50 ntu water sample flocs remain the larger ones in case of df flocs formed with the highest turbidity also represent the larger fractal dimensions 3 3 aluminium sulfate fig 3 shows the evolution of the psd β1 parameters and the df over the flocculation time for aluminium sulfate the graphs obtained for parameter β1 from the use of aluminium sulfate as a coagulant showed some discrepancy the parameters evolved in a less standardized way making it difficult to define the mechanisms that caused these variations a possible explanation for these phenomena is the limitation of the image acquisition method for use with this particular coagulant in addition another possible justification is that the coagulation with aluminium sulfate happens through more complex mechanisms that can vary according to the combination of coagulant dosage and turbidity that is one can suppose that from these different combinations differences in the flocs formation and growth are found however for this inference further investigation would be necessary some differences can be found on the evolution of fractal dimension in the experiments made with aluminium sulfate for the first two conditions with turbidity of 10 ntu and dosages of 2 5 and 5 mg l of al3 the maximum df value is reached only in the 10th minute for the other 7 situations the peak is reached just before in the 3 and 5 min of flocculation this happens due to the higher turbidity values of the water sample in addition to the higher concentration of the coagulant combined with the turbidity of 10 ntu in the 3rd experiment in which this water was used thus there was ease in the agglomeration of particles and their structural organization thus increasing the fractal dimension values upon reaching its maximum value df then remains practically stable until the end of the process although less patterns were observed for aluminium sulfate as coagulant it is clear the influence of turbidity in most cases flocs formed under higher turbidites represent the larger dimensions 4 conclusions this work aimed to analyze the behavior of psd parameters and df under some conditions of experiment it was found that the parameter β1 in general presents low values in the first minute of flocculation which indicates a greater hegemony of particles of small sizes since the process is still in its beginning then it is observed that this value tends to increase which indicates a decrease in this hegemony and therefore suggests agglomeration of smaller particles in larger flocs in some cases reversibility processes are observed as stated by he et al 10 and bouyer et al 9 it is observed that for higher dosages and mainly higher turbidity values flocculation process happens more quickly that is the increase of parameter β1 happens faster indicating ease of formation of these flocs it is also noticed that after a certain period of flocculation the values of β1 parameters tend to decline this suggests sedimentation of flocs of larger sizes and greater densities which returns to a greater hegemony of particles of smaller sizes submerged in the water these mentioned patterns are better observed for ferric chloride and polyaluminum sulfate flocs on the other hand for aluminium sulfate no evolutionary patterns were observed for parameter β1 when the different conditions of experiment were compared giving rise to the opportunity for further investigation regarding the growth evolution of flocs for this coagulant df shows a very similar behavior for the three coagulant chemicals used this value tends to increase in the first minutes of flocculation and later it tends to remain stable this indicates that the structure of these flocs is formed at the beginning and it remains during the process not necessarily related to the fluctuation in the size of these flocs it is also observed that larger flocs tend to have larger df as affirmed by vahedi gorczyca 6 for further studies investigations on evolutionary patterns of aluminium sulfate flocs during coagulation flocculation processes should be carried also it is recommended to investigate the turbidity influence on flocs dimension finally these conclusions can help further investigations in order to improve coagulation and flocculation

13403,this study addressed the need to better understand process engineering aspects of zeolite lta synthesis from waste materials in particular concepts such as zeolite yield recycling of mother liquor softening performance and regeneration of calcium loaded zeolite lta were evaluated zeolite lta was made via alkaline fusion pre activation of alum sludge and waste glass at 700 c for 2 h followed by hydrothermal treatment at 80 c for 5 h increasing the sio2 al2o3 ratio of the feed mixture from 1 to 2 3 doubled the yield of zeolite lta to 67 consequently a feed mixture of composition 9 2na2o al2o3 2 3sio2 276h2o was adopted for subsequent tests recycling of the alkali and other dissolved species in the mother liquor improved zeolite lta crystallinity 80 to 86 wt and calcium exchange capacity from 73 to 78 mg g implementation of recycling depends upon the cost benefit analysis regarding energy demand for evaporation of mother liquor relative to savings by more effectively using the excess alkali reagent calcium uptake on zeolite lta was reduced when treating simulated river water 65 5 mg ca2 g due to competitive ion exchange regeneration of calcium loaded zeolite lta required a nacl solution with a molarity of at least 2 m a notable reduction of calcium loading capacity was detected after several loading regeneration cycles the outlined technology proposed a feasible and scalable approach to recycling of wastes producing a commodity which could be successfully used locally by the water treatment plant as a water softener graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water treatment sludge waste glass mother liquor zeolite a hardness removal regeneration 1 introduction hardness is importance with respect to water quality the term hardness is generally linked to concentrations of dissolved calcium and magnesium cations expressed as milligrams of caco3 equivalent per litre 1 water hardness is classified in terms as soft 60 mg caco3 l moderately hard 60 120 mg caco3 l hard 120 180 caco3 l and very hard 180 caco3 l 1 2 indeed there are examples where water hardness can surpass values of 500 mg caco3 l 3 4 elevated water hardness is a challenge both for the general population and industry calcium and magnesium insoluble salts have a propensity to precipitate on the inner surfaces of pipes and water treatment or heating equipment i e scaling common consequences include impedance of water flow in distribution systems and a reduction in heating efficiency moreover a high level of hardness impairs organoleptic characteristics of drinking water and aggravates general life quality due to formation of soap scum and decrease of lifespan effectiveness of appliances 2 5 6 consumption of very hard water has been considered as a contributory factor to the development of eczema diabetes and neural disease 1 2 7 more recent studies reported a correlation between high groundwater hardness and the occurrence of chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology ckdu 8 10 removal of water hardness is also a common occurrence in our daily lives as laundry powders comprise of materials which soften the water and allow the detergent to operate successfully 11 a number of techniques have been used to reduce hardness from water sources including chemical softening 12 nanofiltration 13 deionization 14 and ion exchange 6 chemical softening using lime or sodium carbonate is relatively inexpensive but it generates sludge whereas membrane processes raise the intricacy and operational cost of the water treatment 15 membranes can also remove calcium and magnesium cations below minimum required concentrations of 10 and 20 mg l respectively which increases the risk of corrosion 5 16 alternatively ion exchange using zeolite lta na12 alo2 12 sio2 12 27h2o has been used for many years due to low cost simplicity capacity and selectivity factors 17 18 zeolite lta is extensively used as a water softener in water wastewater treatment and detergent industries since 1974 and its use is growing annually 18 19 studies have focused on hardness removal from waters of high salinity for seawater and reverse osmosis ro concentrates 20 21 as well as reverse osmosis permeate 22 brackish and groundwater 23 zeolite lta does not occur naturally and is typically hydrothermally synthesized from high purity alkaline solutions of sodium silicate and sodium aluminate 24 a current trend is the use of natural aluminosilicates or waste materials including rice husk 25 coal fly ash 26 alum sludge 27 and a range of others 18 alum sludge is of particular interest to the drinking water treatment dwt sector as this waste is produced from use of aluminium coagulants employed to remove suspended solids and natural organic matter alum sludge represents 1 to 3 by volume of the treated water which amounts to approximately 10 000 tons day worldwide 28 29 typically alum sludge is disposed to landfill which is costly and a potential environmental problem however this waste may be potentially recycled as zeolite lta as the major components are alumina and silica 30 31 using alum sludge for lta zeolite synthesis in this case is of particular benefit due to produced material can be used locally at water treatment plant reducing both raw water hardness and water treatment costs while conventional hydrothermal synthesis of zeolite lta from alum sludge was relatively ineffective using fusion pre treatment resulted in material of higher purity and crystallinity 32 33 recently rozhkovskaya et al 34 examined the feasibility of alum sludge conversion into zeolite lta by fusion assisted hydrothermal method for water treatment applications single phase zeolite lta of 97 crystallinity was made with a calcium exchange capacity of 209 75 mg caco3 g one limitation was the use of na2sio3 5h2o to adjust sio2 al2o3 ratio whereas using silica rich waste is preferred from an environmental point of view hence why anuwattana and khummongkol 32 synthesized zeolite lta with 64 crystallinity and 3 sodalite impurity using cupola slag and alum sludge as starting materials with respect to a suitable source of wast silica glass cullet is a silica rich municipal solid waste available worldwide annual landfill disposal of this waste reached 0 47 and 7 million tonnes in australia and the usa respectively in 2017 35 36 therefore a need exists to develop alternative recycling strategies for glass cullet as the current recovery rate is still relatively low converting waste glass into zeolite lta has thus been tested 37 with some studies using microwave irradiation 38 and fusion assisted hydrothermal synthesis 39 40 nevertheless a single phase zeolite with high yield and cation exchange capacity was not obtained it was evident that several investigations of the chemistry of zeolite lta synthesis from waste material have been reported 18 however translation of the chemical understanding to issues important from a process engineering point of view is limited for example operationally it is desirable to reduce energy consumption relating to heating of materials pumping cooling and drying in addition minimizing the cost of feed materials is also critical mother liquor recycling is essentially compulsory in industry to recover valuable feedstock material yet it is majorly overlooked in published zeolite articles 41 the mother liquor is the liquid component collected by filtration of the zeolite containing sludge following the high temperature crystallisation step mother liquor typically contains high concentrations of sodium hydroxide aluminates and silicates 42 additionally softening performance of zeolite lta made from waste materials needs to be analysed in the context of solutions comprising of competing ions and not simple solutions of for example dissolved calcium chloride 43 process economics also dictates that following loading of hardness cations on zeolite lta than an effective method is discovered for regeneration of the exchange sites 44 in accord with knowledge gaps identified this study aimed to resolve process engineering issues associated with manufacture high quality zeolite lta from alum sludge and waste glass and examine key water treatment performance metrics such as softening effectiveness for river water and subsequent regeneration of exhausted zeolite the hypothesis was if engineering aspects of zeolite lta synthesis from alum sludge and waste glass and performance are resolved then the drinking water treatment industry may reduce operational costs and environmental impact due to the use of local wastes on site specific research questions to support the hypothesis were as follows 1 which synthesis parameters produce the highest quality zeolite lta at lowest cost 2 what is the influence of mother liquor use on zeolite lta crystallisation 3 how effective is zeolite lta derived from alum sludge and waste glass for hardness removal from naturally hard river water 4 what is the optimum regeneration strategy of exhausted zeolite over several ion exchange cycles the experimental testing was conducted at bench scale in order to optimize zeolite lta synthesis several reaction parameters were altered including sio2 al2o3 molar ratio of initial aluminosilicate gel and time of hydrothermal reaction quantitative x ray diffraction analysis was employed to confirm the purity and specific amount of crystalline material in the sample performance of waste derived zeolite lta in terms of hardness removal from simulated river water was examined on the basis of equilibrium studies the experiments were conducted using simulated high harness river water since there is the advantage of using the technology at drinking water treatment plants that produce large quantities of waste alum sludge in the areas of high hardness raw water however the technology is also potentially applicable for the treatment of groundwaters with high hardness the proposed idea promoted the environmental acceptability of zeolite lta synthesis by recycling two abundant waste materials simultaneously and addressed various practical considerations 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials dewatered alum sludge as was collected from the mount crosby west bank water treatment plant queensland australia the sludge was initially dried overnight in an oven at 105 c waste glass was separated from municipal solid wastes produced in queensland before being used for zeolite lta synthesis alum sludge and glass cullet were ground in a cr steel ball mill to obtain a fine powder characteristics and chemical composition of the alum sludge employed has been described previously 34 it consisted of 8 85 wt of sio 2 and 30 09 wt of al 2 o 3 with loss of ignition value of 57 79 analytical grade naoh 99 mini pearls were purchased from chem supply commercial grade salts nh4cl nacl caco3 nabo7 10h20 cuso4 kcl mgcl2 6h20 naf nano3 and cacl2 were also purchased from chem supply 2 2 water composition river water with a total hardness of 295 mg caco3 l was simulated based on water quality data from london england 45 the composition was derived from a report for the dartford south supply zone the location of water treatment plant provided by thames water utilities ltd based on the data collected throughout 2019 to reproduce the chemical composition of river water the following chemicals were diluted in 5 l of deionized di water 0 0003 g of nh4cl 0 3376 g of cacl2 0 0244 g of nacl 1 0923 g of caco3 0 0022 g of

of the simulated river water is presented in table 1 2 3 zeolite lta synthesis 2 3 1 alkaline fusion of waste materials alkaline fusion of individual waste materials instead of a mixture of aluminium and silica waste was completed based upon published data 46 alum sludge and waste glass were fused separately with naoh with a mass ratio 1 2 waste naoh in a nickel crucible at 700 c for 2 h in an ashing furnace aaf 11 3 by carbolite gero after cooling in a desiccator at room temperature the fused products were ground in a cr steel ball mill and sealed in a plastic container 2 3 2 hydrothermal synthesis of fused waste materials to synthesize zeolite lta from the fused wastes the first stage was addition of the fused alum sludge in equal amounts of deionized di water in two separate brandtech vitlab pmp erlenmeyer flasks at room temperature subsequently the aqueous fused glass mixture was slowly poured into the alum sludge solution and agitated with a magnetic stirrer at room temperature until homogenised the formed thick gel was then aged for 16 h at room temperature in a sealed flask 27 the final molar chemical composition of the mixture was 4xna2o al2o3 xsio2 120xh2o where x represented the sio2 al2o3 molar ratio from 1 to 3 the na2o sio2 molar ratio of 4 was fixed while the h2o na2o molar ratio of 30 was already optimized from a previous study 46 final zeolite

24 naoh crystallisation of zeolite was performed by hydrothermal synthesis in a teflon lined vessel under static conditions at 80 c while the time was varied from 1 to 9 h once reaction was complete the bottle was removed from the heating source and cooled to room temperature the solid product was separated from the mother liquor using vacuum filtration and after the mother liquor was removed the solid was washed with deionized water until filtrate ph was below 9 the resultant solids were finally dried in an oven at 105 c overnight 2 4 recycling of mother liquor once mother liquor was collected it was analysed by icp oes to determine concentrations of dissolved ions then the liquid was transferred to an oven and evaporated at 105 c while water vapour could be condensed and reused at the hydrothermal synthesis and or washing stage resulting solids were returned back to the alum sludge fusion process an as naoh mass ratio of 1 2 was maintained by addition of additional commercial grade naoh alkaline fusion and hydrothermal treatment at previously optimized conditions were carried out as described in sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 three consecutive cycles of liquor regeneration were performed 2 5 equilibrium ion exchange studies to assess cation exchange capacity of zeolite lta equilibrium isotherm studies were conducted the constant concentration method was employed as this has been demonstrated to be more precise compared to the constant sorbent mass approach 47 a number of zeolite samples with mass ranging from 0 03 to 0 6 g were weighed and put into 250 ml nalgene bottles then 200 ml of cacl2 solution 99 mg ca2 l or 248 mg caco3 l or simulated river water was added sealed bottles were then placed in an incubator innova 42r new brunswick scientific and agitated for 72 h at a fixed temperature of 30 0 1 c once reaction was complete supernatants were analysed as described in section 2 8 the amount of calcium exchanged at equilibrium and removal efficiency were determined according to eqs 5 6 5 q e c o c e v m 6 r c o c e c o 100 where q e is the quantity of cations exchanged at the time t mg g c o c e the initial and equilibrium concentrations of the cation mg l v is the volume of the solution l m is mass of the zeolite dosed g and r is the removal efficiency in this study the brouers sotolongo isotherm bsi was used to fit the ion exchange equilibrium data the bsi mode was pointed out to provide an excellent fit for ion exchange process in heterogeneous systems 48 49 eq 7 7 q e q max 1 exp k w c e α where qmax is the maximum loading of cations on the zeolite mg g kw is the bsi constant expressed as kf qmax kf is a freundlich constant and α is the measure of sorption energy distribution 2 6 regeneration of exhausted zeolite lta to regenerate exhausted zeolite the preferred concentration of nacl solution was first determined the first step in this process was loading of 0 2 g of zeolite lta with calcium by agitation with 40 ml of 1 g ca2 l solution as cacl2 overnight at room temperature the dose of zeolite corresponded to the optimum driving force of ion exchange 200 mg ca2 g zeolite determined in the equilibrium study once ion exchange was complete the liquid phase was separated from the solids by centrifugation and analysed by icp oes to determine final calcium and sodium concentrations after the solids were washed with ethanol 3 times to remove residual water the material was dried in a laboratory oven for 30 mins at 80 c the second step was to mix resultant ca zeolite lta with 40 ml of either 0 1 0 5 1 2 or 3 m nacl solution and agitate overnight at room temperature then the solution was separated and also analysed by icp oes for calcium and sodium concentrations ca recovery was calculated according to eq 8 8 r c reg c o c 1 100 where c o initial calcium concentration mg l c 1 remaining calcium concentration in the solution after loading stage mg l and c reg calcium concentration released after regeneration mg l once the regeneration conditions were identified several cycles of zeolite lta loading and regeneration were conducted using simulated river water the experiments were averaged over 4 repetitions to ensure reproducibility the methodology for one regeneration cycle was as follows 1 0 026 g of zeolite lta was mixed with 50 ml of simulated river water 2 stirred overnight at room temperature 3 solution was separated by centrifugation and analysed by icp oes for calcium and sodium concentrations 4 solids were washed with ethanol 3 times and dried in a laboratory oven for 20 min at 80 c 5 ca lta zeolite was mixed with 50 ml of 2 m nacl solution 6 repeat steps 2 to 4 2 7 characterization of solids 2 7 1 quantitative x ray diffraction xrdq the crystalline and amorphous content of the powder samples were analysed using the quantitative powder x ray diffraction qxrd method the patterns were collected with a d8 advance powder diffractometer bruker germany using cokα radiation λ 1 789 å at a scan range between 2 and 90 2θ with a scan speed of 1 5 2θ min with a 2θ step size of 0 015 all patterns were collected using variable divergence slit which enhanced relative peak intensity at large 2θ values to determine the crystalline and amorphous content of the materials the internal standard method was applied by micronizing a powder of unknown nature with 10 of corundum as a spike phase then xrd patterns were refined by rietveld structure refinement using topas total pattern analysis solution version 6 software by bruker 50 final weight percentage of phases was calculated as an average from two repeat experiments 2 7 2 x ray fluorescence spectroscopy xrf the chemical composition of the as received waste materials fused waste and zeolite product were analysed by x ray fluorescence spectroscopy xrf using an axios fast simultaneous x ray fluorescence spectrometer malvern panalytical uk 2 7 3 scanning electron microscopy sem scanning electron microscopy imaging was conducted using a jeol 7001f scanning electron microscope japan sample preparation included ultrasonic treatment of samples in 99 ethanol for 10 min in order to separate clusters of crystals following this procedure three drops of the ethanol sample suspension were put on a specimen stub the samples were carbon coated 10 nm thick in order to improve conductivity of the samples and thus contrast of images 2 8 solution analysis using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes to measure concentrations of cations solutions were filtered using 0 45um syringe filter to remove any residual solids spiked with 0 2 ml 70 hno3 and analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer perkinelmer optima 8300 dv usa aqueous samples were diluted using an auto diluter microlab 600 hamilton usa by addition of nitric acid 2 5 calibration of the icp oes was achieved by using calibration standards from australian chemical reagents 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis process optimization 3 1 1 influence of sio2 al2o3 molar ratio on zeolite lta crystallinity optimisation of synthesis recipe is a crucial stage when making zeolite from waste materials due to their complex composition it was previously claimed that the presence of impurities in zeolite precursors might be a negative factor for nucleation of aluminosilicate gels 51 while for example organic matters impede zeolite crystallisation transition metal cations have a strong electrolytic effect on gel formation which may cause alteration of a synthesis pathway with a following crystallisation of an undesired zeolite phase 27 52 to investigate the effect of sio2 al2o3 molar ratio upon crystallisation of zeolite lta from fused alum sludge and waste glass the starting composition of aluminosilicate gels was fixed as 4xna2o al2o3 xsio2 120xh2o where x was altered from 1 to 3 fig 1 the original xrd patterns of the samples from which the quantitative amounts of crystalline zeolite are presented in supplementary fig a 1 to investigate the effect of sio2 al2o3 molar ratio upon crystallisation of zeolite lta from fused alum sludge and waste glass the starting composition of aluminosilicate gels was fixed as 4xna2o al2o3 xsio2 120xh2o where x was altered from 1 to 3 fig 1 the original xrd patterns of the samples from which the quantitative amounts of crystalline zeolite are presented in supplementary fig a 1 the lowest sio2 al2o3 ratio of 1 resulted in zeolite lta with 79 wt of crystalline material increase of sio2 al2o3 ratio up to 1 5 slightly elevated this value to 84 albeit raising the sio2 al2o3 molar ratio further decreased the amount of crystalline zeolite lta concomitantly zeolite x which is a faujasite type zeolite was formed when sio2 al2o3 was 2 5 or greater previous studies have also demonstrated formation of faujasite instead of zeolite lta zeolite at sio2 al2o3 values 2 50 53 formation of d4r units prevails in low silica systems which promote crystallisation of zeolite lta 54 while fau consists of larger double six membered units d6r which imply a higher amount of dissolved silica was required 55 yields of zeolites are mainly not provided in academic publications yet as can be seen from fig 1 the trend is not the same as the amount of crystalline zeolite lta usually zeolite lta producers operate with a slight excess of alumina species in the gel 1 8 0 2 as this ensures that highly crystalline and relatively pure zeolite lta is manufactured 56 the data presented in fig 1 was in agreement with the commercial process in that not only was the highest zeolite lta crystallinity formed at sio2 al2o3 values 2 but also due to silica unavailability and consequently yield values the sio2 al2o3 values should be 1 5 from the zeolite lta formula na12 alo2 12 sio2 12 27h2o a sio2 al2o3 ratio 2 maybe expected to give the best zeolite yield however in the current system derived from alum and glass wastes zeolite lta yield peaked at sio2 al2o3 2 3 this fact can tentatively be ascribed to the presence of impurities in the initial aluminosilicate gel an idea consistent with previous synthesis of low silica zeolites from impure sources 34 51 further increase of silica led to a substantial reduction in zeolite yield which was a consequence of production of non diffracting materials and zeolite x 57 3 1 2 optimization of reaction time on zeolite lta formation in the zeolite manufacturing sector minimization of reaction time while maintain zeolite lta purity is important in relation to process economics fig 2 shows the amount of crystalline zeolite lta formed as a function of hydrothermal synthesis time notably within the first hour no zeolite lta was detected and only amorphous material was present nevertheless in industry high purity zeolite lta can routinely be made in less than an hour and in the best case a matter of minutes 58 an important parameter here is the time taken to heat the reactant mixture to reaction temperature in this case the gel components were added at room temperature and placed in a teflon lined reactor which was placed in an oven due to heat transfer limitations the time taken to reach 80 c may easily be 1 h or more in contrast zeolite lta manufacturers normally pre heat the sodium aluminate and sodium silicate solutions to ca 60 to 80 c 59 additionally it is recommended to rapidly raise the temperature to reaction temperature as soon as possible after gel creation a reaction time of 5 h resulted in optimal production of crystalline zeolite lta 80 wt whereas above this reaction time a reduction in the quantity of zeolite lta was observed along with creation of the more thermodynamically stable sodalite such behaviour was consistent with previous understanding of the zeolite lta synthesis system 57 moreover after prolong exposure metastable crystals of lta zeolite tend to dissolve in hot concentrated alkali solution which consequently causes increase in amorphous content 60 it is emphasised that overall reaction time may be reduced by adjusting the h2o na2o ratio as this is thought to be the most important factor in relation to the reaction time required to make zeolite lta 56 a lesser but significant means of controlling the reaction time is the na2o sio2 ratio 57 for instance in the example illustrated in fig 2 the h2o na2o was 30 typical range 10 to 35 and na2o sio2 ratio 4 typically 1 to 2 5 57 therefore decrease in the h2o na2o ratio to 25 or 30 may be productive in terms of reduction of reaction time to further investigate the impact of reaction time upon zeolite lta crystallisation from alum sludge and waste glass at 80 c sem micrographs of the products were collected fig 3 in general sem data was in agreement with the quantitative xrd data shown in fig 2 the first hour of hydrothermal reaction at 80 c fig 3a was found to be a nucleation stage without crystalline material detected further increase in reaction time led to formation of typical cubic crystals of zeolite lta at the optimum reaction time of 5 h particles with truncated edges and smooth surface were observed fig 3c bevelled edges of zeolite particles are attributed to high alkalinity of the starting aluminosilicate gel as was shown previously 61 62 notably mainly single crystals were formed without twinning or intergrowth which ensured larger surface area and thus should exhibit a positive effect on cation exchange capacity extension of hydrothermal time beyond the optimum caused gradual dissolution of zeolite lta crystals and ultimately transformation of the cubic morphology of zeolite lta into sodalite of thread ball morphology fig 3e 3 2 regeneration of the mother liquor after the crystallisation stage the product zeolite is normally separated from the mother liquor in order to recover valuable excess sodium hydroxide and other species such as aluminates 63 for example garcía et al 53 found that high purity zeolite lta was made when they used mother liquor to dissolve the aluminium hydroxide starting material it was noted that the mother liquor probably contained zeolite seeds which accelerated the nucleation of zeolite lta therefore a mother liquor recycling approach was enacted in this study as this was the situation which simulated industry processes fig 4 due to fact that solid sodium hydroxide was used in the fusion stage of this study the first step was evaporation of the mother liquor recovered from the first synthesis cycle the resultant salts were then used for the fusion of alum sludge to partially substitute for naoh silica and alumina in the system in order to avoid a fluctuation of sodium concentration the experiments were conducted in a controlled environment using the same sodium content in each test fig 5 presents quantitative xrd data and calcium exchange capacity of zeolite lta synthesized after several consecutive mother liquor recycling tests the crystalline consent of zeolite lta was slightly increased from 80 to 86 wt after 3 experiments wherein mother liquor was recycled calcium exchange capacity accordingly increased from 73 to 78 mg ca2 g after the 3rd cycle which was in agreement with the study by lin et al 42 it was surmised that the collected solids after the mother liquor evaporation stage contained residual silica and alumina species which facilitated zeolite nucleation in addition to excess alkali 42 64 however the reported studies investigated mother liquor recycling in liquid form whereas this study provided evidence that residual silica and alumina remained after evaporation of the liquor promoted zeolite lta crystallisation even after alkali fusion treatment sem images were also collected in order to discover whether the mother liquor recycling process changed the shape and size of the zeolite lta fig 6 inspection of zeolite morphology revealed well defined cubic crystals attributed to zeolite lta particles with smooth surface bevelled edges and minor twinning were observed in each image in contrast to earlier findings 42 65 zeolite particle size slightly increased each cycle as did the uniformity of lta crystals again this observation indicated a positive effect of residual silica and alumina from the mother liquor on zeolite nucleation 3 3 ion exchange equilibrium studies of calcium ions with zeolite lta to study the performance of zeolite lta made from waste materials as a water softener equilibrium tests were carried out using pure calcium chloride solution and simulated hard river water of similar calcium concentration ca 99 mg ca2 l focus was made on calcium removal due to the fact it is usually the most prevalent alkaline earth ion in natural ground and river waters 2 equilibrium isotherm profiles for both the simple calcium chloride solution and river water are compared in fig 7 from the data it was seen that calcium removal efficiency was higher from pure cacl2 solution despite similar initial zeolite and calcium concentration introduction of competing ions decreased calcium removal capacity by 10 from a maximum loading of 73 mg ca2 g in pure cacl2 solution to 65 5 mg ca2 g in model river water the plateau in the data points of calcium uptake in each case implied that isotherm test conditions were appropriate and that the calcium exchange with zeolite lta was favourable 66 to gain a deeper understanding of the ion exchange process in simulated river water analysis of exchange stoichiometry and uptake of competitive ions was conducted fig 8 inspection of the experimental data for ion exchange stoichiometry in fig 8a revealed a general linear relationship between loaded calcium and released sodium ions notably at the higher calcium loadings there appeared to be sodium ions ejected from the zeolite lta which were not simply due to ion exchange phenomena this observation may suggest that a small amount of sodium hydroxide may be in the zeolite pores which was dislodged when the calcium ions sorbed on the zeolite lta fig 8b indicated that the selectivity series was k mg2 ca2 the affinity of lta zeolite towards calcium over magnesium was shown in literature 44 67 the removal efficiency of magnesium and calcium reached 97 and 99 respectively at the highest zeolite lta dosage of 3 g l however according to the national institute of public health czech republic 5 residual a calcium concentration of ca 50 mg l in the drinking water supply is desired therefore 50 calcium removal at a zeolite lta dosage of 0 7 g l was sufficient to fulfil municipal water quality requirements overall this data indicated that calcium and magnesium could be simultaneously removed from naturally hard river water using zeolite lta derived from alum sludge and waste glass 3 4 regeneration strategy for calcium loaded zeolite lta in practice zeolites need to be regenerated once they have become loaded with calcium ions due to practical and economic considerations 68 69 to regenerate exhausted zeolite material selection of the regenerant solution should be carried out originally lta is a sodium based zeolite thus a relatively inexpensive solution comprised of sodium salts is required hence sodium chloride is usually employed for regeneration of zeolite lta 70 as was described in methodology section 2 6 once zeolite was loaded with calcium ions regeneration was conducted using nacl solution with concentrations ranged from 0 1 m to 3 m by agitation for 24 h at room temperature the driving force of ion exchange at the regeneration stage was 0 85 13 g na g zeolite fig 9 illustrates the impact of nacl molarity upon the recovery degree of calcium ion regeneration it can be seen from fig 9 that the concentration of sodium chloride was an important factor with respect to calcium recovery whereas washing of exhausted zeolite lta with deionized water did not lead to calcium release regeneration effectiveness with nacl solution rose with an increase of concentration and reached 99 6 using 2 m solution this observation was consistent with an increasing driving force i e concentration gradient which facilitated the ion exchange process the na applied ca2 loaded molar ratio in this study ranged from 10 6 to 157 with an increase of nacl concentration from 0 1 to 3 m the stoichiometry of the ion exchange process illustrated that 2 mol of na was required to recover 1 mol of ca2 eq 9 9 z na ca 2 z 2 ca 2 na therefore theoretically 0 018 m nacl solution dose 200 ml g should be sufficient to recover the calcium ions loaded on the zeolite however it was demonstrated in fig 9 that an excess of sodium ions was actually required for complete recovery of calcium from zeolite lta due to its high affinity towards this cation similarly song et al 70 demonstrated 4 m nacl solution to be suitable for complete recovery of exhausted lta zeolite using half the dose of solution 100 ml of nacl per 1 g of zeolite in a batch regeneration test according to this result 2 m nacl solution was selected for regeneration of zeolite lta derived from alum sludge and waste glass calcium uptake from simulated river water and the following recovery using 2 m nacl solution was studied during 4 consecutive regeneration cycles fig 10 interestingly an increase in calcium uptake by 16 was detected after the first regeneration cycle this observation might be explained by the fact that impurities such as calcium magnesium and potassium ions were already present on the zeolite lta ion exchange sites after initial synthesis was completed as the waste glass comprised of a significant amount of calcium species 9 4 as cao 46 it was likely that the more preferred calcium ions exchanged with sodium ions on the zeolite lattice after the first regeneration cycle with concentrated nacl solution however those cations were partially exchanged with sodium providing additional ion exchange sites for the following cycle nevertheless by the 4th regeneration cycle the calcium ion uptake declined to 46 7 mg g this situation may be explained by inefficient regeneration of the zeolite by nacl solutions decrease of regeneration efficiency after several loading regeneration cycles indicated gradual exhaustion of the ion exchange material and the need to further adjust the regeneration procedure in accordance with the present results previous studies have also demonstrated progressive reduction of cation exchange capacity of zeolite lta after several regeneration cycles 44 71 the influence of solids losses during the cycling experiments may also have been a factor in significant decrease of calcium uptake at the 4th regeneration cycle in order to examine the regeneration strategy in more detail and further support the deduction xrf analysis of the chemical composition of zeolite lta after the first calcium loading and regeneration with 2 m nacl is shown in table 2 notably the na2o al2o3 molar ratio of the synthesized zeolite lta was less than the ideal value of 1 0 81 for na12 alo2 12 sio2 12 27h2o which confirmed that calcium ions were present on a fraction of the zeolite exchange sites hence the excess expulsion of calcium ions relative to calcium ions loaded from solution after the first regeneration stage was consistent with the xrf analysis this observation also explains why the zeolite lta made from waste materials exhibited a lower calcium ion exchange capacity compared with commercial samples 106 6 mg ca2 g zeolite 34 after loading of zeolite lta with calcium ions a substantial reduction in sodium oxide content was apparent 85 2 and accordingly the cao content was raised as suspected the regeneration conditions were not able to recover 100 of the calcium ions from the zeolite lta as evidence by presence of 3 215 wt cao remaining however calcium content as well as potassium and magnesium in regenerated sample reduced sufficiently to result in cec increase compared with the original zeolite lta the detection of a surplus of sodium oxide in the regenerated zeolite lta sample na2o al2o3 1 1 may also indicate inclusion of excess nacl remaining after the regeneration process due to the high driving force 4 conclusions zeolite lta was not only successfully synthesized from alum sludge and waste glass but also demonstrated to be effective at softening simulated river water pre activation of both the alumina and silica containing wastes using high temperature alkaline fusion was used based upon previous literature from consideration of the zeolite lta yield data the optimal sio2 al2o3 ratio in the crystallisation stage was suggested to be ca 2 25 importantly consideration of only the crystalline zeolite lta content would have erroneously predicted sio2 al2o3 ratio s 2 the zeolite crystallisation time should be no more than 5 h at 80 c as beyond this value sodalite impurities are formed synthesis times are somewhat controlled by the geometry and thermal transfer profiles of the laboratory reactor employed and thus it is challenging to accurately compare with other studies albeit trends should be similar to enhance the economic viability of zeolite synthesis from waste materials the recycling of mother liquor is required in addition to financial considerations mother liquor recycling has been shown in this study to enhance the physical properties and performance of the zeolite lta compared to the initial batch of zeolite made using mother liquid in this study had a positive effect on lta crystallinity after 3 consecutive cycles which was reflected in calcium exchange capacity increase notably the majority of zeolite synthesis publications do not investigate the influence of mother liquor recycling and as such it is recommended for researchers to adopt this strategy in the future the balance in savings due to recycling of the residual sodium hydroxide and the additional cost of water evaporation should also be explored the fact that almost pure sodium hydroxide is required for the fusion process makes the dehydration of mother liquor particularly challenging another factor which needs to be considered is the fate of the impurities in the waste sources upon zeolite synthesis zeolite lta with cec of 73 mg ca2 g made from waste materials was able to soften simulated river water the extent of calcium ions removed was less with river water compared to pure solutions of calcium chloride analysis revealed that magnesium and potassium ions were also removed from the river water regeneration of zeolite lta after softening required the use of nacl solutions of at least 2 m concentration however upon multiple loading regeneration cycles the degree of softening diminished which suggested an improved regeneration procedure may be required despite the growing number of publications relating to zeolite synthesis from aluminosilicate wastes it is clear that a more in depth analysis of the process engineering and economic considerations is required if this technology approach is to succeed an emphasis on reducing the cost of the activation procedure for silica and alumina from waste materials appears to be of high importance the outlined use of high temperature alkaline fusion although effective inherently is more costly than zeolite lta synthesis from aluminosilicate gels in addition the discovery of an activation strategy which uses sodium hydroxide solutions in contrast to solid sodium hydroxide may be more preferable

13403,this study addressed the need to better understand process engineering aspects of zeolite lta synthesis from waste materials in particular concepts such as zeolite yield recycling of mother liquor softening performance and regeneration of calcium loaded zeolite lta were evaluated zeolite lta was made via alkaline fusion pre activation of alum sludge and waste glass at 700 c for 2 h followed by hydrothermal treatment at 80 c for 5 h increasing the sio2 al2o3 ratio of the feed mixture from 1 to 2 3 doubled the yield of zeolite lta to 67 consequently a feed mixture of composition 9 2na2o al2o3 2 3sio2 276h2o was adopted for subsequent tests recycling of the alkali and other dissolved species in the mother liquor improved zeolite lta crystallinity 80 to 86 wt and calcium exchange capacity from 73 to 78 mg g implementation of recycling depends upon the cost benefit analysis regarding energy demand for evaporation of mother liquor relative to savings by more effectively using the excess alkali reagent calcium uptake on zeolite lta was reduced when treating simulated river water 65 5 mg ca2 g due to competitive ion exchange regeneration of calcium loaded zeolite lta required a nacl solution with a molarity of at least 2 m a notable reduction of calcium loading capacity was detected after several loading regeneration cycles the outlined technology proposed a feasible and scalable approach to recycling of wastes producing a commodity which could be successfully used locally by the water treatment plant as a water softener graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water treatment sludge waste glass mother liquor zeolite a hardness removal regeneration 1 introduction hardness is importance with respect to water quality the term hardness is generally linked to concentrations of dissolved calcium and magnesium cations expressed as milligrams of caco3 equivalent per litre 1 water hardness is classified in terms as soft 60 mg caco3 l moderately hard 60 120 mg caco3 l hard 120 180 caco3 l and very hard 180 caco3 l 1 2 indeed there are examples where water hardness can surpass values of 500 mg caco3 l 3 4 elevated water hardness is a challenge both for the general population and industry calcium and magnesium insoluble salts have a propensity to precipitate on the inner surfaces of pipes and water treatment or heating equipment i e scaling common consequences include impedance of water flow in distribution systems and a reduction in heating efficiency moreover a high level of hardness impairs organoleptic characteristics of drinking water and aggravates general life quality due to formation of soap scum and decrease of lifespan effectiveness of appliances 2 5 6 consumption of very hard water has been considered as a contributory factor to the development of eczema diabetes and neural disease 1 2 7 more recent studies reported a correlation between high groundwater hardness and the occurrence of chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology ckdu 8 10 removal of water hardness is also a common occurrence in our daily lives as laundry powders comprise of materials which soften the water and allow the detergent to operate successfully 11 a number of techniques have been used to reduce hardness from water sources including chemical softening 12 nanofiltration 13 deionization 14 and ion exchange 6 chemical softening using lime or sodium carbonate is relatively inexpensive but it generates sludge whereas membrane processes raise the intricacy and operational cost of the water treatment 15 membranes can also remove calcium and magnesium cations below minimum required concentrations of 10 and 20 mg l respectively which increases the risk of corrosion 5 16 alternatively ion exchange using zeolite lta na12 alo2 12 sio2 12 27h2o has been used for many years due to low cost simplicity capacity and selectivity factors 17 18 zeolite lta is extensively used as a water softener in water wastewater treatment and detergent industries since 1974 and its use is growing annually 18 19 studies have focused on hardness removal from waters of high salinity for seawater and reverse osmosis ro concentrates 20 21 as well as reverse osmosis permeate 22 brackish and groundwater 23 zeolite lta does not occur naturally and is typically hydrothermally synthesized from high purity alkaline solutions of sodium silicate and sodium aluminate 24 a current trend is the use of natural aluminosilicates or waste materials including rice husk 25 coal fly ash 26 alum sludge 27 and a range of others 18 alum sludge is of particular interest to the drinking water treatment dwt sector as this waste is produced from use of aluminium coagulants employed to remove suspended solids and natural organic matter alum sludge represents 1 to 3 by volume of the treated water which amounts to approximately 10 000 tons day worldwide 28 29 typically alum sludge is disposed to landfill which is costly and a potential environmental problem however this waste may be potentially recycled as zeolite lta as the major components are alumina and silica 30 31 using alum sludge for lta zeolite synthesis in this case is of particular benefit due to produced material can be used locally at water treatment plant reducing both raw water hardness and water treatment costs while conventional hydrothermal synthesis of zeolite lta from alum sludge was relatively ineffective using fusion pre treatment resulted in material of higher purity and crystallinity 32 33 recently rozhkovskaya et al 34 examined the feasibility of alum sludge conversion into zeolite lta by fusion assisted hydrothermal method for water treatment applications single phase zeolite lta of 97 crystallinity was made with a calcium exchange capacity of 209 75 mg caco3 g one limitation was the use of na2sio3 5h2o to adjust sio2 al2o3 ratio whereas using silica rich waste is preferred from an environmental point of view hence why anuwattana and khummongkol 32 synthesized zeolite lta with 64 crystallinity and 3 sodalite impurity using cupola slag and alum sludge as starting materials with respect to a suitable source of wast silica glass cullet is a silica rich municipal solid waste available worldwide annual landfill disposal of this waste reached 0 47 and 7 million tonnes in australia and the usa respectively in 2017 35 36 therefore a need exists to develop alternative recycling strategies for glass cullet as the current recovery rate is still relatively low converting waste glass into zeolite lta has thus been tested 37 with some studies using microwave irradiation 38 and fusion assisted hydrothermal synthesis 39 40 nevertheless a single phase zeolite with high yield and cation exchange capacity was not obtained it was evident that several investigations of the chemistry of zeolite lta synthesis from waste material have been reported 18 however translation of the chemical understanding to issues important from a process engineering point of view is limited for example operationally it is desirable to reduce energy consumption relating to heating of materials pumping cooling and drying in addition minimizing the cost of feed materials is also critical mother liquor recycling is essentially compulsory in industry to recover valuable feedstock material yet it is majorly overlooked in published zeolite articles 41 the mother liquor is the liquid component collected by filtration of the zeolite containing sludge following the high temperature crystallisation step mother liquor typically contains high concentrations of sodium hydroxide aluminates and silicates 42 additionally softening performance of zeolite lta made from waste materials needs to be analysed in the context of solutions comprising of competing ions and not simple solutions of for example dissolved calcium chloride 43 process economics also dictates that following loading of hardness cations on zeolite lta than an effective method is discovered for regeneration of the exchange sites 44 in accord with knowledge gaps identified this study aimed to resolve process engineering issues associated with manufacture high quality zeolite lta from alum sludge and waste glass and examine key water treatment performance metrics such as softening effectiveness for river water and subsequent regeneration of exhausted zeolite the hypothesis was if engineering aspects of zeolite lta synthesis from alum sludge and waste glass and performance are resolved then the drinking water treatment industry may reduce operational costs and environmental impact due to the use of local wastes on site specific research questions to support the hypothesis were as follows 1 which synthesis parameters produce the highest quality zeolite lta at lowest cost 2 what is the influence of mother liquor use on zeolite lta crystallisation 3 how effective is zeolite lta derived from alum sludge and waste glass for hardness removal from naturally hard river water 4 what is the optimum regeneration strategy of exhausted zeolite over several ion exchange cycles the experimental testing was conducted at bench scale in order to optimize zeolite lta synthesis several reaction parameters were altered including sio2 al2o3 molar ratio of initial aluminosilicate gel and time of hydrothermal reaction quantitative x ray diffraction analysis was employed to confirm the purity and specific amount of crystalline material in the sample performance of waste derived zeolite lta in terms of hardness removal from simulated river water was examined on the basis of equilibrium studies the experiments were conducted using simulated high harness river water since there is the advantage of using the technology at drinking water treatment plants that produce large quantities of waste alum sludge in the areas of high hardness raw water however the technology is also potentially applicable for the treatment of groundwaters with high hardness the proposed idea promoted the environmental acceptability of zeolite lta synthesis by recycling two abundant waste materials simultaneously and addressed various practical considerations 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials dewatered alum sludge as was collected from the mount crosby west bank water treatment plant queensland australia the sludge was initially dried overnight in an oven at 105 c waste glass was separated from municipal solid wastes produced in queensland before being used for zeolite lta synthesis alum sludge and glass cullet were ground in a cr steel ball mill to obtain a fine powder characteristics and chemical composition of the alum sludge employed has been described previously 34 it consisted of 8 85 wt of sio

the composition was derived from a report for the dartford south supply zone the location of water treatment plant provided by thames water utilities ltd based on the data collected throughout 2019 to reproduce the chemical composition of river water the following chemicals were diluted in 5 l of deionized di water 0 0003 g of nh4cl 0 3376 g of cacl2 0 0244 g of nacl 1 0923 g of caco3 0 0022 g of

of the simulated river water is presented in table 1 2 3 zeolite lta synthesis 2 3 1 alkaline fusion of waste materials alkaline fusion of individual waste materials instead of a mixture of aluminium and silica waste was completed based upon published data 46 alum sludge and waste glass were fused separately with naoh with a mass ratio 1 2 waste naoh in a nickel crucible at 700 c for 2 h in an ashing furnace aaf 11 3 by carbolite gero after cooling in a desiccator at room temperature the fused products were ground in a cr steel ball mill and sealed in a plastic container 2 3 2 hydrothermal synthesis of fused waste materials to synthesize zeolite lta from the fused wastes the first stage was addition of the fused alum sludge in equal amounts of deionized di water in two separate brandtech vitlab pmp erlenmeyer flasks at room temperature subsequently the aqueous fused glass mixture was slowly poured into the alum sludge solution and agitated with a magnetic stirrer at room temperature until homogenised the formed thick gel was then aged for 16 h at room temperature in a sealed flask 27 the final molar chemical composition of the mixture was 4xna2o al2o3 xsio2 120xh2o where x represented the sio2 al2o3 molar ratio from 1 to 3 the na2o sio2 molar ratio of 4 was fixed while the h2o na2o molar ratio of 30 was already optimized from a previous study 46 final zeolite

24 naoh crystallisation of zeolite was performed by hydrothermal synthesis in a teflon lined vessel under static conditions at 80 c while the time was varied from 1 to 9 h once reaction was complete the bottle was removed from the heating source and cooled to room temperature the solid product was separated from the mother liquor using vacuum filtration and after the mother liquor was removed the solid was washed with deionized water until filtrate ph was below 9 the resultant solids were finally dried in an oven at 105 c overnight 2 4 recycling of mother liquor once mother liquor was collected it was analysed by icp oes to determine concentrations of dissolved ions then the liquid was transferred to an oven and evaporated at 105 c while water vapour could be condensed and reused at the hydrothermal synthesis and or washing stage resulting solids were returned back to the alum sludge fusion process an as naoh mass ratio of 1 2 was maintained by addition of additional commercial grade naoh alkaline fusion and hydrothermal treatment at previously optimized conditions were carried out as described in sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 three consecutive cycles of liquor regeneration were performed 2 5 equilibrium ion exchange studies to assess cation exchange capacity of zeolite lta equilibrium isotherm studies were conducted the constant concentration method was employed as this has been demonstrated to be more precise compared to the constant sorbent mass approach 47 a number of zeolite samples with mass ranging from 0 03 to 0 6 g were weighed and put into 250 ml nalgene bottles then 200 ml of cacl2 solution 99 mg ca2 l or 248 mg caco3 l or simulated river water was added sealed bottles were then placed in an incubator innova 42r new brunswick scientific and agitated for 72 h at a fixed temperature of 30 0 1 c once reaction was complete supernatants were analysed as described in section 2 8 the amount of calcium exchanged at equilibrium and removal efficiency were determined according to eqs 5 6 5 q e c o c e v m 6 r c o c e c o 100 where q e is the quantity of cations exchanged at the time t mg g c o c e the initial and equilibrium

maximum loading of cations on the zeolite mg g kw is the bsi constant expressed as kf qmax kf is a freundlich constant and α is the measure of sorption energy distribution 2 6 regeneration of exhausted zeolite lta to regenerate exhausted zeolite the preferred concentration of nacl solution was first determined the first step in this process was loading of 0 2 g of zeolite lta with calcium by agitation with 40 ml of 1 g ca2 l solution as cacl2 overnight at room temperature the dose of zeolite corresponded to the optimum driving force of ion exchange 200 mg ca2 g zeolite determined in the equilibrium study once ion exchange was complete the liquid phase was separated from the solids by centrifugation and analysed by icp oes to determine final calcium and sodium concentrations after the solids were washed with ethanol 3 times to remove residual water the material was dried in a laboratory oven for 30 mins at 80 c the second step was to mix resultant ca zeolite lta with 40 ml of either 0 1 0 5 1 2 or 3 m nacl solution and agitate overnight at room temperature then the solution was separated and also analysed by icp oes for calcium and sodium concentrations ca recovery was

experiments were averaged over 4 repetitions to ensure reproducibility the methodology for one regeneration cycle was as follows 1 0 026 g of zeolite lta was mixed with 50 ml of simulated river water

a laboratory oven for 20 min at 80 c 5 ca lta zeolite was mixed with 50 ml of 2 m nacl solution 6 repeat steps 2 to 4 2 7 characterization of solids 2 7 1 quantitative x ray diffraction xrdq the

chemical reagents 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis process optimization 3 1 1 influence of sio2 al2o3 molar ratio on zeolite lta crystallinity optimisation of synthesis recipe is a crucial stage when making zeolite from waste materials due to their complex composition it was previously claimed that the presence of impurities in zeolite precursors might be a negative factor for nucleation of aluminosilicate gels 51 while for example organic matters impede zeolite crystallisation transition metal cations have a strong electrolytic effect on gel formation which may cause alteration of a synthesis pathway with a following crystallisation of an undesired zeolite phase 27 52 to investigate the effect of sio2 al2o3 molar ratio upon crystallisation of zeolite lta from fused alum sludge and waste glass the starting composition of aluminosilicate gels was fixed as 4xna2o al2o3 xsio2 120xh2o where x was altered from 1 to 3 fig 1 the original xrd patterns of the samples from which the quantitative amounts of crystalline zeolite are presented in supplementary fig a 1 to investigate the effect of sio2 al2o3 molar ratio upon crystallisation of zeolite lta from fused alum sludge and waste glass the starting composition of aluminosilicate gels was fixed as 4xna2o al2o3 xsio2 120xh2o where x was altered from 1 to 3 fig 1 the original xrd patterns of the samples from which the quantitative amounts of crystalline zeolite are presented in supplementary fig a 1 the lowest sio2 al2o3 ratio of 1 resulted in zeolite lta with 79 wt of crystalline material increase of sio2 al2o3 ratio up to 1 5 slightly elevated this value to 84 albeit raising the sio2 al2o3 molar ratio further decreased the amount of crystalline zeolite lta concomitantly zeolite x which is a faujasite type zeolite was formed when sio2 al2o3 was 2 5 or greater previous studies have also demonstrated formation of faujasite instead of zeolite lta zeolite at sio2 al2o3 values 2 50 53 formation of d4r units prevails in low silica systems which promote crystallisation of zeolite lta 54 while fau consists of larger double six membered units d6r which imply a higher amount of dissolved silica was required 55 yields of zeolites are mainly not provided in academic publications yet as can be seen from fig 1 the trend is not the same as the amount of crystalline zeolite lta usually zeolite lta producers operate with a slight excess of alumina species in the gel 1 8 0 2 as this ensures that highly crystalline and relatively pure zeolite lta is manufactured 56 the data presented in fig 1 was in agreement with the commercial process in that not only was the highest zeolite lta crystallinity formed at sio2 al2o3 values 2 but also due to silica unavailability and consequently yield values the sio2 al2o3 values should be 1 5 from the zeolite lta formula na12 alo2 12 sio2 12 27h2o a sio2 al2o3 ratio 2 maybe expected to give the best zeolite yield however in the current system derived from alum and glass wastes zeolite lta yield peaked at sio2 al2o3 2 3 this fact can tentatively be ascribed to the presence of impurities in the initial aluminosilicate gel an idea consistent with previous synthesis of low silica zeolites from impure sources 34 51 further increase of silica led to a substantial reduction in zeolite yield which was a consequence of production of non diffracting materials and zeolite x 57 3 1 2 optimization of reaction time on zeolite lta formation in the zeolite manufacturing sector minimization of reaction time while maintain zeolite lta purity is important in relation to process economics fig 2 shows the amount of crystalline zeolite lta formed as a function of hydrothermal synthesis time notably within the first hour no zeolite lta was detected and only amorphous material was present nevertheless in industry high purity zeolite lta can routinely be made in less than an hour and in the best case a matter of minutes 58 an important parameter here is the time taken to heat the reactant mixture to reaction temperature in this case the gel components were added at room temperature and placed in a teflon lined reactor which was placed in an oven due to heat transfer limitations the time taken to reach 80 c may easily be 1 h or more in contrast zeolite lta manufacturers normally pre heat the sodium aluminate and sodium silicate solutions to ca 60 to 80 c 59 additionally it is recommended to rapidly raise the temperature to reaction temperature as soon as possible after gel creation a reaction time of 5 h resulted in optimal production of crystalline zeolite lta 80 wt whereas above this reaction time a reduction in the quantity of zeolite lta was observed along with creation of the more thermodynamically stable sodalite such behaviour was consistent with previous understanding of the zeolite lta synthesis system 57 moreover after prolong exposure metastable crystals of lta zeolite tend to dissolve in hot concentrated alkali solution which consequently causes increase in amorphous content 60 it is emphasised that overall reaction time may be reduced by adjusting the h2o na2o ratio as this is thought to be the most important factor in relation to the reaction time required to make zeolite lta 56 a lesser but significant means of controlling the reaction time is the na2o sio2 ratio 57 for instance in the example illustrated in fig 2 the h2o na2o was 30 typical range 10 to 35 and na2o sio2 ratio 4 typically 1 to 2 5 57 therefore decrease in the h2o na2o ratio to 25 or 30 may be productive in terms of reduction of reaction time to further investigate the impact of reaction time upon zeolite lta crystallisation from alum sludge and waste glass at 80 c sem micrographs of the products were collected fig 3 in general sem data was in agreement with the quantitative xrd data shown in fig 2 the first hour of hydrothermal reaction at 80 c fig 3a was found to be a nucleation stage without crystalline material detected further increase in reaction time led to formation of typical cubic crystals of zeolite lta at the optimum reaction time of 5 h particles with truncated edges and smooth surface were observed fig 3c bevelled edges of zeolite particles are attributed to high alkalinity of the starting aluminosilicate gel as was shown previously 61 62 notably mainly single crystals were formed without twinning or intergrowth which ensured larger surface area and thus should exhibit a positive effect on cation exchange capacity extension of hydrothermal time beyond the optimum caused gradual dissolution of zeolite lta crystals and ultimately transformation of the cubic morphology of zeolite lta into sodalite of thread ball morphology fig 3e 3 2 regeneration of the mother liquor after the crystallisation stage the product zeolite is normally separated from the mother liquor in order to recover valuable excess sodium hydroxide and other species such as aluminates 63 for example garcía et al 53 found that high purity zeolite lta was made when they used mother liquor to dissolve the aluminium hydroxide starting material it was noted that the mother liquor probably contained zeolite seeds which accelerated the nucleation of zeolite lta therefore a mother liquor recycling approach was enacted in this study as this was the situation which simulated industry processes fig 4 due to fact that solid sodium hydroxide was used in the fusion stage of this study the first step was evaporation of the mother liquor recovered from the first synthesis cycle the resultant salts were then used for the fusion of alum sludge to partially substitute for naoh silica and alumina in the system in order to avoid a fluctuation of sodium concentration the experiments were conducted in a controlled environment using the same sodium content in each test fig 5 presents quantitative xrd data and calcium exchange capacity of zeolite lta synthesized after several consecutive mother liquor recycling tests the crystalline consent of zeolite lta was slightly increased from 80 to 86 wt after 3 experiments wherein mother liquor was recycled calcium exchange capacity accordingly increased from 73 to 78 mg ca2 g after the 3rd cycle which was in agreement with the study by lin et al 42 it was surmised that the collected solids after the mother liquor evaporation stage contained residual silica and alumina species which facilitated zeolite nucleation in addition to excess alkali 42 64 however the reported studies investigated mother liquor recycling in liquid form whereas this study provided evidence that residual silica and alumina remained after evaporation of the liquor promoted zeolite lta crystallisation even after alkali fusion treatment sem images were also collected in order to discover whether the mother liquor recycling process changed the shape and size of the zeolite lta fig 6 inspection of zeolite morphology revealed well defined cubic crystals attributed to zeolite lta particles with smooth surface bevelled edges and minor twinning were observed in each image in contrast to earlier findings 42 65 zeolite particle size slightly increased each cycle as did the uniformity of lta crystals again this observation indicated a positive effect of residual silica and alumina from the mother liquor on zeolite nucleation 3 3 ion exchange equilibrium studies of calcium ions with zeolite lta to study the performance of zeolite lta made from waste materials as a water softener equilibrium tests were carried out using pure calcium chloride solution and simulated hard river water of similar calcium concentration ca 99 mg ca2 l focus was made on calcium removal due to the fact it is usually the most prevalent alkaline earth ion in natural ground and river waters 2 equilibrium isotherm profiles for both the simple calcium chloride solution and river water are compared in fig 7 from the data it was seen that calcium removal efficiency was higher from pure cacl2 solution despite similar initial zeolite and calcium concentration introduction of competing ions decreased calcium removal capacity by 10 from a maximum loading of 73 mg ca2 g in pure cacl2 solution to 65 5 mg ca2 g in model river water the plateau in the data points of calcium uptake in each case implied that isotherm test conditions were appropriate and that the calcium exchange with zeolite lta was favourable 66 to gain a deeper understanding of the ion exchange process in simulated river water analysis of exchange stoichiometry and uptake of competitive ions was conducted fig 8 inspection of the experimental data for ion exchange stoichiometry in fig 8a revealed a general linear relationship between loaded calcium and released sodium ions notably at the higher calcium loadings there appeared to be sodium ions ejected from the zeolite lta which were not simply due to ion exchange phenomena this observation may suggest that a small amount of sodium hydroxide may be in the zeolite pores which was dislodged when the calcium ions sorbed on the zeolite lta fig 8b indicated that the selectivity series was k mg2 ca2 the affinity of lta zeolite towards calcium over magnesium was shown in literature 44 67 the removal efficiency of magnesium and calcium reached 97 and 99 respectively at the highest zeolite lta dosage of 3 g l however according to the national institute of public health czech republic 5 residual a calcium concentration of ca 50 mg l in the drinking water supply is desired therefore 50 calcium removal at a zeolite lta dosage of 0 7 g l was sufficient to fulfil municipal water quality requirements overall this data indicated that calcium and magnesium could be simultaneously removed from naturally hard river water using zeolite lta derived from alum sludge and waste glass 3 4 regeneration strategy for calcium loaded zeolite lta in practice zeolites need to be regenerated once they have become loaded with calcium ions due to practical and economic considerations 68 69 to regenerate exhausted zeolite material selection of the regenerant solution should be carried out originally lta is a sodium based zeolite thus a relatively inexpensive solution comprised of sodium salts is required hence sodium chloride is usually employed for regeneration of zeolite lta 70 as was described in methodology section 2 6 once zeolite was loaded with calcium ions regeneration was conducted using nacl solution with concentrations ranged from 0 1 m to 3 m by agitation for 24 h at room temperature the driving force of ion exchange at the regeneration stage was 0 85 13 g na g zeolite fig 9 illustrates the impact of nacl molarity upon the recovery degree of calcium ion regeneration it can be seen from fig 9 that the concentration of sodium chloride was an important factor with respect to calcium recovery whereas washing of exhausted zeolite lta with deionized water did not lead to calcium release regeneration effectiveness with nacl solution rose with an increase of concentration and reached 99 6 using 2 m solution this observation was consistent with an increasing driving force i e concentration gradient which facilitated the ion exchange process the na applied ca2 loaded molar ratio in this study ranged from 10 6 to 157 with an increase of nacl concentration from 0 1 to 3 m the stoichiometry of the ion exchange process illustrated that 2 mol of na was required to recover 1 mol of ca2 eq 9 9 z na ca 2 z 2 ca 2 na therefore theoretically 0 018 m nacl solution dose 200 ml g should be sufficient to recover the calcium ions loaded on the zeolite however it was demonstrated in fig 9 that an excess of sodium ions was actually required for complete recovery of calcium from zeolite lta due to its high affinity towards this cation similarly song et al 70 demonstrated 4 m nacl solution to be suitable for complete recovery of exhausted lta zeolite using half the dose of solution 100 ml of nacl per 1 g of zeolite in a batch regeneration test according to this result 2 m nacl solution was selected for regeneration of zeolite lta derived from alum sludge and waste glass calcium uptake from simulated river water and the following recovery using 2 m nacl solution was studied during 4 consecutive regeneration cycles fig 10 interestingly an increase in calcium uptake by 16 was detected after the first regeneration cycle this observation might be explained by the fact that impurities such as calcium magnesium and potassium ions were already present on the zeolite lta ion exchange sites after initial synthesis was completed as the waste glass comprised of a significant amount of calcium species 9 4 as cao 46 it was likely that the more preferred calcium ions exchanged with sodium ions on the zeolite lattice after the first regeneration cycle with concentrated nacl solution however those cations were partially exchanged with sodium providing additional ion exchange sites for the following cycle nevertheless by the 4th regeneration cycle the calcium ion uptake declined to 46 7 mg g this situation may be explained by inefficient regeneration of the zeolite by nacl solutions decrease of regeneration efficiency after several loading regeneration cycles indicated gradual exhaustion of the ion exchange material and the need to further adjust the regeneration procedure in accordance with the present results previous studies have also demonstrated progressive reduction of cation exchange capacity of zeolite lta after several regeneration cycles 44 71 the influence of solids losses during the cycling experiments may also have been a factor in significant decrease of calcium uptake at the 4th regeneration cycle in order to examine the regeneration strategy in more detail and further support the deduction xrf analysis of the chemical composition of zeolite lta after the first calcium loading and regeneration with 2 m nacl is shown in table 2 notably the na2o al2o3 molar ratio of the synthesized zeolite lta was less than the ideal value of 1 0 81 for na12 alo2 12 sio2 12 27h2o which confirmed that calcium ions were present on a fraction of the zeolite exchange sites hence the excess expulsion of calcium ions relative to calcium ions loaded from solution after the first regeneration stage was consistent with the xrf analysis this observation also explains why the zeolite lta made from waste materials exhibited a lower calcium ion exchange capacity compared with commercial samples 106 6 mg ca2 g zeolite 34 after loading of zeolite lta with calcium ions a substantial reduction in sodium oxide content was apparent 85 2 and accordingly the cao content was raised as suspected the regeneration conditions were not able to recover 100 of the calcium ions from the zeolite lta as evidence by presence of 3 215 wt cao remaining however calcium content as well as potassium and magnesium in regenerated sample reduced sufficiently to result in cec increase compared with the original zeolite lta the detection of a surplus of sodium oxide in the regenerated zeolite lta sample na2o al2o3 1 1 may also indicate inclusion of excess nacl remaining after the regeneration process due to the high driving force 4 conclusions zeolite lta was not only successfully synthesized from alum sludge and waste glass but also demonstrated to be effective at softening simulated river water pre activation of both the alumina and silica containing wastes using high temperature alkaline fusion was used based upon previous literature from consideration of the zeolite lta yield data the optimal sio2 al2o3 ratio in the crystallisation stage was suggested to be ca 2 25 importantly consideration of only the crystalline zeolite lta content would have erroneously predicted sio2 al2o3 ratio s 2 the zeolite crystallisation time should be no more than 5 h at 80 c as beyond this value sodalite impurities are formed synthesis times are somewhat controlled by the geometry and thermal transfer profiles of the laboratory reactor employed and thus it is challenging to accurately compare with other studies albeit trends should be similar to enhance the economic viability of zeolite synthesis from waste materials the recycling of mother liquor is required in addition to financial considerations mother liquor recycling has been shown in this study to enhance the physical properties and performance of the zeolite lta compared to the initial batch of zeolite made using mother liquid in this study had a positive effect on lta crystallinity after 3 consecutive cycles which was reflected in calcium exchange capacity increase notably the majority of zeolite synthesis publications do not investigate the influence of mother liquor recycling and as such it is recommended for researchers to adopt this strategy in the future the balance in savings due to recycling of the residual sodium hydroxide and the additional cost of water evaporation should also be explored the fact that almost pure sodium hydroxide is required for the fusion process makes the dehydration of mother liquor particularly challenging another factor which needs to be considered is the fate of the impurities in the waste sources upon zeolite synthesis zeolite lta with cec of 73 mg ca2 g made from waste materials was able to soften simulated river water the extent of calcium ions removed was less with river water compared to pure solutions of calcium chloride analysis revealed that magnesium and potassium ions were also removed from the river water regeneration of zeolite lta after softening required the use of nacl solutions of at least 2 m concentration however upon multiple loading regeneration cycles the degree of softening diminished which suggested an improved regeneration procedure may be required despite the growing number of publications relating to zeolite synthesis from aluminosilicate wastes it is clear that a more in depth analysis of the process engineering and economic considerations is required if this technology approach is to succeed an emphasis on reducing the cost of the activation procedure for silica and alumina from waste materials appears to be of high importance the outlined use of high temperature alkaline fusion although effective inherently is more costly than zeolite lta synthesis from aluminosilicate gels in addition the discovery of an activation strategy which uses sodium hydroxide solutions in contrast to solid sodium hydroxide may be more preferable

13404,the combination of nanotechnology and green chemistry based on the valorization of natural resources for environmental applications becomes a top priority for scientific researchers in the last decades biomass with fascinating features including abundance environmentally safe nature and low cost can be easily manipulated as an infinite source for green and advanced sorbent materials design in this study date palm fibers as one of the most plenty resources in morocco was exploited to extract pure cellulosic fibers which were combined with tio2 nanoparticles in the form of highly porous blocks using a natural linker to be used as green photocatalyst for both cationic and anionic dyes photodegradation structural morphological thermal and textural properties of the resulting composites

dyes and excellent regeneration after several cycles with easier separation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords date palm fiber tio2polyisoprene highly porous block dyes adsorption photocatalysis 1 introduction over the last decades heterogeneous photocatalysis based on semiconductor materials has gained tremendous advancements in various application fields such as environmental remediation photocatalysis energy conversion and storage cosmetics etc 1 4 titanium dioxide tio2 with excellent chemical stability strong oxidizing power and high ability in degrading a wide range of pollutants has emerged as one of the most promising photocatalysts for environmental applications 5 8 the difficulties in separating it after the photocatalytic process and easer tendency to agglomeration are the serious impediments limiting its feasibility for industrial applications 9 10 indeed various studies have shown that the immobilization of tio2 photocatalyst onto different supports such as glass polymers carbonaceous nanomaterials clays and many others can solve those problems 11 14 nonetheless preoccupy and obsessed with green chemistry why not thinking of developing environmental friendly materials based on natural resources from biomass such as natural fibers for supporting tio2 nanoparticles natural fibers are abundant cheap and renewable moreover they possessed high mechanical properties and high adsorption capacity toward a large span of contaminants 15 17 indeed combining the tio2 with natural fibers may be more advantageous not only to facilitate its recovery but also to enhance its photocatalytic performances based on the literature review it seems that a lot of natural fibers have been used as support for tio2 in wastewater treatment wool fibers were successfully impregnated with tio2 zro2 and used as photocatalyst for the photodegradation of methylene blue mb and eosin yellowish dyes 18 natural luffa cylindrica fibers were also used for the tio2 immobilization for efficient degradation of methanol and mb 19 thus despite their advantages fibers have hydrophobic groups which decrease their interaction with tio2 requiring further chemical modifications 16 20 to the best of our knowledge there is no study to date relating the combination of date palm fibers and tio2 photocatalyst for the removal of organic dyes from wastewater therefore the originality of this work lies in the development for the first time of a novel highly porous photocatalyst based on tio2 date palm fiber as the cellulosic source and polyisoprene as a binder with well regulated internal channels good surface area excellent sorption performances and high photocatalytic activity for the removal of both anionic and cationic dyes from aqueous media 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials date palm fibers dpf were collected from the leaves of date palm trees grown in morocco poly cis 1 4 isoprene pir used as a linker with a density of

from carlo erba reagents ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm 1 was used to prepare all solutions temperature and ph were measured using a digital multimeter thermal scientific orion star mb and cr concentrations were measured by spectrophotometer model uv 1900 shimadzu uvc lamps philips tuv 8 w were used as irradiation source for photocatalytic tests all the reagents and solvents were used without any further purification 2 2 bdpf pir blocks preparation the preparation of the bdpf pir blocks was carried out in two successive steps as follows date palm leaves were carefully extracted from the trees washed with tap water and detergent to remove surface impurities followed by air drying for 24 h the obtained dried sheets were ground by a fritsch pulverisette 19 mill having a sieve opening of 2 mm followed by sieving through a sieve of 0 5 mm to obtain homogeneous fibers the resulting fibers dpf were subsequently undergoing an alkaline treatment by their immersing in an aqueous solution containing 4 wt of sodium hydroxide for 20 h at room temperature under stirring to remove non cellulosic components hemicellulose and lignin pectin and waxes covering the external surface the alkali treated fibers adpf were filtered washed with ultrapure water and then treated with an acetic acid solution 10 wt before their bleaching with an aqueous solution containing hydrogen peroxide 5 wt and sodium hydroxide 4 wt at 100 c for 3 h under continuous agitation this treatment was repeated three times to remove residual lignin impurities resulting in pure cellulose product the bleached fibers bdpf were washed with ultrapure water and oven dried at 60 c the resulting dried fibers 2 5 g were mixed homogeneously with a solution of pir dissolved in dichloromethane with a ratio of 1 2 the mixture was then placed into a suitable mold 100 100 5 mm3 covered by ptfe sheets compressed until a thickness of 1 mm with a good fiber adhesion once pressed the rectangular plates were carefully removed from the mold refrigerated at 4 c until the solvent evaporation and finally cut into square blocks 5 5 1 mm3 2 3 tio2 bdpf pir blocks preparation tio2 bdpf pir photocatalysts were prepared following the same procedure described above once the bdpf pir blocks are obtained they are immersed into a 2 wt cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab solution under stirring for 30 min these latter have been recovered and added to a homogenous solution containing 1 g of tio2 dispersed in 250 ml of ultrapure water and kept under stirring for 12 h the resulting impregnated blocks were washed several times with water to remove the excess of no attached particles and finally dried overnight at room temperature until further use fig 1 the tio2 nanoparticles used in this work were prepared via a sol gel method in an acidic medium followed by calcination at 650 c for 3 h inspired by the methodology described by mahshid et al 21 2 4 characterization the crystal structure of the composite was identified by a panalytical diffractometer 45 kv 40 ma using cu kα radiation λ 1 54060 å in the range of 3 to 90 functional groups were performed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis using a perkinelmer spectrometer in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 the composite morphologies were characterized using scanning electron microscope thermo scientific quattro esem operated at 30 kv and equipped with an edx analyzer the thermal stability of the composite was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis tga using a q500 ta instruments usa from room temperature to 800 c with a heating rate of 10 c min bet surface area of the composite was determined by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms using a micromeritics surface area analyzer at 77 k prior to the measurements the composite was degassed at 80 c for 12 h 2 5 batch adsorption experiments the adsorption behaviors of the tio2 bdpf pir composite were studied toward methylene blue mb and congo red cr dyes adsorption tests were carried out in a batch system in dark by adding 2 g of the prepared blocks to 500 ml of dye solutions with initial concentrations ranging between 50 and 300 mg l at room temperature for 120 min ph studies were conducted at different ph values 4 9 the mb and cr concentrations in the solutions were determined using uv vis spectrophotometer at an absorbance wavelength of 664 and 500 nm respectively the adsorption capacity qt mg g was calculated according to the eq 1 1 q t mg g c 0 c t v m where c0 and ct are respectively the initial and equilibrium concentrations of dye in the solution mg l v is the solution volume l and m is the mass of adsorbent g 2 6 photocatalytic experiments photocatalytic performances of tio2 bdpf pir composite were assessed by the degradation of cr and mb dyes under uv light irradiation using an experimental setup patented and manufactured by our laboratory as shown in the fig 2 6 the setup contains four uv lamps 8 w placed in parallel the distance between the lamp and the liquid level was approximately 15 cm photocatalytic tests were carried out in alike conditions as the sorption process 2 g of the composite was magnetically agitated with 500 ml of dye solutions at room temperature the native ph of the solutions was adjusted to 4 and 6 for cr and mb respectively while the initial dye concentrations were chosen as follows 100 200 and 300 mg l prior to uv light irradiation the mixture was stirred in the dark for 30 min to achieve an adsorption desorption equilibrium all experiments were carried out in duplicate 3 results and discussions 3 1 x ray diffraction xrd analysis was carried out to verify the tio2 nanoparticles crystalline nature before and after bdpf pir blocks impregnation however it was found necessary to present firstly the x ray diffraction patterns of both raw and bleached fibers to elucidate the effect of the bleaching process on the fiber crystallinity thus as illustrated in fig 3 a both untreated and bleached date palm fibers have almost similar patterns characterized by the presence of the main characteristic peaks located at approximately 2θ equals to 15 16 and 22 4 indexed by 1 10 110 and 200 the lattice planes of cellulose i 22 23 in fact the untreated date palm fibers used in this work unlike other natural fibers are highly crystalline due to the weakness of the amorphous regions justifying the use of such fibers in such applications the intensity of the peak at 22 4 was increased after bleaching treatment indicating the success of this process in the elimination of undesirable non cellulosic polysaccharides such as wax hemicellulose lignin and other extractives leading therefore to higher fiber crystallinity 24 moreover xrd analysis results show that there is no structural change after the block preparation and the tio2 impregnation indeed as shown in fig 3b the bdpf pir impregnation by tio2 nanoparticles on the external surface using ctab surfactant has no effect either on the tio2 nanoparticles mixed phases anatase rutile or on the crystalline structure of the bdpf pir blocks the main characteristic peaks corresponding to the anatase phase located at 25 4 37 67 48 04 54 25 55 06 and 62 7 jcpds no 21 1272 and those attributed to the rutile one located at 27 32 35 83 41 13 and 53 8 jcpds no 21 1275 were clearly observed in the xrd pattern of the tio2 bdpf pir composite confirming the presence of tio2 on the resulting photocatalyst 3 2 ftir analysis fig 4 depicts the ftir spectra collected over the 400 4000 cm 1 region for raw and bleached date palm fibers as well as bdpf pir composite before and after impregnation using tio2 when comparing the ir spectra of fibers before and after bleaching it can be seen clearly that they displayed the same peaks with slight changes in terms of intensity the appearance of some new peaks or the disappearance of others from the figure the broad and the dominant band spectrum at 3360 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of oh groups 22 the absorption bands at 1733 and 1230 cm 1 are associated to the co stretching mode of hemicellulose and the co stretching vibration of the acetyl group in lignin 25 the peak intensities were immensely increased after the bleaching treatment indicating a reduction of carboxylic acids hemicellulose and lignin from the fiber surface during bleaching 16 26 the peaks observed in the region about 1448 and 1027 cm 1 belong to the ch2 symmetric bending and co groups of the cellulose respectively 27 the increase in their intensity revealed an increase in fibers crystallinity after bleaching which is consistent with xrd results from the ftir spectra of bdpf pir the peaks appearing at 2960 2920 2850 and 1645 cm 1 are assigned to the ch3 asymmetric ch2 asymmetric ch2 symmetric and cc stretching modes of the natural rubber isoprene unit respectively 28 the bdpf pir composites before and after impregnation using tio2 demonstrated almost the same peaks indicating that bdpf pir structure remains unchangeable after tio2 immobilization the only difference between them lies in the appearance of a broadband spectrum at 800 400 cm 1 which is attributed to the tio and ti o ti bonds vibrations characteristics of tio2 29 confirming the successful immobilization of titanium dioxide on the external surface of bdpf pir blocks 3 3 sem coupled with edx analysis sem micrographs of bdpf pir blocks before and after tio2 immobilization are displayed in fig 5 as can be clearly observed both composites presented highly microporous and compacted structures with interconnected pores due to the random assembly of the fibers using the polyisoprene binder in fact polyisoprene has been used in very small quantities only to promote partial binding of fibers without their entrapment resulting in highly entangled and fluffy architectures fig 5a after tio2 immobilization fig 5b a densely coated surface of the bdpf pir composite was observed with a quite rough appearance the tio2 nanoparticles are less aggregated owing to the presence of long hydrocarbon chains of ctab that prevents their agglomeration and facilitates their adhesion to the bdpf pir blocks 30 31 the data indicate that the presence of tio2 nanoparticles with less agglomeration on surface materials can lead to an increase in the final composite surface area enhancing therefore the pollutants adsorption on its external surface which is more beneficial for the photocatalysis process the edx spectra revealed the presence of the ti and o peaks attributed to the tio2 nanoparticles displaying their effective distribution on the bdpf pir blocks which was also confirmed by means of elemental mapping analysis as illustrated in fig 5c 3 4 thermogravimetric analysis tga the thermal stability of raw date palm fibers dpf bleached date palm fibers bdpf un impregnated blocks bdpf pir and tio2 impregnated blocks tio2 bdpf pir was determined using tga analysis at a heating rate of 10 c min under 60 of nitrogen and 40 of air as shown in fig 6 tga and dta analysis of raw and bleached date palm fibers exhibited almost similar thermal behaviors fig 6a and a the fibers degradation occurs generally in three stages the first mass loss detected below 100 c is attributed to the evaporation of water molecules namely physisorbed and chemically bonded water 32 the second and last losses that occurred beyond 100 c are basically assigned to lignocellulosic compounds degradation hemicellulose starts to decompose at low temperature 200 250 c followed by cellulose at 240 350 c and finally the lignin for a temperature above 300 c 25 33 tga and dta graphs of bdpf pir before and after tio2 immobilization are given in fig 6b and b respectively the degradation of the bdpf pir blocks as well occurred in three main stages involving water molecules evaporation hemicellulose and cellulose degradation 34 unlike tio2 bdpf pir composite thermal degradation of the tio2 bdpf pir composite occurs in a single step characterized by a single dtg peak around 320 330 c this peak can be associated with the degradation of the structure of cellulose proving its greater thermal stability compared to non impregnated blocks 3 5 textural properties analysis fig 7 illustrates the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms for bdpf pir blocks before and after tio2 immobilization according to the iupac classification the main adsorption desorption isotherm curves of both samples can be classified as iv isotherm type with an h3 hysteresis loop suggesting their mesoporous structures 35 36 the specific surface area of the blocks has been greatly improved after their impregnation with tio2 nanoparticles tio2 bdpf pir block possessed an important surface area 33 6643 m2 g nearly five times larger than that of non impregnated blocks 7 0752 m2 g in fact the presence of tio2 nanoparticles as a new phase on the external biochar surface already approved by sem micrographs creates more roughness and heterogeneity inducing an increase in the specific surface area for the composite this enhancement promotes more sorption sites and facilitates the diffusion of the dye molecules within the porous medium which will certainly be benefit for the adsorption and photocatalysis processes 3 6 adsorption study 3 6 1 effect of ph the initial ph of the dye solution plays great importance in the prediction of the main mechanisms involved in the whole purification process as it influences the surface charge of the sorbent as well as the generation rate of reactive radicals in the aqueous medium indeed various studies agreed upon that the initial ph solution strongly affects the adsorption capacities of dyes onto different sorbents due to the high correlation between ph and their surface charges nature 37 38 the effect of ph on the adsorption performances of tio2 bdpf pir blocks was investigated by varying the ph of the initial solution from 4 to 9 at room temperature with maintaining the initial dye concentrations constant at c0 50 mg l as displayed in fig 8 a the adsorption capacity of tio2 bdpf pir was found closely dependent on the initial ph solution either for mb or cr the amount of adsorbed methylene blue molecules on tio2 bdpf pir blocks increased with the increase in ph initial solution while that of cr shows the opposite the adsorption capacity of impregnated blocks for mb was determined to be equal to 12 5 mg g at an initial ph value of 6 against 10 81 mg g for cr at ph 4 these results can be attributed to the strong electrostatic interactions between the surface charges of the composite and those of dyes in fact with a ph isoelectric point phpzc of 5 88 and when the solution ph is underneath 5 88 the surface of the tio2 bdpf pir blocks becomes positively charged and improves the electrostatic attractions with congo red molecules since its isoelectric point is approximately 3 enhancing therefore the adsorption process 36 besides when the solution ph was higher than 5 88 the tio2 bdpf pir surface is negatively charged attracting more positively charged functional groups of mb dye leading therefore to strong electrostatic attractions and further to high adsorption capacities the literature has already reported similar results for the adsorption of different dyes from aqueous environments 39 40 3 6 2 effect of contact time and initial dye concentration contact time is one of the most key parameters affecting the adsorption process generally a good absorbent material is one that possesses high adsorption rate in a short time fig 8b illustrates the evaluation of the adsorbed quantity and removal rate of both mb and cr dyes as a function of time the experiments were performed at ambient temperature using 2 g of the sorbent and initial dye concentration of 50 mg l the adsorption of both dyes was faster within the first minutes it increased meaningfully with the increase of contact time and then declined gradually until reaching adsorption equilibrium of at least 40 min for mb and 90 min for cr in fact adsorption occurs spontaneously at the beginning due to the abundance and availability of active sites on the tio2 bdpf pir surface subsequently the dye molecules find it difficult to occupy the vacant sites due to the steric barrier between them thus leading to repulsive forces between the adsorbate and the adsorbent 41 the initial dye concentration is a further crucial parameter affecting the adsorption process the effect of initial dye concentration on the adsorption performances of tio2 bdpf pir blocks was investigated by varying concentration from 50 to 300 mg l maintaining sorbent amount constant at 2 g temperature at 25 c and ph at 4 for cr and ph 6 for mb respectively as illustrated in fig 8c and d increasing the initial concentration of mb and cr in the range of 50 to 300 mg l resulted in an incremental increase in the equilibrium adsorption capacity from 12 5 to 45 08 mg g and from 10 81 to 34 09 mg g for mb and cr respectively due to the promotion of a greater number of interactions between dye and adsorbent surface as well as the use of all active sites available for dye capturing 42 43 moreover it was observed that the uptake of dyes from aqueous solutions with lower concentrations was more fast compared to solutions with high concentrations from these results it is therefore evident that at high concentrations the adsorption capacity is consistently higher while at lower concentrations the removal rate of the dye is faster 3 6 3 adsorption isotherms in order to understand and predict the mechanisms involved during the adsorption process of mb and cr dyes onto tio2 bdpf pir blocks the experimental isotherm data were analyzed by the application of langmuir and freundlich models expressed according to the eqs 2 and 3 respectively 44 fig 9 a and b displayed the adsorption isotherms of both mb and cr dyes onto tio2 bdpf pir blocks respectively while table 1 summarized the fitting parameters and the linear regression correlation coefficient r2 corresponding to each model the higher correlation coefficient of langmuir as compared to freundlich one in the case of mb adsorption along with the theoretical adsorption capacity which is in good accordance with the experimental one indicates that the adsorption of mb onto the tio2 bdpf pir sorbent is monolayer adsorption with no transmigration in the adsorbent surface on the other hand in the case of cr adsorption it was observed that the experimental data of the adsorption of cr on tio2 bdpf pir composite agrees well with the freundlich model indicating that cr adsorption onto the blocks is multilayer adsorption moreover as the value of 1 n is less than unity it can be clearly concluded that the cr is favorably adsorbed by the composite and occurred on heterogeneous surfaces 2 1 q e 1 k l q m cⅇ 1 q m 3 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where qe is the dye amount adsorbed at equilibrium qm and kl are the langmuir constants for the adsorption capacity and adsorption rate respectively while kf is the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and n indicates the favorability of the adsorption process 3 6 4 adsorption kinetics the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models developed according to eqs 4 and 5 respectively 45 were used to further examine the adsorption rates of methylene blue and congo red dyes onto the tio2 bdpf pir composite linearized plots of the two models for the adsorption of mb and cr dyes onto the composite were illustrated in fig 9 c c d and d thus the calculated corresponding parameters and the linear regression correlation coefficient r2 are provided in table 2 the pseudo second order model determination coefficients r2 for mb and cr sorption were found to be closer to the unity in comparison with those of the pseudo first order model revealing that the pseudo second order model was the best model to explain the adsorption of mb and that of cr on tio2 bdpf pir blocks further the calculated equilibrium adsorption capacities qe cal from this model were found to be in good agreement with the experimental qe exp values suggesting that the adsorption of both dyes onto the composite is controlled by chemisorption besides the rate constant k2 of pseudo second order for both dyes decreased with increasing the initial dye concentration which confirmed a favorable process at higher initial dye concentration 4 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt are the amounts of dye molecules adsorbed onto tio2 bdpf pir composite at equilibrium and given time t respectively k1 min 1 and k2 g mg 1 min 1 are the rate constant for the pseudo first order and pseudo second order adsorption respectively 3 7 photocatalysis after reaching the adsorption equilibrium the photocatalytic activity of tio2 bdpf pir photocatalyst was investigated through the degradation of mb and cr dye solutions under uv light irradiation as shown in fig 10 as mentioned above the material developed in this work highly possessed sorption performances toward both dyes as a function of time regardless of the initial solution concentration due to their good specific surface area and high porous structure once the uv light irradiations are turned on remarkable improvements in both dyes photodegradation were observed confirming the synergetic relationship between adsorption upon the highly porous blocks and degradation involving tio2 nanoparticles in the tio2 bdpf pir composite material typically 97 95 of mb and 90 57 of cr were eliminated after 2 h of uv irradiations in the case of c0 100 mg l the difference in the tio2 bdpf pir performances toward the two dyes can be assigned to their different chemical nature and structure or to the type of bonds that can be created between them and the sorbent surface the kinetics of photocatalytic degradation of mb and cr dyes by tio2 bdpf pir photocatalyst was investigated using the pseudo first order langmuir hinshelwood lh model given by eq 5 46 fig 10a and b displayed the kinetic plots of ln c c0 as a function of time irradiation of tio2 bdpf pir for mb and cr respectively as can be seen the l h plots for mb and cr photodegradation are nearly linear with correlation coefficients r2 close to 1 table 3 whatever the initial dye concentration suggesting that the langmuir hinshelwood model is more appropriate to describe the photocatalytic degradation of mb and cr dyes besides the apparent rate constants kapp for both dyes degradation calculated from the linear plots based on eq 6 showed an increase as the initial dye concentration decreased indeed the photocatalytic degradation of mb becomes twice faster when the initial dye concentration decreased from 300 to 100 mg l while that of cr becomes almost three times quicker suggesting faster dye molecules transport from solution to the photocatalyst surface at low concentrations furthermore the decrease in the photocatalytic process efficiency with increasing concentration can be also attributed to the saturation of adsorption active sites on the photocatalyst surface as well as to the difficulty penetration of uv light irradiation into the aqueous suspensions 47 6 ln c c 0 k app t where kapp is the first order rate constant c0 and c are the concentration of dye at t0 and t respectively the comparison of the adsorption capacity of the tio2 bdpf pir composite compared to various adsorbents previously reported in the literature for methylene blue and congo red dyes are shown in table 4 3 8 possible mechanism for photodegradation of dyes the proposed degradation mechanism of methylene blue and congo red dyes using tio2 bdpf pir composite is illustrated in fig 11 based on the above results the mechanism for dyes photodegradation can be occurred as follow 1 migration and diffusion of dye molecules from the liquid solution to the surface of the photocatalyst 2 adsorption of dyes molecules over the photocatalyst surface through two steps as displayed in the figure below electrostatic interactions between positively charged nitrogen center of dye with the negatively charged surface of the composite hydrogen bonding formation between hydroxyl groups of tio2 bdpf pir composite and nitrogen atom of mb and cr dyes as displayed in the figure below 3 decomposition of organic dyes the irradiation of the photocatalyst with uv light leads to the generation of electrons e and holes h in conduction and valence bands respectively the holes interact with water molecules h2o on the surface to generate highly reactive hydroxyl radical oh while the electrons interact with the oxygen adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface to form superoxide anion o2 radicals through oxidative and reductive mechanisms these species attack the aromatic rings of dyes leading to the direct breaking of benzene ring c s c bond c n and c c bonds and azo bond n n leading to the generation of various reaction intermediates products which were be completely mineralized into carbon dioxide water and other minerals 3 9 reusability and reuse the evaluation of the recyclability and durability of the developed photocatalyst is a key parameter to consider for possible industrial applications reuse tests of the developed photocatalyst tio2 bdpf pir are performed by making five adsorption photocatalysis cycles fig 12 illustrated the photodegradation efficiency of mb and cr dyes under uv light irradiations for five consecutive cycles it was observed that the photocatalytic performances of the tio2 bdpf pir for both dyes decreased as the cycle number increased the observed degradation of mb for the 5 cycles was 97 95 97 21 94 95 90 47 and 83 54 respectively against 90 57 89 45 81 04 72 19 and 60 2 for cr dye which may be assigned either to the saturation of active sites caused by the accumulation of dyes molecules degradation on the composite surface or to the loss of the photocatalyst mass during the tests even so it remains very satisfying especially toward mb 4 conclusion this paper assesses the photocatalytic performances of a novel photocatalyst based on tio2 nanoparticles immobilized on bleached date palm fibers combined via a simple method in the form of highly porous blocks for the removal of both anionic and cationic dyes from aqueous solutions in fact due to their well interconnected structure important surface area and abundant functional groups tio2 bdpf pir blocks were found efficient for mb and cr uptake even at high concentrations moreover due to the presence of tio2 nanoparticles on their external surface the composite exhibited also excellent photocatalysis performances nearly 97 95 and 90 57 of mb and cr were degraded at optimal ph values of 6 and 4 respectively on 2 h of uv irradiations recyclability tests show that the as prepared composite sustains always high photocatalytic activity and could be reused more than five times making it more promising for the removal of organic contaminants in aquatic environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13404,the combination of nanotechnology and green chemistry based on the valorization of natural resources for environmental applications becomes a top priority for scientific researchers in the last decades biomass with fascinating features including abundance environmentally safe nature and low cost can be easily manipulated as an infinite source for green and advanced sorbent materials design in this study date palm fibers as one of the most plenty resources in morocco was exploited to extract pure cellulosic fibers which were combined with tio2 nanoparticles in the form of highly porous

dyes and excellent regeneration after several cycles with easier separation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords date palm fiber tio2polyisoprene highly porous block dyes adsorption photocatalysis 1 introduction over the last decades heterogeneous photocatalysis based on semiconductor materials has gained tremendous advancements in various application fields such as environmental remediation photocatalysis energy conversion and storage cosmetics etc 1 4 titanium dioxide tio2 with excellent chemical stability strong oxidizing power and high ability in degrading a wide range of pollutants has emerged as one of the most promising photocatalysts for environmental applications 5 8 the difficulties in separating it after the photocatalytic process and easer tendency to agglomeration are the serious impediments limiting its feasibility for industrial applications 9 10 indeed various studies have shown that the immobilization of tio2 photocatalyst onto different supports such as glass polymers carbonaceous nanomaterials clays and many others can solve those problems 11 14 nonetheless preoccupy and obsessed with green chemistry why not thinking of developing environmental friendly materials based on natural resources from biomass such as natural fibers for supporting tio2 nanoparticles natural fibers are abundant cheap and renewable moreover they possessed high mechanical properties and high adsorption capacity toward a large span of contaminants 15 17 indeed combining the tio2 with natural fibers may be more advantageous not only to facilitate its recovery but also to enhance its photocatalytic performances based on the literature review it seems that a lot of natural fibers have been used as support for tio2 in wastewater treatment wool fibers were successfully impregnated with tio2 zro2 and used as photocatalyst for the photodegradation of methylene blue mb and eosin yellowish dyes 18 natural luffa cylindrica fibers were also used for the tio2 immobilization for efficient degradation of methanol and mb 19 thus despite their advantages fibers have hydrophobic groups which decrease their interaction with tio2 requiring further chemical modifications 16 20 to the best of our knowledge there is no study to date relating the combination of date palm fibers and tio2 photocatalyst for the removal of organic dyes from wastewater therefore the originality of this work lies in the development for the first time of a novel highly porous photocatalyst based on tio2 date palm fiber as the cellulosic source and polyisoprene as a binder with well regulated internal channels good surface area excellent sorption performances and high photocatalytic activity for the removal of both anionic and cationic dyes from aqueous media 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials date palm fibers dpf were collected from the leaves of date palm trees grown in morocco poly cis 1 4 isoprene pir used as a linker with a density of 0 9603 g cm3 was obtained from ivory coast titanium iv n butoxide reagent grade c16h36o4ti 340 32 g mol 97 ti obu 4 nitric acid 65 hydrochloric acid 37 sodium hydroxide 97 hydrogen peroxide methylene blue mb c16h18cln3s3 319 85 g mol 1 cationic dye and congo red cr c32h22n6na2o6s2 696 66 g mol 1 anionic dye were supplied from sigma aldrich dichloromethane dcm and propan 2 ol 99 5 were purchased from carlo erba reagents ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm 1 was used to prepare all solutions temperature and ph were measured using a digital multimeter thermal scientific orion star mb and cr concentrations were measured by spectrophotometer model uv 1900 shimadzu uvc lamps philips tuv 8 w were used as irradiation source for photocatalytic tests all the reagents and solvents were used without any further purification 2 2 bdpf pir blocks preparation the preparation of the bdpf pir blocks was carried out in two successive steps as follows date palm leaves were carefully extracted from the trees washed with tap water and detergent to remove surface impurities followed by air drying for 24 h the obtained dried sheets were ground by a fritsch pulverisette 19 mill having a sieve opening of 2 mm followed by sieving through a sieve of 0 5 mm to obtain homogeneous fibers the resulting fibers dpf were subsequently undergoing an alkaline treatment by their immersing in an aqueous solution containing 4 wt of sodium hydroxide for 20 h at room temperature under stirring to remove non cellulosic components hemicellulose and lignin pectin and waxes covering the external surface the alkali treated fibers adpf were filtered washed with ultrapure water and then treated with an acetic acid solution 10 wt before their bleaching with an aqueous solution containing hydrogen peroxide 5 wt and sodium hydroxide 4 wt at 100 c for 3 h under continuous agitation this treatment was repeated three times to remove residual lignin impurities resulting in pure cellulose product the bleached fibers bdpf were washed with ultrapure water and oven dried at 60 c the resulting dried fibers 2 5 g were mixed homogeneously with a solution of pir dissolved in dichloromethane with a ratio of 1 2 the mixture was then placed into a suitable mold 100 100 5 mm3 covered by ptfe sheets compressed until a thickness of 1 mm with a good fiber adhesion once pressed the rectangular plates were carefully removed from the mold refrigerated at 4 c until the solvent evaporation and finally cut into square blocks 5 5 1 mm3 2 3 tio2 bdpf pir blocks preparation tio2 bdpf pir photocatalysts were prepared following the same procedure described above once the bdpf pir blocks are obtained they are immersed into a 2 wt cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab solution under stirring for 30 min these latter have been recovered and added to a homogenous solution containing 1 g of tio2 dispersed in 250 ml of ultrapure water and kept under stirring for 12 h the resulting impregnated blocks were washed several times with water to remove the excess of no attached particles and finally dried overnight at room temperature until further use fig 1 the tio2 nanoparticles used in this work were prepared via a sol gel method in an acidic medium followed by calcination at 650 c for 3 h inspired by the methodology described by mahshid et al 21 2 4 characterization the crystal structure of the composite was identified by a panalytical diffractometer 45 kv 40 ma using cu kα radiation λ 1 54060 å in the range of 3 to 90 functional groups were performed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis using a perkinelmer spectrometer in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 the composite morphologies were characterized using scanning electron microscope thermo scientific quattro esem operated at 30 kv and equipped with an edx analyzer the thermal stability of the composite was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis tga using a q500 ta instruments usa from room temperature to 800 c with a heating rate of 10 c min bet surface area of the composite was determined by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms using a micromeritics surface area analyzer at 77 k prior to the measurements the composite was degassed at 80 c for 12 h 2 5 batch adsorption experiments the adsorption behaviors of the tio2 bdpf pir composite were studied toward methylene blue mb and congo red cr dyes adsorption tests were carried out in a batch system in dark by adding 2 g of the prepared blocks to 500 ml of dye solutions with initial concentrations ranging between 50 and 300 mg l at room temperature for 120 min ph studies were conducted at different ph values 4 9 the mb and cr concentrations in the solutions were determined using uv vis spectrophotometer at an absorbance wavelength of 664 and 500 nm respectively the adsorption capacity qt mg g was calculated according to the eq 1 1 q t mg g c 0 c t v m where c0 and ct are respectively the initial and equilibrium concentrations of dye in the solution mg l v is the solution volume l and m is the mass of adsorbent g 2 6 photocatalytic experiments photocatalytic performances of tio2 bdpf pir composite were assessed by the degradation of cr and mb dyes under uv light irradiation using an experimental setup patented and manufactured by our laboratory as shown in the fig 2 6 the setup contains four uv lamps 8 w placed in parallel the distance between the lamp and the liquid level was approximately 15 cm photocatalytic tests were carried out in alike conditions as the sorption process 2 g of the composite was magnetically agitated with 500 ml of dye solutions at room temperature the native ph of the solutions was adjusted to 4 and 6 for cr and mb respectively while the initial dye concentrations were chosen as follows 100 200 and 300 mg l prior to uv light irradiation the mixture was stirred in the dark for 30 min to achieve an adsorption desorption equilibrium all experiments were carried out in duplicate 3 results and discussions 3 1 x ray diffraction xrd analysis was carried out to verify the tio2 nanoparticles crystalline nature before and after bdpf pir blocks impregnation however it was found necessary to present firstly the x ray diffraction patterns of both raw and bleached fibers to elucidate the effect of the bleaching process on the fiber crystallinity thus as illustrated in fig 3 a both untreated and bleached date palm fibers have almost similar patterns characterized by the presence of the main characteristic peaks located at approximately 2θ equals to 15 16 and 22 4 indexed by 1 10 110 and 200 the lattice planes of cellulose i 22 23 in fact the untreated date palm fibers used in this work unlike other natural fibers are highly crystalline due to the weakness of the amorphous regions justifying the use of such fibers in such applications the intensity of the peak at 22 4 was increased after bleaching treatment indicating the success of this process in the elimination of undesirable non cellulosic polysaccharides such as wax hemicellulose lignin and other extractives leading therefore to higher fiber crystallinity 24 moreover xrd analysis results show that there is no structural change after the block preparation and the tio2 impregnation indeed as shown in fig 3b the bdpf pir impregnation by tio2 nanoparticles on the external surface using ctab surfactant has no effect either on the tio2 nanoparticles mixed phases anatase rutile or on the crystalline structure of the bdpf pir blocks the main characteristic peaks corresponding to the anatase phase located at 25 4 37 67 48 04 54 25 55 06 and 62 7 jcpds no 21 1272 and those attributed to the rutile one located at 27 32 35 83 41 13 and 53 8 jcpds no 21 1275 were clearly observed in the xrd pattern of the tio2 bdpf pir composite confirming the presence of tio2 on the resulting photocatalyst 3 2 ftir analysis fig 4 depicts the ftir spectra collected over the 400 4000 cm 1 region for raw and bleached date palm fibers as well as bdpf pir composite before and after impregnation using tio2 when comparing the ir spectra of fibers before and after bleaching it can be seen clearly that they displayed the same peaks with slight changes in terms of intensity the appearance of some new peaks or the disappearance of others from the figure the broad and the dominant band spectrum at 3360 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of oh groups 22 the absorption bands at 1733 and 1230 cm 1 are associated to the co stretching mode of hemicellulose and the co stretching vibration of the acetyl group in lignin 25 the peak intensities were immensely increased after the bleaching treatment indicating a reduction of carboxylic acids hemicellulose and lignin from the fiber surface during bleaching 16 26 the peaks observed in the region about 1448 and 1027 cm 1 belong to the ch2 symmetric bending and co groups of the cellulose respectively 27 the increase in their intensity revealed an increase in fibers crystallinity after bleaching which is consistent with xrd results from the ftir spectra of bdpf pir the peaks appearing at 2960 2920 2850 and 1645 cm 1 are assigned to the ch3 asymmetric ch2 asymmetric ch2 symmetric and cc stretching modes of the natural rubber isoprene unit respectively 28 the bdpf pir composites before and after impregnation using tio2 demonstrated almost the same peaks indicating that bdpf pir structure remains unchangeable after tio2 immobilization the only difference between them lies in the appearance of a broadband spectrum at 800 400 cm 1 which is attributed to the tio and ti o ti bonds vibrations characteristics of tio2 29 confirming the successful immobilization of titanium dioxide on the external surface of bdpf pir blocks 3 3 sem coupled with edx analysis sem micrographs of bdpf pir blocks before and after tio2 immobilization are displayed in fig 5 as can be clearly observed both composites presented highly microporous and compacted structures with interconnected pores due to the random assembly of the fibers using the polyisoprene binder in fact polyisoprene has been used in very small quantities only to promote partial binding of fibers without their entrapment resulting in highly entangled and fluffy architectures fig 5a after tio2 immobilization fig 5b a densely coated surface of the bdpf pir composite was observed with a quite rough appearance the tio2 nanoparticles are less aggregated owing to the presence of long hydrocarbon chains of ctab that prevents their agglomeration and facilitates their adhesion to the bdpf pir blocks 30 31 the data indicate that the presence of tio2 nanoparticles with less agglomeration on surface materials can lead to an increase in the final composite surface area enhancing therefore the pollutants adsorption on its external surface which is more beneficial for the photocatalysis process the edx spectra revealed the presence of the ti and o peaks attributed to the tio2 nanoparticles displaying their effective distribution on the bdpf pir blocks which was also confirmed by means of elemental mapping analysis as illustrated in fig 5c 3 4 thermogravimetric analysis tga the thermal stability of raw date palm fibers dpf bleached date palm fibers bdpf un impregnated blocks bdpf pir and tio2 impregnated blocks tio2 bdpf pir was determined using tga analysis at a heating rate of 10 c min under 60 of nitrogen and 40 of air as shown in fig 6 tga and dta analysis of raw and bleached date palm fibers exhibited almost similar thermal behaviors fig 6a and a the fibers degradation occurs generally in three stages the first mass loss detected below 100 c is attributed to the evaporation of water molecules namely physisorbed and chemically bonded water 32 the second and last losses that occurred beyond 100 c are basically assigned to lignocellulosic compounds degradation hemicellulose starts to decompose at low temperature 200 250 c followed by cellulose at 240 350 c and finally the lignin for a temperature above 300 c 25 33 tga and dta graphs of bdpf pir before and after tio2 immobilization are given in fig 6b and b respectively the degradation of the bdpf pir blocks as well occurred in three main stages involving water molecules evaporation hemicellulose and cellulose degradation 34 unlike tio2 bdpf pir composite thermal degradation of the tio2 bdpf pir composite occurs in a single step characterized by a single dtg peak around 320 330 c this peak can be associated with the degradation of the structure of cellulose proving its greater thermal stability compared to non impregnated blocks 3 5 textural properties analysis fig 7 illustrates the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms for bdpf pir blocks before and after tio2 immobilization according to the iupac classification the main adsorption desorption isotherm curves of both samples can be classified as iv isotherm type with an h3 hysteresis loop suggesting their mesoporous structures 35 36 the specific surface area of the blocks has been greatly improved after their impregnation with tio2 nanoparticles tio2 bdpf pir block possessed an important surface area 33 6643 m2 g nearly five times larger than that of non impregnated blocks 7 0752 m2 g in fact the presence of tio2 nanoparticles as a new phase on the external biochar surface already approved by sem micrographs creates more roughness and heterogeneity inducing an increase in the specific surface area for the composite this enhancement promotes more sorption sites and facilitates the diffusion of the dye molecules within the porous medium which will certainly be benefit for the adsorption and photocatalysis processes 3 6 adsorption study 3 6 1 effect of ph the initial ph of the dye solution plays great importance in the prediction of the main mechanisms involved in the whole purification process as it influences the surface charge of the sorbent as well as the generation rate of reactive radicals in the aqueous medium indeed various studies agreed upon that the initial ph solution strongly affects the adsorption capacities of dyes onto different sorbents due to the high correlation between ph and their surface charges nature 37 38 the effect of ph on the adsorption performances of tio2 bdpf pir blocks was investigated by varying the ph of the initial solution from 4 to 9 at room temperature with maintaining the initial dye concentrations constant at c0 50 mg l as displayed in fig 8 a the adsorption capacity of tio2 bdpf pir was found closely dependent on the initial ph solution either for mb or cr the amount of adsorbed methylene blue molecules on tio2 bdpf pir blocks increased with the increase in ph initial solution while that of cr shows the opposite the adsorption capacity of impregnated blocks for mb was determined to be equal to 12 5 mg g at an initial ph value of 6 against 10 81 mg g for cr at ph 4 these results can be attributed to the strong electrostatic interactions between the surface charges of the composite and those of dyes in fact with a ph isoelectric point phpzc of 5 88 and when the solution ph is underneath 5 88 the surface of the tio2 bdpf pir blocks becomes positively charged and improves the electrostatic attractions with congo red molecules since its isoelectric point is approximately 3 enhancing therefore the adsorption process 36 besides when the solution ph was higher than 5 88 the tio2 bdpf pir surface is negatively charged attracting more positively charged functional groups of mb dye leading therefore to strong electrostatic attractions and further to high adsorption capacities the literature has already reported similar results for the adsorption of different dyes from aqueous environments 39 40 3 6 2 effect of contact time and initial dye concentration contact time is one of the most key parameters affecting the adsorption process generally a good absorbent material is one that possesses high adsorption rate in a short time fig 8b illustrates the evaluation of the adsorbed quantity and removal rate of both mb and cr dyes as a function of time the experiments were performed at ambient temperature using 2 g of the sorbent and initial dye concentration of 50 mg l the adsorption of both dyes was faster within the first minutes it increased meaningfully with the increase of contact time and then declined gradually until reaching adsorption equilibrium of at least 40 min for mb and 90 min for cr in fact adsorption occurs spontaneously at the beginning due to the abundance and availability of active sites on the tio2 bdpf pir surface subsequently the dye molecules find it difficult to occupy the vacant sites due to the steric barrier between them thus leading to repulsive forces between the adsorbate and the adsorbent 41 the initial dye concentration is a further crucial parameter affecting the adsorption process the effect of initial dye concentration on the adsorption performances of tio2 bdpf pir blocks was investigated by varying concentration from 50 to 300 mg l maintaining sorbent amount constant at 2 g temperature at 25 c and ph at 4 for cr and ph 6 for mb respectively as illustrated in fig 8c and d increasing the initial concentration of mb and cr in the range of 50 to 300 mg l resulted in an incremental increase in the equilibrium adsorption capacity from 12 5 to 45 08 mg g and from 10 81 to 34 09 mg g for mb and cr respectively due to the promotion of a greater number of interactions between dye and adsorbent surface as well as the use of all active sites available for dye capturing 42 43 moreover it was observed that the uptake of dyes from aqueous solutions with lower concentrations was more fast compared to solutions with high concentrations from these results it is therefore evident that at high concentrations the adsorption capacity is consistently higher while at lower concentrations the removal rate of the dye is faster 3 6 3 adsorption isotherms in order to understand and predict the mechanisms involved during the adsorption process of mb and cr dyes onto tio2 bdpf pir blocks the experimental isotherm data were analyzed by the application of langmuir and freundlich models expressed according to the eqs 2 and 3 respectively 44 fig 9 a and b displayed the adsorption isotherms of both mb and cr dyes onto tio2 bdpf pir blocks respectively while table 1 summarized the fitting parameters and the linear regression correlation coefficient r2 corresponding to each model the higher correlation coefficient of langmuir as compared to freundlich one in the case of mb adsorption along with the theoretical adsorption capacity which is in good accordance with the experimental one indicates that the adsorption of mb onto the tio2 bdpf pir sorbent is monolayer adsorption with no transmigration in the adsorbent surface on the other hand in the case of cr adsorption it was observed that the experimental data of the adsorption of cr on tio2 bdpf pir composite agrees well with the freundlich model indicating that cr adsorption onto the blocks is multilayer adsorption moreover as the value of 1 n is less than unity it can be clearly concluded that the cr is favorably adsorbed by the composite and occurred on heterogeneous surfaces 2 1 q e 1 k l q m cⅇ 1 q m 3 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where qe is the dye amount adsorbed at equilibrium qm and kl are the langmuir constants for the adsorption capacity and adsorption rate respectively while kf is the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and n indicates the favorability of the adsorption process 3 6 4 adsorption kinetics the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models developed according to eqs 4 and 5 respectively 45 were used to further examine the adsorption rates of methylene blue and congo red dyes onto the tio2 bdpf pir composite linearized plots of the two models for the adsorption of mb and cr dyes onto the composite were illustrated in fig 9 c c d and d thus the calculated corresponding parameters and the linear regression correlation coefficient r2 are provided in table 2 the pseudo second order model determination coefficients r2 for mb and cr sorption were found to be closer to the unity in comparison with those of the pseudo first order model revealing that the pseudo second order model was the best model to explain the adsorption of mb and that of cr on tio2 bdpf pir blocks further the calculated equilibrium adsorption capacities qe cal from this model were found to be in good agreement with the experimental qe exp values suggesting that the adsorption of both dyes onto the composite is controlled by chemisorption besides the rate constant k2 of pseudo second order for both dyes decreased with increasing the initial dye concentration which confirmed a favorable process at higher initial dye concentration 4 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt are the amounts of dye molecules adsorbed onto tio2 bdpf pir composite at equilibrium and given time t respectively k1 min 1 and k2 g mg 1 min 1 are the rate constant for the pseudo first order and pseudo second order adsorption respectively 3 7 photocatalysis after reaching the adsorption equilibrium the photocatalytic activity of tio2 bdpf pir photocatalyst was investigated through the degradation of mb and cr dye solutions under uv light irradiation as shown in fig 10 as mentioned above the material developed in this work highly possessed sorption performances toward both dyes as a function of time regardless of the initial solution concentration due to their good specific surface area and high porous structure once the uv light irradiations are turned on remarkable improvements in both dyes photodegradation were observed confirming the synergetic relationship between adsorption upon the highly porous blocks and degradation involving tio2 nanoparticles in the tio2 bdpf pir composite material typically 97 95 of mb and 90 57 of cr were eliminated after 2 h of uv irradiations in the case of c0 100 mg l the difference in the tio2 bdpf pir performances toward the two dyes can be assigned to their different chemical nature and structure or to the type of bonds that can be created between them and the sorbent surface the kinetics of photocatalytic degradation of mb and cr dyes by tio2 bdpf pir photocatalyst was investigated using the pseudo first order langmuir hinshelwood lh model given by eq 5 46 fig 10a and b displayed the kinetic plots of ln c c0 as a function of time irradiation of tio2 bdpf pir for mb and cr respectively as can be seen the l h plots for mb and cr photodegradation are nearly linear with correlation coefficients r2 close to 1 table 3 whatever the initial dye concentration suggesting that the langmuir hinshelwood model is more appropriate to describe the photocatalytic degradation of mb and cr dyes besides the apparent rate constants kapp for both dyes degradation calculated from the linear plots based on eq 6 showed an increase as the initial dye concentration decreased indeed the photocatalytic degradation of mb becomes twice faster when the initial dye concentration decreased from 300 to 100 mg l while that of cr becomes almost three times quicker suggesting faster dye molecules transport from solution to the photocatalyst surface at low concentrations furthermore the decrease in the photocatalytic process efficiency with increasing concentration can be also attributed to the saturation of adsorption active sites on the photocatalyst surface as well as to the difficulty penetration of uv light irradiation into the aqueous suspensions 47 6 ln c c 0 k app t where kapp is the first order rate constant c0 and c are the concentration of dye at t0 and t respectively the comparison of the adsorption capacity of the tio2 bdpf pir composite compared to various adsorbents previously reported in the literature for methylene blue and congo red dyes are shown in table 4 3 8 possible mechanism for photodegradation of dyes the proposed degradation mechanism of methylene blue and congo red dyes using tio2 bdpf pir composite is illustrated in fig 11 based on the above results the mechanism for dyes photodegradation can be occurred as follow 1 migration and diffusion of dye molecules from the liquid solution to the surface of the photocatalyst 2 adsorption of dyes molecules over the photocatalyst surface through two steps as displayed in the figure below electrostatic interactions between positively charged nitrogen center of dye with the negatively charged surface of the composite hydrogen bonding formation between hydroxyl groups of tio2 bdpf pir composite and nitrogen atom of mb and cr dyes as displayed in the figure below 3 decomposition of organic dyes the irradiation of the photocatalyst with uv light leads to the generation of electrons e and holes h in conduction and valence bands respectively the holes interact with water molecules h2o on the surface to generate highly reactive hydroxyl radical oh while the electrons interact with the oxygen adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface to form superoxide anion o2 radicals through oxidative and reductive mechanisms these species attack the aromatic rings of dyes leading to the direct breaking of benzene ring c s c bond c n and c c bonds and azo bond n n leading to the generation of various reaction intermediates products which were be completely mineralized into carbon dioxide water and other minerals 3 9 reusability and reuse the evaluation of the recyclability and durability of the developed photocatalyst is a key parameter to consider for possible industrial applications reuse tests of the developed photocatalyst tio2 bdpf pir are performed by making five adsorption photocatalysis cycles fig 12 illustrated the photodegradation efficiency of mb and cr dyes under uv light irradiations for five consecutive cycles it was observed that the photocatalytic performances of the tio2 bdpf pir for both dyes decreased as the cycle number increased the observed degradation of mb for the 5 cycles was 97 95 97 21 94 95 90 47 and 83 54 respectively against 90 57 89 45 81 04 72 19 and 60 2 for cr dye which may be assigned either to the saturation of active sites caused by the accumulation of dyes molecules degradation on the composite surface or to the loss of the photocatalyst mass during the tests even so it remains very satisfying especially toward mb 4 conclusion this paper assesses the photocatalytic performances of a novel photocatalyst based on tio2 nanoparticles immobilized on bleached date palm fibers combined via a simple method in the form of highly porous blocks for the removal of both anionic and cationic dyes from aqueous solutions in fact due to their well interconnected structure important surface area and abundant functional groups tio2 bdpf pir blocks were found efficient for mb and cr uptake even at high concentrations moreover due to the presence of tio2 nanoparticles on their external surface the composite exhibited also excellent photocatalysis performances nearly 97 95 and 90 57 of mb and cr were degraded at optimal ph values of 6 and 4 respectively on 2 h of uv irradiations recyclability tests show that the as prepared composite sustains always high photocatalytic activity and could be reused more than five times making it more promising for the removal of organic contaminants in aquatic environments declaration of competing interest
