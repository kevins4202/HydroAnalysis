485,in this paper a computational framework based on the material point method mpm is developed to study the coupled seepage erosion deformation process within unsaturated soils based on the mixture theory the unsaturated erodible soil is conceptualized as a three phase multi species porous medium which is represented as a set of lagrangian material points in a three phase multi species single point mpm framework governing equations as well as constitutive models for describing the coupled seepage erosion deformation behaviour within unsaturated erodible soils are presented the solid skeleton is modelled as an elasto plastic material the pore water is treated as a weakly compressible fluid while the fine particles in the solid matrix can be eroded and transferred into liquidised fine particles and transported with the flowing liquid this governing system is discretised with the generalized interpolation material point gimp method and solved explicitly the proposed coupled seepage erosion deformation gimp is validated via three numerical examples and then employed for simulating the rainfall induced slope failure process involving internal erosion thanks to the capability of the mpm in capturing large deformations the evolution of the coupled seepage erosion deformation behaviour during the whole slope failure process can be obtained this suggests that the proposed coupled gimp framework is a promising approach for future studies of internal erosion problems in unsaturated soils involving complex multi couplings of seepage flow phase change and large deformations which are difficult to be modelled by traditional mesh based methods keywords material point method internal erosion seepage deformation unsaturated soils large deformation 1 introduction soils in many earth structures such as dams levees and colluvial slopes are usually composed of mixed coarse and fine particles with a broadly graded or gap graded soil structure within these soils the coarse soil skeleton is supposed to support and transmit the external stresses while fine particles can possibly move through the constrictions among these coarse particles upon sufficient seepage velocity fine particles in these soils are easy to be detached from the soil skeleton by the interstitial flow and transported with the seeping liquid within the pores formed by the coarse matrix this seepage induced internal erosion i e suffusion in this study process will inevitably alter the local distribution of the size and content of fine particles in soils lead to local variations of hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of soils and may destabilize the soil structure accordingly lots of damages and failures of dams luo et al 2017 embankments zhang et al 2013 as well as failure of unsaturated natural slopes crosta and di prisco 1999 cui et al 2014 2017 hu et al 2018 are associated with these internal erosion processes internal erosion is a complex multi physics coupled process which usually involves various coupled behaviour of different phases such as water seepage flow liquefaction of solid fine particles transport of liquidised fine particles and the deformation of soil skeleton traditionally two types of numerical approaches are usually used to simulate the internal erosion phenomena the first type is based on the discrete approach the discrete element method dem is adopted to consider the properties of the material at the grain scale and is usually coupled with computational fluid dynamics cfd in order to consider the water flow effects within the pores abdoulaye et al 2016 tao and tao 2017 cheng et al 2018 the second type is based on the continuous approach in which the finite element method fem is usually used to solve the coupled governing equations implicitly though the discrete methods can represent fairly well the microstructure and describe better the physical mechanisms within granular materials they cannot provide a sufficiently accurate representation of the problems at the scale of the geotechnical structure due to the restriction of number of particles yang and yin 2018 while the continuous approach permits work to be done at the scale of an entire engineering structure such as the simulations of piping of earth dams fujisawa et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 internal erosion induced dike failure yang and yin 2018 suffusion of landslide dams uzuoka et al 2012 and fines migration effects on the unsaturated slope stability zhang et al 2017 lei et al 2017a b however as a mesh based method fem suffers from severe numerical issues related to the mesh distortion when simulating problems with large deformations soga et al 2016 therefore these mesh based models can only deal with the evolution of internal erosion process and the associated hydro mechanical responses within soils in the pre failure regime with small deformations but not the post failure behaviours such as the progressive failure and run out of the failure mass which involves large deformations and need to be dealt with by other advanced numerical methods in the past few decades mesh free methods such as smooth particle hydrodynamics sph gingold and monaghan 1977 particle finite element method pfem onate et al 2004 finite element method with lagrangian integration points femlip moresi et al 2003 and material point method mpm sulsky et al 1994 have been developed successfully and gained popularity for simulating large deformation problems though each with their own inherent drawbacks as reviewed in soga et al 2016 among various mesh free methods mpm appears to be one of the most popular methods chosen by the geomechanics community thanks to some of its attractive features 1 mpm is a hybrid eulerian lagrangian approach with moving lagrangian material points and an eulerian background mesh which facilitates the application of various boundary conditions 2 it can simulate large deformation problems without frequent re meshing 3 advanced history dependent soil constitutive models as well as other well established knowledge from fem can be adopted easily in addition mpm is also well suited for coupled multi physics problems in the context of coupled hydro mechanical problems two kinds of mpm approaches can be used to account for the solid fluid interactions the first one as developed and adopted by zhang et al 2009 zabala and alonso 2011 jassim et al 2013 and so on used one layer of material points to carry the information of both solid and liquid phases i e two phase single point formulation the second one as presented in abe et al 2014 bandara and soga 2015 liu et al 2017 and so on adopted two layers of material points to represent the solid skeleton and the liquid phase separately i e two phase double point formulation the two phase double point formulation can be extended to cases when the fluid motion inside the pores is non laminar e g yamaguchi et al 2020 but with relatively higher computer costs ceccato et al 2018 whereas the two phase single point formulation is straightforward to be extended to unsaturated cases e g yerro et al 2015 bandara et al 2016 wang et al 2018 and is easy to account for other coupled physical processes such as the coupled thermo hydro mechanical process pinyol et al 2018 though mesh free methods have been adopted widely for modelling hydro mechanical problems with large deformations e g bandara et al 2016 bui and nguyen 2017 monforte et al 2019 their application on modelling seepage erosion couplings during internal erosion is rare maeda and kondo 2014 have tried to use sph for modelling progressive seepage failure and depression with internal erosion in their sph model the soil phase and the water phase are represented by a layer of soil particles and a layer of water particles which overlaps with each other similar to the two phase double point approach in mpm the internal erosion is treated as the mass transfer from soil particles to water particles though some erosion effects such as looseness and liquefaction of soils have been illustrated by their sph simulations the detailed information for their sph model such as governing equations and constitutive laws was absent yerro et al 2017 have presented a first approach using the mpm to model internal erosion process within saturated soils their mpm model adopted the two phase single point mpm approach in which the internal erosion is represented by the mass transfer from solid to liquid phase the seepage erosion process under one dimensional seepage flow was simulated by their coupled mpm their model can take into account the mass exchange process between solid and liquid phases but without couplings of any mechanical deformation and advanced erosion law in summary internal erosion which can occur in both saturated and unsaturated soils is a multi physics coupled process associated with large deformations however there is an apparent shortage of methods which can simulate the whole failure stages of soil structures suffered from internal erosion the single point mpm was shown well adopted for simulating unsaturated hydro mechanical problems with large deformations accordingly in this paper a three phase multi species single point mpm formulation is proposed for modelling the coupled seepage erosion deformation process within unsaturated erodible soils based on the mixture theory unsaturated erodible soils are conceptualised as three phase multi species porous media governing equations for describing skeleton deformation liquid flow liquefaction of solid fine particles and convection of liquidised fine particles are formulated for the explicit dynamic mpm framework suitable for modelling large deformations and discretized by the generalized interpolation material point gimp method bardenhagen and kober 2004 the proposed coupled seepage erosion deformation gimp is validated and verified by simulating liakopoulos 1965 s drainage tests sterpi 2003 s internal erosion tests and the coupled seepage erosion responses during infiltration tests this coupled gimp is then employed for simulating the rainfall induced failure process of a slope comprised of soils prone to internal erosion the evolution of the coupled seepage erosion deformation behaviour during both the pre failure and post failure stages is analysed it suggests that the proposed mpm framework is a promising approach for future studies of internal erosion problems in unsaturated soils involving complex multi couplings of seepage flow phase change and large soil deformations which are difficult to be modelled by traditional mesh based methods 2 governing formulation of unsaturated erodible soils 2 1 conceptualization the soil matrix of soils susceptible to suffusion is usually composed of mixed coarse and fine particles under certain geometric and hydro mechanical conditions the fine particles can be detached from the solid skeleton and behave as a part of the liquid phase in the form of liquidised fine particles which can be transported away by the flowing liquid lei et al 2017a to describe this fines migration process mathematically unsaturated soils composed with mixed coarse and fine particles with their pore spaces filled by liquid or air are treated as a kind of three phase multi species porous media as illustrated by fig 1 this conceptualized porous medium consists of three phases solid phase s liquid phase l and gaseous phase g with their respective species shown by the following sets 1 s c e l w e g g in this way coarse and fine particles in the soil matrix of erodible soils phase s are represented by c and e species respectively the liquid phase l consists of both water species w and liquidised fines species e whereas gaseous phase g is assumed contain only dry air species g the internal erosion process is represented by the phase transfer process from solid fines species e to liquidised fines species e the liquidised fines species e will also be transported with the water species w within the seeping liquid phase as its suspension possible clogging process fines deposition phase transfer from e to e which is not dealt with in this research can be taken into account in some necessary cases within the framework of the proposed three phase multi species single point mpm the tri phasic porous medium is represented by one single layer of material points in other words each material point contains all the constituents of the porous media whose geometry is defined by the solid skeleton and the movement of liquid and gaseous phases will be described with respect to the solid skeleton accordingly the volume fraction concept as well as the kinematic description of each phase and species can be adopted from the fem study lei et al 2014 2017a directly as shown in fig 1 a tri phasic porous medium which occupied a volume dω0 at time t 0 in its initial configuration and occupies a volume dω t at an arbitrary time t in its current configuration is taken as the representative elementary volume rev the three phases in the porous medium each have their own intrinsic densities ρ α α refers to a particular phase and so as those species each with their own intrinsic densities ρ j in each phase j refers to a generic species accordingly the total volume of this rve is the sum of individual volumes occupied by each species and can also be expressed as the sum of individual volumes occupied by each phase such that d ω α d ω α j d ω j based on the mixture theory this rev being heterogeneous at the microscopic scale can be viewed as the superimposition of three phase particles solid liquid gaseous which simultaneously occupy the whole rev volume dω t with their corresponding apparent densities ρ α top row of fig 1 meanwhile it also can be treated as the superimposition of all species particles within the rev with their apparent densities ρ j bottom row of fig 1 the apparent densities ρ α and ρ j are linked to their corresponding intrinsic densities ρ α and ρ j through their respective volume fractions n α and nj n j d ω t j d ω t n α d ω t α d ω t n α j α n j to be consistent with the terms used in the soil mechanics the volume fraction of the whole pore space is referred as the porosity n whereas the relative volume fraction occupied by the liquid within these pores is referred as the liquid saturation sl further the volumetric concentration ce is used to refer to the relative volume fraction of the liquidised fine particles in the liquid phase i e 2 n 1 n s s l n l n c e n e n l 2 2 general assumptions some assumptions which have been adopted in developing the coupled gimp formulation for unsaturated erodible soils are presented as follows 1 the internal erosion process under consideration is limited to suffusion and clogging will not be dealt with 2 the weight of air phase is assumed to be negligible and its pressure is assumed to remain at zero 3 the solid fine particles and the liquidised fine particles are assumed have the same intrinsic density 4 the solid species are incompressible while the water species is weakly compressible 5 the liquid flow follows darcy s law 6 the liquid species share the same velocity with the bulk liquid at any instant and the diffusion of liquidised fine particles in liquid can be neglected 7 bishop s effective stress concept is assumed to be valid and the solid skeleton can be modelled in an elasto plastic framework 2 3 balance equations and constitutive laws in the framework of continuum mechanics mass balance equations for the solid phase liquid phase and liquidised fine particle species as well as the momentum balance equations for the whole mixture and liquid phase will be developed for the unsaturated erodible soils an elasto plastic model using bishop s effective stress and an erosion law governing the rate of internal erosion will also be presented they together form the governing equation system for modelling the coupled seepage erosion deformation process within unsaturated soils 2 3 1 mass conservation for solid phase the mass conservation of the solid phase is described as 3 d s dt ω t ρ s d ω t ω t 1 n ρ s t 1 n ρ s v s d ω t ω t 1 j d s m e dt d ω t in which d s dt t v s is the particle derivative with respect to the solid phase s which follows the motion of the solid phase coussy 2004 v s is the velocity of solid phase ρ s and ρ s are the apparent and intrinsic density of solid phase respectively m e is the mass content of solid fine species which is related to its apparent density by m e ρ e d ω t d ω 0 j ρ e with j being the jacobian of the transformation of the solid skeleton by assuming the solid species hence the solid grains are incompressible the above equation can be simplified as the following equation 4 d s n dt 1 n v s d s dt m e ρ e j the above equation indicates that the porosity evolution of soil skeleton is contributed by both the skeleton deformation and the internal erosion 2 3 2 mass conservation for species in liquid phase the conservation equations of water species and liquidised fine species are expressed as 5 d w d ω t ρ w d ω t ω t 1 c e n s l ρ w t 1 c e n s l ρ w v w d ω t 0 6 d e d ω t ρ e d ω t ω t c e n s l ρ e t c e n s l ρ e v e d ω t ω t 1 j d s m e dt d ω t in which d j dt t v j j w e is the particle derivative with respect to the species ρ w ρ e is the apparent density of water and liquidised fine species respectively by inserting eq 4 into eq 5 the combination of the above two equations could lead to the following pore liquid pressure evolution law 7 d s dt p l n s l p c n s l k l 1 s l 1 n v s n s l v l n s l v l v s 1 s l ρ e j d s m e dt in which pl is the liquid pressure kl is the bulk modulus of liquid phase pc is the soil matric suction and s l p c is governed by the soil water retention law of a specified soil will be presented in the following examples to arrive at the above equation the time derivative of saturation degree is linked to that of pore liquid pressure through 8 d s d t s l s l p c d s d t p c s l p c d s d t p l in which the gas pressure pg is assumed to be zero for simplicity and the soil matric suction pc is taken as pc pg pl pl the water species is assumed to be linearly compressible via the following constitutive relation d ρ w ρ w d p w k w positive compressive stress convention is adopted as presented in coussy 2004 bandara et al 2016 while its gradient is negligible ρ w 0 the density of liquidised fine species is constant ρ e ρ e ρ s the species share the same velocity with the bulk liquid v w v e v l further the modulus of water species will be replaced by the modulus of the liquid phase by assuming 1 c e n s l k w n s l k l with the assumption that the diffusion of liquidised fine particles within liquid can be neglected i e v w v e v l the mass conservation of liquidised fine species eq 6 can be rewritten as 9 d s c e dt v l v s c e 1 c e n s l ρ e j d s m e dt 0 in which the term related to the contribution from the compressibility of water species c e 1 c e n s l 1 ρ w ρ w t 0 is neglected 2 3 3 momentum balance for mixture the momentum balance equation of the whole soil mixture can be written as wang et al 2018 10 1 n ρ s a s σ ρ b n s l ρ l a l in which a s and a l are the acceleration of solid phase and liquid phase respectively ρ is the density of the mixture which can be represented as ρ 1 n ρ s nslρ l b is the body force acceleration σ is the total stress tensor 2 3 4 momentum balance for liquid phase in this research laminar fluid flow is assumed for the unsaturated flow even during large deformations wang et al 2018 since the momentum change due to the phase change of fine particles is small relative to the one of the whole liquid phase the following momentum balance equation for unsaturated laminar fluid flow without explicit consideration of fine particles suspension yerro et al 2015 is assumed can be adopted 11 ρ l a l p l s l n ρ l g k l v l v s ρ l b in which a l is the acceleration of liquid ρ l is the intrinsic density of liquid kl is the soil hydraulic conductivity g is the gravitational constant 2 3 5 constitutive equation for skeleton deformation the total stress σ in this research is calculated based on a bishop type effective stress σ bandara et al 2016 wang et al 2018 i e 12 σ σ s l p l m d ɛ s s l p l m in which d is an effective stiffness tensor which depends on the specified constitutive model adopted ε s is the strain tensor of solid skeleton m is the kronecker delta vector 111000 t the sign convention of stress and strain tensors follows the classic poromechanics coussy 2004 with normal tension being positive with the compressive liquid pressure being positive as sated previously the gas pressure is assumed to be zero for simplicity in this study the mohr column model is adopted in case of elasto plastic analysis accordingly the effective stiffness tensor d should be replaced by the corresponding elasto plastic form see clausen et al 2007 for model implementation details the yield function fs and the plastic potential function gs are presented as 13 f s 1 2 σ 1 σ 3 1 2 σ 1 σ 3 sin ϕ c cos ϕ 14 g s 1 2 σ 1 σ 3 1 2 σ 1 σ 3 sin ψ in which σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 are the principal effective stresses c is the soil cohesion ϕ is the internal friction angle of soil ψ is the dilation angle of soil 2 3 6 erosion law an erosion law is necessary to describe the phase transfer rate of solid fine particles to liquidised fine particles in the literature various erosion laws have been proposed most of them are empirical relations which relate the erosion rate to the flow characteristics velocity hydraulic gradient porosity fines density and empirical erosion coefficients vardoulakis et al 1996 papamichos and vardoulakis 2005 uzuoka et al 2012 seghir et al 2014 chetti et al 2016 in this study the variation of fine particles content in the soil skeleton is assumed to be due only to the suffusion marot and benamar 2012 mechanism the erosion law taken from lei et al 2017a which is modified from cividini and gioda 2004 is chosen to calculate the fines variation rate at pore surfaces 15 d s dt m e k er ρ e x e x e v l v s in which ker is a material parameter which controls the overall soil erosion sensitivity x e is the current mass fraction of solid erodible fines current erodible solid fines mass content initial solid mass content x e m e 1 n 0 ρ s and x e is the ultimate long term mass fraction of erodible fines ultimate erodible solid fines mass content initial solid mass content x e m e 1 n 0 ρ s under the given seepage velocity after a long seepage period v l v s is the norm of the relative velocity vector of pore liquid to soil skeleton v l v s this erosion law implies that if sufficient time is allowed under a given flow velocity the erosion process will remove the fine particles until the corresponding long term fine fraction x e is reached the x e is calculated by 16 x e x e 0 x e 0 x e v l v s v if 0 v l v s v x e x e α er log v l v s v if v l v s v in which v is a reference low seepage velocity under which the variation of ultimate mass fraction x e with v l v s is linear x e 0 is the initial mass fraction of erodible fines initial erodible solid fines mass content initial solid mass content and x e is the ultimate mass fraction of erodible fines under the reference flow velocity v α er is a material parameter controlling the nonlinear variation of x e with v l v s zhang et al 2017 2 4 comparison of coupled formulations for implicit fem and explicit mpm a coupled seepage erosion deformation formulation for the implicit fem was proposed by lei et al 2017b for the comparison purpose its governing equations are summarised in table 1 together with the governing equations for mpm developed in this research as can be seen the main difference between these two sets of governing equations is the first two equations for the hydro mechanical component the u s pl solid displacement fluid pressure formulation is used in the implicit fem while the v s v l solid velocity liquid velocity formulation is adopted for the explicit mpm this fem formulation could be used to partially validate our explicit mpm in cases of quasi static problems with small deformations in these cases i e terms associated with a s and a l can be neglected and j 1 the equation f1 in the fem formulation is comparable to the equation m1 in the mpm formulation whereas the equation f2 is identical to eq 7 in which the seepage velocity is usually solved by the darcy s flow equation presented by the equation m2 indeed both the u s pl formulation and the v s v l formulation can be used in mpm this classic u s pl formulation is widely used in dynamics to solve the coupled problems due to its simplicity and was adapted to the mpm by zhang et al 2009 zabala alonso 2011 and so on however since fluid accelerations are neglected in this formulation this makes it impossible to capture high frequency movements when the coupling between soil and water needs to be dealt with navas et al 2017 in addition this formulation will bring numerical troubles in the explicit mpm with linear element as indicated in the literature yerro 2015 song et al 2017 the mixed displacement pressure approaches suffer from pressure instability problems if the number of degrees of freedom used to interpolate the pressure is lower than that used to interpolate the displacements to accommodate with the explicit mpm in this research the velocities of solid and liquid as the main unknowns for the hydro mechanical component in this v s v l formulation each node has four degrees of freedom in 2d problems and the pore pressure is obtained afterwards this formulation automatically ensures the consistency between pressure and stress jassim 2013 what s more the application of impervious boundary conditions with v s v l formulation is more straightforward than the u s pl formulation especially when inclined boundaries are involved navas et al 2016 accordingly this formulation is the most popular formulation in mpm for hydro mechanical couplings in more recent researches such as jassim 2013 yerro et al 2015 and bandara and soga 2015 3 coupled seepage erosion deformation gimp 3 1 weak form of the governing equations the momentum balance equation of the porous mixture 10 the momentum balance for liquid phase 11 the mass conservation equation for fine particle species 9 the fines erosion law 15 are selected as the governing equations to be solved by the explicit mpm with the solid velocity v s the liquid velocity v l the liquidised fines concentration ce and the solid fines mass content m e as the main unknown variables the weak forms of these governing equations are given as 17 ω 1 n ρ s a s δ u d ω ω t t δ u d ω t ω σ δ u d ω ω ρ b δ u d ω ω n s l ρ l a l δ u d ω 18 ω

attached to the solid skeleton carrying all the information and providing a lagrangian description an eulerian background grid defining the physical space a body moves in is adopted on which governing equations are solved in every time step since some physical variables can be either associated with a particle p or with a node i in what follows we will use the subscript p to indicate particle variables and use the subscript i to indicate nodal variables by default physical variables without these explicit subscripts will be associated with particles within the original mpm sulsky et al 1994 the interpolation shape functions which map information between particles and grid nodes are chosen as the dirac delta functions these shape functions are linear c0 continuous whose gradients are discontinuous at the cell boundary which leads to notorious cell crossing instability when particles cross a cell boundary zhou et al 1999 the generalized interpolation material point gimp method developed by bardenhagen and kober 2004 adopted the so called particle characteristic function to replace the linear basis functions for the information mappings compared with the original mpm the weighting functions of gimp are c1 continuous with no discontinuous gradients at the cell boundary and therefore the associated cell crossing errors can be reduced significantly the gimp replaces the original point evaluation of the mpm integrals with a weighted average integral over a finite domain in the neighbourhood of the particle according to the gimp any continuous function f is represented by the summation of the function value at the material points and can be integrated as bardenhagen and kober 2004 21 ω f x d ω ω p f p x p x d ω where fp is the value of the function on particle p and xp x is a particle characteristic function of space position x which integrates to the volume associated with particle p in our three phase single point mpm model the weight of air phase is neglected the solid phase mass msp liquid phase mass mlp as well as the total mass mp of each material point can be calculated with 22 m s p ρ s v p m l p ρ l p v p m p 1 n p m s p s l p n p m l p in which ρ lp

governing equations eq 17 to eq 20 can be expressed in their particle based forms for example the particle based form of the momentum balance equation of the porous mixture eq 17 is expanded as 23 p ω

are the nodal shape functions the gimp shape function sip and its gradient g ip are then defined as 25 s ip 1 v p ω x p x n i x d ω g ip 1 v p ω x p x n i x d ω accordingly eq 23 which is in the

update the particle velocity two methods are usually used in the literature for particle methods particle in cell pic harlow 1964 and fluid implicit particle flip brackbill 1988 the flip update increments particle velocity using accelerations extrapolated to the grid while the pic update extrapolates the grid velocity directly to the particle 34 flip v α p flip n 1 v α p n i a α i n s ip n δ

updating other main unknowns to improve stability for example the liquidised fines concentration can be updated with this approach as so to introduce artificial diffusivity to stabilize the convection term when the peclet number is high in this study the above mixed approach is only limited for updating particle velocities of solid and liquid phase the erodible mass fraction and liquidised fines

details note that the traction and liquid pressure boundaries are prescribed on the surfaces of the moving particles and the displacement and concentration boundaries are prescribed by enforcing fixed velocity and concentration at the background nodes a boundary without any restriction means that yerro 2015 the solid skeleton can move freely the total stress is zero the liquid pressure is zero the liquid phase can move freely and the concentration is not restricted 3 5 numerical algorithm the algorithm of the coupled seepage erosion deformation mpm consists of the following steps in which the classic update stresses last usl method bardenhagen 2002 was adopted for stresses and strains update the time step for our explicit mpm is ensured within the minimum time step criterion for

model as well as its implementation is validated and verified by three examples the first example is to simulate the drainage test of saturated soil column with which the coupling of unsaturated seepage and deformation is validated the second example is to simulate the internal erosion test with which the coupling of saturated seepage and erosion is validated and the characteristics of the adopted erosion law are illustrated the third example is to simulate the infiltration induced fines migration process with which the coupling of unsaturated seepage and erosion is validated 4 1 drainage test seepage deformation the drainage test experiment of liakopoulos 1965 consisted of a 1 0 m high perspex column packed with del monte sand and instrumented to measure moisture tension along the height of the column bandara et al 2016 the del monte sand column was initially fully saturated by adding water from the top surface continuously the water supply ceased at the start of the experiment the two side walls were impermeable to water while the water was able to freely drain from the bottom the moisture tensions along the column height were measured during the desaturation due to gravity the test was simulated with the hydro mechanical component termed as hm gimp of the proposed coupled seepage erosion deformation gimp by turning off the erosion component in this simulation a 1 0 m high and 0 05 m width soil column fully saturated with water is considered the soil column is represented by a set of material points as illustrated in fig 2 a the background grid consists of cells with 0 05m 0 05 m and 4 material points per each cell note that when performing gimp analysis an additional layer of ghost cells will be added automatically to each boundary in all the examples soil behaviour is modelled using an isotropic linear poro elastic material with the hydro mechanical parameters taken from lewis and schrefler 1998 and wang et al 2018 young s modulus e 1300 kpa poisson s ratio v 0 40 intrinsic density of solid phase ρ s 2000 kg m3 intrinsic density of water species ρ w 1000 kg m3 bulk modulus of liquid kl 2 0e6 kpa initial soil permeability k l 0 1 0e 6 m s gravitational constant g 10 m s2 the water retention curve s l f p c and the permeability reduction factor k l k l 0 k r s l are also taken from lewis and schrefler 1998 and wang et al 2018 44 s l 1 1 9722 10 11 p c 2 4279 k r 1 2 207 1 s l 1 0121 the total stress tensor pore pressure and saturation have been specified by initial values in k0 state prior to the calculation to increase the time step in this example the mass scaling technique presented in jassim 2013 and yerro 2015 has been adopted for quasi static problems the mass terms m s i n and m l i n in eq 30 and eq 33 were scaled 1 e4 times which increased the time step for 100 times finally the time step used in the simulation is 1 0e 4 s additionally the pic fraction β l in eq 35 is chosen as 0 05 for the liquid velocity update the suction profile and the displacement profile along the column obtained by hm gimp are presented in fig 2b and fig 2c compared with the experimental data and the mpm results from wang et al 2018 since only the column bottom was open for water drainage the water inside the column flowed towards the bottom due to gravity this desaturation process led to gradual increase of suction along the column fig 2b meanwhile since only gravity is considered the increase of suction will also lead to the increase of effective stress accordingly the skeleton deformation induced by the change of effective stress accumulated with time which leads to settlement profiles shown in fig 2c as can be seen the hm gimp formulation can reproduce well the experimental data of liakopoulos 1965 besides the hm gimp results with cell size 0 05m 0 05 m are close to the mpm results of wang et al 2018 with cell size 0 1m 0 1 m 4 2 internal erosion test seepage erosion cividini and gioda 2004 s erosion law which is adopted to govern the internal erosion process in this research is developed based on internal erosion test results presented in sterpi 2003 to demonstrate its characteristics as well as to validate its implementation in our coupled seepage erosion deformation gimp abbreviated as sed gimp code the internal erosion tests reported in sterpi 2003 are simulated by our proposed coupled gimp in this section the soil specimen consists of sand and silt with the height of 14 cm and the diameter of 7 cm its fines content is 23 and void ratio is 0 51 the erosion tests were performed with different hydraulic gradients which generated upward seepage flows with different velocities leading to different erosion rates the mass of eroded fine particles was measured after drying the water flux from the top of specimens which contains fine particles in the proposed gimp the saturated soil column is represented by a layer of material points with the same size as the soil specimen which are located within 7 background cells with cell size 7cm 2 cm with 4 particles per cell all the boundaries for the solid phase have been fixed both the top and bottom boundaries are permeable for water while the lateral boundaries are impervious the soil in the model is assumed to be homogeneous the parameter associated with liquid flow and fines erosion are needed the initial porosity n 0 0 34 permeability k l 0 0 360 m h constant in this test as well as the initial fine mass fraction x e 0 0 2 are taken from sterpi 2003 the intrinsic density of solid ρ s is assumed to be 2600 kg m3 with the initial erodible mass content x e 0 1 n 0 ρ s the ultimate fines mass fractions x e at the end of the experimental tests is estimated as 0 19 based on the final eroded fines mass ratios under these four seepage velocities given in fig 3 then the parameter α er controlling the variation of x e and the parameter ker controlling the overall erosion sensitivity in the erosion law 15 are evaluated through the best fitting of the experimental data cividini and gioda 2004 uzuoka et al 2012 which are taken as 0 2 and 0 25 respectively to generate the darcy flows corresponding to the hydraulic gradients of 0 18 0 39 0 55 and 0 60 in the experiments the bottom boundary nodes are fixed with four corresponding seepage velocities i e 0 130 m h 0 281 m h 0 396 m h and 0 432 m h in this way the simulation is simplified as a 1d seepage erosion problem with constant seepage velocity zero solid velocity and constant liquid velocity the time step is set to 1 e 5 h and run for a total time 50 h in this simulation the hydraulic gradients as well as the velocity fields are homogenous along the depth therefore homogenous erosion rates will be generated which lead to homogenous fine content distributions within the soil specimens the evaluation profiles of the eroded fines mass ratio in the specimens under different constant seepage velocities are presented in fig 3a as can be seen consistent with the erosion model the erosion rate increases with the applied hydraulic gradient seepage velocity and the fine particles inside soils will be eroded until the fine content fraction reaches the ultimate long term fine content fraction which is also dependent on the seepage velocity the gimp simulation replicates the fem results as well as the experimental results quite well note that the discrepancy in the erodible mass between the numerical and the experimental results is due to the inaccuracies in the ultimate mass fraction curve as shown in uzuoka et al 2012 in our coupled gimp framework the internal erosion effect is mainly accounted for through the porosity change which is calculated by eq 4 in the model two contributions for the porosity change can be identified the skeleton deformation and the interphase mass transfer of fine species lei et al 2017b which are difficult to be separated in the experiment in this example to validate the implementation of this seepage erosion module the skeleton deformation is assumed to be restricted accordingly the porosity varies only with the internal erosion process as shown in fig 3b the porosity profiles simulated by the gimp almost overlap with the ones obtained by fem which are proportional to the erosion process 4 3 infiltration test seepage erosion this example simulates the coupled unsaturated infiltration and internal erosion process within a 1d unsaturated rigid soil column of 1 m length the example is an extension of the 1d infiltration example presented in yerro 2015 by further considering the internal erosion process the soil column is assumed to be unsaturated with a constant suction pc 0 5 mpa the bottom boundary is impervious gravity is neglected and the soil skeleton cannot deform the permeability is constant and the water retention curve is linearized according to sl 1 aspc in which as is a material constant at time t 0 the suction liquid pressure at the top of the column is enforced to zero to simulate the water infiltration phenomena in this extended example in addition to yerro 2015 s settings initial and boundary conditions related to internal erosion are necessary the initial mass content of erodible fine particles is assumed to be 340 kg m3 no liquidised fine particle exists in the liquid phase ce 0 and the concentration of the liquidised particles at the top surface is fixed at zero during the whole infiltration process accordingly the hydraulic loading by applying zero suction on the column top will not only induce penetration of clean water into the unsaturated soil column via the top boundary but also the internal erosion process in our numerical simulations two cases are considered 1 infiltration without erosion the yerro 2015 case 2 infiltration with erosion both cases are simulated with the proposed coupled gimp and coupled fem lei et al 2017a respectively in the fem model the soil column is meshed into 50 elements with 1d element size 0 02 m while in the gimp model it is meshed into 50 cells with cell size 0 1m 0 02 m with 4 particles per cell these infiltration tests are simulated for 9 s with the time step 2 5e 5 s see yerro 2015 for the minimum time step criterion the material parameters needed in these simulations are the erosion sensitive parameter ker 0 25 the initial mass fraction of erodible fines in solid phase x e 0 0 2 the reference low flow seepage velocity v 6 5e 5 m s the ultimate mass fraction of erodible fines under the reference velocity x e 0 19 the erosion law parameter controlling the ultimate mass fraction α er 0 2 initial porosity n 0 0 30 initial permeability k l 0 5 0e 8 m s intrinsic density of water species ρ w 1000 kg m3 intrinsic density of solid species phase ρ e 2600 kg m3 bulk modulus of liquid kl 80 000 kpa material constant for swrc as 1 e 5 pa 1 the numerical results of both cases are presented in fig 4 as can be seen the numerical results obtained with the proposed coupled explicit gimp sed gimp are very close to the ones obtained with the coupled implicit fem sed fem overall the infiltration induced fine particle migration process simulated here is consistent with the similar case addressed in lei et al 2017a with water infiltration from the top surface the suction decreases gradually fig 4a while the water saturation increases at the meantime fig 4b the infiltration generates the downward seepage water flow fig 4c which erodes fine particles from the soil skeleton with time fig 4d and hence increases the porosity accordingly fig 4e upon erosion the eroded solid fines become parts of liquid phase whose concentration increases with the continuous erosion process and are transported downwardly along with the flowing water by advection fig 4f for the infiltration test without erosion described above analytical solution for suction evolution can be obtained yerro 2015 as can be seen in fig 4a the suction profiles obtained with the hydro mechanical component hm gimp of the proposed coupled gimp fit well with the analytical results hm ana the suction decrease in the case of hm gimp is slightly different from the one in the case of sed gimp which is directly linked to the contribution of solid fines erosion term in eq 7 under the assumptions of rigid skeleton and constant permeability 5 simulation of coupled seepage erosion deformation process within slopes soils in landslide deposits colluvial slopes and fill slopes sometimes show the geometrical features which are susceptible to internal erosion under rainfall infiltration lei et al 2017a zhang et al 2017 upon seepage induced erosion fine particles will be transported from the upper part and surface of the slope to the toe and deeper part of the slope crosta and di prisco 1999 cui et al 2014 2017 hu et al 2018 the fines migration process will inevitably alter the hydromechanical characteristics of slope soils which influences the both the failure mechanism and the post failure motion of the slope in this example the rainfall induced failure process of an unsaturated slope comprised of soils prone to internal erosion is simulated with the proposed coupled seepage erosion deformation gimp to demonstrate its capability to simulate the evolving coupled multi physical process in unsaturated soils as well as to hand large deformations the whole failure stage from initiation to run out of both the cases with erosion seepage erosion deformation coupled sed gimp and without erosion hydro mechanical coupled hm gimp are modelled and compared 5 1 model settings the geometry of the slope simulated in this example as well as its gimp discretisation is presented in fig 5 as can be seen the slope is 7 m high with the slope angle 35 a layer of material points is placed beneath the bottom of the slope which interacts with the landslide mass through the internal friction so as to avoid boundary effects on the run out behaviour the slope model contains 5120 material points which are distributed uniformly in a background grid of four material points per cell with the cell size 0 25m 0 25 m note that cells at the slope surface may contain less than four material points both the right and left sides of the material point domain are prescribed with roller boundary for both solid and liquid phase which prevents horizontal displacement and liquid flow a fully fixed boundary for both solid and liquid phase is prescribed at the bottom to simulate a perfectly rough interface with the impermeable bedrock below zero pore liquid pressure and concentration boundary conditions are assigned on the slope surface to trigger clean rainfall infiltration the slope soil is assumed to be a homogeneous sandy soil whose fine particles can be eroded upon rainfall infiltration the mohr coulomb model using bishop s effective stress presented in section 2 2 is adopted to capture the soil failure behaviour and the van genuchten s equation is adopted as the soil water retention law van genuchten 1980 45 s l s min 1 s min 1 α v p c p c r e f n v 1 1 n v in which sl is the liquid saturation pc and pc ref are the matric suction and the reference suction value s min is the minimum residual saturation can be reached α v nv are fitting parameters all the material points are assigned with the same material parameters including the ones for mohr column model darcy seepage flow internal erosion law and soil water retention curve which are given in table 4 a high permeability is used to accelerate wetting process and to reduce the computational time yerro et al 2015 wang et al 2018 the influence of the changes of porosity on the intrinsic permeability uzuoka et al 2012 and the dependence of the liquid permeability on the degree of saturation yerro et al 2015 are taken into account by the following power law 46 k r n s l n n 0 3 s l 3 the internal erosion effect is taken into account through the erosion induced porosity change in this example only the permeability change according to the above equation is taken into accounted as the erosion effect the erosion induced soil mechanical properties change which is ignored for simplicity in this demonstrative case can be further considered by reducing the shear strength parameters lei et al 2017b or by other advanced models the

fitting parameter α v 0 44 swrc fitting parameter nv 3 04 with the above swrc parameters the soil water retention curve the dependence of permeability on liquid saturation and the dependence of permeability on porosity are calculated and presented in fig 6 for simplicity the initial suction throughout the slope is assumed to be constant an initial suction of 50 0 kpa corresponding to a saturation of 0 375 is prescribed across the domain and then the initial stresses are generated in equilibrium with the gravity force and this suction value once in situ stress state is obtained a zero pore liquid pressure is maintained on the slope surface to represent the situation corresponding to the saturated surface infiltration without any surface ponding for the sake of comparison both cases with and without internal erosion process are analysed the calculations are run with the time step 1 e 4 s and last for 45 s to stabilize the solution the pic fraction for solid velocity update β s is chosen as 0 005 while the one for liquid velocity update β l is chosen as 0 05 5 2 overview of the whole failure process the evolution contours of liquid pressure saturation equivalent plastic shear strain horizontal displacement erodible fines mass fraction as well as the volumetric concentration of liquidised fines during the whole failure process of the slope in the case sed gimp with erosion are presented in fig 7 to fig 9 due to the zero pore liquid pressure boundary condition prescribed on the slope surface at t 0 s a major change in water pressure from 50 kpa to 0 kpa took place near the slope surface at this initial stage due to the water pressure gradient water infiltrates into the unsaturated slope continuously saturation was also increased accordingly which increases the weight of the soil water mixture gradually since an impermeable bottom is assumed for the slope water can accumulate once reaching this boundary at time t 5 s positive water pressure can be observed near the toe of the slope and plastic shear strains begin to develop near this region along with the water infiltration plastic shear strains develop and accumulate with time at time t 15 s continuous localised plastic shear strains can be observed through the slope toe to the slope top which represents that an continuous slip surface has been developed and the slope failed totally since this time large deformation took place and the failed mass starts to move downwardly under gravity the initial geometry prior to rainfall infiltration is illustrated with red curves in the equivalent plastic shear strain calculated from the deviatoric part of the plastic strain tensor ɛ s p l d e v through 2 3 ɛ s p l d e v ɛ s p l d e v contour presented in fig 8 as can be seen along with the continuous development of the equivalent plastic shear strain the geometry of the slope changed significantly after t 15 s at t 35 s the slope was fully saturated and the liquid pressure in the slope is distributed in a nearly hydrostatic condition retrogression can be observed after the full saturation of the slope which was similar to the slope example in wang et al 2018 by using the coupled seepage erosion deformation gimp sed gimp the evolution of mass fraction of erodible fine particles and the volumetric concentration of liquidised fines particles can be obtained as can be seen the internal erosion process developed along with the infiltration process which led to severe fine particles decrease near the slope surface meanwhile liquidised fines particles are generated along with the erosion process which are then transported along with the flowing fluid toward the interior slope in this example the mechanical properties are assumed to be constant the erosion process only affects the wetting process by changing the porosity the failure mode of cases with and without internal erosion process are the same but different in the failure time 5 3 effect of erosion on wetting process to better illustrate the effect of internal erosion process considered in this example i e change of porosity the evolution profiles of filed variables along section s1 x 1 m for cases with and without erosion are compared in fig 10 in the sed gimp case erodible fine particle mass fraction decreased with time due to the seepage induced internal erosion while fines fraction was kept at its initial value 340 kg m3 in the hm gimp case fig 10a the evolution of porosity in our coupled seepage erosion deformation formulation is governed by eq 4 as shown in fig 10b the porosity induced by mechanical deformation was small in the case hm gimp while porosity was increased significantly along with the internal erosion process case sed gimp the erosion effect in this example was taken into account by adopting since a porosity dependent permeability evolution law eq 46 was adopted in this example this erosion induced porosity increase will increase the soil permeability which facilitated the water infiltration process as shown in fig 10c and fig 10d the wetting process was advanced evidently by this internal erosion process 5 4 failure mechanism to study the failure mechanism and the post failure motion of the slope time evolution information of the five monitoring material points presented in fig 5 will be extracted and analysed as indicated by fig 8a p1 p2 p3 are located on the initial slip surface but different in altitude while p4 p2 p5 are located on the same horizontal plane but different in their distances to the slope surface p2 and p5 are located on two different slip surfaces while p4 is out of any slip surface the evolution profiles of liquid pressure and saturation of p1 p2 p3 from both the sed gimp case and the hm gimp case are presented in fig 11 the wetting from slope surface led to the gradual increase of liquid pressure fig 11a the saturation increased with the liquid pressure according to the swrc law eq 45 p1 which is near the slope toe became fully saturated first followed by p2 and p3 fig 11b due to the erosion enhanced permeability the wetting process in the case sed gimp was faster than the one in the case hm p1 p2 p3 reached the full saturation state at 11 3 s 17 8 s 28 6 s respectively in the case sed gimp and at 13 7 s 21 5 s 35 9 s in the case hm the effective stress paths the effective mean stress σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 3 vs the deviatoric shear stress 1 2 σ 1 σ 2 2 σ 2 σ 3 2 σ 3 σ 4 2 of p1 p2 and p3 during the whole slope failure process are shown in fig 11c the wetting process on one hand changed the effective mean stress by increasing liquid pressure and saturation term slpl in eq 12 and on the other hand increased the total stresses by increasing the self weight of the upward soils increasing the density of mixture in eq 10 for point p1 the later effect dominated both the effective mean stress and the deviatoric stress increased upon wetting until reaching the failure surface for p2 and p3 self weight increase effect dominated at the very early stage then the effective mean stress decreased continually upon wetting which led to their final failure the failure time of each point is also marked with point in fig 11b as can be seen p1 p2 p3 reached the yield surface successively plastic strains accumulated simultaneously when these points were located on the yield surface once these points failed and formed a continuous slip surface large deformations took place as shown by the significant increase of plastic shear strain in fig 11d again since the erosion process is assumed only affect the wetting process by changing the permeability the field variables presented in fig 11 obtained from both the case sed gimp and the case hm gimp have very similar evolution tendency but only different in the failure time though not considered here once the erosion induced mechanical degradation is considered the yield surface in fig 10 for case sed gimp would move downwardly along with the erosion process which further decreases its failure time the evolution profiles of liquid pressure and saturation of p4 p2 p5 which are located on the same horizontal plane are presented in fig 12a and fig 12b the wetting front reached p4 p2 p5 successively whose arrival times were proportional to their distance to the slope surface compared with those of p1 p2 p3 these differences among p4 p2 p5 are more distinct so as the arrivals of the wetting front to these points the erosion effect is also evidently demonstrated by the accelerated wetting process in the case sed gimp compared to the one in the case hm gimp the effective stress paths of p4 p2 p5 are also compared in fig 12c for p4 the wetting decreased its effective mean stress and increased its deviatoric stress but no enough to lead its final failure for p5 the wetting increased both the effective mean stress and the deviatoric stress initially which led to its failure at the early stage however the stress was then released by the continuous failure along p1 p2 p3 accordingly the plastic development on p5 was suspended however later on around 35 s in the case sed gimp the slope was fully saturated the increase of positive liquid pressure decreased the effective mean pressure rapidly which led p5 to reach the yield surface again at this time a continuous slip surface has formed through p5 fig 9 a accordingly significant plastic shear strains generated after that as shown in fig 12d 5 5 post failure motion the run out velocities x direction as well as run out distances x direction of the material points p1 to p6 p6 is added to illustrate the maximum run out distance are presented in fig 13 and fig 14 for points p1 p2 p3 p4 p6 two peaks can be observed in the velocity profiles which were related to the development of two failure stages shown in fig 8a while for p5 only one peak can be observed in the velocity profiles which is related to the retrogression after full saturation of the slope the first failure stage is characterized as shallow failure of the near surface mass due to the vertical rainfall infiltration while the second stage is due to the liquefaction of the saturated slope the post failure motions of the case sed gimp and the case hm gimp are similar in this example which are mainly different in time in more complicated cases the erosion will change the residual strength and dilation of soils the differences will be larger however one can note that slight differences can be found between these two cases in peak velocity values fig 13a the maximum velocities of the first and the second failure stage in the case sed gimp were around 0 35 m s and 0 32 m s respectively while they were about 0 30 m s and 0 41 m s respectively in the case hm gimp according to our model the internal erosion will on one hand transferred the solid fine particles to liquidised fine particles which are transported away by the flowing water and on the other hand increase the porosity which therefore allow the soils per volume to store more liquid the combined effect affects the density of the soil water mixture which will lead to the difference between the failed sliding mass in two cases hence the difference in velocities the developments of the total displacement of these points are consistent with the velocity profiles presented above the landslide in the case sed gimp stopped at around t 40 s while it stopped at around t 43 s in the case hm gimp the maximum run out distance of the slope can be obtained from p6 directly which was 3 74 m in the case sed gimp and 3 93 m in the case hm gimp since only the erosion induced permeability change is considered the differences between these two cases are mainly due to their failure time and saturation state at the failure point fig 11 b accordingly their difference in terms of the maximum run out distance is very small indeed for this localised failure problem the influence of background mesh size could be larger than the influence of this erosion induced permeability change with a coarser mesh 0 5m 0 5 m the maximum run out distance in the case sed gimp and case hm gimp at the end of the calculation t 45 s was calculated to be 3 42 m and 3 50 m respectively therefore it is important to emphasise here that a very fine mesh 0 25m 0 25 m is adopted in the example so as to mitigate its influence on the shear band development and the comparison between case hm gimp and case sed gimp is performed with this same fine mesh with constant shear strength parameters so as to demonstrate the sed gimp s potential to simulate the coupled process of erosion and large deformation 6 conclusion the paper has developed a three phase multi species single point material point method mpm framework for modelling the coupled seepage erosion deformation process within unsaturated soils involving large deformations based on the mixture theory the unsaturated soils under suffusion were conceptualized as three phase multi species porous continua governing equations for capturing the skeleton deformation liquid flow erosion of solid fine particles and convection of liquidised fine particles have been proposed within the explicit dynamic mpm framework and were discretized by the generalized interpolation material point gimp spatially the proposed coupled seepage erosion deformation gimp has been validated and verified by modelling the liakopoulos 1965 s drainage tests sterpi 2003 s internal erosion tests and the infiltration tests involving internal erosion the capability of the proposed gimp for simulating coupled seepage erosion deformation process involving large deformations was then demonstrated by modelling the rainfall induced failure process of an unsaturated slope comprised of soils prone to internal erosion the effects of erosion on the rainfall infiltration process the slope failure mechanism as well as the post failure run out behaviour have been analysed it is shown that the

485,in this paper a computational framework based on the material point method mpm is developed to study the coupled seepage erosion deformation process within unsaturated soils based on the mixture theory the unsaturated erodible soil is conceptualized as a three phase multi species porous medium which is represented as a set of lagrangian material points in a three phase multi species single point mpm framework governing equations as well as constitutive models for describing the coupled seepage erosion deformation behaviour within unsaturated erodible soils are presented the solid skeleton is modelled as an elasto plastic material the pore water is treated as a weakly compressible fluid while the fine particles in the solid matrix can be eroded and transferred into liquidised fine particles and transported with the flowing liquid this governing system is discretised with the generalized interpolation material point gimp method and solved explicitly the proposed coupled seepage erosion deformation gimp is validated via three numerical examples and then employed for simulating the rainfall induced slope failure process involving internal erosion thanks to the capability of the mpm in capturing large deformations the evolution of the coupled seepage erosion deformation behaviour during the whole slope failure process can be obtained this suggests that the proposed coupled gimp framework is a promising approach for future studies of internal erosion problems in unsaturated soils involving complex multi couplings of seepage flow phase change and large deformations which are difficult to be modelled by traditional mesh based methods keywords material point method internal erosion seepage deformation unsaturated soils large deformation 1 introduction soils in many earth structures such as dams levees and colluvial slopes are usually composed of mixed coarse and fine particles with a broadly graded or gap graded soil structure within these soils the coarse soil skeleton is supposed to support and transmit the external stresses while fine particles can possibly move through the constrictions among these coarse particles upon sufficient seepage velocity fine particles in these soils are easy to be detached from the soil skeleton by the interstitial flow and transported with the seeping liquid within the pores formed by the coarse matrix this seepage induced internal erosion i e suffusion in this study process will inevitably alter the local distribution of the size and content of fine particles in soils lead to local variations of hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of soils and may destabilize the soil structure accordingly lots of damages and failures of dams luo et al 2017 embankments zhang et al 2013 as well as failure of unsaturated natural slopes crosta and di prisco 1999 cui et al 2014 2017 hu et al 2018 are associated with these internal erosion processes internal erosion is a complex multi physics coupled process which usually involves various coupled behaviour of different phases such as water seepage flow liquefaction of solid fine particles transport of liquidised fine particles and the deformation of soil skeleton traditionally two types of numerical approaches are usually used to simulate the internal erosion phenomena the first type is based on the discrete approach the discrete element method dem is adopted to consider the properties of the material at the grain scale and is usually coupled with computational fluid dynamics cfd in order to consider the water flow effects within the pores abdoulaye et al 2016 tao and tao 2017 cheng et al 2018 the second type is based on the continuous approach in which the finite element method fem is usually used to solve the coupled governing equations implicitly though the discrete methods can represent fairly well the microstructure and describe better the physical mechanisms within granular materials they cannot provide a sufficiently accurate representation of the problems at the scale of the geotechnical structure due to the restriction of number of particles yang and yin 2018 while the continuous approach permits work to be done at the scale of an entire engineering structure such as the simulations of piping of earth dams fujisawa et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 internal erosion induced dike failure yang and yin 2018 suffusion of landslide dams uzuoka et al 2012 and fines migration effects on the unsaturated slope stability zhang et al 2017 lei et al 2017a b however as a mesh based method fem suffers from severe numerical issues related to the mesh distortion when simulating problems with large deformations soga et al 2016 therefore these mesh based models can only deal with the evolution of internal erosion process and the associated hydro mechanical responses within soils in the pre failure regime with small deformations but not the post failure behaviours such as the progressive failure and run out of the failure mass which involves large deformations and need to be dealt with by other advanced numerical methods in the past few decades mesh free methods such as smooth particle hydrodynamics sph gingold and monaghan 1977 particle finite element method pfem onate et al 2004 finite element method with lagrangian integration points femlip moresi et al 2003 and material point method mpm sulsky et al 1994 have been developed successfully and gained popularity for simulating large deformation problems though each with their own inherent drawbacks as reviewed in soga et al 2016 among various mesh free methods mpm appears to be one of the most popular methods chosen by the geomechanics community thanks to some of its attractive features 1 mpm is a hybrid eulerian lagrangian approach with moving lagrangian material points and an eulerian background mesh which facilitates the application of various boundary conditions 2 it can simulate large deformation problems without frequent re meshing 3 advanced history dependent soil constitutive models as well as other well established knowledge from fem can be adopted easily in addition mpm is also well suited for coupled multi physics problems in the context of coupled hydro mechanical problems two kinds of mpm approaches can be used to account for the solid fluid interactions the first one as developed and adopted by zhang et al 2009 zabala and alonso 2011 jassim et al 2013 and so on used one layer of material points to carry the information of both solid and liquid phases i e two phase single point formulation the second one as presented in abe et al 2014 bandara and soga 2015 liu et al 2017 and so on adopted two layers of material points to represent the solid skeleton and the liquid phase separately i e two phase double point formulation the two phase double point formulation can be extended to cases when the fluid motion inside the pores is non laminar e g yamaguchi et al 2020 but with relatively higher computer costs ceccato et al 2018 whereas the two phase single point formulation is straightforward to be extended to unsaturated cases e g yerro et al 2015 bandara et al 2016 wang et al 2018 and is easy to account for other coupled physical processes such as the coupled thermo hydro mechanical process pinyol et al 2018 though mesh free methods have been adopted widely for modelling hydro mechanical problems with large deformations e g bandara et al 2016 bui and nguyen 2017 monforte et al 2019 their application on modelling seepage erosion couplings during internal erosion is rare maeda and kondo 2014 have tried to use sph for modelling progressive seepage failure and depression with internal erosion in their sph model the soil phase and the water phase are represented by a layer of soil particles and a layer of water particles which overlaps with each other similar to the two phase double point approach in mpm the internal erosion is treated as the mass transfer from soil particles to water particles though some erosion effects such as looseness and liquefaction of soils have been illustrated by their sph simulations the detailed information for their sph model such as governing equations and constitutive laws was absent yerro et al 2017 have presented a first approach using the mpm to model internal erosion process within saturated soils their mpm model adopted the two phase single point mpm approach in which the internal erosion is represented by the mass transfer from solid to liquid phase the seepage erosion process under one dimensional seepage flow was simulated by their coupled mpm their model can take into account the mass exchange process between solid and liquid phases but without couplings of any mechanical deformation and advanced erosion law in summary internal erosion which can occur in both saturated and unsaturated soils is a multi physics coupled process associated with large deformations however there is an apparent shortage of methods which can simulate the whole failure stages of soil structures suffered from internal erosion the single point mpm was shown well adopted for simulating unsaturated hydro mechanical problems with large deformations accordingly in this paper a three phase multi species single point mpm formulation is proposed for modelling the coupled seepage erosion deformation process within unsaturated erodible soils based on the mixture theory unsaturated erodible soils are conceptualised as three phase multi species porous media governing equations for describing skeleton deformation liquid flow liquefaction of solid fine particles and convection of liquidised fine particles are formulated for the explicit dynamic mpm framework suitable for modelling large deformations and discretized by the generalized interpolation material point gimp method bardenhagen and kober 2004 the proposed coupled seepage erosion deformation gimp is validated and verified by simulating liakopoulos 1965 s drainage tests sterpi 2003 s internal erosion tests and the coupled seepage erosion responses during infiltration tests this coupled gimp is then employed for simulating the rainfall induced failure process of a slope comprised of soils prone to internal erosion the evolution of the coupled seepage erosion deformation behaviour during both the pre failure and post failure stages is analysed it suggests that the proposed mpm framework is a promising approach for future studies of internal erosion problems in unsaturated soils involving complex multi couplings of seepage flow phase change and large soil deformations which are difficult to be modelled by traditional mesh based methods 2 governing formulation of unsaturated erodible soils 2 1 conceptualization the soil matrix of soils susceptible to suffusion is usually composed of mixed coarse and fine particles under certain geometric and hydro mechanical conditions the fine particles can be detached from the solid skeleton and behave as a part of the liquid phase in the form of liquidised fine particles which can be transported away by the flowing liquid lei et al 2017a to describe this fines migration process mathematically unsaturated soils composed with mixed coarse and fine particles with their pore spaces filled by liquid or air are treated as a kind of three phase multi species porous media as illustrated by fig 1 this conceptualized porous medium consists of three phases solid phase s liquid phase l and gaseous phase g with their respective species shown by the following sets 1 s c e l w e g g in this way coarse and fine particles in the soil matrix of erodible soils phase s are represented by c and e species respectively the liquid phase l consists of both water species w and liquidised fines species e whereas gaseous phase g is assumed contain only dry air species g the internal erosion process is represented by the phase transfer process from solid fines species e to liquidised fines species e the liquidised fines species e will also be transported with the water species w within the seeping liquid phase as its suspension possible clogging process fines deposition phase transfer from e to e which is not dealt with in this research can be taken into account in some necessary cases within the framework of the proposed three phase multi species single point mpm the tri phasic porous medium is represented by one single layer of material points in other words each material point contains all the constituents of the porous media whose geometry is defined by the solid skeleton and the movement of liquid and gaseous phases will be described with respect to the solid skeleton accordingly the volume fraction concept as well as the kinematic description of each phase and species can be adopted from the fem study lei et al 2014 2017a directly as shown in fig 1 a tri phasic porous medium which occupied a volume dω0 at time t 0 in its initial configuration and occupies a volume dω t at an arbitrary time t in its current configuration is taken as the representative elementary volume rev the three phases in the porous medium each have their own intrinsic densities ρ α α refers to a particular phase and so as those species each with their own intrinsic densities ρ j in each phase j refers to a generic species accordingly the total volume of this rve is the sum of individual volumes occupied by each species and can also be expressed as the sum of individual volumes occupied by each phase such that d ω α d ω α j d ω j based on the mixture theory this rev being heterogeneous at the microscopic scale can be viewed as the superimposition of three phase particles solid liquid gaseous which simultaneously occupy the whole rev volume dω t with their corresponding apparent densities ρ α top row of fig 1 meanwhile it also can be treated as the superimposition of all species particles within the rev with their apparent densities ρ j bottom row of fig 1 the apparent densities ρ α and ρ j are linked to their corresponding intrinsic densities ρ α and ρ j through their respective volume fractions n α and nj n j d ω t j d ω t n α d ω t α d ω t n α j α n j to be consistent with the terms used in the soil mechanics the volume fraction of the whole pore space is referred as the porosity n whereas the relative volume fraction occupied by the liquid within these pores is referred as the liquid saturation sl further the volumetric concentration ce is used to refer to the relative volume fraction of the liquidised fine particles in the liquid phase i e 2 n 1 n s s l n l n c e n e n l 2 2 general assumptions some assumptions which have been adopted in developing the coupled gimp formulation for unsaturated erodible soils are presented as follows 1 the internal erosion process under consideration is limited to suffusion and clogging will not be dealt with 2 the weight of air phase is assumed to be negligible and its pressure is assumed to remain at zero 3 the solid fine particles and the liquidised fine particles are assumed have the same intrinsic density 4 the solid species are incompressible while the water species is weakly compressible 5 the liquid flow follows darcy s law 6 the liquid species share the same velocity with the bulk liquid at any instant and the diffusion of liquidised fine particles in liquid can be neglected 7 bishop s effective stress concept is assumed to be valid and the solid skeleton can be modelled in an elasto plastic framework 2 3 balance equations and constitutive laws in the framework of continuum mechanics mass balance equations for the solid phase liquid phase and liquidised fine particle species as well as the momentum balance equations for the whole mixture and liquid phase will be developed for the unsaturated erodible soils an elasto plastic model using bishop s effective stress and an erosion law governing the rate of internal erosion will also be presented they together form the governing equation system for modelling the coupled seepage erosion deformation process within unsaturated soils 2 3 1 mass conservation for solid phase the mass conservation of the solid phase is described as 3 d s dt ω t ρ s d ω t ω t 1 n ρ s t 1 n ρ s v s d ω t ω t 1 j d s m e dt d ω t in which d s dt t v s is the particle derivative with respect to the solid phase s which follows the motion of the solid phase coussy 2004 v s is the velocity of solid phase ρ s and ρ s are the apparent and intrinsic density of solid phase respectively m e is the mass content of solid fine species which is related to its apparent density by m e ρ e d ω t d ω 0 j ρ e with j being the jacobian of the transformation of the solid skeleton by assuming the solid species hence the solid grains are incompressible the above equation can be simplified as the following equation 4 d s n dt 1 n v s d s dt m e ρ e j the above equation indicates that the porosity evolution of soil skeleton is contributed by both the skeleton deformation and the internal erosion 2 3 2 mass conservation for species in liquid phase the conservation equations of water species and liquidised fine species are expressed as 5 d w d ω t ρ w d ω t ω t 1 c e n s l ρ w t 1 c e n s l ρ w v w d ω t 0 6 d e d ω t ρ e d ω t ω t c e n s l ρ e t c e n s l ρ e v e d ω t ω t 1 j d s m e dt d ω t in which d j dt t v j j w e is the particle derivative with respect to the species ρ w ρ e is the apparent density of water and liquidised fine species respectively by inserting eq 4 into eq 5 the combination of the above two equations could lead to the following pore liquid pressure evolution law 7 d s dt p l n s l p c n s l k l 1 s l 1 n v s n s l v l n s l v l v s 1 s l ρ e j d s m e dt in which pl is the liquid pressure kl is the bulk modulus of liquid phase pc is the soil matric suction and s l p c is governed by the soil water retention law of a specified soil will be presented in the following examples to arrive at the above equation the time derivative of saturation degree is linked to that of pore liquid pressure through 8 d s d t s l s l p c d s d t p c s l p c d s d t p l in which the gas pressure pg is assumed to be zero for simplicity and the soil matric suction pc is taken as pc pg pl pl the water species is assumed to be linearly compressible via the following constitutive relation d ρ w ρ w d p w k w positive compressive stress convention is adopted as presented in coussy 2004 bandara et al 2016 while its gradient is negligible ρ w 0 the density of liquidised fine species is constant ρ e ρ e ρ s the species share the same velocity with the bulk liquid v w v e v l further the modulus of water species will be replaced by the modulus of the liquid phase by assuming 1 c e n s l k w n s l k l with the assumption that the diffusion of liquidised fine particles within liquid can be neglected i e v w v e v l the mass conservation of liquidised fine species eq 6 can be rewritten as 9 d s c e dt v l v s c e 1 c e n s l ρ e j d s m e dt 0 in which the term related to the contribution from the compressibility of water species c e 1 c e n s l 1 ρ w ρ w t 0 is neglected 2 3 3 momentum balance for mixture the momentum balance equation of the whole soil mixture can be written as wang et al 2018 10 1 n ρ s a s σ ρ b n s l ρ l a l in which a s and a l are the acceleration of solid phase and liquid phase respectively ρ is the density of the mixture which can be represented as ρ 1 n ρ s nslρ l b is the body force acceleration σ is the total stress tensor 2 3 4 momentum balance for liquid phase in this research laminar fluid flow is assumed for the unsaturated flow even during large deformations wang et al 2018 since the momentum change due to the phase change of fine particles is small relative to the one of the whole liquid phase the following momentum balance equation for unsaturated laminar fluid flow without explicit consideration of fine particles suspension yerro et al 2015 is assumed can be adopted 11 ρ l a l p l s l n ρ l g k l v l v s ρ l b in which a l is the acceleration of liquid ρ l is the intrinsic density of liquid kl is the soil hydraulic conductivity g is the gravitational constant 2 3 5 constitutive equation for skeleton deformation the total stress σ in this research is calculated based on a bishop type effective stress σ bandara et al 2016 wang et al 2018 i e 12 σ σ s l p l m d ɛ s s l p l m in which d is an effective stiffness tensor which depends on the specified constitutive model adopted ε s is the strain tensor of solid skeleton m is the kronecker delta vector 111000 t the sign convention of stress and strain tensors follows the classic poromechanics coussy 2004 with normal tension being positive with the compressive liquid pressure being positive as sated previously the gas pressure is assumed to be zero for simplicity in this study the mohr column model is adopted in case of elasto plastic analysis accordingly the effective stiffness tensor d should be replaced by the corresponding elasto plastic form see clausen et al 2007 for model implementation details the yield function fs and the plastic potential function gs are presented as 13 f s 1 2 σ 1 σ 3 1 2 σ 1 σ 3 sin ϕ c cos ϕ 14 g s 1 2 σ 1 σ 3 1 2 σ 1 σ 3 sin ψ in which σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 are the principal effective stresses c is the soil cohesion ϕ is the internal friction angle of soil ψ is the dilation angle of soil 2 3 6 erosion law an erosion law is necessary to describe the phase transfer rate of solid fine particles to liquidised fine particles in the literature various erosion laws have been proposed most of them are empirical relations which relate the erosion rate to the flow characteristics velocity hydraulic gradient porosity fines density and empirical erosion coefficients vardoulakis et al 1996 papamichos and vardoulakis 2005 uzuoka et al 2012 seghir et al 2014 chetti et al 2016 in this study the variation of fine particles content in the soil skeleton is assumed to be due only to the suffusion marot and benamar 2012 mechanism the erosion law taken from lei et al 2017a which is modified from cividini and gioda 2004 is chosen to calculate the fines variation rate at pore surfaces 15 d s dt m e k er ρ e x e x e v l v s in which ker is a material parameter which controls the overall soil erosion sensitivity x e is the current mass fraction of solid erodible fines current erodible solid fines mass content initial solid mass content x e m e 1 n 0 ρ s and x e is the ultimate long term mass fraction of erodible fines ultimate erodible solid fines mass content initial solid mass content x e m e 1 n 0 ρ s under the given seepage velocity after a long seepage period v l v s is the norm of the relative velocity vector of pore liquid to soil skeleton v l v s this erosion law implies that if sufficient time is allowed under a given flow velocity the erosion process will remove the fine particles until the corresponding long term fine fraction x e is reached the x e is calculated by 16 x e x e 0 x e 0 x e v l v s v if 0 v l v s v x e x e α er log v l v s v if v l v s v in which v is a reference low seepage velocity under which the variation of ultimate mass fraction x e with v l v s is linear x e 0 is the initial mass fraction of erodible fines initial erodible solid fines mass content initial solid mass content and x e is the ultimate mass fraction of erodible fines under the reference flow velocity v α er is a material parameter controlling the nonlinear variation of x e with v l v s zhang et al 2017 2 4 comparison of coupled formulations for implicit fem and explicit mpm a coupled seepage erosion deformation formulation for the implicit fem was proposed by lei et al 2017b for the comparison purpose its governing equations are summarised in table 1 together with the governing equations for mpm developed in this research as can be seen the main difference between these two sets of governing equations is the first two equations for the hydro mechanical component the u s pl solid displacement fluid pressure formulation is used in the implicit fem while the v s v l solid velocity liquid velocity formulation is adopted for the explicit mpm this fem formulation could be used to partially validate our explicit mpm in cases of quasi static problems with small deformations in these cases i e terms associated with a s and a l can be neglected and j 1 the equation f1 in the fem formulation is comparable to the equation m1 in the mpm formulation whereas the equation f2 is identical to eq 7 in which the seepage velocity is usually solved by the darcy s flow equation presented by the equation m2 indeed both the u s pl formulation and the v s v l formulation can be used in mpm this classic u s pl formulation is widely used in dynamics to solve the coupled problems due to its simplicity and was adapted to the mpm by zhang et al 2009 zabala alonso 2011 and so on however since fluid accelerations are neglected in this formulation this makes it impossible to capture high frequency movements when the coupling between soil and water needs to be dealt with navas et al 2017 in addition this formulation will bring numerical troubles in the explicit mpm with linear element as indicated in the literature yerro 2015 song et al 2017 the mixed displacement pressure approaches suffer from pressure instability problems if the number of degrees of freedom used to interpolate the pressure is lower than that used to interpolate the displacements to accommodate with the explicit mpm in this research the velocities of solid and liquid as the main unknowns for the hydro mechanical component in this v s v l formulation each node has four degrees of freedom in 2d problems and the pore pressure is obtained afterwards this formulation automatically ensures the consistency between pressure and stress jassim 2013 what s more the application of impervious boundary conditions with v s v l formulation is more straightforward than the u s pl formulation especially when inclined boundaries are involved navas et al 2016 accordingly this formulation is the most popular formulation in mpm for hydro mechanical couplings in more recent researches such as jassim 2013 yerro et al 2015 and bandara and soga 2015 3 coupled seepage erosion deformation gimp 3 1 weak form of the governing equations the momentum balance equation of the porous mixture 10 the momentum balance for liquid phase 11 the mass conservation equation for fine particle species 9 the fines erosion law 15 are selected as the governing equations to be solved by the explicit mpm with the solid velocity v s the liquid velocity v l the liquidised fines concentration ce and the solid fines mass content m e as the main unknown variables the weak forms of these governing equations are given as 17 ω 1 n ρ s a s δ u d ω ω t t δ u d ω t ω σ δ u d ω ω ρ b δ u d ω ω n s l ρ l a l δ u d ω 18 ω

x e v l v s d ω 0 in which δ u δ w δc δm are the virtual field variables for solid displacement liquid displacement liquidised fines concentration and solid fines mass content respectively t σ n is the surface force per unit area acting on the border ω t of the mixture n is the unit normal to the boundary surface p l n s l p l m n is the prescribed pressure on the border ω p l of the liquid qe is the source term q e 1 c e n s l ρ e j d s m e d t 3 2 gimp discretisation in the framework of three phase single point mpm the analysed body is represented by a cloud of material points which moves attached to the solid skeleton carrying all the information and providing a lagrangian description an eulerian background grid defining the physical space a body moves in is adopted on which governing equations are solved in every time step since some physical variables can be either associated with a particle p or with a node i in what follows we will use the subscript p to indicate particle variables and use the subscript i to indicate nodal variables by default physical variables without these explicit subscripts will be associated with particles within the original mpm sulsky et al 1994 the interpolation shape functions which map information between particles and grid nodes are chosen as the dirac delta functions these shape functions are linear c0 continuous whose gradients are discontinuous at the cell boundary which leads to notorious cell crossing instability when particles cross a cell boundary zhou et al 1999 the generalized interpolation material point gimp method developed by bardenhagen and kober 2004 adopted the so called particle characteristic function to replace the linear basis functions for the information mappings compared with the original mpm the weighting functions of gimp are c1 continuous with no discontinuous gradients at the cell boundary and therefore the associated cell crossing errors can be reduced significantly the gimp replaces the original point evaluation of the mpm integrals with a weighted average integral over a finite domain in the neighbourhood of the particle according to the gimp any continuous function f is represented by the summation of the function value at the material points and can be integrated as bardenhagen and kober 2004 21 ω f x d ω ω p f p x p x d ω where fp is the value of the function on particle p and xp x is a particle characteristic function of space position x which integrates to the volume associated with particle p in our three phase single point mpm model the weight of air phase is neglected the solid phase mass msp liquid phase mass mlp as well as the total mass mp of each material point can be calculated with 22 m s p ρ s v p m l p ρ l p v p m p 1 n p m s p s l p n p m l p in which ρ lp 1 cep ρ w cepρ e ρ e ρ e ρ s and the particle volume vp is initialised with v p 0 ω x p x d ω bardenhagen and kober 2004 and will be updated in each step by using eq 21 and eq 22 the weak forms of governing equations eq 17 to eq 20 can be expressed in their particle based forms for example the particle based form of the momentum balance equation of the porous mixture eq 17 is expanded as 23 p ω

update the particle velocity two methods are usually used in the literature for particle methods particle in cell pic harlow 1964 and fluid implicit particle flip brackbill 1988 the flip update increments particle velocity using accelerations extrapolated to the grid while the pic update extrapolates the grid velocity directly to the particle 34 flip v α p flip n 1 v α p n i a α i n s ip n δ

updating other main unknowns to improve stability for example the liquidised fines concentration can be updated with this approach as so to introduce artificial diffusivity to stabilize the convection term when the peclet number is high in this study the above mixed approach is only limited for updating particle velocities of solid and liquid phase the erodible mass fraction and liquidised fines

prescribed solid velocity boundary u s x t u s t on the boundary ω u s the prescribed liquid pressure boundary p l x t n p l t on the boundary ω p l and the prescribed liquid velocity boundary u l x t u l t on the boundary ω u l in addition the prescribed liquidised fines volumetric concentration boundary c x t c t on the boundary ω c is needed see yerro 2015 and nairn 2019 for implementation details note that the traction and liquid pressure boundaries are prescribed on the surfaces of the moving particles and the displacement and concentration boundaries are prescribed by enforcing fixed velocity and concentration at the background nodes a boundary without any restriction means that yerro 2015 the solid skeleton can move freely the total stress is zero the liquid pressure is zero the liquid phase can move freely and the concentration is not restricted 3 5 numerical algorithm the algorithm of the coupled seepage erosion deformation mpm consists of the following steps in which the classic update stresses last usl method bardenhagen 2002 was adopted for stresses and strains update the time step for our explicit mpm is ensured within the minimum time step criterion for unsaturated hydro mechanical problems proposed by yerro 2015 1 initialization 1a for t 0 a background grid is set up as the computational mesh the continuum body is discretized with material particles

the terms needed for governing equations eq 30 to eq 33 are assembled with the field variables evaluated at the step n including the contributions from the body force acceleration b and the liquid

model as well as its implementation is validated and verified by three examples the first example is to simulate the drainage test of saturated soil column with which the coupling of unsaturated seepage and deformation is validated the second example is to simulate the internal erosion test with which the coupling of saturated seepage and erosion is validated and the characteristics of the adopted erosion law are illustrated the third example is to simulate the infiltration induced fines migration process with which the coupling of unsaturated seepage and erosion is validated 4 1 drainage test seepage deformation the drainage test experiment of liakopoulos 1965 consisted of a 1 0 m high perspex column packed with del monte sand and instrumented to measure moisture tension along the height of the column bandara et al 2016 the del monte sand column was initially fully saturated by adding water from the top surface continuously the water supply ceased at the start of the experiment the two side walls were impermeable to water while the water was able to freely drain from the bottom the moisture tensions along the column height were measured during the desaturation due to gravity the test was simulated with the hydro mechanical component termed as hm gimp of the proposed coupled seepage erosion deformation gimp by turning off the erosion component in this simulation a 1 0 m high and 0 05 m width soil column fully saturated with water is considered the soil column is represented by a set of material points as illustrated in fig 2 a the background grid consists of cells with 0 05m 0 05 m and 4 material points per each cell note that when performing gimp analysis an additional layer of ghost cells will be added automatically to each boundary in all the examples soil behaviour is modelled using an isotropic linear poro elastic material with the hydro mechanical parameters taken from lewis and schrefler 1998 and wang et al 2018 young s modulus e 1300 kpa poisson s ratio v 0 40 intrinsic density of solid phase ρ s 2000 kg m3 intrinsic density of water species ρ w 1000 kg m3 bulk modulus of liquid kl 2 0e6 kpa initial soil permeability k l 0 1 0e 6 m s gravitational constant g 10 m s2 the water retention curve s l f p c and the permeability reduction factor k l k l 0 k r s l are also taken from lewis and schrefler 1998 and wang et al 2018 44 s l 1 1 9722 10 11 p c 2 4279 k r 1 2 207 1 s l 1 0121 the total stress tensor pore pressure and saturation have been specified by initial values in k0 state prior to the calculation to increase the time step in this example the mass scaling technique presented in jassim 2013 and yerro 2015 has been adopted for quasi static problems the mass terms m s i n and m l i n in eq 30 and eq 33 were scaled 1 e4 times which increased the time step for 100 times finally the time step used in the simulation is 1 0e 4 s additionally the pic fraction β l in eq 35 is chosen as 0 05 for the liquid velocity update the suction profile and the displacement profile along the column obtained by hm gimp are presented in fig 2b and fig 2c compared with the experimental data and the mpm results from wang et al 2018 since only the column bottom was open for water drainage the water inside the column flowed towards the bottom due to gravity this desaturation process led to gradual increase of suction along the column fig 2b meanwhile since only gravity is considered the increase of suction will also lead to the increase of effective stress accordingly the skeleton deformation induced by the change of effective stress accumulated with time which leads to settlement profiles shown in fig 2c as can be seen the hm gimp formulation can reproduce well the experimental data of liakopoulos 1965 besides the hm gimp results with cell size 0 05m 0 05 m are close to the mpm results of wang et al 2018 with cell size 0 1m 0 1 m 4 2 internal erosion test seepage erosion cividini and gioda 2004 s erosion law which is adopted to govern the internal erosion process in this research is developed based on internal erosion test results presented in sterpi 2003 to demonstrate its characteristics as well as to validate its implementation in our coupled seepage erosion deformation gimp abbreviated as sed gimp code the internal erosion tests reported in sterpi 2003 are simulated by our proposed coupled gimp in this section the soil specimen consists of sand and silt with the height of 14 cm and the diameter of 7 cm its fines content is 23 and void ratio is 0 51 the erosion tests were performed with different hydraulic gradients which generated upward seepage flows with different velocities leading to different erosion rates the mass of eroded fine particles was measured after drying the water flux from the top of specimens which contains fine particles in the proposed gimp the saturated soil column is represented by a layer of material points with the same size as the soil specimen which are located within 7 background cells with cell size 7cm 2 cm with 4 particles per cell all the boundaries for the solid phase have been fixed both the top and bottom boundaries are permeable for water while the lateral boundaries are impervious the soil in the model is assumed to be homogeneous the parameter associated with liquid flow and fines erosion are needed the initial porosity n 0 0 34 permeability k l 0 0 360 m h constant in this test as well as the initial fine mass fraction x e 0 0 2 are taken from sterpi 2003 the intrinsic density of solid ρ s is assumed to be 2600 kg m3 with the initial erodible mass content x e 0 1 n 0 ρ s the ultimate fines mass fractions x e at the end of the experimental tests is estimated as 0 19 based on the final eroded fines mass ratios under these four seepage velocities given in fig 3 then the parameter α er controlling the variation of x e and the parameter ker controlling the overall erosion sensitivity in the erosion law 15 are evaluated through the best fitting of the experimental data cividini and gioda 2004 uzuoka et al 2012 which are taken as 0 2 and 0 25 respectively to generate the darcy flows corresponding to the hydraulic gradients of 0 18 0 39 0 55 and 0 60 in the experiments the bottom boundary nodes are fixed with four corresponding seepage velocities i e 0 130 m h 0 281 m h 0 396 m h and 0 432 m h in this way the simulation is simplified as a 1d seepage erosion problem with constant seepage velocity zero solid velocity and constant liquid velocity the time step is set to 1 e 5 h and run for a total time 50 h in this simulation the hydraulic gradients as well as the velocity fields are homogenous along the depth therefore homogenous erosion rates will be generated which lead to homogenous fine content distributions within the soil specimens the evaluation profiles of the eroded fines mass ratio in the specimens under different constant seepage velocities are presented in fig 3a as can be seen consistent with the erosion model the erosion rate increases with the applied hydraulic gradient seepage velocity and the fine particles inside soils will be eroded until the fine content fraction reaches the ultimate long term fine content fraction which is also dependent on the seepage velocity the gimp simulation replicates the fem results as well as the experimental results quite well note that the discrepancy in the erodible mass between the numerical and the experimental results is due to the inaccuracies in the ultimate mass fraction curve as shown in uzuoka et al 2012 in our coupled gimp framework the internal erosion effect is mainly accounted for through the porosity change which is calculated by eq 4 in the model two contributions for the porosity change can be identified the skeleton deformation and the interphase mass transfer of fine species lei et al 2017b which are difficult to be separated in the experiment in this example to validate the implementation of this seepage erosion module the skeleton deformation is assumed to be restricted accordingly the porosity varies only with the internal erosion process as shown in fig 3b the porosity profiles simulated by the gimp almost overlap with the ones obtained by fem which are proportional to the erosion process 4 3 infiltration test seepage erosion this example simulates the coupled unsaturated infiltration and internal erosion process within a 1d unsaturated rigid soil column of 1 m length the example is an extension of the 1d infiltration example presented in yerro 2015 by further considering the internal erosion process the soil column is assumed to be unsaturated with a constant suction pc 0 5 mpa the bottom boundary is impervious gravity is neglected and the soil skeleton cannot deform the permeability is constant and the water retention curve is linearized according to sl 1 aspc in which as is a material constant at time t 0 the suction liquid pressure at the top of the column is enforced to zero to simulate the water infiltration phenomena in this extended example in addition to yerro 2015 s settings initial and boundary conditions related to internal erosion are necessary the initial mass content of erodible fine particles is assumed to be 340 kg m3 no liquidised fine particle exists in the liquid phase ce 0 and the concentration of the liquidised particles at the top surface is fixed at zero during the whole infiltration process accordingly the hydraulic loading by applying zero suction on the column top will not only induce penetration of clean water into the unsaturated soil column via the top boundary but also the internal erosion process in our numerical simulations two cases are considered 1 infiltration without erosion the yerro 2015 case 2 infiltration with erosion both cases are simulated with the proposed coupled gimp and coupled fem lei et al 2017a respectively in the fem model the soil column is meshed into 50 elements with 1d element size 0 02 m while in the gimp model it is meshed into 50 cells with cell size 0 1m 0 02 m with 4 particles per cell these infiltration tests are simulated for 9 s with the time step 2 5e 5 s see yerro 2015 for the minimum time step criterion the material parameters needed in these simulations are the erosion sensitive parameter ker 0 25 the initial mass fraction of erodible fines in solid phase x e 0 0 2 the reference low flow seepage velocity v 6 5e 5 m s the ultimate mass fraction of erodible fines under the reference velocity x e 0 19 the erosion law parameter controlling the ultimate mass fraction α er 0 2 initial porosity n 0 0 30 initial permeability k l 0 5 0e 8 m s intrinsic density of water species ρ w 1000 kg m3 intrinsic density of solid species phase ρ e 2600 kg m3 bulk modulus of liquid kl 80 000 kpa material constant for swrc as 1 e 5 pa 1 the numerical results of both cases are presented in fig 4 as can be seen the numerical results obtained with the proposed coupled explicit gimp sed gimp are very close to the ones obtained with the coupled implicit fem sed fem overall the infiltration induced fine particle migration process simulated here is consistent with the similar case addressed in lei et al 2017a with water infiltration from the top surface the suction decreases gradually fig 4a while the water saturation increases at the meantime fig 4b the infiltration generates the downward seepage water flow fig 4c which erodes fine particles from the soil skeleton with time fig 4d and hence increases the porosity accordingly fig 4e upon erosion the eroded solid fines become parts of liquid phase whose concentration increases with the continuous erosion process and are transported downwardly along with the flowing water by advection fig 4f for the infiltration test without erosion described above analytical solution for suction evolution can be obtained yerro 2015 as can be seen in fig 4a the suction profiles obtained with the hydro mechanical component hm gimp of the proposed coupled gimp fit well with the analytical results hm ana the suction decrease in the case of hm gimp is slightly different from the one in the case of sed gimp which is directly linked to the contribution of solid fines erosion term in eq 7 under the assumptions of rigid skeleton and constant permeability 5 simulation of coupled seepage erosion deformation process within slopes soils in landslide deposits colluvial slopes and fill slopes sometimes show the geometrical features which are susceptible to internal erosion under rainfall infiltration lei et al 2017a zhang et al 2017 upon seepage induced erosion fine particles will be transported from the upper part and surface of the slope to the toe and deeper part of the slope crosta and di prisco 1999 cui et al 2014 2017 hu et al 2018 the fines migration process will inevitably alter the hydromechanical characteristics of slope soils which influences the both the failure mechanism and the post failure motion of the slope in this example the rainfall induced failure process of an unsaturated slope comprised of soils prone to internal erosion is simulated with the proposed coupled seepage erosion deformation gimp to demonstrate its capability to simulate the evolving coupled multi physical process in unsaturated soils as well as to hand large deformations the whole failure stage from initiation to run out of both the cases with erosion seepage erosion deformation coupled sed gimp and without erosion hydro mechanical coupled hm gimp are modelled and compared 5 1 model settings the geometry of the slope simulated in this example as well as its gimp discretisation is presented in fig 5 as can be seen the slope is 7 m high with the slope angle 35 a layer of material points is placed beneath the bottom of the slope which interacts with the landslide mass through the internal friction so as to avoid boundary effects on the run out behaviour the slope model contains 5120 material points which are distributed uniformly in a background grid of four material points per cell with the cell size 0 25m 0 25 m note that cells at the slope surface may contain less than four material points both the right and left sides of the material point domain are prescribed with roller boundary for both solid and liquid phase which prevents horizontal displacement and liquid flow a fully fixed boundary for both solid and liquid phase is prescribed at the bottom to simulate a perfectly rough interface with the impermeable bedrock below zero pore liquid pressure and concentration boundary conditions are assigned on the slope surface to trigger clean rainfall infiltration the slope soil is assumed to be a homogeneous sandy soil whose fine particles can be eroded upon rainfall infiltration the mohr coulomb model using bishop s effective stress presented in section 2 2 is adopted to capture the soil failure behaviour and the van genuchten s equation is adopted as the soil water retention law van genuchten 1980 45 s l s min 1 s min 1 α v p c p c r e f n v 1 1 n v in which sl is the liquid saturation pc and pc ref are the matric suction and the reference suction value s min is the minimum residual saturation can be reached α v nv are fitting parameters all the material points are assigned with the same material parameters including the ones for mohr column model darcy seepage flow internal erosion law and soil water retention curve which are given in table 4 a high permeability is used to accelerate wetting process and to reduce the computational time yerro et al 2015 wang et al 2018 the influence of the changes of porosity on the intrinsic permeability uzuoka et al 2012 and the dependence of the liquid permeability on the degree of saturation yerro et al 2015 are taken into account by the following power law 46 k r n s l n n 0 3 s l 3 the internal erosion effect is taken into account through the erosion induced porosity change in this example only the permeability change according to the above equation is taken into accounted as the erosion effect the erosion induced soil mechanical properties change which is ignored for simplicity in this demonstrative case can be further considered by reducing the shear strength parameters lei et al 2017b or by other advanced models the

fitting parameter α v 0 44 swrc fitting parameter nv 3 04 with the above swrc parameters the soil water retention curve the dependence of permeability on liquid saturation and the dependence of permeability on porosity are calculated and presented in fig 6 for simplicity the initial suction throughout the slope is assumed to be constant an initial suction of 50 0 kpa corresponding to a saturation of 0 375 is prescribed across the domain and then the initial stresses are generated in equilibrium with the gravity force and this suction value once in situ stress state is obtained a zero pore liquid pressure is maintained on the slope surface to represent the situation corresponding to the saturated surface infiltration without any surface ponding for the sake of comparison both cases with and without internal erosion process are analysed the calculations are run with the time step 1 e 4 s and last for 45 s to stabilize the solution the pic fraction for solid velocity update β s is chosen as 0 005 while the one for liquid velocity update β l is chosen as 0 05 5 2 overview of the whole failure process the evolution contours of liquid pressure saturation equivalent plastic shear strain horizontal displacement erodible fines mass fraction as well as the volumetric concentration of liquidised fines during the whole failure process of the slope in the case sed gimp with erosion are presented in fig 7 to fig 9 due to the zero pore liquid pressure boundary condition prescribed on the slope surface at t 0 s a major change in water pressure from 50 kpa to 0 kpa took place near the slope surface at this initial stage due to the water pressure gradient water infiltrates into the unsaturated slope continuously saturation was also increased accordingly which increases the weight of the soil water mixture gradually since an impermeable bottom is assumed for the slope water can accumulate once reaching this boundary at time t 5 s positive water pressure can be observed near the toe of the slope and plastic shear strains begin to develop near this region along with the water infiltration plastic shear strains develop and accumulate with time at time t 15 s continuous localised plastic shear strains can be observed through the slope toe to the slope top which represents that an continuous slip surface has been developed and the slope failed totally since this time large deformation took place and the failed mass starts to move downwardly under gravity the initial geometry prior to rainfall infiltration is illustrated with red curves in the equivalent plastic shear strain calculated from the deviatoric part of the plastic strain tensor ɛ s p l d e v through 2 3 ɛ s p l d e v ɛ s p l d e v contour presented in fig 8 as can be seen along with the continuous development of the equivalent plastic shear strain the geometry of the slope changed significantly after t 15 s at t 35 s the slope was fully saturated and the liquid pressure in the slope is distributed in a nearly hydrostatic condition retrogression can be observed after the full saturation of the slope which was similar to the slope example in wang et al 2018 by using the coupled seepage erosion deformation gimp sed gimp the evolution of mass fraction of erodible fine particles and the volumetric concentration of liquidised fines particles can be obtained as can be seen the internal erosion process developed along with the infiltration process which led to severe fine particles decrease near the slope surface meanwhile liquidised fines particles are generated along with the erosion process which are then transported along with the flowing fluid toward the interior slope in this example the mechanical properties are assumed to be constant the erosion process only affects the wetting process by changing the porosity the failure mode of cases with and without internal erosion process are the same but different in the failure time 5 3 effect of erosion on wetting process to better illustrate the effect of internal erosion process considered in this example i e change of porosity the evolution profiles of filed variables along section s1 x 1 m for cases with and without erosion are compared in fig 10 in the sed gimp case erodible fine particle mass fraction decreased with time due to the seepage induced internal erosion while fines fraction was kept at its initial value 340 kg m3 in the hm gimp case fig 10a the evolution of porosity in our coupled seepage erosion deformation formulation is governed by eq 4 as shown in fig 10b the porosity induced by mechanical deformation was small in the case hm gimp while porosity was increased significantly along with the internal erosion process case sed gimp the erosion effect in this example was taken into account by adopting since a porosity dependent permeability evolution law eq 46 was adopted in this example this erosion induced porosity increase will increase the soil permeability which facilitated the water infiltration process as shown in fig 10c and fig 10d the wetting process was advanced evidently by this internal erosion process 5 4 failure mechanism to study the failure mechanism and the post failure motion of the slope time evolution information of the five monitoring material points presented in fig 5 will be extracted and analysed as indicated by fig 8a p1 p2 p3 are located on the initial slip surface but different in altitude while p4 p2 p5 are located on the same horizontal plane but different in their distances to the slope surface p2 and p5 are located on two different slip surfaces while p4 is out of any slip surface the evolution profiles of liquid pressure and saturation of p1 p2 p3 from both the sed gimp case and the hm gimp case are presented in fig 11 the wetting from slope surface led to the gradual increase of liquid pressure fig 11a the saturation increased with the liquid pressure according to the swrc law eq 45 p1 which is near the slope toe became fully saturated first followed by p2 and p3 fig 11b due to the erosion enhanced permeability the wetting process in the case sed gimp was faster than the one in the case hm p1 p2 p3 reached the full saturation state at 11 3 s 17 8 s 28 6 s respectively in the case sed gimp and at 13 7 s 21 5 s 35 9 s in the case hm the effective stress paths the effective mean stress σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 3 vs the deviatoric shear stress 1 2 σ 1 σ 2 2 σ 2 σ 3 2 σ 3 σ 4 2 of p1 p2 and p3 during the whole slope failure process are shown in fig 11c the wetting process on one hand changed the effective mean stress by increasing liquid pressure and saturation term slpl in eq 12 and on the other hand increased the total stresses by increasing the self weight of the upward soils increasing the density of mixture in eq 10 for point p1 the later effect dominated both the effective mean stress and the deviatoric stress increased upon wetting until reaching the failure surface for p2 and p3 self weight increase effect dominated at the very early stage then the effective mean stress decreased continually upon wetting which led to their final failure the failure time of each point is also marked with point in fig 11b as can be seen p1 p2 p3 reached the yield surface successively plastic strains accumulated simultaneously when these points were located on the yield surface once these points failed and formed a continuous slip surface large deformations took place as shown by the significant increase of plastic shear strain in fig 11d again since the erosion process is assumed only affect the wetting process by changing the permeability the field variables presented in fig 11 obtained from both the case sed gimp and the case hm gimp have very similar evolution tendency but only different in the failure time though not considered here once the erosion induced mechanical degradation is considered the yield surface in fig 10 for case sed gimp would move downwardly along with the erosion process which further decreases its failure time the evolution profiles of liquid pressure and saturation of p4 p2 p5 which are located on the same horizontal plane are presented in fig 12a and fig 12b the wetting front reached p4 p2 p5 successively whose arrival times were proportional to their distance to the slope surface compared with those of p1 p2 p3 these differences among p4 p2 p5 are more distinct so as the arrivals of the wetting front to these points the erosion effect is also evidently demonstrated by the accelerated wetting process in the case sed gimp compared to the one in the case hm gimp the effective stress paths of p4 p2 p5 are also compared in fig 12c for p4 the wetting decreased its effective mean stress and increased its deviatoric stress but no enough to lead its final failure for p5 the wetting increased both the effective mean stress and the deviatoric stress initially which led to its failure at the early stage however the stress was then released by the continuous failure along p1 p2 p3 accordingly the plastic development on p5 was suspended however later on around 35 s in the case sed gimp the slope was fully saturated the increase of positive liquid pressure decreased the effective mean pressure rapidly which led p5 to reach the yield surface again at this time a continuous slip surface has formed through p5 fig 9 a accordingly significant plastic shear strains generated after that as shown in fig 12d 5 5 post failure motion the run out velocities x direction as well as run out distances x direction of the material points p1 to p6 p6 is added to illustrate the maximum run out distance are presented in fig 13 and fig 14 for points p1 p2 p3 p4 p6 two peaks can be observed in the velocity profiles which were related to the development of two failure stages shown in fig 8a while for p5 only one peak can be observed in the velocity profiles which is related to the retrogression after full saturation of the slope the first failure stage is characterized as shallow failure of the near surface mass due to the vertical rainfall infiltration while the second stage is due to the liquefaction of the saturated slope the post failure motions of the case sed gimp and the case hm gimp are similar in this example which are mainly different in time in more complicated cases the erosion will change the residual strength and dilation of soils the differences will be larger however one can note that slight differences can be found between these two cases in peak velocity values fig 13a the maximum velocities of the first and the second failure stage in the case sed gimp were around 0 35 m s and 0 32 m s respectively while they were about 0 30 m s and 0 41 m s respectively in the case hm gimp according to our model the internal erosion will on one hand transferred the solid fine particles to liquidised fine particles which are transported away by the flowing water and on the other hand increase the porosity which therefore allow the soils per volume to store more liquid the combined effect affects the density of the soil water mixture which will lead to the difference between the failed sliding mass in two cases hence the difference in velocities the developments of the total displacement of these points are consistent with the velocity profiles presented above the landslide in the case sed gimp stopped at around t 40 s while it stopped at around t 43 s in the case hm gimp the maximum run out distance of the slope can be obtained from p6 directly which was 3 74 m in the case sed gimp and 3 93 m in the case hm gimp since only the erosion induced permeability change is considered the differences between these two cases are mainly due to their failure time and saturation state at the failure point fig 11 b accordingly their difference in terms of the maximum run out distance is very small indeed for this localised failure problem the influence of background mesh size could be larger than the influence of this erosion induced permeability change with a coarser mesh 0 5m 0 5 m the maximum run out distance in the case sed gimp and case hm gimp at the end of the calculation t 45 s was calculated to be 3 42 m and 3 50 m respectively therefore it is important to emphasise here that a very fine mesh 0 25m 0 25 m is adopted in the example so as to mitigate its influence on the shear band development and the comparison between case hm gimp and case sed gimp is performed with this same fine mesh with constant shear strength parameters so as to demonstrate the sed gimp s potential to simulate the coupled process of erosion and large deformation 6 conclusion the paper has developed a three phase multi species single point material point method mpm framework for modelling the coupled seepage erosion deformation process within unsaturated soils involving large deformations based on the mixture theory the unsaturated soils under suffusion were conceptualized as three phase multi species porous continua governing equations for capturing the skeleton deformation liquid flow erosion of solid fine particles and convection of liquidised fine particles have been proposed within the explicit dynamic mpm framework and were discretized by the generalized interpolation material point gimp spatially the proposed coupled seepage erosion deformation gimp has been validated and verified by modelling the liakopoulos 1965 s drainage tests sterpi 2003 s internal erosion tests and the infiltration tests involving internal erosion the capability of the proposed gimp for simulating coupled seepage erosion deformation process involving large deformations was then demonstrated by modelling the rainfall induced failure process of an unsaturated slope comprised of soils prone to internal erosion the effects of erosion on the rainfall infiltration process the slope failure mechanism as well as the post failure run out behaviour have been analysed it is shown that the coupled seepage erosion deformation behaviour during both the pre failure and post failure stages can be captured by the proposed gimp therefore it is suggested that the proposed mpm framework is a promising approach for future studies of coupled seepage erosion deformation problems involving large soil deformations e g failure of dams levees and slopes due to internal erosion which are difficult to be treated by traditional mesh based methods it is also worth noting that the current coupled mpm framework can be also extended to consider some more complicated phenomena during the internal erosion process for example an additional deposition law for liquidised fine particles can be added into the governing equation system so as to take into account the clogging phenomena during the fine particles migration process e g lei et al 2017a advanced soil constitutive models e g yang and yin 2018 can be adopted to further account for the erosion effect on the soil stress strain behaviour evolving dilation laws e g iverson and george 2014 can be developed to better capture the effect of erosion induced grading porosity changes on the whole slope failure process these phenomena which are important for the accurate modelling of internal erosion problems and are neglected in this research for simplicity can be taken into account within our coupled mpm framework what s more mpm is a mesh based particle method which suffers from mesh sensitive issues therefore further advanced techniques e g burghardt et al 2012 pinyol et al 2018 could be used to improve its

486,tremendous efforts have been made for obtaining surface soil moisture sm at high spatial resolutions from microwave based products via spatial downscaling in recent years machine learning has been one of the most advanced techniques in sm spatial downscaling the performance of a machine learning technique in sm spatial downscaling varies with the algorithm and the underlying surface however despite the importance of machine learning for sm downscaling there are still only few inter comparisons particularly over different surfaces in this study the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms in downscaling the ecv the essential climate variable program initiated by the european space agency sm dataset was validated over different underlying surfaces six machine learning algorithms artificial neural network ann bayesian baye classification and regression trees cart k nearest neighbor knn random forest rf and support vector machine svm were implemented to establish the spatial downscaling models with reliable continuous in situ sm observations over four case study areas including the okalahoma mesonet okm in north america naqu network nan in the tibetan plateau remedhus rem network in northeast spain and oznnet ozn in southeast australia the land surface temperature lst normalized difference vegetation index ndvi albedo digital elevation model dem and geographic coordinates were the explanatory variables and their contributions to the downscaling models over different surfaces were quantified the conclusions of the experiments can be summarized as follows 1 the rf achieved excellent performance with a high correlation coefficient and a low regression error the baye and knn also demonstrated favorable capabilities for sm downscaling however the robustness of their algorithms needed further improvements numerous abnormal values were obtained in the scale down process by the ann cart and svm methods suggesting their comparative inadequacy in sm downscaling 2 downscaled 1 km resolution sm in rem generally presented a close correlation with the in situ measurements and its bias was larger than that in the other three regions comparatively the smallest bias with the second highest correlation was found in the ozn region it was primarily deduced that regions that located in one single climate zone and had mild topography variation and medium vegetation coverage tended to produce high accuracy results 3 the feature importance index fii calculated by the rf model revealed that the dem daytime lst and ndvi were dominant during reconstruction particularly dem in a study region with a large height difference the specific fii of each independent variable varied remarkably across the different case study areas probably owing to the complex hydrothermal as well as physical geography conditions the results of this study demonstrate that the rf model outperforms the other models considered herein furthermore the effect of the

general high accuracy continuous time series and complete spatial coverage are the common requirements for an ideal sm product in the 1950s the soviet union and mongolia started to record ground sm using monitoring sensors such as coring devices e g auger to determine the national soil water content walker and houser 2001 sheffield and wood 2006 ground observations had a considerable advantage in that they can provide precise sm measurements at a specific time site and depth via sensor networks however it was barely possible to draw nationwide sm maps by referring to only dozens of ground stations because there existed an enormous scale gap between point and regional sm values concurrently the non uniformity in the sensor distribution inconsistency in the monitoring period and differences in the sensor types further hindered acquiring qualified sm maps by spatial point based interpolation approaches to fundamentally resolve this problem there was an attempt to use a microwave radiometer and a radar onboard a satellite to retrieve large scale surface sm allowing obtaining the daily sm condition across the globe vyas et al 1985 subsequently gradually numerous earth observation programs were established and correspondingly sm products emerged njoku et al 2003 rosenqvist et al 2007 entekhabi et al 2010 chan et al 2016 it could be well accepted that each satellite derived sm product possesses unique characteristics which were illustrated by its specific retrieving band inversion algorithm spatial temporal resolution monitoring length and null value strip angiulli et al 2004 considering the factual applicability heterogeneity in different sm products the european space agency esa initiated the essential climate variable soil moisture ecv sm program in 2010 aiming to develop a global daily and long time series sm product with a satisfactory performance by integrating multi source satellite based sm products finally the ecv sm product was built by combining three active microwave sm products ers 1 2 attema et al 1998 metop a ascat bartalis et al 2007 and metop b ascat wagner et al 2013a and seven passive microwave sm products smmr paloscia et

across networks further researches demonstrated that its low pixel resolution 0 25 hindered its application on the watershed scale peng et al 2016 liu et al 2017a peng et al 2017 moreover to analyze regional hydrologic phenomena such as drought flood and irrigation it might be necessary to utilize fine resolution i e 1 km sm data to embody the detailed sm texture change to improve the spatial resolution of satellite retrieved sm products considerable research has been conducted to develop sm downscaling techniques srivastava et al 2013 jing et al 2018 among them machine learning ml

results the ml algorithm family has been widely applied in high resolution sm generation driven by multi source data fusion the performances of ml approaches in sm spatial downscaling varied with the algorithm and the underlying surface however despite the importance of their application in sm downscaling there were only few inter comparisons particularly over different surfaces hence the main objective of our research was to evaluate the capabilities of the ann baye cart knn rf and svm techniques in the ecv sm downscaling application this was achieved using modis products over different continental case study areas with diverse land surface parameter features and continuous stable ground observations 2 study areas and data source 2 1 study areas this research attempted to explore the performances of several ml techniques in generating high resolution sm for multiple underlying surfaces we selected four regions with stable long time series data and representative physical geography background as the typical areas to conduct the research they were located in the south of the high plains of the mississippi river basin called the okalahoma mesonet okm northern part of the iberian peninsula called remedhus rem southeastern margin of the tibetan plateau called the naqu network nan and mountainous and coastal plains of southeast australia called oznnet ozn fig 1 the study time period of okm was from 1st january 2010 to 3rd october 2011 the time range of rem and nan was from 1st january 2013 to 31st december 2014 and the time span of ozn was from 1st january 2010 to 31rd may 2011 2 1 1 okm the okm sm monitoring network includes 99 valid sites its data are widely used in the analysis of hydrological phenomena in interdisciplinary disciplines such as drought monitoring water balance exploration and remote sensed sm verification brock et al 2018 this monitoring network synchronously measures hourly sm data at depths of 5 cm 25 cm 60 cm and 75 cm van der veer martens et al 2017 the okm has a temperate continental climate with four distinct seasons the temperature increases from the northwest to the southeast and precipitation decreases from the east to the west table 1 lists the types of land covers and the number and percentage of sites in the region with numerous rivers winding through the region the main land cover types are dry farmlands deciduous broad leaved forests and herbaceous vegetation considering the limitation of satellite microwave penetration 5 cm depth measurements were taken to conduct the verification 2 1 2 rem the intensive rem monitoring network is located in northwest spain with 24 sites in its 35 35 km2 area sanchez et al 2012a each ground station acquires 0 5 cm soil humidity records hourly by hydrological probes besides sm product evaluation it is also widely used in hydrological model calibrations sánchez et al 2010 influenced by the north atlantic warm current the rem region has a typical temperate marine climate accompanied by 800 mm of annual precipitation which mainly occurs in winter benito et al 2008 impacted by the seasonal temperature and precipitation factors the sm can be high in winter and low in summer moreover the duro river breeds large tracts of farmland through the plain concurrently 65 of the stations are located in croplands proving that the local institution gives high importance to the plant products industry table 2 2 1 3 nan the nan is located in the alpine plateau climate area of the central qinghai tibet plateau at an average altitude of 4000 5000 m the representative and dominant land cover type is plateau meadow yang et al 2013 simultaneously more than three fourths of the soil moisture stations in the monitoring network are located in alpine meadows table 3 precipitation and evapotranspiration are dominant in the nan sm cycle causing the sm to vary from residual to saturated su et al 2011 in view of its climate particularity and ecological fragility the qinghai tibet plateau is called the third pole of the world madsen 2016 therefore systematic verification in the qinghai tibet plateau is a key step in evaluating the applicability of sm products worldwide 2 1 4 ozn the ozn region is located in the maritime monsoon climate area of the mullenbiki river basin in southeast australia the monitoring stations in this area are mostly distributed in the central and southeastern low altitude plains as summarized in table 4 the main land cover types in the site area are cultivated land primary vegetation and built up areas smith et al 2012 the uniform distribution of precipitation artificial irrigation and flood irrigation in november constitute the hydrological factors increasing the sm mei et al 2016 currently the ozn monitoring records are mostly used to validate satellite sm products guerschman et al 2009 modis evapotranspiration peischl et al 2012 and land surface hydrological models richter et al 2004 this study compared the applicability of ml techiniques in sm downscaling in the southern and northern hemispheres by verifying the sm using the ozn and the other three aforementioned regions 2 2 ecv sm modis data and supplementary data 2 2 1 ecv sm the esa launched the climate change initiative program to observe the evolutionary trends of 15 elements strongly related to the climatic variation in 2010 dorigo et al 2015a the ecv sm being one of the research targets has received intensive attention since its inception gruber et al 2019 the ecv sm comprised of three active and seven passive microwave remote sensing sensors derived sm products it was a daily product with a 0 25 spatial resolution in this study we utilized the latest version version 4 4 ecv sm the employed data were from the esa sm official website https www esa soilmoisture cci org 2 2 2 modis data the data sources of the independent variables ndvi lst and albedo were taken from the modis website they were downloaded from the land process distributed active archive center https lpdaac usgs gov the daily lst was extracted from mod11a1 on board terra satellite and myd11a1 on board aqua satellite and the arithmetic mean of the day lst lst d and night lst lst n was calculated it can be considered that the mean values of land surface parameters from multi passing time satellites could be more representative of reflecting daily land surface conditions than any single satellite derived products in addition the daily lst fluctuation lst was calculated acting as an explanatory variable during the regression process the daily ndvi was calculated from the difference of the reflectances of the near infrared band and the red band divided by their sum the reflectances of the near infrared band and red band were derived from mcd43a4 modis nadir brdf adjusted reflectance in addition the albedo data were retrieved from mcd43a3 albedo model dataset 2 2 3 in situ measurements the ground observation records of the rem nan and ozn regions were acquired from the international soil moisture network ismn https ismn geo tuwien ac at en the ismn was a data hosting facility for global in situ sm measurements dorigo et al 2013 the ismn was initiated in 2009 to support the calibration and validation of remote sensing products and land surface models by collecting harmonizing and sharing sm datasets from various individually operating networks dorigo et al 2013 the okm data was accessed from the atmospheric radiation measurement user facility https www arm gov capabilities instruments okm it was built jointly by the oklahoma state university and the university of oklahoma al 2007 besides in this study the daily mean sm was represented by an hour by hour arithmetic average 2 2 4 other auxiliary data apart from the lst ndvi and albedo the digital elevation model dem and geolocation were also used in the regression model construction our study utilized the dem dataset from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model https earthdata nasa gov the geolocation defined by the longitude and latitude in this research was acquired from the corresponding pixel coordinates moreover mod44w was applied in the data preprocessing to filter out water bodies 3 methods 3 1 generating high spatial resolution soil moiture based on a downscaling approach the major steps of the approach for downscaling soil moisture data are shown as follows and the specific experimental process is shown in fig 2 1 first the collected explanatory variables were classified into dynamic variables and steady state variables as shown in fig 2 dynamic variables were composed of albedo ndvi lst d lst n and lst and steady state variables included dem longitude and latitude the daily changed dynamic data and steady state parameters were taken together to establish the sm regression model and they were smoothed by low pass filtering to remove the outliers in particular the savitzky golay sg algorithm was adopted to conduct the filtering process the sg method used least squares polynomial approximation sliding windows along the timeline to smooth sequential data and this method showed that fitting a polynomial to a set of input samples and then evaluating the resulting polynomial at a single point within the approximation interval was equivalent to discrete convolution with a fixed impulse response schafer 2011 being a favorable low pass filtering with both noise reduction and fidelity maintaining the sg algorithm has achieved good results in the field of remote sensing data processing bian et al 2010 chen and shu 2011 kim et al 2014 as a result this study used the sg method originated from scipy https scipy org which was a python based ecosystem of open source software for mathematics virtanen et al 2020 to achieve time series reconstruction of explanatory variable datasets 2 second explanatory variables were resampled to the same pixel resolution of the sm data to match the sm data on the spatial scale in order to assure the validity and presentation of training samples only when no less than half of the original explanatory variable pixels within one 0 25 pixel scope were valid can we carry out the resample process and the arithmetic means of the original pixels were calculated to indicate the value of the corresponding resampled 0 25 pixel further the scope spatial projection and geographical coordinates of all the training data were unified concurrently the mod44w product acted as a mask to filter out waterbody areas 3 third the preprocessed samples were imported into the ml algorithms to construct regression models on a 0 25 scale each ml algorithm established a prediction model based on its own principle as introduced in section 3 2 to simulate the samples 4 finally 1 km test data were introduced to established models to generate high resolution sm products the spatial scale conversion from 0 25 about 25 km to 1 km was conducted based on the accepted theory that models developed by explanatory variables over an appropriate range of scales are applicable to sm reproduction western et al 2002 besides numerous studies have succeeded in downscaling hydrological related elements with satisfying accuracy jing et al 2016c ke et al 2016 liu et al 2018a 3 2 machine learning algorithms ml algorithms have been broadly applied in satellite based sm regression and prediction studies valentine and kalnins 2016 park et al 2017 in this research six classical ml approaches were adopted to compare the applicability of the heterogeneity of each algorithm in sm downscaling over different continental regions besides fifty percent of the data was employed to the training process and the remaining fifty percent of the data was treated as test dataset the algorithms and the parameters used for training are briefily described as follows and details of the algorithms and their formulations are provided in the appdendix 1 ann ann is a flexible and efficient technique capable of building non linear models between the input and output samples hsu et al 1995 gardner et al 1998 a classical neural network backward propagation algorithm iterates to deal with the instances in the training set following the regression the differences between the predicted values and the real values are compared then the weight of each connection is updated by the reverse method from the output layer to the hidden layer and then to the input layer to minimize the error and optimize the regression results in this study the feed forward neural network ffnn regressor was employed to downscale sm with 1 hidden layer and 100 neurons the rectified linear unit function was taken as the activation function for the hidden layer the stochastic gradient based optimizer solver was used for weight optimization the value for numerical stability in solver was 1e 08 the initial learning rate was 0 001 the regularization term

optimization was 1e 4 2 baye the baye statistical model is mainly divided into two steps in the first step the likelihood function uses the training data following which the posterior distribution by combining the likelihood function with the prior distribution in the second step for a new test dataset the posterior weights obtained by the model are taken as the target weights and the weighted integrals are calculated in the entire parameter space to obtain the predicted data distribution fei fei and perona 2005 drummond and rambaut 2007 in the baye regression model of this study the iteration times were 300 3 cart cart is constructed by dividing the feature space into two parts to generate a binary tree breiman et al 1984 de ath and fabricius 2000 following the iterated division samples in same subgroup have maximal homogeneity whereas those in different subgroups have the maximal diversity the cut points are called nodes and the terminal nodes are called leaf nodes in general a cart is a binary regression tree algorithm the details of every utilized parameter in cart were shown as follows the minimum samples split was 2 the minimum samples leaf was 10 and the mean squared error was used to measure the quality of a split 4 knn knn classifies and regresses by measuring the distance between the different eigenvalues regardless of the distribution of the other distant samples if most of the k known samples that are closest to the unknown pending samples in the feature space belong to a certain category the pending samples also belong to that category keller et al 2012 noh et al 2017 it is a non parametric classifier and regressor altman 1992 the number of neighbors to use for k neighbors queries was 29 in particular the regression performance of three kernel functions ball tree k dimensional tree and brute were compared and the ball tree achieved the best performance 5 rf rf uses multiple decision trees to formulate an ensemble learning algorithm liaw and wiener 2002 vladimir svetnik et al 2003 chen and breiman 2004 it adopts a general sample extraction technology and repeatedly selects a group of samples for training randomly with replacement each subset has a cart and the final predicted value is the average value of all the subsets random subsets are extracted from the total training set with replacement the size of each subset is two thirds of the original sample set the cross validation method is adopted by the out of bag samples to evaluate the quality of the cart model established by each subset the parameters and their values used in the rf modeling process were displayed as follows the number of trees in the forest was 180 the minimum samples split was 2 the minimum samples leaf was 10 the maximum features was 9 the number of jobs to run in parallel was 1 the mean squared error was used to measure the quality of a split and the bootstrap samples were used when building trees 6 svm the basic principle of svm is to model one dimensional linear separable samples for linearly inseparable samples a low dimensional point set is gradually mapped to a non linear dimension until it is separable tong and chang 2001 the dimension raising of a non linear sample is achieved by using a linear hyperplane to segment the samples in the high dimensional space however this will significantly increase the computational complexity and time consumption keerthi et al 2014 to solve these problems high dimensional complex maps are frequently simplified using kernel functions to reduce the computational complexity to approximate the linear level specifically the radial basis function kernel was finally chosen to conduct the feature research after a performance comparison among the linear polynomial sigmoid and radial basis kernel functions 3 3 assessment approaches the correlation coefficient r goodness of fit r2 bias root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and unbiased root mean square deviation ubrmsd were used in this study the r is first devised by the statistician carl pearson and is an efficient indicator of the degree of linear correlation between variables taylor 1990 r2 indicates how well the regression line fits the observation this metric measures the overall fitting degree of the regression equation and is widely applied in multidisciplinary data statistics and analysis fagerland et al 1989 donner and eliasziw 1992 cheung and rensvold 2002 bias could depict the level of overestimation and underestimation of observations by model predictions in comparison the degree of dispersion of the predictions could be quantitatively reflected by both rmse and mae chai and draxler 2014 bias rmse and mae can be together used in this study to simultaneously describe the overestimation underestimation and magnitude of the error additionally ubrmsd is used to represent the difference of standard deviation between predictions and observations and is broadly utilized in sm accuracy evaluations kim et al 2017 stillman and zeng 2018 walker et al 2018 hence these metrics allows us to systematically and thoroughly explore the capability of different ml algorithms in sm downscaling over the case study areas and their equations are listed as follows 1 r i 1 n y i y x i x i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 2 r 2 i 1 n y i y x i x i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 3 b i a s i 1 n x i i 1 n y i n 4 r m s e i 1 n y i x i 2 n 5 m a e i 1 n y i x i n 6 u b r m s d i 1 n x i x y i y 2 n wherexi x yi y represent the simulated sm values at pixel i arithmetic means of all the pixels true sm value at station i averaged value of all the sm true values respectively 4 results 4 1 reconstruction comparison firstly regression models were established on the original ecv sm scale 0 25 grid resolution further the adopted approaches recontructed the sm on a 0 25 scale the reconstruction capacities of the six regression models were preliminarily evaluated across different regions the experiment first applied the regression model to reconstruct the ecv sm without a scale transition scatterplots and regression correlations of each ml technique applied in the four selected regions are shown in figs 3 6 regarding the reconstruction data of different areas the okm region best fitted the original ecv sm moreover the correlation coefficient was generally larger than 0 8 revealing the outstanding agreement with the spatiotemporal evolution trend of the ecv product meanwhile it achieved small rmse and mae values additionally the slope of the regression equation approached 1 and the intercept approached 0 indicating that the reconstructed values were extremely close to those of the original products and the over underestimation was not significant by contrast the fitting trends of the rem and nan were fairly good but there was a certain degree of overestimation in the ozn region the reconstructed sm slightly overestimated the original ecv products and the fitting coefficient was smaller than those of the other three regions this phenomenon dropping a hint that there could have to some extent pronounced gap between northern and southern hemisphere regressed sms different ml techniques generated heterogenous reconstruction results on the scale of 0 25 the fitting coefficients of the ann and cart reconstructed data against those of the original products were small accompanied by a remarkable deviation and overestimation generally the baye knn and svm simulated sm could effectively depict the value and change trend of the original ecv sm illustrating the stable suitability of these three algorithms the rf reconstructed data demonstrated prominent performance among all the algorithms the rf could not only regenerate the original ecv sm with superior precision but also accurately reproduce its temporal and spatial evolution trends 4 2 downscaled results figs 7 10 display the original ecv and downscaled fine resolution sm products of test dataset over four selected regions there was a large null value area in the original ecv due to the rfi dense vegetation and satellite ascending descending strip gap the null value area with the coarse resolution co limited its capacity in the overall coverage of land surface in comparison the 1 km high resolution sm not only enhanced the detail expressing ability but also realized spatial full coverage based on the downscaling results of all the algorithms in fig 7 the ann retrieved sm values deviated significantly from the original ecv sm data particularly in 2011 the downscaled value range even deviated from the main interval of 0 05 0 35 m3 m3 showing a large empty area in addition in the okm region overestimation of the western side was prevalent in all the downscaled sm conversely the ann precisely reproduced the spatial value distribution in the nan region as presented in fig 9 suggesting the applicability difference of a particular regression approach in different regions in the rem region the northern wet area was mainly covered with indigenous forest whereas the southern dry region was occupied by cropland the knn can overall efficiently differentiate the dry and wet region in fig 8 in the ozn region fig 10 both the knn and rf could accurately simulate the spatial differentiation characteristics of the original ecv sm overall the applicability of the same algorithm model varies between different regions concurrently underestimation in wet regions and overestimation in dry regions are common in all the algorithms despite the fluctuating underlying surface properties the rf maintains a robust performance in the four regions 4 3 in situ measurements based validation 4 3 1 quantitative evaluation in this study ground observations were employed as references to systematically evaluate the downscaling performance the bias r rmse and ubrmsd were selected to perform the quantitative analysis from multiple aspects via boxplots the boxplots are nonparametric visualization tools that could help the user discover the characteristic features of the data mirzargar et al 2014 the horizontal solid lines from top to bottom represent the maximum upper quartile median lower quartile and minimum values respectively in addition the horizontal dashed lines indicate the mean values and dots indicate potential outliers in the okm region the downscaled sm generally underestimated the measured data by varying degrees fig 11 the knn exhibited its unique superiority for the value accuracy because it only considered the nearest k members as the basis of the regression however it was difficult for this simple algorithm to ensure a high fitting degree while targeting accuracy contrastingly the downscaled data in rem region revealed overall overestimation fig 12 the knn algorithm continued its consistent advantage of high data accuracy bias 0 076 m3m 3 the largest deviation occurred in the ann downscaled sm bias 0 091 m3m 3 the deviation r rmse and ubrmsd of the downscaled sm in the nan regions in fig 13 were higher than those in the okm and lower than those in the rem region this phenomenon seemed to suggest that it could be difficult to be satisfactory in terms of both the absolute error and goodness of fit besides the 1 km resolution data located in the southern hemisphere yielded the minimum absolute error fig 14 apart from box plots scatter line charts were drawn to visually present the sm value distribution variation between the in situ measurements and ml techniques regressed results figs 15 18 basically the sm temporal change was in accordance with the local seasonal climate elements i e precipitation and temperature variation for example the north atlantic drift resulted sufficient precipitation and low temperature in winter co contributed to a high level sm in the rem region in fig 16 moreover the sm of the nan region from november to next february was not considered as the period with far below zero temperature and frozen soil water the downscaled sm was underestimated in the okm region overestimated in the rem and nan region and unstable under overestimated in the ozn indicating complex non linear applicability difference in different regions it can be inferred from the first sub figures of figs 15 18 that there exist numerous abnormal values in the ann simulated sm moreover the cart retrieved sm typically possesses an unsatisfactory fitting degree to in situ measurements in comparison the other four algorithms perform well basically therefore the subsequent assessment is mainly focused on the baye knn rf and svm 4 3 2 temporal series accuracy analysis the preceding sections have validated the relative outperformances of the baye knn rf and svm techniques in coarse sm downscaling particularly the robustness of the rf we conducted temporal based accuracy analysis to further explore the precision fluctuation characteristics of the downscaled sm due to seasonal rhythm changes tables 5 8 list the monthly downscaled sm temporal series accuracy in the four case study areas it seemed that the low fitting degree season of each region was not always the same in particular the main landcover type in the okm rem and ozn regions was cropland specifically artificial irrigation which occasionally occurred can remarkably induce an abrupt change in the surface sm an in situ measurement can precisely record the sm variation hourly however sensors on board an instantaneous transit satellite may miss the brief surge in the sm caused by irrigation owing to their individual climate features rainfall was scarce in the okm winter and rem summer the scarce precipitation and artificial irrigation may explain the reason why r is low in the period overall between the four presentable algorithms rf could still behave excellently with a fairly small bias and favorable r besides it was noticed that even though the rf models performed better in comparison to other models the r values could be relatively low or negative in some cases for instance as shown in tables 5 and 7 the correlation coefficients were weak in winter january february and december of okm and in spring and autumn march april may june and october of nan the water inside soil became ice water mixtures when the temperature falls to approximately zero degrees celsius the dielectric constant of the water 91 0 is nearly 30 times that of ice crystals 3 1 in theory tang et al 2019 therefore it can be hard for satellite sensors to accurately retrieve sm with ice water mixtures since the top layer soil temperature would inevitably fall to around zero in winter okm and in nan with average altitude of 4000 5000 m the sm retrieval uncertainty increased accordingly meanwhile previous researches have achieved similar assessment results about remotely sensed sm products in cold regions zeng et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 ma et al 2019 as a result it is preliminarily deduced that the uncertainty of ecv sm could have an enormous effect on the quality of the downscaled sm and it is suggested that maybe after the supplement of in situ measurements in the training dataset the accuracy of model simulated sm would be improved 4 3 3 error analysis given the significant difference in the downscaled sm derived from the ml approaches over inter continent regions scatterplots were drawn fig 19 between the bias and the sm and explanatory variables moreover the scatterplots and regression lines were drawn by using microsoft excel the comparisons were conducted among exponential linear logarithmic and polynomial functions and we selected the one with superior r2 to formulate the corresponding regression lines however the r2 could be hardly ideal even though we chose the relative proper functions after comparisons for example the ndvi and dem in rem region this phenomenon suggested that the sm bias could be in weak correlation to ndvi and dem in rem region it was found that the bias exhibited a negative correlation to the sm except for the ozn region overestimation occurred when the sm was below 0 22 m3m 3 and it became underestimation when the sm exceeded 0 22 m3m 3 the ozn region typically exhibited overestimation in the u shaped curve the ndvi and lst presented weak correlations to the bias apart from the nan region it was suggested that the ground sm may be humid in case of abundant vegetation cover and a relatively high lst in the tibet plateau the deviation caused by the geo location differences longitude latitude and dem between the observation stations was not significant we speculated that the non significant correlation may be attributed to the centralized distribution of each in situ station in the case study regions 4 4 feature importance assessment the importance percentage of each explanatory feature was calculated and presented in fig 20 it was found that dem predominates sm retrieval particularly over the okm rem and nan regions concurrently all the three regions exhibited a large elevation variation 1000 m suggesting that there may exist a coupling relationship between dem and the sm over regions with sharp elevation fluctuations a previous study stated the usefulness of dem in sm spatial modeling zhu et al 2009 moreover it appeared that the local topography may be more important in determining the sm condition than the classic soil wetness index murphy et al 2009 in particular when the topography can control a significant amount of the soil water movement the terrain could act as a reliable base data for the sm estimation however a relatively flat field topography can not be the only contributor to the soil water movements schmidt and persson 2003 in addition lst d had the second contribution rate indicating the strong relationship between the daytime lst and the sm actually compared to the lst n the lst always fluctuated volatilely fig 20 in general both the modis lst d and lst n were utilized in the sm to reflect the temperature change of an entire day they achieved high accuracy to the ground temperature sensor records wan et al 2004 wang et al 2007 moreover the ndvi was also a critical element in the sm downscaling previous studies have demonstrated a two way interaction between the vegetation condition and the sm farrar et al 1994a han et al 2010 chen et al 2014a furthermore much of the research in satellite based sm retrieval co combined the lst and ndvi to estimate the subsurface sm huang et al 2008 song et al 2013 holzman et al 2014 park et al 2014 basically the fii reveals that the dem daytime lst and ndvi are dominant during reconstruction particularly for dem in a study region with a large height difference the specific fii of each independent variable varies across the case study areas probably caused by the complex hydrothermal as well as physical geography conditions 5 discussions ai based ml approaches have been adopted to solve regression and prediction problems in the geoscience field since their inception numerous studies have focused on applying ml techniques to acquire downscaled sm with one case study area abbaszadeh et al 2019 lee et al 2019 our comparative research evaluated the performances of various ml techniques in sm downscaling in addition four case study areas which had quite different underlying surfaces and hydrothermal combination conditions were selected for the comparisons the validation results demonstrated that the rf achieved superior performance with high regression precision and robustness in the different areas concurrently the advantage of rf in simulating sm has been accepted by numerous scholars liu et al 2017 implemented the cart knn baye and rf methods to downscale the monthly ecv sm over northeast china liu et al 2017b the rf downscaled results had a superior matching performance to both the ecv sm and in situ measurements chen et al 2017 evaluated the logistic model tree rf and cart for the spatial prediction of landslide susceptibility the rf model exhibited the highest predictive capability chen et al 2017 rodriguez galiano et al 2012 explored the performance of the rf classifier for land cover classification of a complex area the results exhibited that the rf algorithm yielded accurate land cover classifications compared to a single decision tree rodriguez galiano et al 2012 the study regions were selected based on stable in situ measurements and extensive previous related research on sm brock et al 1995 sanchez et al 2012b mei et al 2017 1 km resolution sm in the rem region was most closely correlated to in situ measurements however its bias needed to be further reduced by comparison the smallest bias and the second highest correlation occurred in the ozn region it was primarily deduced that regions that located in one single climate zone and had mild topography variation and medium vegetation coverage tended to produce high accuracy results in addition the fii of each parameter varied with the region in general the dem daytime lst and ndvi constituted the major part in constructing the sm regression model specifically dem was suggested to be a critical element in areas with large elevation variation the strong bilateral interaction and correlation between the ndvi and sm has been testified by previous studies farrar et al 1994b schnur et al 2010 chen et al 2014b the daytime lst was more important than the nighttime lst and the lst daily fluctuation the ndvi lst and albedo data have been proved to have profound interactions to sm and been broadly used in sm downscaling and reconstruction with good performance jing et al 2018 bai et al 2019 wei et al 2019 moreover it was noticed that apart from the above mentioned lst the stand deviation of lst describing the distance that each lst data deviates from the average value was also closely linked to sm variation according to previous researches giraldo et al 2009 anton et al 2019b avram et al 2019 meanwhile the stand deviation of ndvi and albedo could also reflect the spatial and temporal fluctuation of sm carlson et al 1990 guan et al 2009 as a result we thought that it could be a promising attempt to combine the stand deviation of dynamic variables i e lst ndvi and albedo to estimate sm especially to simulate the variation characteristics of sm this study confirmed the competence of various ml techniques in predicting fine resolution sm over different continental regions the validation results proved the superiority of the rf which could accurately simulate sm at a 1 km scale however it seemed difficult for the regressed sm to transcend the original ecv sm in data precision the main reason was that the original ecv sm was employed as a training sample to establish the regression model specifically the quality of the original satellite based sm as the bottleneck factor of precision restriction became increasingly prominent hence sufficient in situ measurement based satellite sm data correction would be necessary in future studies the study of remote sensing sm downscaling has got long term and sustained attention given the importance of sm information in water cycle studies drought and flood monitoring and crop growth analysis peng et al 2017 meanwhile the scale effect could be a critical point because the patterns and processes of geographical phenomena have an implicit scale of variation ge et al 2019 previous study by ghanbarian et al 2015 showed that the regression based models would be improved if the effect of scale is incorporated in model development ghanbarian et al 2015 jing et al 2018 downscaled the spatial resolution ecv from 0 25 to 0 05 by using rf method and the validation was done in the united states and australia validation results indicated that the reconstructed soil moisture showed comparable good performance average r2 0 66 as the original ecv products average r2 0 65 and nicely reflected the temporal behavior of in situ measurements jing et al 2018 in comparison although the rf model successfully downscaled the ecv sm to 1 km scale with good performance it is suggested that the downscaling accuracy may get improved if the scale effect could be taken into consideration to realize smooth scale transition future experiments would focus on downscaling sm firstly from 0 25 to 0 05 and then from 0 05 to 1 km scale and accuracy evaluation derived comparison would be made between gradually downscaled sm and directly downscaled sm 6 conclusions in recent years tremendous efforts have been made to acquire high precision and resolution sm products across the world further ml techniques have revealed unique characteristics compared to statistical and physical models in scaling conversion ge et al 2019 this study systematically compared the performances of ml techniques in sm downscaling over four continental case study areas the applicability of algorithms regional heterogeneities and variables importance were considered during the evaluation process the rf outperformed all the other algorithms in terms of both the value accuracy and tendency variation the baye and knn also demonstrated preferable capability in sm downscaling however the robustness of these algorithms needed further improvement in terms of the regional factors the preliminary conclusion was that an underlying surface with a relatively stable hydrothermal combination moderate elevation change and medium vegetation coverage would tend to yield accurate downscaled sm in addition although apparently the fii of each parameter varied significantly across the different regions the dem daytime lst and ndvi were the major contributors to establishing the sm regression models the results of this study highlighted the outperformance of the rf model compared to the other considered models and the variations in the importance of the variables for the downscaling model over different underlying surfaces this study attempted to explore the capacity and suitability of ml techniques for ecv sm downscaling over diverse regions moreover it clarified the contribution rate of each explanatory variable the results are expected to act as references for subsequent studies focusing on applying appropriate algorithms and parameters to scale the conversion of sm or other earth science parameters in addition the future work would be concentrated on breaking the limitation of the quality of original satellite based sm to continuously improve the accuracy of downscaled sm

486,tremendous efforts have been made for obtaining surface soil moisture sm at high spatial resolutions from microwave based products via spatial downscaling in recent years machine learning has been one of the most advanced techniques in sm spatial downscaling the performance of a machine learning technique in sm spatial downscaling varies with the algorithm and the underlying surface however despite the importance of machine learning for sm downscaling there are still only few inter comparisons particularly over different surfaces in this study the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms in downscaling the ecv the essential climate variable program initiated by the european space agency sm dataset was validated over different underlying surfaces six machine learning algorithms artificial neural network ann bayesian baye classification and regression trees cart k nearest neighbor knn random forest rf and support vector machine svm were implemented to establish the spatial downscaling models with reliable continuous in situ sm observations over four case study areas including the okalahoma mesonet okm in north america naqu network nan in the tibetan plateau remedhus rem network in northeast spain and oznnet ozn in southeast australia the land surface temperature lst normalized difference vegetation index ndvi albedo digital elevation model dem and geographic coordinates were the explanatory variables and their contributions to the downscaling models over different surfaces were quantified the conclusions of the experiments can be summarized as follows 1 the rf achieved excellent performance with a high correlation coefficient and a low regression error the baye and knn also demonstrated favorable capabilities for sm downscaling however the robustness of their algorithms needed further improvements numerous abnormal values were obtained in the scale down process by the ann cart and svm methods suggesting their comparative inadequacy in sm downscaling 2 downscaled 1 km resolution sm in rem generally presented a close correlation with the in situ measurements and its bias was larger than that in the other three regions comparatively the smallest bias with the second highest correlation was found in the ozn region it was primarily deduced that regions that located in one single climate zone and had mild topography variation and medium vegetation coverage tended to produce high accuracy results 3 the feature importance index fii calculated by the rf model revealed that the dem daytime lst and ndvi were dominant during reconstruction particularly dem in a study region with a large height difference the specific fii of each independent variable varied remarkably across the different case study areas probably owing to the complex hydrothermal as well as physical geography conditions the results of this study demonstrate that the rf model outperforms the other models considered herein furthermore the effect of the

continually to serve different research needs reichle et al 2009 dorigo et al 2011 wagner et al 2013b chan et al 2016 dorigo et al 2017 matei et al 2017a matei et al 2017b bindlish et al 2018 in general high accuracy continuous time series and complete spatial coverage are the common requirements for an ideal sm product in the 1950s the soviet union and mongolia started to record ground sm using monitoring sensors such as coring devices e g auger to determine the national soil water content walker and houser 2001 sheffield and wood 2006 ground observations had a considerable advantage in that they can provide precise sm measurements at a specific time site and depth via sensor networks however it was barely possible to draw nationwide sm maps by referring to only dozens of ground stations because there existed an enormous scale gap between point and regional sm values concurrently the non uniformity in the sensor distribution inconsistency in the monitoring period and differences in the sensor types further hindered acquiring qualified sm maps by spatial point based interpolation approaches to fundamentally resolve this problem there was an attempt to use a microwave radiometer and a radar onboard a satellite to retrieve large scale surface sm allowing obtaining the daily sm condition across the globe vyas et al 1985 subsequently gradually numerous earth observation programs were established and correspondingly sm products emerged njoku et al 2003 rosenqvist et al 2007 entekhabi et al 2010 chan et al 2016 it could be well accepted that each satellite derived sm product possesses unique characteristics which were illustrated by its specific retrieving band inversion algorithm spatial temporal resolution monitoring length and null value strip angiulli et al 2004 considering the factual applicability heterogeneity in different sm products the european space agency esa initiated the essential climate variable soil moisture ecv sm program in 2010 aiming to develop a global daily and long time series sm product with a satisfactory performance by integrating multi source satellite based sm products finally the ecv sm product was built by

across networks further researches demonstrated that its low pixel resolution 0 25 hindered its application on the watershed scale peng et al 2016 liu et al 2017a peng et al 2017 moreover to analyze regional hydrologic phenomena such as drought flood and irrigation it might be necessary to utilize fine resolution i e 1 km sm data to embody the detailed sm texture change to improve the spatial resolution of satellite retrieved sm products considerable research has been conducted to develop sm downscaling techniques srivastava et al 2013 jing et al 2018 among them machine learning ml techniques have received most attention in sm assimilation owing to their flexibility and capability to deal with massive remote sensed data and non linear problems ali et al 2015 comprising of the probability theory statistics the approximation theory and a complex algorithm ml is a multi disciplinary technique bishop 2006 further it has been widely utilized to accurately simulate spatial geoscience processes lary et al 2016 araya and ghezzehei 2019 in terms of its utilization in sm studies liu et al 2017 compared different ml approaches classification and regression trees cart k nearest neighbor knn bayesian baye and random forest rf techniques for obtaining the monthly ecv sm over northeast china the results showed that the rf downscaled sm demonstrated superior matching performance to the in situ measurements compared to the other methods and could positively respond to precipitation variation liu et al 2017a srivastava et al 2013 attempted to downscale the smos soil moisture and ocean salinity sm by adopting artificial neural network ann and support vector machine svm approaches with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land surface temperature lst in southwest england they successfully proved the effectiveness of artificial intelligence ai in satellite based sm downscaling srivastava et al 2013 im et al 2016 conducted a case study in south korea and australia downscaling the amsr e advanced microwave scanning radiometer eos sm using ml based approaches and achieved high level coefficients against ground observations im et al 2016 being a subcategory of ai ml has proved its advantages in nonparametric regression in geoscience and remote sensing fields lary et al 2016 besides sm the above ml techniques can also be reliable methods to improve estimations in hydrology meteorology and their related fields wu and chau 2011 han and cluckie 2015 jing et al 2016a jing et al 2016b anton et al 2019a as demonstrated by the above research results the ml algorithm family has been widely applied in high resolution sm generation driven by multi source data fusion the performances of ml approaches in sm spatial downscaling varied with the algorithm and the underlying surface however despite the importance of their application in sm downscaling there were only few inter comparisons particularly over different surfaces hence the main objective of our research was to evaluate the capabilities of the ann baye cart knn rf and svm techniques in the ecv sm downscaling application this was achieved using modis products over different continental case study areas with diverse land surface parameter features and continuous stable ground observations 2 study areas and data source 2 1 study areas this research attempted to explore the performances of several ml techniques in generating high resolution sm for multiple underlying surfaces we selected four regions with stable long time series data and representative physical geography background as the typical areas to conduct the research they were located in the south of the high plains of the mississippi river basin called the okalahoma mesonet okm northern part of the iberian peninsula called remedhus rem southeastern margin of the tibetan plateau called the naqu network nan and mountainous and coastal plains of southeast australia called oznnet ozn fig 1 the study time period of okm was from 1st january 2010 to 3rd october 2011 the time range of rem and nan was from 1st january 2013 to 31st december 2014 and the time span of ozn was from 1st january 2010 to 31rd may 2011 2 1 1 okm the okm sm monitoring network includes 99 valid sites its data are widely used in the analysis of hydrological phenomena in interdisciplinary disciplines such as drought monitoring water balance exploration and remote sensed sm verification brock et al 2018 this monitoring network synchronously measures hourly sm data at depths of 5 cm 25 cm 60 cm and 75 cm van der veer martens et al 2017 the okm has a temperate continental climate with four distinct seasons the temperature increases from the northwest to the southeast and precipitation decreases from the east to the west table 1 lists the types of land covers and the number and percentage of sites in the region with numerous rivers winding through the region the main land cover types are dry farmlands deciduous broad leaved forests and herbaceous vegetation considering the limitation of satellite microwave penetration 5 cm depth measurements were taken to conduct the verification 2 1 2 rem the intensive rem monitoring network is located in northwest spain with 24 sites in its 35 35 km2 area sanchez et al 2012a each ground station acquires 0 5 cm soil humidity records hourly by hydrological probes besides sm product evaluation it is also widely used in hydrological model calibrations sánchez et al 2010 influenced by the north atlantic warm current the rem region has a typical temperate marine climate accompanied by 800 mm of annual precipitation which mainly occurs in winter benito et al 2008 impacted by the seasonal temperature and precipitation factors the sm can be high in winter and low in summer moreover the duro river breeds large tracts of farmland through the plain concurrently 65 of the stations are located in croplands proving that the local institution gives high importance to the plant products industry table 2 2 1 3 nan the nan is located in the alpine plateau climate area of the central qinghai tibet plateau at an average altitude of 4000 5000 m the representative and dominant land cover type is plateau meadow yang et al 2013 simultaneously more than three fourths of the soil moisture stations in the monitoring network are located in alpine meadows table 3 precipitation and evapotranspiration are dominant in the nan sm cycle causing the sm to vary from residual to saturated su et al 2011 in view of its climate particularity and ecological fragility the qinghai tibet plateau is called the third pole of the world madsen 2016 therefore systematic verification in the qinghai tibet plateau is a key step in evaluating the applicability of sm products worldwide 2 1 4 ozn the ozn region is located in the maritime monsoon climate area of the mullenbiki river basin in southeast australia the monitoring stations in this area are mostly distributed in the central and southeastern low altitude plains as summarized in table 4 the main land cover types in the site area are cultivated land primary vegetation and built up areas smith et al 2012 the uniform distribution of precipitation artificial irrigation and flood irrigation in november constitute the hydrological factors increasing the sm mei et al 2016 currently the ozn monitoring records are mostly used to validate satellite sm products guerschman et al 2009 modis evapotranspiration peischl et al 2012 and land surface hydrological models richter et al 2004 this study compared the applicability of ml techiniques in sm downscaling in the southern and northern hemispheres by verifying the sm using the ozn and the other three aforementioned regions 2 2 ecv sm modis data and supplementary data 2 2 1 ecv sm the esa launched the climate change initiative program to observe the evolutionary trends of 15 elements strongly related to the climatic variation in 2010 dorigo et al 2015a the ecv sm being one of the research targets has received intensive attention since its inception gruber et al 2019 the ecv sm comprised of three active and seven passive microwave remote sensing sensors derived sm products it was a daily product with a 0 25 spatial resolution in this study we utilized the latest version version 4 4 ecv sm the employed data were from the esa sm official website https www esa soilmoisture cci org 2 2 2 modis data the data sources of the independent variables ndvi lst and albedo were taken from the modis website they were downloaded from the land process distributed active archive center https lpdaac usgs gov the daily lst was extracted from mod11a1 on board terra satellite and myd11a1 on board aqua satellite and the arithmetic mean of the day lst lst d and night lst lst n was calculated it can be considered that the mean values of land surface parameters from multi passing time satellites could be more representative of reflecting daily land surface conditions than any single satellite derived products in addition the daily lst fluctuation lst was calculated acting as an explanatory variable during the regression process the daily ndvi was calculated from the difference of the reflectances of the near infrared band and the red band divided by their sum the reflectances of the near infrared band and red band were derived from mcd43a4 modis nadir brdf adjusted reflectance in addition the albedo data were retrieved from mcd43a3 albedo model dataset 2 2 3 in situ measurements the ground observation records of the rem nan and ozn regions were acquired from the international soil moisture network ismn https ismn geo tuwien ac at en the ismn was a data hosting facility for global in situ sm measurements dorigo et al 2013 the ismn was initiated in 2009 to support the calibration and validation of remote sensing products and land surface models by collecting harmonizing and sharing sm datasets from various individually operating networks dorigo et al 2013 the okm data was accessed from the atmospheric radiation measurement user facility https www arm gov capabilities instruments okm it was built jointly by the oklahoma state university and the university of oklahoma al 2007 besides in this study the daily mean sm was represented by an hour by hour arithmetic average 2 2 4 other auxiliary data apart from the lst ndvi and albedo the digital elevation model dem and geolocation were also used in the regression model construction our study utilized the dem dataset from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model https earthdata nasa gov the geolocation defined by the longitude and latitude in this research was acquired from the corresponding pixel coordinates moreover mod44w was applied in the data preprocessing to filter out water bodies 3 methods 3 1 generating high spatial resolution soil moiture based on a downscaling approach the major steps of the approach for downscaling soil moisture data are shown as follows and the specific experimental process is shown in fig 2 1 first the collected explanatory variables were classified into dynamic variables and steady state variables as shown in fig 2 dynamic variables were composed of albedo ndvi lst d lst n and lst and steady state variables included dem longitude and latitude the daily changed dynamic data and steady state parameters were taken together to establish the sm regression model and they were smoothed by low pass filtering to remove the outliers in particular the savitzky golay sg algorithm was adopted to conduct the filtering process the sg method used least squares polynomial approximation sliding windows along the timeline to smooth sequential data and this method showed that fitting a polynomial to a set of input samples and then evaluating the resulting polynomial at a single point within the approximation interval was equivalent to discrete convolution with a fixed impulse response schafer 2011 being a favorable low pass filtering with both noise reduction and fidelity maintaining the sg algorithm has achieved good results in the field of remote sensing data processing bian et al 2010 chen and shu 2011 kim et al 2014 as a result this study used the sg method originated from scipy https scipy org which was a python based ecosystem of open source software for mathematics virtanen et al 2020 to achieve time series reconstruction of explanatory variable datasets 2 second explanatory variables were resampled to the same pixel resolution of the sm data to match the sm data on the spatial scale in order to assure the validity and presentation of training samples only when no less than half of the original explanatory variable pixels within one 0 25 pixel scope were valid can we carry out the resample process and the arithmetic means of the original pixels were calculated to indicate the value of the corresponding resampled 0 25 pixel further the scope spatial projection and geographical coordinates of all the training data were unified concurrently the mod44w product acted as a mask to filter out waterbody areas 3 third the preprocessed samples were imported into the ml algorithms to construct regression models on a 0 25 scale each ml algorithm established a prediction model based on its own principle as introduced in section 3 2 to simulate the samples 4 finally 1 km test data were introduced to established models to generate high resolution sm products the spatial scale conversion from 0 25 about 25 km to 1 km was conducted based on the accepted theory that models developed by explanatory variables over an appropriate range of scales are applicable to sm reproduction western et al 2002 besides numerous studies have succeeded in downscaling hydrological related elements with satisfying accuracy jing et al 2016c ke et al 2016 liu et al 2018a 3 2 machine learning algorithms ml algorithms have been broadly applied in satellite based sm regression and prediction studies valentine and kalnins 2016 park et al 2017 in this research six classical ml approaches were adopted to compare the applicability of the heterogeneity of each algorithm in sm downscaling over different continental regions besides fifty percent of the data was employed to the training process and the remaining fifty percent of the data was treated as test dataset the algorithms and the parameters used for training are briefily described as follows and details of the algorithms and their formulations are provided in the appdendix 1 ann ann is a flexible and efficient technique capable of building non linear models between the input and output samples hsu et al 1995 gardner et al 1998 a classical neural network backward propagation algorithm iterates to deal with the instances in the training set following the regression the differences between the predicted values and the real values are compared then the weight of each connection is updated by the reverse method from the output layer to the hidden layer and then to the input layer to minimize the error and optimize the regression results in this study the feed forward neural network ffnn regressor was employed to downscale sm with 1 hidden layer and 100 neurons the rectified linear unit function was taken as the activation function for the hidden layer the stochastic gradient based optimizer solver was used for weight optimization the value for numerical stability in solver was 1e 08 the initial learning rate was 0 001 the regularization term parameter alpha was 0 001 the batch size was the minimum between 200 and sample sizes the maximum number of iterations was 200 the samples were shuffled in each iteration and the tolerance for the optimization was 1e 4 2 baye the baye statistical model is mainly divided into two steps in the first step the likelihood function uses the training data following which the posterior distribution by combining the likelihood function with the prior distribution in the second step for a new test dataset the posterior weights obtained by the model are taken as the target weights and the weighted integrals are calculated in the entire parameter space to obtain the predicted data distribution fei fei and perona 2005 drummond and rambaut 2007 in the baye regression model of this study the iteration times were 300 3 cart cart is constructed by dividing the feature space into two parts to generate a binary tree breiman et al 1984 de ath and fabricius 2000 following the iterated division samples in same subgroup have maximal homogeneity whereas those in different subgroups have the maximal diversity the cut points are called nodes and the terminal nodes are called leaf nodes in general a cart is a binary regression tree algorithm the details of every utilized parameter in cart were shown as follows the minimum samples split was 2 the minimum samples leaf was 10 and the mean squared error was used to measure the quality of a split 4 knn knn classifies and regresses by measuring the distance between the different eigenvalues regardless of the distribution of the other distant samples if most of the k known samples that are closest to the unknown pending samples in the feature space belong to a certain category the pending samples also belong to that category keller et al 2012 noh et al 2017 it is a non parametric classifier and regressor altman 1992 the number of neighbors to use for k neighbors queries was 29 in particular the regression performance of three kernel functions ball tree k dimensional tree and brute were compared and the ball tree achieved the best performance 5 rf rf uses multiple decision trees to formulate an ensemble learning algorithm liaw and wiener 2002 vladimir svetnik et al 2003 chen and breiman 2004 it adopts a general sample extraction technology and repeatedly selects a group of samples for training randomly with replacement each subset has a cart and the final predicted value is the average value of all the subsets random subsets are extracted from the total training set with replacement the size of each subset is two thirds of the original sample set the cross validation method is adopted by the out of bag samples to evaluate the quality of the cart model established by each subset the parameters and their values used in the rf modeling process were displayed as follows the number of trees in the forest was 180 the minimum samples split was 2 the minimum samples leaf was 10 the maximum features was 9 the number of jobs to run in parallel was 1 the mean squared error was used to measure the quality of a split and the bootstrap samples were used when building trees 6 svm the basic principle of svm is to model one dimensional linear separable samples for linearly inseparable samples a low dimensional point set is gradually mapped to a non linear dimension until it is separable tong and chang 2001 the dimension raising of a non linear sample is achieved by using a linear hyperplane to segment the samples in the high dimensional space however this will significantly increase the computational complexity and time consumption keerthi et al 2014 to solve these problems high dimensional complex maps are frequently simplified using kernel functions to reduce the computational complexity to approximate the linear level specifically the radial basis function kernel was finally chosen to conduct the feature research after a performance comparison among the linear polynomial sigmoid and radial basis kernel functions 3 3 assessment approaches the correlation coefficient r goodness of fit r2 bias root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and unbiased root mean square deviation ubrmsd were used in this study the r is first devised by the statistician carl pearson and is an efficient indicator of the degree of linear correlation between variables taylor 1990 r2 indicates how well the regression line fits the observation this metric measures the overall fitting degree of the regression equation and is widely applied in multidisciplinary data statistics and analysis fagerland et al 1989 donner and eliasziw 1992 cheung and rensvold 2002 bias could depict the level of overestimation and underestimation of observations by model predictions in comparison the degree of dispersion of the predictions could be quantitatively reflected by both rmse and mae chai and draxler 2014 bias rmse and mae can be together used in this study to simultaneously describe the overestimation underestimation and magnitude of the error additionally ubrmsd is used to represent the difference of standard deviation between predictions and observations and is broadly utilized in sm accuracy evaluations kim et al 2017 stillman and zeng 2018 walker et al 2018 hence these metrics allows us to systematically and thoroughly explore the capability of different ml algorithms in sm downscaling over the case study areas and their equations are listed as follows 1 r i 1 n y i y x i x i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 2 r 2 i 1 n y i y x i x i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 3 b i a s i 1 n x

true sm value at station i averaged value of all the sm true values respectively 4 results 4 1 reconstruction comparison firstly regression models were established on the original ecv sm scale 0 25 grid resolution further the adopted approaches recontructed the sm on a 0 25 scale the reconstruction capacities of the six regression models were preliminarily evaluated across different regions the experiment first applied the regression model to reconstruct the ecv sm without a scale transition scatterplots and regression correlations of each ml technique applied in the four selected regions are shown in figs 3 6 regarding the reconstruction data of different areas the okm region best fitted the original ecv sm moreover the correlation coefficient was generally larger than 0 8 revealing the outstanding agreement with the spatiotemporal evolution trend of the ecv product meanwhile it achieved small rmse and mae values additionally the slope of the regression equation approached 1 and the intercept approached 0 indicating that the reconstructed values were extremely close to those of the original products and the over underestimation was not significant by contrast the fitting trends of the rem and nan were fairly good but there was a certain degree of overestimation in the ozn region the reconstructed sm slightly overestimated the original ecv products and the fitting coefficient was smaller than those of the other three regions this phenomenon dropping a hint that there could have to some extent pronounced gap between northern and southern hemisphere regressed sms different ml techniques generated heterogenous reconstruction results on the scale of 0 25 the fitting coefficients of the ann and cart reconstructed data against those of the original products were small accompanied by a remarkable deviation and overestimation generally the baye knn and svm simulated sm could effectively depict the value and change trend of the original ecv sm illustrating the stable suitability of these three algorithms the rf reconstructed data demonstrated prominent performance among all the algorithms the rf could not only regenerate the original ecv sm with superior precision but also accurately reproduce its temporal and spatial evolution trends 4 2 downscaled results figs 7 10 display the original ecv and downscaled fine resolution sm products of test dataset over four selected regions there was a large null value area in the original ecv due to the rfi dense vegetation and satellite ascending descending strip gap the null value area with the coarse resolution co limited its capacity in the overall coverage of land surface in comparison the 1 km high resolution sm not only enhanced the detail expressing ability but also realized spatial full coverage based on the downscaling results of all the algorithms in fig 7 the ann retrieved sm values deviated significantly from the original ecv sm data particularly in 2011 the downscaled value range even deviated from the main interval of 0 05 0 35 m3 m3 showing a large empty area in addition in the okm region overestimation of the western side was prevalent in all the downscaled sm conversely the ann precisely reproduced the spatial value distribution in the nan region as presented in fig 9 suggesting the applicability difference of a particular regression approach in different regions in the rem region the northern wet area was mainly covered with indigenous forest whereas the southern dry region was occupied by cropland the knn can overall efficiently differentiate the dry and wet region in fig 8 in the ozn region fig 10 both the knn and rf could accurately simulate the spatial differentiation characteristics of the original ecv sm overall the applicability of the same algorithm model varies between different regions concurrently underestimation in wet regions and overestimation in dry regions are common in all the algorithms despite the fluctuating underlying surface properties the rf maintains a robust performance in the four regions 4 3 in situ measurements based validation 4 3 1 quantitative evaluation in this study ground observations were employed as references to systematically evaluate the downscaling performance the bias r rmse and ubrmsd were selected to perform the quantitative analysis from multiple aspects via boxplots the boxplots are nonparametric visualization tools that could help the user discover the characteristic features of the data mirzargar et al 2014 the horizontal solid lines from top to bottom represent the maximum upper quartile median lower quartile and minimum values respectively in addition the horizontal dashed lines indicate the mean values and dots indicate potential outliers in the okm region the downscaled sm generally underestimated the measured data by varying degrees fig 11 the knn exhibited its unique superiority for the value accuracy because it only considered the nearest k members as the basis of the regression however it was difficult for this simple algorithm to ensure a high fitting degree while targeting accuracy contrastingly the downscaled data in rem region revealed overall overestimation fig 12 the knn algorithm continued its consistent advantage of high data accuracy bias 0 076 m3m 3 the largest deviation occurred in the ann downscaled sm bias 0 091 m3m 3 the deviation r rmse and ubrmsd of the downscaled sm in the nan regions in fig 13 were higher than those in the okm and lower than those in the rem region this phenomenon seemed to suggest that it could be difficult to be satisfactory in terms of both the absolute error and goodness of fit besides the 1 km resolution data located in the southern hemisphere yielded the minimum absolute error fig 14 apart from box plots scatter line charts were drawn to visually present the sm value distribution variation between the in situ measurements and ml techniques regressed results figs 15 18 basically the sm temporal change was in accordance with the local seasonal climate elements i e precipitation and temperature variation for example the north atlantic drift resulted sufficient precipitation and low temperature in winter co contributed to a high level sm in the rem region in fig 16 moreover the sm of the nan region from november to next february was not considered as the period with far below zero temperature and frozen soil water the downscaled sm was underestimated in the okm region overestimated in the rem and nan region and unstable under overestimated in the ozn indicating complex non linear applicability difference in different regions it can be inferred from the first sub figures of figs 15 18 that there exist numerous abnormal values in the ann simulated sm moreover the cart retrieved sm typically possesses an unsatisfactory fitting degree to in situ measurements in comparison the other four algorithms perform well basically therefore the subsequent assessment is mainly focused on the baye knn rf and svm 4 3 2 temporal series accuracy analysis the preceding sections have validated the relative outperformances of the baye knn rf and svm techniques in coarse sm downscaling particularly the robustness of the rf we conducted temporal based accuracy analysis to further explore the precision fluctuation characteristics of the downscaled sm due to seasonal rhythm changes tables 5 8 list the monthly downscaled sm temporal series accuracy in the four case study areas it seemed that the low fitting degree season of each region was not always the same in particular the main landcover type in the okm rem and ozn regions was cropland specifically artificial irrigation which occasionally occurred can remarkably induce an abrupt change in the surface sm an in situ measurement can precisely record the sm variation hourly however sensors on board an instantaneous transit satellite may miss the brief surge in the sm caused by irrigation owing to their individual climate features rainfall was scarce in the okm winter and rem summer the scarce precipitation and artificial irrigation may explain the reason why r is low in the period overall between the four presentable algorithms rf could still behave excellently with a fairly small bias and favorable r besides it was noticed that even though the rf models performed better in comparison to other models the r values could be relatively low or negative in some cases for instance as shown in tables 5 and 7 the correlation coefficients were weak in winter january february and december of okm and in spring and autumn march april may june and october of nan the water inside soil became ice water mixtures when the temperature falls to approximately zero degrees celsius the dielectric constant of the water 91 0 is nearly 30 times that of ice crystals 3 1 in theory tang et al 2019 therefore it can be hard for satellite sensors to accurately retrieve sm with ice water mixtures since the top layer soil temperature would inevitably fall to around zero in winter okm and in nan with average altitude of 4000 5000 m the sm retrieval uncertainty increased accordingly meanwhile previous researches have achieved similar assessment results about remotely sensed sm products in cold regions zeng et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 ma et al 2019 as a result it is preliminarily deduced that the uncertainty of ecv sm could have an enormous effect on the quality of the downscaled sm and it is suggested that maybe after the supplement of in situ measurements in the training dataset the accuracy of model simulated sm would be improved 4 3 3 error analysis given the significant difference in the downscaled sm derived from the ml approaches over inter continent regions scatterplots were drawn fig 19 between the bias and the sm and explanatory variables moreover the scatterplots and regression lines were drawn by using microsoft excel the comparisons were conducted among exponential linear logarithmic and polynomial functions and we selected the one with superior r2 to formulate the corresponding regression lines however the r2 could be hardly ideal even though we chose the relative proper functions after comparisons for example the ndvi and dem in rem region this phenomenon suggested that the sm bias could be in weak correlation to ndvi and dem in rem region it was found that the bias exhibited a negative correlation to the sm except for the ozn region overestimation occurred when the sm was below 0 22 m3m 3 and it became underestimation when the sm exceeded 0 22 m3m 3 the ozn region typically exhibited overestimation in the u shaped curve the ndvi and lst presented weak correlations to the bias apart from the nan region it was suggested that the ground sm may be humid in case of abundant vegetation cover and a relatively high lst in the tibet plateau the deviation caused by the geo location differences longitude latitude and dem between the observation stations was not significant we speculated that the non significant correlation may be attributed to the centralized distribution of each in situ station in the case study regions 4 4 feature importance assessment the importance percentage of each explanatory feature was calculated and presented in fig 20 it was found that dem predominates sm retrieval particularly over the okm rem and nan regions concurrently all the three regions exhibited a large elevation variation 1000 m suggesting that there may exist a coupling relationship between dem and the sm over regions with sharp elevation fluctuations a previous study stated the usefulness of dem in sm spatial modeling zhu et al 2009 moreover it appeared that the local topography may be more important in determining the sm condition than the classic soil wetness index murphy et al 2009 in particular when the topography can control a significant amount of the soil water movement the terrain could act as a reliable base data for the sm estimation however a relatively flat field topography can not be the only contributor to the soil water movements schmidt and persson 2003 in addition lst d had the second contribution rate indicating the strong relationship between the daytime lst and the sm actually compared to the lst n the lst always fluctuated volatilely fig 20 in general both the modis lst d and lst n were utilized in the sm to reflect the temperature change of an entire day they achieved high accuracy to the ground temperature sensor records wan et al 2004 wang et al 2007 moreover the ndvi was also a critical element in the sm downscaling previous studies have demonstrated a two way interaction between the vegetation condition and the sm farrar et al 1994a han et al 2010 chen et al 2014a furthermore much of the research in satellite based sm retrieval co combined the lst and ndvi to estimate the subsurface sm huang et al 2008 song et al 2013 holzman et al 2014 park et al 2014 basically the fii reveals that the dem daytime lst and ndvi are dominant during reconstruction particularly for dem in a study region with a large height difference the specific fii of each independent variable varies across the case study areas probably caused by the complex hydrothermal as well as physical geography conditions 5 discussions ai based ml approaches have been adopted to solve regression and prediction problems in the geoscience field since their inception numerous studies have focused on applying ml techniques to acquire downscaled sm with one case study area abbaszadeh et al 2019 lee et al 2019 our comparative research evaluated the performances of various ml techniques in sm downscaling in addition four case study areas which had quite different underlying surfaces and hydrothermal combination conditions were selected for the comparisons the validation results demonstrated that the rf achieved superior performance with high regression precision and robustness in the different areas concurrently the advantage of rf in simulating sm has been accepted by numerous scholars liu et al 2017 implemented the cart knn baye and rf methods to downscale the monthly ecv sm over northeast china liu et al 2017b the rf downscaled results had a superior matching performance to both the ecv sm and in situ measurements chen et al 2017 evaluated the logistic model tree rf and cart for the spatial prediction of landslide susceptibility the rf model exhibited the highest predictive capability chen et al 2017 rodriguez galiano et al 2012 explored the performance of the rf classifier for land cover classification of a complex area the results exhibited that the rf algorithm yielded accurate land cover classifications compared to a single decision tree rodriguez galiano et al 2012 the study regions were selected based on stable in situ measurements and extensive previous related research on sm brock et al 1995 sanchez et al 2012b mei et al 2017 1 km resolution sm in the rem region was most closely correlated to in situ measurements however its bias needed to be further reduced by comparison the smallest bias and the second highest correlation occurred in the ozn region it was primarily deduced that regions that located in one single climate zone and had mild topography variation and medium vegetation coverage tended to produce high accuracy results in addition the fii of each parameter varied with the region in general the dem daytime lst and ndvi constituted the major part in constructing the sm regression model specifically dem was suggested to be a critical element in areas with large elevation variation the strong bilateral interaction and correlation between the ndvi and sm has been testified by previous studies farrar et al 1994b schnur et al 2010 chen et al 2014b the daytime lst was more important than the nighttime lst and the lst daily fluctuation the ndvi lst and albedo data have been proved to have profound interactions to sm and been broadly used in sm downscaling and reconstruction with good performance jing et al 2018 bai et al 2019 wei et al 2019 moreover it was noticed that apart from the above mentioned lst the stand deviation of lst describing the distance that each lst data deviates from the average value was also closely linked to sm variation according to previous researches giraldo et al 2009 anton et al 2019b avram et al 2019 meanwhile the stand deviation of ndvi and albedo could also reflect the spatial and temporal fluctuation of sm carlson et al 1990 guan et al 2009 as a result we thought that it could be a promising attempt to combine the stand deviation of dynamic variables i e lst ndvi and albedo to estimate sm especially to simulate the variation characteristics of sm this study confirmed the competence of various ml techniques in predicting fine resolution sm over different continental regions the validation results proved the superiority of the rf which could accurately simulate sm at a 1 km scale however it seemed difficult for the regressed sm to transcend the original ecv sm in data precision the main reason was that the original ecv sm was employed as a training sample to establish the regression model specifically the quality of the original satellite based sm as the bottleneck factor of precision restriction became increasingly prominent hence sufficient in situ measurement based satellite sm data correction would be necessary in future studies the study of remote sensing sm downscaling has got long term and sustained attention given the importance of sm information in water cycle studies drought and flood monitoring and crop growth analysis peng et al 2017 meanwhile the scale effect could be a critical point because the patterns and processes of geographical phenomena have an implicit scale of variation ge et al 2019 previous study by ghanbarian et al 2015 showed that the regression based models would be improved if the effect of scale is incorporated in model development ghanbarian et al 2015 jing et al 2018 downscaled the spatial resolution ecv from 0 25 to 0 05 by using rf method and the validation was done in the united states and australia validation results indicated that the reconstructed soil moisture showed comparable good performance average r2 0 66 as the original ecv products average r2 0 65 and nicely reflected the temporal behavior of in situ measurements jing et al 2018 in comparison although the rf model successfully downscaled the ecv sm to 1 km scale with good performance it is suggested that the downscaling accuracy may get improved if the scale effect could be taken into consideration to realize smooth scale transition future experiments would focus on downscaling sm firstly from 0 25 to 0 05 and then from 0 05 to 1 km scale and accuracy evaluation derived comparison would be made between gradually downscaled sm and directly downscaled sm 6 conclusions in recent years tremendous efforts have been made to acquire high precision and resolution sm products across the world further ml techniques have revealed unique characteristics compared to statistical and physical models in scaling conversion ge et al 2019 this study systematically compared the performances of ml techniques in sm downscaling over four continental case study areas the applicability of algorithms regional heterogeneities and variables importance were considered during the evaluation process the rf outperformed all the other algorithms in terms of both the value accuracy and tendency variation the baye and knn also demonstrated preferable capability in sm downscaling however the robustness of these algorithms needed further improvement in terms of the regional factors the preliminary conclusion was that an underlying surface with a relatively stable hydrothermal combination moderate elevation change and medium vegetation coverage would tend to yield accurate downscaled sm in addition although apparently the fii of each parameter varied significantly across the different regions the dem daytime lst and ndvi were the major contributors to establishing the sm regression models the results of this study highlighted the outperformance of the rf model compared to the other considered models and the variations in the importance of the variables for the downscaling model over different underlying surfaces this study attempted to explore the capacity and suitability of ml techniques for ecv sm downscaling over diverse regions moreover it clarified the contribution rate of each explanatory variable the results are expected to act as references for subsequent studies focusing on applying appropriate algorithms and parameters to scale the conversion of sm or other earth science parameters in addition the future work would be concentrated on breaking the limitation of the quality of original satellite based sm to continuously improve the accuracy of downscaled sm

circulation times 2 baye model π θ x f x θ π θ 0 θ f x θ π θ d θ where π is the probabilistic distribution π θ is prior probability π x θ is posterior probability f x θ is the observed sample distribution 0 θ is all possible range of θ so the posterior probability π x θ is the probability density distribution of θ in the 0 θ domain on the premise of given x each θ has a corresponding probability after 300 times iteration the probabilistic model is used to estimate test dataset 3 cart model cart is constructed from learning samples of n size by recursive process the algorithm divides the t node into two sub trees tl andtr according to the optimal variable st and corresponding optimal value s at node t so that the samples in the same sub tree have the greatest similarity and the samples in different sub trees have the greatest difference δ i s t i t p l i t l p r i t r p l n t l n t p r n t r n t where n t l and n t r are the number of samples of two sub nodes tl and tr respectively i t is the measurement function of model accuracy i t 1 n t i 1 n t y i y where nt is the number of samples contained in node t yi is the input value of sample i in node t y is the arithmetic average value of y set calculated by formula 1 n t i 1 n t y i the predicted output value based on the new input sample is the value of the corresponding leaf node where the y sample propagates in the tree in this study the minimum samples split is 2 the minimum samples leaf is 10 and the mean squared error is used to measure the quality of a split 4 knn model 1 calculate the distance between test data and training data 2 sort according to the incremental relation of distance 3 select k points with the smallest distance in this study k 29 distance measurement method can be flexible in terms of different sample characteristics and application requirements the euclidean distance between samples s 1 x 1 y 1 and s 2 x 2 y 2 is defined as e u c l i d e a n d i s t a n c e d x 2 x 1 2 y 2 y 1 2 in order to efficiently query the nearest neighbors the ball tree kernel function is used to split samples via series of hyper spheres 4 the average value of k samples in the feature space is the predicted value of the test sample 5 rf model rf uses multiple decision trees to formulate an ensemble learning algorithm random subsets are extracted from the total training set with replacement the size of each subset is 2 3 of the original sample set the cross validation method is adopted by using out of bag samples to evaluate the quality of the cart model established by each subset thus regression can be done by averaging the predictions of all individual regression trees f 1 n t r e e i 1 n t r e e f i x where ntree is the number of regression tree ntree is 180 in this study fi x is the predicted value of each regression tree 6 svm model the low dimensional sample set is gradually mapped to non linear dimension until it is separable the dimension raising of non linear sample is done by means of using linear hyperplane to segment samples in high dimensional space hyperplane is defined as w t x b 0 w w 1 w 2 w 3 w n where wt is the transposed weight vector nis the number of eigenvalues x the training example andb the intercept to decrease the computational complexity and time consumption high dimensional complex maps are often simplified by using kernel functions to reduce the computational complexity to approximate linear level in this study the radial basis function kernel was finally chosen to conduct the feature research the specific regression

appelstraße 9a 30167 hannover germany corresponding author microbially induced calcite precipitation micp provides the potential for developing innovative and environmentally friendly techniques to improve the engineering properties of soil through reduction of permeability in soil and increase of soil stiffness and strength in the present research work coupled bio chemo hydraulic modelling was developed to enhance the understanding of the coupled processes involved in micp and to predict the micp performance in permeability reduction in the model an overall kinetically controlled model is adopted to describe the biochemical reactions where the reaction rate is dependent on the concentration of both bacteria and chemical reactants specifically an effective porosity concept was proposed and implemented in the model to capture the effects of pore throat blockage on permeability reduction caused by precipitated calcite correspondingly the kozeny carman equation was modified to describe the permeability variation during micp this model has been applied to simulate two laboratory experiments the observed changes in chemical components and hydraulic conductivity can be well reproduced in the model through comparisons of the effective porosity concept to other commonly used porosity permeability relationships it is estimated that effective porosity should be considered to simulate the permeability reduction observed in micp furthermore a sensitivity analysis of the reaction related parameters was conducted the results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the maximum urease

applications according to many experimental observations the bacterial promoted precipitation of calcium carbonate can remarkably reduce the permeability and improve the stiffness strength and compressibility of soil with these features micp enables the development of innovative solution strategies for a wide range of problems in geo environmental engineering e g immobilization of groundwater contamination erosion protection environmental remediation concrete repair and land slope stabilization whiffin et al 2007 currently most micp treatments can only be demonstrated in the laboratory or in field tests major application related challenges are found in controlling monitoring and predicting micp performance dejong et al 2013 during the past decades many experimental investigations on micp have been performed and have been utilized to gain a substantial understanding of the involved coupled processes stocks fischer et al 1999 al qabany et al 2012 most experimental studies focus on the analysis of the precipitated calcite structure stocks fischer et al 1999 the change in hydraulic and mechanical properties of the treated sand chou et al 2011 tan et al 2017

concentration the concentration of ammonium and urea oxygen availability mortensen et al 2011 and different experimental conditions martinez et al 2011 al qabany et al 2012 on the reaction rate and on the performance of micp treatment however some relevant issues e g predictions of the long term behaviour of micp treated soil sensitivity and scenario analysis of micp performance under different conditions are usually difficult to realize in experiments therefore reliable numerical models are required generally micp in the soil can be described as mechanisms caused by transport and metabolic related biological activities in porous media and these mechanisms further cause a series of coupled phenomena in biological chemical hydraulic and mechanical fields recent mathematical and modelling work considering multispecies reactions transport flow and deformation processes in porous media diersch 1989 ehlers 1989 bear and bachmat 2012 helmig 1997 lewis and schrefler 1998 provides an essential tool to develop the micp numerical model the modelling work concerning the transport growth decay and degradation of microorganisms in porous media as well as the biologically induced reactions and blockage processes clement et al 1997 kildsgaard and engesgaard 2001 schijven et al 2002 prommer and barry 2005 olson et al 2006 islam et al 2001 brovelli et al 2009 serves as the basis to complement and optimize the micp model barkouki et al 2011 and martinez et al 2014 proposed a model that considers a comprehensive hydro geochemical reaction framework including complex ureolysis calcite precipitation and dissolution the chemical reactions in the model are controlled in a mixed manner the aqueous complex reactions are governed by the equilibrium of the chemical system following the mass action law the ureolysis and calcite precipitation are kinetically controlled the geochemical reaction model is coupled with a one dimensional flow model to capture the spatial distribution of aqueous chemical components the transport of bacteria and the biologically induced porosity and permeability variation are not considered ebigbo et al 2012 developed a two phase model considering the transport of aqueous and gaseous components the most relevant biogeochemical processes i e kinetic controlled ureolysis calcite precipitation and dissolution biomass and biofilm growth and decay are also included later hommel et al 2015 revised the model of ebigbo et al 2012 by modifying and calibrating the expression for the ureolysis rate cuthbert et al 2013 presented a model to simulate the reduction of fractured rock permeability using micp in which a simplified kinetic reaction model is included and the relationship between the increased calcite volume and the corresponding decrease in fracture width has been analysed in those mathematical and numerical works the overall reaction approach proposed by van paassen 2009 is noteworthy in this reaction approach an overall kinetic rate that controls all the chemical reactions in micp was introduced through comparisons with the experimental findings the overall reaction approach delivered an accuracy as good as the more complex biochemical approach concerning the temporal evolution in concentration of the chemical substances based on this approach van wijngaarden et al 2011 developed an overall biogrout model in which bacteria is assumed to be immobile and homogeneously distributed and the variations in porosity as well as permeability caused by calcite precipitation are considered fauriel and laloui 2012 further developed the overall biogrout model by considering a deformable solid grain and the change in mechanical properties caused by micp more recently a field scale model cunningham et al 2018 was developed to predict the micp performance in sealing fractures in underground in most of the aforementioned macroscopic continuum models complete mixing of the aqueous biochemical components is assumed thus the influences of the local incomplete mixing of reactants at the pore throat cannot be considered to consider such local heterogeneity pore scale simulations are usually required recently pore scale models nogues et al 2013 qin et al 2016 zhang and klapper 2014 for micp can be found in the literature because of the high computational cost the pore scale model might have limitations when applied in simulations with relatively large sizes compared to pore scale models macroscopic models based on homogenization techniques have certain advantages especially in large scale micp applications through modelling work e g barkouki et al 2011 martinez et al 2014 ebigbo et al 2012 hommel et al 2015 the biochemical processes and reaction kinetics have been better understood in recent years however the coupled mechanisms involved in micp remain as issues in some studies e g van wijngaarden et al 2011 fauriel and laloui 2012 which focus on the coupling effects between biochemical and hydraulic fields the biochemical reactions are usually simplified under the assumption of an overall reaction rate that is related to a specific maximum urease constant in the literature the values of the maximum urease constant are found over a wide range as an important factor to evaluate the micp performance the variations in porosity and permeability were considered in some modelling works in van wijngaarden et al 2011 2013 2016 and fauriel and laloui 2012 the classical kozeny carman kc equation is adopted to describe the porosity permeability relationship further the porosity permeability relationship in ebigbo et al 2012 and hommel et al 2015 is described by the verma pruess relationship in which a critical porosity is introduced based on the current sutdies further investigations on the feasibility of using the classical kc equation and other porosity permeability relationships to predict the permeability reduction during micp are required related modelling work should be calibrated and validated against the corresponding experiments the present study aims to obtain a better insight of the coupled mechanisms in micp especially the biochemically induced change in porosity and permeability using numerical modelling the numerical work has been based on a coupled bio chemo hydraulic model in which the biogeochemical processes are described by the overall kinetically controlled reaction model according to the approach proposed in van paassen 2009 further the other major mechanisms in micp i e multispecies and multicomponent transport the interactions between the biochemical and hydraulic fields have been addressed in the model for a better prediction of the permeability evolution the commonly used kc equation is modified with an effective porosity concept this numerical model has been calibrated and validated against two laboratory experiments the sensitivity of the maxium urease rate was analysed furthermore the modelling results using the effective porosity approach have been compared to the results using the original kc equation and two other commonly used porosity permeability relations finally the possible modifications of the model to capture the micp behaviour under further treatment conditions were discussed 2 physical processes 2 1 microbially induced calcite precipitation in porous media in practice the bacterium sporosarcina pasteurii is often used for micp treatment to use urea nh 2 2 co as an energy source stocks fischer et al 1999 for the metabolic process s pasteurii produces a large amount of urease that catalyses the hydrolysis of urea into ammonium n h 4 the solution of ammonium in the aqueous phase causes an increase in the ph value that leads to the dramatic increase in the concentration of the dissolved carbonate ions c o 3 2 in the solution 1 c o n h 2 2 2 h 2 o u r e a s e 2 n h 4 c o 3 2 following the hydrolysis of urea eq 1 if calcium c a 2 is present in the system then calcite caco 3 can precipitate 2 c o 3 2 c a 2 c a c o 3 the urea hydrolysis eq 1 is a homogeneous reaction that occurs only in the aqueous phase causing mass transfer among the components in the liquid phase the calcite precipitation eq 2 corresponds to a heterogeneous reaction that leads to a mass decrease in the liquid phase and a mass increase in the solid phase combining eq 1 and eq 2 the overall micp reaction can be derived 3 c o n h 2 2 2 h 2 o c a 2 u r e a s e 2 n h 4 c a c o 3 2 2 coupled processes to obtain insight of the mechanisms using micp for permeability reduction an understanding of the coupled processes among the biological b chemical c and hydraulic h fields fig 1 is required first the bacterial behaviour e g growth decay and de attachment leads to the temporal and spatial variation in bacterial concentrations in the system that can affect the rate of chemical reactions the consumption of reactants and diffusion during the chemical processes can affect the bacterial behaviour the experimental observations indicate that following bacterial catalysed chemical reactions upon precipitation calcite can attach to the solid matrix simultaneously and fill in the pore space causing a reduction of porosity and permeability depending on the injection strategy the variations in porosity and permeability may affect the advection or pressure distribution during the hydraulic process in an advection dominated flow system the variation in advective flow can significantly change the spatial distribution of the bacteria and the aqueous chemical components in summary the main mechanisms that need to be considered are summarized as follows 1 major biological mechanisms transport growth decay and de attachment 2 transport of aqueous chemical components governed by dispersion diffusion and advection 3 mass transfer and decrease in the liquid phase caused by chemical reactions 4 mass increase in the solid phase due to calcite precipitation and the corresponding reduction in porosity and permeability 5 the dependence of the reaction rate on the current distribution of different biochemical components 6 the variation in the advective flow due to the porosity and permeability reduction 3 model development the development of the model is based on a macroscopic continuum in the representative element volume rev both the solid phase and aqueous phase are considered in the aqueous phase multicomponents are considered it is assumed that the porous medium is fully saturated calcium carbonate is assumed to be present only in the solid phase the other chemical components urea calcium and ammonium are assumed to exist only in the aqueous phase part of the bacterial mass is expected to attach to the solid grain while the remainder of the mass remains suspended in the aqueous solution according to the aforementioned definition and assumptions the system is then composed of a solid phase denoted by subscript s and a liquid phase denoted by l in the solid phase solid grains attached bacteria and calcium carbonate are considered the liquid phase contains five components pore water calcium urea ammonium and suspended bacteria 3 1 mass balance equation of the liquid phase the macroscopic mass balance is applied to derive the mathematical model since the liquid phase contains five components the general expression of the mass balance equation for the liquid phase is given by 4 ϕ ρ l t ϕ ρ l v ω u r e a ω c a 2 ω n h 4 q w where ϕ is the porosity v is the vector of liquid velocity ω i is the production consumption rate of each aqueous chemical mass qw is the source sink term of the pore water mass and ρl is the liquid density in van wijngaarden et al 2011 according to the experiments a

water density and is equal to 1000 kg m 3 ci is the concentration of urea calcium and ammonium in the aqueous solution the spatial and temporal distribution of each aqueous component in the homogeneous and saturated porous media is governed by advection diffusion mechanical dispersion chemical reaction biological decay and usually also by adsorption the model concentrates on the transport of aqueous reactants and products of micp reactions in the sand column where the adsorption effect of the chemical components is not significant van wijngaarden et al 2011 therefore in the transport equations the retardation phenomenon of the chemical components urea calcium and ammonium caused by adsorption is neglected the advective transport of all components in the liquid phase is assumed to be governed by the same overall liquid flow velocity according to the mass balance equation of each species the transport equations for urea calcium ammonium and suspended bacteria can be expressed as 6 ϕ c i t ϕ d c i q c i q i where ci is the concentration of aqueous components i i urea c a 2 nh 4 and bacteria and qi is the reaction related sink source term q ϕ v is the vector of darcy velocity d is the diffusion dispersion matrix which is composed of diffusion df and mechanical dispersion dp parts by definition of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient αl and the transversal dispersion coefficient αt the dispersion matrix is expressed by 7 d p α l α t v v v α t v i 3 2 biochemical reactions 3 2 1 overall kinetically controlled reaction model similar to the work done by fauriel and laloui 2012 and van wijngaarden et al 2011 an overall kinetically controlled reaction model is adopted to describe urea hydrolysis and calcite precipitation in micp in this model the chemical reactions are assumed to be first order irreversible reactions and controlled by an overall kinetic rate krea the overall kinetic rate is defined by adjusting the michaelis menten kinetics which is typically used for enzyme catalysed reactions 8 k r e a u c u r e a k m c u r e a e x p t t d where km is the half saturation constant at which the reaction rate is reduced by 50 curea is the concentration of urea related research performed by van paassen 2009 fauriel and laloui 2012 and van wijngaarden et al 2011 suggested that the reaction rate could decrease throughout the treatment since several processes during biochemical reactions are likely to reduce the reaction activity of the microorganisms on the one hand oxygen and nutrientsare continuously consumed in the system without further supply the reactions would be restrained due to insufficient oxygen or nutrients on the other hand the bacteria can be encapsulated by the precipitated calcite which hinders not only the contact of urea with bacteria but also transmission of the nutrients between bacteria and solution to consider the possible reduction in the reaction activity over time the time constant td is introduced eq 8 in eq 8 u is the coefficient for the maximum ureolytic activity of bacteria which is further determined by the current bacterial concentration 9 u u s p c b a c t where usp is the maximum urease constant cbact is the total bacterial concentration that is composed of the immobile bacterial concentration that attach to the solid grains cbacs and the suspended bacterial concentration in the pore fluid cbacl 3 2 2 bacterial behaviour in this model bacterial decay and attachment are considered in most micp applications before injection bacteria are first accumulated in the laboratory to obtain a desired concentration and activity after that bacterial decay dominates de muynck et al 2010 therefore in the model bacterial growth is neglected it is also postulated that the bacterial decay is linear with a constant decay rate kd and that the decay rate for the attached and suspended biomass is identical therefore the temporal variation in the total bacterial concentration is given by 10 c b a c t t k d c b a c t bacterial attachment is assumed to be dependent on the currently suspended bacterial concentration in the system similar to most previous studies on micp bacterial attachment is simplified by a first order kinetic model with constant attachment rate katt 11 c b a c s t k a t t c b a c l k d c b a c l accordingly the decrease in suspended bacterial concentration is calculated as 12 c b a c l t k a t t c b a c l k d c b a c s 3 3 field equations darcy s law is applied to describe the advection term in the flow equation eq 4 13 q k μ l p l ρ l g where k is the intrinsic permeability μl is the liquid viscosity g is the gravity acceleration vector and pl is the liquid pressure choosing liquid pressure as the primary variable for the flow equation and according to the chain rule the left hand side of eq 4 can be rewritten as 14 ϕ ρ l t ϕ ρ l p l p l t ρ l ϕ p l p l t ρ l p l t ϕ β l ϕ p l the liquid phase is considered to be low compressible and described by a constant compressibility β l 1 ρ l ρ l p l since the solid phase is assumed to be rigid the porosity is independent of the liquid pressure then the right hand term of eq 14 becomes 15 ϕ ρ l t β l ρ l ϕ p l t substituting the chemical stoichiometry and the overall chemical reaction rate the net production consumption terms in eq 4 can then be expressed as 16 ω u r e a m u r e a ϕ k r e a 17 ω c a 2 m c a 2 ϕ k r e a 18 ω n h 4 2 m n h 4 ϕ k r e a in addition in the context of the overall kinetic rate the production rate of calcite mass can also be calculated 19 ω

final partial differential equations pdes to be solved in the model are composed of eqs 20 21 22 23 and 24 3 4 porosity and permeability variations according to the experimental observations the major contribution to the decrease of porosity and permeability is due to the filling of the precipitated calcite in the pore space therefore similar to several previous studies e g van wijngaarden et al 2011 van wijngaarden et al 2013 van wijngaarden et al 2016 fauriel and laloui 2012 cuthbert et al 2013 the decreased total pore volume is assumed to be equal to the produced calcite volume then the total variation in porosity is given by 25 δ ϕ t o t δ v p o r e v t o t a l δ v c a c o 3 v t o t a l m c a c o 3 ϕ t o t δ c c a c o 3 ρ c a c o 3 where ρ caco3 is the density of calcite and c caco3 is the amount of produced calcite in mol with respect to the unit volume of liquid according to eq 19 by assuming a small time interval the decrease rate of the total porosity can be obtained by 26 ϕ t o t t 1 ρ c a c o 3 m c a c o 3 ϕ t o t c c a c o 3 t 1 ρ c a c o 3 m c a c o 3 ϕ t o t k r e a upon the derived variation in porosity the permeability reduction could be obtained by utilization of a proper model for the description of the porosity permeability constitutive relations many different models regarding porosity permeability relations have been developed and applied to simulate different geochemical and geomechanical processes that can alter the pore space of porous media hommel et al 2018 among these models and due to its simple implementation the kozeny carman kc equation which was established based on experimental findings has been widely used to describe the porosity and permeability changes caused by mineral precipitation dissolution and biomass accumulation for instance in several current micp models van wijngaarden et al 2011 2013 2016 fauriel and laloui 2012 the unmodified kc equation is adopted however calcite precipitation could cause the closing of pore throats especially by small pore spaces and narrow pore throats as a consequence isolated non permeable areas could be formed fig 2 a although not all pore volumes in those areas are fully filled with calcium carbonate this phenomenon has already been observed in experiments through results from scanning electron microscopy sem and optical microscopy wang et al 2018 qabany and k soga 2013 wang et al 2017 terzis and laloui 2018 cuthbert et al 2012 since those isolated areas can no longer contribute to the flow path the pore space in such isolated areas should be removed by the calculation of a new permeability after calcite precipitation furthermore the behaviour of the permeability reduction during micp could be significantly different in different soil types with different pore properties caused by e g different grain sizes specific surface and roughness of the grain surface however in the unmodified kc equation to obtain the current permeability only the calculation of the initial and current porosity is required 27 k i f ϕ 0 ϕ i k 0 ϕ i 3 1 ϕ i 2 1 ϕ 0 2 ϕ 0 3 where the influence of further pore altering during micp e g closing the pore throats on permeability reduction cannot be captured to capture the different possible features of the abovementioned permeability reductions during micp the effective porosity concept is adopted in the numerical model effective porosity is defined as part of the total porosity and represents the volume fraction of pore space that is still interconnected after calcite precipitation according to the approach proposed in koponen et al 1997 the effective porosity is given by 28 ϕ e f f a x 3 2 a ϕ c x 2 a 1 ϕ c x 29 x ϕ t o t ϕ c 1 ϕ c where ϕtot is the total porosity a is a constant and ϕc is the critical porosity below which the permeability is equal to zero usually the values of a and ϕc vary depending on the characterization of the pore space they can be determined by fitting the measured porosity permeability relationships eq 28 has the form of the most general polynomial with a third order in which the natural constraints of porosity are fulfilled to be specific ϕ e f f 1 at ϕ t o t 1 ϕ e f f 0 at ϕ t o t ϕ c and for all ϕtot 1 ϕeff ϕtot an example of the relationship between the effective and total porosity is illustrated in fig 2 b it can be seen from this figure that a reasonable dependence of effective porosity on total porosity can be obtained using eqs 28 and 29 specifically by a relatively high total porosity the material reveals good permeable property the effective porosity could be identical to the total porosity e g dashed line in fig 2 b when the total porosity is higher than 0 8 however with the decrease in the total porosity more pore spaces tend to be isolated as a consequence the difference between effective and total porosity becomes large in the context of effective porosity the kc equation is modified in which the calculation of permeability variation is based on the change in the effective porosity instead of the change in the total porosity 30 k k x k y k z d m 2 180 ϕ e f f 3 1 ϕ e f f 2 where dm is the mean particle size of the subsurface medium since the initial porosity and permeability are usually known the current permeability at time step i can be calculated from the initial effective porosity permeability and the current effective porosity 31 k i k 0 ϕ e f f i 3 1 ϕ e f f i 2 1 ϕ e f f 0 2 ϕ e f f 0 3 where k 0 and ϕeff 0 are the initial permeability and initial effective porosity respectively 3 5 numerical solution strategy in this model three processes are solved i e flow transport h mass transport c and biochemical reactions b regarding the aqueous phase pl curea c c a 2 c n h 4 and cbacl are chosen as primary variables the pdes are solved using the finite element method fem based on the code opengeosys ogs kolditz et al 2012 in the ogs code there are preexisting modules pertaining to the multispecies transport and saturated and partially saturated flow the overall kinetically controlled reaction model has been coupled with the multispecies transport module in ogs the effective porosity concept as well as the porosity permeability relationship have been implemented in the ogs code in the numerical treatment two way couplings between the flow multispecies transport and biochemical processes are considered the coupled problem between the hydraulic field h and biochemical field bc is solved using a staggered scheme in which the hydraulic process and reactive mass transport are solved separately however the biochemical reactions b are solved with the mass transport c process together the major coupling effects are incorporated into the system as the dependency of the parameters and primary variables involved in different processes the coupling concept is illustrated in fig 3 iterations have been made between the liquid flow and reactive mass transport processes in every time step in the first iteration the liquid density the total as well as effective porosity and permeability are updated with the corresponding results calculated from the previous time step under the assumption that the permeability as well as the porosity are constant within a small time step the liquid flow eq 20 is solved to obtain the advective velocity as the input information for the multispecies transport equations eqs 21 22 23 and 24 the biochemical reactions are coupled with the multispecies transport based on a global implicit gi approach in which the reaction terms calculated from the overall kinetically controlled biochemical reaction model are incorporated into the corresponding mass transport equations as source sink terms then the reactive mass transport equations are solved to derive the current distribution of aqueous components of urea calcium suspended bacteria and ammonium as solid components the calcite and the attached bacteria are assumed to be immobile and their concentration with respect to liquid volume is calculated locally on each node 32 c c a c o 3 i n c c a c o 3 i 1 n k r e a i n δ t 33 c b a c s i n c b a c s i 1 n k a t t c b a c l i n δ t k d c b a c s i 1 n δ t where the subscript n refers to the n th node and i refers to the i th timestep after the determination of the calcite concentration an increased calcite volume can be obtained therefore the porosity change can be subsequently derived upon the results calculated from the first iteration liquid density total and effective porosity and permeability are updated with these new material properties the next iteration between h and bc is started following the same sequence as the first iteration a criterion for stopping the iteration is defined as 34 x i k 1 x i k 2 x i k 2 10 6 where x i k 1 and x i k are the vectors of the primary variables at the i th time step by the k 1 th and k th iterations respectively 4 model application two laboratory experiments from different literature contributions have been simulated the simulation of the first experiment half metre scale column tests martinez et al 2013 simulation case 1 is to validate whether this model can reasonably predict the spatial distribution of the produced calcite and the final hydraulic conductivity the second simulation case is about a set of small scale batch tests tan et al 2017 the purpose of the second simulation case is to estimate whether this model can be applied to predict the temporal evolution of permeability during micp treatment 4 1 simulation of half metre scale column tests case 1 in martinez et al 2013 several laboratory tests of micp treatments on half metre sand columns ottawa 50 70 sand with d 50 0 21 m m e min 0 55 e max 0 87 under different conditions were conducted among those tests three different tests were simulated the simulation of test 3b is used for calibration of the model parameters to validate and evaluate the predictive ability of the numerical model test 1b and test 3a were simulated the properties of the sand columns used in these three tests are listed in table 1 the treatment strategies of each test are summarized in table 2 all tests experienced two injection phases namely biological and chemical treatment during the biological treatment the solution containing cells of bacteria s pasteurii was continuously injected into the sample from the top the biological injection was followed by a no flow retention period which allowed bacterial attachment on the surface of the solid grain following the retention period chemical treatment was performed during which the solution containing urea calcium and ammonia was pumped from the column base via two different injection methods samples in test 3b and test 1b were treated by the continuous injection cf method test 3a was treated by stop flow sf injection in the sf injection method each injection interval was followed by a retention time of approximately 2 hours in each injection interval approximately 1 5 pore volumes of chemical solutions were injected 4 1 1 model setup as the diameter of the sand column 5 cm is much smaller than its length 50 cm the variation in the radial direction is neglected hence a one dimensional model with a length of 50 cm was set up the initial parameters of the model correspond to the measured values table 1 initially all concentrations in the model domain are equal to zero the initial pore pressure is assumed to be equal to the atmospheric pressure patm the biological b chemical injection phases c and the retention r time between phases b and c are considered in the modelling correspondingly the boundary conditions in each phase are defined table 3 the model parameters are listed in table 4 since coupled multifield problems are considered in the model the parameters are divided into hydraulic chemical and biological parameters most model parameters were obtained from the literature whereas other parameters were estimated by fitting the experimental data of test 3b more details about the parameter calibration as well as model estimation are discussed in the next section 4 1 2 simulation results results of test 3b during the biological treatment part of the biomass was adsorbed onto the mineral matrix and part of the biomass remained suspended and was transported by the advective flow and diffusion process bacterial adhesion which governs attachment behaviour can be affected by many environmental factors e g chemistry the flow rate of pore water temperature mineralogy ph value ionic strength etc scholl et al 1990 therefore the attachment rate is usually determined through calibration against the corresponding experiments qin et al 2016 hommel et al 2015 cuthbert et al 2013 van wijngaarden et al 2016 ebigbo et al 2012 in our modelling the value of the attachment rate table 4 is calibrated by fitting the measured normalized unattached cell density profile normalized to the injected initial cell density fig 4 a compared to the values reported in taylor and jaffé 1990 and ebigbo et al 2012 where the attachment rate is equal to 635 d 1 7 35e 3 s 1 and 9 9e 4 s 1 respectively our calibrated value of 1 2e 3 s 1 is in the comparable range as shown in fig 4 a the concentration of the suspended cells decreases from the injection source top to the bottom of the column it can be seen from the comparison of the computed results neglecting bacterial attachment dashed line with the measured profile that bacterial attachment is the main source causing the nonuniform bacterial distribution along the column the numerically predicted distributions of the attached cell concentration by the end of biological injection and after 8 hours of the retention period are illustrated in fig 4 b the attached bacterial concentration along the column after retention is generally higher than the concentration immediately after injection which indicates that additional biomass was attached on the solid grain during the 8 hour retention of injection similar to the distribution of the suspended bacterial distribution more biomass attached near the injection source than in the area further from the injection source according to the experimental observations the suspended bacterial cells could be flushed out at the early stage of the chemical injection therefore calcite precipitation is predominately induced by the activity of the attached biomass following the injection of urea calcium carbonate was produced gradually along the column due to microbial urease activity the value of the maximum urease constant usp table 4 is calibrated by fitting the measured carbonate profile fig 5 the measured calcite profile reveals that the bacterial distribution has an obvious influence on the spatial distribution of calcite although urea was injected opposite to the biological injection source due to the higher biomass more calcite was produced near the biological source top than near the chemical source bottom in general the spatial distribution of calcite concentration is determined jointly by the distributions of bacteria and urea and the relations between reaction rate and transport mechanisms the values of the constants a and ϕc in the effective porosity concept are determined by fitting the measured final hydraulic conductivity where the measured and computed hydraulic conductivity reduced to 0 017 cm s from its initial value of 0 024 cm s results of test 1b and test 3a using the parameters calibrated in the modelling of test 3b simulations of test 1b and test 3a were performed although the treatment strategies of test 3a and test 1b are quite different from the treatment strategy of test 3b table 2 without recalibration of any model parameters the observed features in both tests can be reasonably captured the comparison of the computed and measured temporal changes in aqueous chemistry in test 3a at the location of 40 cm away from the injection source is shown in fig 6 both computed and measured results show that urea is consumed continuously by hydrolysis producing twice of the ammonium concentration as the depleted urea concentration moreover the calcium concentration decreases as calcite precipitates fig 6 the chemistry of test 1b is not shown here since the measured data are not well known similarly the trend of carbonate profiles along the column can be well captured in the model fig 7 a despite the different injection strategies one by continuous flow and one by stop flow similar uniform calcite distributions were observed in test 3b and test 3a in test 3a the carbonate distribution in the upper area of the column was well predicted in the model however in the lower area it was overestimated in test 1b due to the higher injected concentration than test 3b higher calcite contents were precipitated the calcite profile in test 1b is more non uniform compare to that in test 3a and test 3b the measured and predicted maximum carbonate concentration is found near the injection source of chemical solutions and the concentration decreases from bottom to top the comparison of the computed and measured final hydraulic conductivity is shown in fig 7 b because the maximum carbonate concentration in test 1b is much higher than those in test 3a and test 3b the final hydraulic conductivity in test 1b is significantly lower than those in the other two tests in martinez et al 2013 a correlation was obtained between the measured final hydraulic conductivity and the maximum carbonate concentration in all tests through adoption of the effective porosity concept a similar correlation between the hydraulic conductivity and maximum carbonate contents can be obtained in the model 4 2 simulation of the laboratory small scale batch tests case 2 the second simulation considers the laboratory batch tests that were carried out by the nanjing hydraulic research institute nhri in 2016 tan et al 2017 in the experiment four cylindrical sand columns with a height of 7 5 cm and a diameter of 3 5 cm were treated using micp the four samples tested in the experiment have different grain sizes and porosities and therefore different hydraulic conductivities table 5 before the micp treatment all samples were fully saturated and the bacterial stock solution was then inoculated into each sample at a constant pumping rate during bacterial inoculation the cell number in the effluent was continuously monitored according to the recorded cell number in the effluent the initial adsorbed bacterial concentration in the sand columns at the beginning of the chemical treatment was determined after the biological treatment the chemical solution with 0 5 mol l urea and 0 5 mol l calcium chloride was pumped into the samples at a constant injection rate of 0 97 ml min the injection was stopped 72 hours later during the injection hydraulic conductivity was measured every 12 hours by the end of the micp test the mass increase in each sample was measured to estimate the final calcite mass produced 4 2 1 model description an axis symmetric model of 7 5 cm height and 1 75 cm radius fig 8 was set up to simulate this laboratory experiment in the modelling only the 72 hour chemical treatment phase is considered since the data regarding the biological treatment are not sufficient for modelling corresponding to the experimental conditions at the injection boundary neumann s boundary condition of a constant advective fluid flux of 0 97 ml min is imposed for the liquid flow and dirichlet s boundary condition with a constant urea calcium concentration of 0 5 mol l is imposed for the mass transport similar to simulation case 1 at the opposite boundary bottom of the sample to the injection boundary the fluid pressure is set equal to the atmospheric pressure for mass flux a natural boundary condition is assigned to this boundary where the mass flux can freely pass through advection the confining boundary is set as a no flow as well as a no mass flux boundary initially the concentrations of all chemical components are set to 0 over the domain the measured initial porosity and hydraulic conductivity table 5 are assigned as the corresponding initial model parameters for each sample according to the measurements table 5 the initially adsorbed bacterial cell numbers are different due to the different pore properties specifically the samples with high initial porosity have good hydraulic conductivity but weak adsorption ability of bacterial cells according to the experimental observations the unattached bacteria were almost flushed out of the sample before the start of the chemical treatment therefore in the model only the attached bacteria are considered due to the small size of samples and the unknown spatial distribution of bacteria a constant initial bacterial concentration is applied over the model domain which corresponds to the measured attached bacterial cell table 5 to calibrate the model parameters first the simulation of the test on sample 2 was carried out the reason for selecting sample 2 as the reference model is because of its representativeness on the one hand the initial porosity of sample 2 is at an intermediate value compared to those porosities of sample 1 and sample 4 on the other hand the measured data evolution of the hydraulic conductivity and the calcite mass in sample 2 were found at the average level among the four samples the calibration of the hydraulic parameters especially a and ϕc in eq 28 table 4 is mainly based on fitting the measured hydraulic conductivity evolution the estimation of the maximum urease constant usp is through fitting the final measured calcite mass produced compared to simulation case 1 the calibrated value of the maximum urease constant in simulation case 2 is lower due to the larger sample size and the higher initial porosity of samples tested in experiment 1 than in experiment 2 better conditions of urea and oxygen supply and thus better bacterial urease activities are expected in case 1 than in case 2 moreover due to the different pore structures of the tested samples in these two experiments the constants in the effective porosity concept are different between the two simulation cases 4 2 2 modelling results results of sample 2 the computed temporal change in urea calcite and porosity in sample 2 at three representative points p1 p2 and p3 in fig 8 are shown in fig 9 only during the early stage fig 9 a is the urea concentration in the points near the bottom lower than the concentration far away after approximately 50 minutes of injection an overall homogeneous urea distribution with a constant concentration of 0 5 mol l was reached fig 9 b even though there was a continuous consumption of urea by the reactions the reason for the overall constant concentration is due to the continuous supply of urea from the top in this case the advection followed by the injection downwards and the diffusion due to the concentration gradient tend to balance the chemical consumption due to the relatively higher advection flow rate with respect to the reaction rate and the small sample size the state of overall homogeneous urea concentration that is equal to the inflow concentration can be reached quickly as a consequence a homogeneous micp performance i e homogeneous calcite and porosity distribution in the sample can be quickly achieved in practice an inhomogeneous micp performance would be expected in the case of an inhomogeneous distribution of urea as in simulation case 1 fig 5 a homogeneous distribution of reactants would be achieved later since the reaction activity is expected to decrease over time results of all samples maintaining the same model parameters as adopted in the modelling of sample 2 simulations of the tests on the other three samples 1 3 and 4 were performed the comparisons of the computed results of all samples with the measured data are illustrated in fig 10 generally the observed features in the experiment can be well captured in the modelling due to the adoption of the time constant the observed behaviour in the reduction of hydraulic conductivity which clearly slows after 24 hours progressively and then becomes stable can be well reproduced in the model concerning the produced calcite mass initially fewer bacteria were attached table 5 although in samples with higher initial porosity more calcite was finally produced this indicates that instead of the initial bacterial concentration the initial pore properties play an essential role in the calcite precipitation during these micp tests according to tan et al 2017 the grain size and thus the tortuosity are quite different in the four samples as a consequence the blockage behaviour of the flow path and thus the local mass transfer are expected to be different the limitation of mass transfer caused by blockage in the pore space is expected to be more significant in the samples with smaller grain sizes therefore less calcium carbonate was produced in sample 1 than in sample 4 in the simulations of sample 2 and sample 3 which have intermediate porosity good agreement can be achieved between the calculated and measured results with regard to the temporal evolution of hydraulic conductivity and final precipitated calcium carbonate mass by adopting the effective porosity concept the general tendency of the reduction in hydraulic conductivity over time can be well captured in all four samples however in quantity a distinct difference was found between the measured and calculated results for sample 1 and sample 4 which have the lowest and highest porosities respectively in sample 1 the produced calcite is overestimated in the model accordingly the magnitude of the calculated hydraulic conductivity decrease is overestimated in contrast the calcite mass in sample 4 is underestimated in the simulation which resulted in an underestimation of the reduction in hydraulic conductivity regarding the present modelling concept the values of effective reaction rates in samples 1 and 4 could be slightly different from that in samples 2 and 3 due to the different initial pore structures 5 analysis of the model features 5 1 influence of the maximum urease constant in the literature different values of the maximum urease constant usp are reported for comparison not only the original value but also the converted value in mol m 3 s are listed in table 6 according to several previous studies thiele 1939 li et al 2007 wood et al 2007 the reaction rate especially fluid solid reactions is usually dependent on the specific reaction surface porosity and the roughness of the flow path thus the observed maximum urease constant in the different samples or under different experimental conditions could be different nevertheless the values of the maximum urease constant reported in the literature as well as calibrated in our model belong to the range of 1e 2 to 1e 1 mol m 3 s to analyse the influence of usp on the spatial distribution of calcite simulations using different usp values were performed the calcite profiles in test 3a of experiment 1 calculated using different usp values were shown in fig 11 as the maximum urease constant increases the reaction rate increases significantly therefore more calcium carbonate mass is produced by the adoption of a smaller maximum urease constant the area of maximum calcite contents moves towards the biological injection source in contrast with the increase in the maximum urease constant the area of maximum calcium carbonate contents shifts gradually towards the chemical injection source in the case with low usp values e g by u sp1 and u sp2 the reaction rate is much lower than the rate of transport and the system is transport dominated the homogeneous distribution of urea concentration could be reached quickly even before the start of the reaction after that the reaction takes place slowly from the biological source due to the high bacterial concentration there further production of calcium carbonate would be expected within a longer reaction time even under the condition of no chemical injection in contrast in the case with a great urease constant e g u s p 0 5 the reaction is much faster than the transport and thus the system is governed primarily by the reactions in these cases a non uniform distribution of the calcium carbonate profile is expected since the total urea mass could be consumed before it can be transported to the area further from the injection source according to the measurements in case 2 it is postulated that the effective reaction rate could be different among the tested samples due to their remarkably different pore structures compared to samples 2 and 3 the effective reaction rate in sample 4 could be higher whereas the reaction rate in sample 1 is expected to be lower to estimate this assumption different simulations were performed with a lower urease constant of 1 7e 3 mol m 3sod for sample 1 and a higher urease constant of 1 7e 2 mol m 3 sodfor sample 4 the results of the variations are illustrated in fig 12 the computed mass is slightly higher than the final measured mass because a small part of the precipitated calcite mass might be flushed out of the samples before being weighed by fitting the produced calcite mass the temporal evolution of hydraulic conductivity is automatically well reproduced by the adoption of the effective porosity concept 5 2 influence of effective porosity to analyse the influence of effective porosity different simulations were conducted with three different porosity permeability relationships among these relationships one is the classical kozeny carman kc relationship eq 27 the other two are power law relationship and exponential relationship where the porosity permeability relationships are expressed as eq 35 and eq 36 respectively 35 k i k 0 ϕ i ϕ 0 n 36 k i k 0 1 e ϵ ϕ i 1 e ϵ ϕ 0 where n and ϵ are constants the reasons for choosing these three porosity permeability relationships as references are that all three relationships are commonly used and general in the application however the effective porosity is not considered in the simulation case 1 the values of n and ϵ table 4 were calibrated based on the measured final hydraulic conductivity in test 3b using the calibrated values from test 3b simulations on test 3a and test 1b were carried out the calculated final hydraulic conductivity and the maximum carbonate contents of each test using different porosity permeability relationships were compared with the results using the effective porosity concept and the measured data fig 13 no obvious difference in maximum carbonate contents is obtained using different porosity permeability relationships due to the similar measured maximum calcite content and final hydraulic conductivity between test 3a and test 3b the measured hydraulic conductivity of test 3a can be relatively well captured by all porosity permeability relationships however in the case when a higher maximum carbonate concentration was precipitated as in test 1b the final hydraulic conductivity was significantly overestimated by all porosity permeability relationships expect the relationship using effective porosity similarly calculations using different porosity permeability relationships have been conducted for simulation case 2 fig 14 a shows the comparison of the computed evolution of hydraulic conductivity based on the unmodified kc equation with the measured results without consideration of the effective porosity the reduction in conductivity is significantly underestimated for instance in sample 2 the computed final hydraulic conductivity is approximately 10 times higher than the measured hydraulic conductivity as well as the computed hydraulic conductivity using the effective porosity the comparison of the computed evolution of hydraulic conductivity using the power law and exponential relationships with the measured data is shown in fig 14 b the values of the constants n and ϵ in simulation case 2 are estimated by fitting the measured evolution of hydraulic conductivity in sample 2 notice that the values of the maximum urease constant adopted here in the simulations of sample 1 and sample 4 are the same as the values adopted in the variation simulations described in section 5 1 since we want to ensure that the calcite mass is well fitted in both samples fig 12 b which would not cause additional deviations in the measured and calculated hydraulic conductivity fig 14 b shows that when using both the power law and exponential relations the evolution of the hydraulic conductivity in sample 1 is obviously overestimated whereas that in sample 4 is underestimated in contrast if the calcite mass is well fitted the evolution of the hydraulic conductivity in sample 1 and sample 4 can be well reproduced using the effective porosity approach fig 12 a 5 3 applicability of the numerical model in the present model a relatively simple kinetic approach for biochemical reactions is implemented in that the most relevant biochemical reactions and the major reactants and products in micp have been considered compared to the model considering complicated reaction processes in which usually the determination of numerous model parameters is required in this model only two reaction related parameters needed to be estimated namely the rate of bacterial attachment and the maximum urease constant through the calibration of these parameters this model could be applied to simulate micp reactions in different soil types especially in large scale in situ tests the simple model has advantages in computational efficiency and model calibration since the complicated conditions and high uncertainties in large scale applications usually make the calibration of such models quite difficult furthermore one of the most important features of this model is to predict the permeability reduction during micp which is a key factor to evaluate the micp performance with the modification of the kc equation only two parameters are additionally introduced through adjustment of these two parameters the model is estimated to have the capacity to predict permeability evolution in different micp treatments in the chemical model the reaction is according to michaelis menten kinetics and dependent on the bacterial and urea concentrations however the influence of calcium concentration is not considered therefore this chemical model may be valid only under the condition that sufficient inorganic calcium is present in the system before precipitation occurs this condition is usually fulfilled in most micp applications since sufficient calcium is usually first provided to optimize calcite precipitation according to the work of lauchnor et al 2015 the influence of ph value on micp performance is minimal compared to the effects of bacterial and urea concentrations in this model the ph effects are hence not considered if ph value has to be considered in some cases the dependency of usp on ph value could be established or the michaelis menten kinetics could be modified by adding a ph related term in this study the kinetics of the reactions are assumed to be whole bacterial cell based rather than biofilm induced since during both simulated experiments no observations on biofilm formulation were reported besides in the experiments of biofilm predominated micp usually biofilm needs to be cultured before the chemical treatment cuthbert et al 2012 phillips et al 2013 however in the case of high bacterial density or biofilm formulation as suggested in lauchnor et al 2015 the kinetic term might have to be modified accordingly similar to the cell based micp in the biofilm induced precipitation permeability reduction is expected to be mainly caused by the infilling of calcite in pore space moreover according to the observations in cuthbert et al 2012 the isolation of the areas where the porosity is not completely infilled could play a significant role in the permeability reduction therefore the effective porosity concept could have the potential to be applied to describe the permeability reduction in the case of biofilm induced calcite precipitation 6 conclusion in the present work we performed numerical analyses of the coupled processes between the biogeochemical and hydraulic fields for micp treatment in the soil in this study two laboratory experiments on micp were simulated the experimental observations on the hydraulic conductivity evolution and calcite precipitation can be well reproduced in the model the results show that the model is able to capture the most relevant features when using micp to reduce the permeability of the sand columns therefore this coupled model is of great interest for the design of laboratory and in situ experiments as well as for future work to determine the strategy for treatment and optimization of micp in engineering applications according to the modelling results the spatial distribution of the precipitated calcite is heavily dependent on the bacterial distribution and the relation between the reaction rate and mass transport rate in practice the reaction rate could be first predicted through experiment or numerical modelling using the designed biochemical solution and then the injection rate can be adjusted based on the predicted reaction rate as a key fact to evaluate micp performance the constitutive relationship between porosity and permeability has been analysed based on both modelling and experimental results to evaluate the proposed effective porosity concept simulations using different commonly used porosity permeability relations were performed the results of simulations suggested the necessity of considering of the effective porosity and the critical porosity to describe the permeability evolution during the micp treatment according to the observations in the experiment considered in the second simulation case different distributions of initial grain size can lead to different behaviours in calcite precipitation and hydraulic conductivity evolution it is suggested that pore structure might have non ignorable effects on the reaction rate to capture the pore effects on reactions an additional coupling mechanism between the pore structure h and reaction rate c should be considered in the current coupling concept fig 1 for a detailed analysis of further pore effects e g pore structure specific surface roughness of the solid surface on biochemical reactions further experimental and numerical investigations are required specifically experiments should be carried out that were designed regarding the reaction rate in samples with different pore characterizations in the modelling aspect the recent model could be complemented and calibrated based on a pore scale modelling investigation credit authorship contribution statement xuerui wang methodology investigation software validation

appelstraße 9a 30167 hannover germany corresponding author microbially induced calcite precipitation micp provides the potential for developing innovative and environmentally friendly techniques to improve the engineering properties of soil through reduction of permeability in soil and increase of soil stiffness and strength in the present research work coupled bio chemo hydraulic modelling was developed to enhance the understanding of the coupled processes involved in micp and to predict the micp performance in permeability reduction in the model an overall kinetically controlled model is adopted to describe the biochemical reactions where the reaction rate is dependent on the concentration of both bacteria and chemical reactants specifically an effective porosity concept was proposed and implemented in the model to capture the effects of pore throat blockage on permeability reduction caused by precipitated calcite correspondingly the kozeny carman equation was modified to describe the permeability variation during micp this model has been applied to simulate two laboratory experiments the observed changes in chemical components and hydraulic conductivity can be well reproduced in the model through comparisons of the effective porosity concept to other commonly used porosity permeability relationships it is estimated that effective porosity should be considered to simulate the permeability reduction observed in micp furthermore a sensitivity analysis of the reaction related parameters was conducted the results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the maximum urease

applications according to many experimental observations the bacterial promoted precipitation of calcium carbonate can remarkably reduce the permeability and improve the stiffness strength and compressibility of soil with these features micp enables the development of innovative solution strategies for a wide range of problems in geo environmental engineering e g immobilization of groundwater contamination erosion protection environmental remediation concrete repair and land slope stabilization whiffin et al 2007 currently most micp treatments can only be demonstrated in the laboratory or in field tests major application related challenges are found in controlling monitoring and predicting micp performance dejong et al 2013 during the past decades many experimental investigations on micp have been performed and have been utilized to gain a substantial understanding of the involved coupled processes stocks fischer et al 1999 al qabany et al 2012 most experimental studies focus on the analysis of the precipitated calcite structure stocks fischer et al 1999 the change in hydraulic and mechanical properties of the treated sand chou et al 2011 tan et al 2017

the performance of micp treatment however some relevant issues e g predictions of the long term behaviour of micp treated soil sensitivity and scenario analysis of micp performance under different conditions are usually difficult to realize in experiments therefore reliable numerical models are required generally micp in the soil can be described as mechanisms caused by transport and metabolic related biological activities in porous media and these mechanisms further cause a series of coupled phenomena in biological chemical hydraulic and mechanical fields recent mathematical and modelling work considering multispecies reactions transport flow and deformation processes in porous media diersch 1989 ehlers 1989 bear and bachmat 2012 helmig 1997 lewis and schrefler 1998 provides an essential tool to develop the micp numerical model the modelling work concerning the transport growth decay and degradation of microorganisms in porous media as well as the biologically induced reactions and blockage processes clement et al 1997 kildsgaard and engesgaard 2001 schijven et al 2002 prommer and barry 2005 olson et al 2006 islam et al 2001 brovelli et al 2009 serves as the basis to complement and optimize the micp model barkouki et al 2011 and martinez et al 2014 proposed a model that considers a comprehensive hydro geochemical reaction framework including complex ureolysis calcite precipitation and dissolution the chemical reactions in the model are controlled in a mixed manner the aqueous complex reactions are governed by the equilibrium of the chemical system following the mass action law the ureolysis and calcite precipitation are kinetically controlled the geochemical reaction model is coupled with a one dimensional flow model to capture the spatial distribution of aqueous chemical components the transport of bacteria and the biologically induced porosity and permeability variation are not considered ebigbo et al 2012 developed a two phase model considering the transport of aqueous and gaseous components the most relevant biogeochemical processes i e kinetic controlled ureolysis calcite precipitation and dissolution biomass and biofilm growth and decay are also included later hommel et al 2015 revised the model of ebigbo et al 2012 by modifying and calibrating the expression for the ureolysis rate cuthbert et al 2013 presented a model to simulate the reduction of fractured rock permeability using micp in which a simplified kinetic reaction model is included and the relationship between the increased calcite volume and the corresponding decrease in fracture width has been analysed in those mathematical and numerical works the overall reaction approach proposed by van paassen 2009 is noteworthy in this reaction approach an overall kinetic rate that controls all the chemical reactions in micp was introduced through comparisons with the experimental findings the overall reaction approach delivered an accuracy as good as the more complex biochemical approach concerning the temporal evolution in concentration of the chemical substances based on this approach van wijngaarden et al 2011 developed an overall biogrout model in which bacteria is assumed to be immobile and homogeneously distributed and the variations in porosity as well as permeability caused by calcite precipitation are considered fauriel and laloui 2012 further developed the overall biogrout model by considering a deformable solid grain and the change in mechanical properties caused by micp more recently a field scale model cunningham et al 2018 was developed to predict the micp performance in sealing fractures in underground in most of the aforementioned macroscopic continuum models complete mixing of the aqueous biochemical components is assumed thus the influences of the local incomplete mixing of reactants at the pore throat cannot be considered to consider such local heterogeneity pore scale simulations are usually required recently pore scale models nogues et al 2013 qin et al 2016 zhang and klapper 2014 for micp can be found in the literature because of the high computational cost the pore scale model might have limitations when applied in simulations with relatively large sizes compared to pore scale models macroscopic models based on homogenization techniques have certain advantages especially in large scale micp applications through modelling work e g barkouki et al 2011 martinez et al 2014 ebigbo et al 2012 hommel et al 2015 the biochemical processes and reaction kinetics have been better understood in recent years however the coupled mechanisms involved in micp remain as issues in some studies e g van wijngaarden et al 2011 fauriel and laloui 2012 which focus on the coupling effects between biochemical and hydraulic fields the biochemical reactions are usually simplified under the assumption of an overall reaction rate that is related to a specific maximum urease constant in the literature the values of the maximum urease constant are found over a wide range as an important factor to evaluate the micp performance the variations in porosity and permeability were considered in some modelling works in van wijngaarden et al 2011 2013 2016 and fauriel and laloui 2012 the classical kozeny carman kc equation is adopted to describe the porosity permeability relationship further the porosity permeability relationship in ebigbo et al 2012 and hommel et al 2015 is described by the verma pruess relationship in which a critical porosity is introduced based on the current sutdies further investigations on the feasibility of using the classical kc equation and other porosity permeability relationships to predict the permeability reduction during micp are required related modelling work should be calibrated and validated against the corresponding experiments the present study aims to obtain a better insight of the coupled mechanisms in micp especially the biochemically induced change in porosity and permeability using numerical modelling the numerical work has been based on a coupled bio chemo hydraulic model in which the biogeochemical processes are described by the overall kinetically controlled reaction model according to the approach proposed in van paassen 2009 further the other major mechanisms in micp i e multispecies and multicomponent transport the interactions between the biochemical and hydraulic fields have been addressed in the model for a better prediction of the permeability evolution the commonly used kc equation is modified with an effective porosity concept this numerical model has been calibrated and validated against two laboratory experiments the sensitivity of the maxium urease rate was analysed furthermore the modelling results using the effective porosity approach have been compared to the results using the original kc equation and two other commonly used porosity permeability relations finally the possible modifications of the model to capture the micp behaviour under further treatment conditions were discussed 2 physical processes 2 1 microbially induced calcite precipitation in porous media in practice the bacterium sporosarcina pasteurii is often used for micp treatment to use urea nh 2 2 co as an energy source stocks fischer et al 1999 for the metabolic process s pasteurii produces a large amount of urease that catalyses the hydrolysis of urea into ammonium n h 4 the solution of ammonium in the aqueous phase causes an increase in the ph value that leads to the dramatic increase in the concentration of the dissolved carbonate ions c o 3 2 in the solution 1 c o n h 2 2 2 h 2 o u r e a s e 2 n h 4 c o 3 2 following the hydrolysis of urea eq 1 if calcium c a 2 is present in the system then calcite caco 3 can precipitate 2 c o 3 2 c a 2 c a c o 3 the urea hydrolysis eq 1 is a homogeneous reaction that occurs only in the aqueous phase causing mass transfer among the components in the liquid phase the calcite precipitation eq 2 corresponds to a heterogeneous reaction that leads to a mass decrease in the liquid phase and a mass increase in the solid phase combining eq 1 and eq 2 the overall micp reaction can be derived 3 c o n h 2 2 2 h 2 o c a 2 u r e a s e 2 n h 4 c a c o 3 2 2 coupled processes to obtain insight of the mechanisms using micp for permeability reduction an understanding of the coupled processes among the biological b chemical c and hydraulic h fields fig 1 is required first the bacterial behaviour e g growth decay and de attachment leads to the temporal and spatial variation in bacterial concentrations in the system that can affect the rate of chemical reactions the consumption of reactants and diffusion during the chemical processes can affect the bacterial behaviour the experimental observations indicate that following bacterial catalysed chemical reactions upon precipitation calcite can attach to the solid matrix simultaneously and fill in the pore space causing a reduction of porosity and permeability depending on the injection strategy the variations in porosity and permeability may affect the advection or pressure distribution during the hydraulic process in an advection dominated flow system the variation in advective flow can significantly change the spatial distribution of the bacteria and the aqueous chemical components in summary the main mechanisms that need to be considered are summarized as follows 1 major biological mechanisms transport growth decay and de attachment 2 transport of aqueous chemical components governed by dispersion diffusion and advection 3 mass transfer and decrease in the liquid phase caused by chemical reactions 4 mass increase in the solid phase due to calcite precipitation and the corresponding reduction in porosity and permeability 5 the dependence of the reaction rate on the current distribution of different biochemical components 6 the variation in the advective flow due to the porosity and permeability reduction 3 model development the development of the model is based on a macroscopic continuum in the representative element volume rev both the solid phase and aqueous phase are considered in the aqueous phase multicomponents are considered it is assumed that the porous medium is fully saturated calcium carbonate is assumed to be present only in the solid phase the other chemical components urea calcium and ammonium are assumed to exist only in the aqueous phase part of the bacterial mass is expected to attach to the solid grain while the remainder of the mass remains suspended in the aqueous solution according to the aforementioned definition and assumptions the system is then composed of a solid phase denoted by subscript s and a liquid phase denoted by l in the solid phase solid grains attached bacteria and calcium carbonate are considered the liquid phase contains five components pore water calcium urea ammonium and suspended bacteria 3 1 mass balance equation of the liquid phase the macroscopic mass balance is applied to derive the mathematical model since the liquid phase contains five components the general expression of the mass balance equation for the liquid phase is given by 4 ϕ ρ l t ϕ ρ l v ω u r e a ω c a 2 ω n h 4 q w where ϕ is the porosity v is the vector of liquid velocity ω i is the production consumption rate of each aqueous chemical mass qw is the source sink term of the pore water mass and ρl is the liquid density in van wijngaarden et al 2011 according to the experiments a linear relation was found between the liquid density and the concentration of each species 5 ρ l ρ w 0 0154994 kg mol c urea 0 0867338 kg mol c c a 2 0 0158991 kg mol c n h 4 where ρw is the constant water density and is equal to 1000 kg m 3 ci is the concentration of urea calcium and ammonium in the aqueous solution the spatial and temporal distribution of each aqueous component in the homogeneous and saturated porous media is governed by advection diffusion mechanical dispersion chemical reaction biological decay and usually also by adsorption the model concentrates on the transport of aqueous reactants and products of micp reactions in the sand column where the adsorption effect of the chemical components is not significant van wijngaarden et al 2011 therefore in the transport equations the retardation phenomenon of the chemical components urea calcium and ammonium caused by adsorption is neglected the advective transport of all components in the liquid phase is assumed to be governed by the same overall liquid flow velocity according to the mass balance equation of each species the transport equations for urea calcium ammonium and suspended bacteria can be expressed as 6 ϕ c i t ϕ d c i q c i q i where ci is the concentration of aqueous components i i urea c a 2 nh 4 and bacteria and qi is the reaction related sink source term q ϕ v is the vector of darcy velocity d is the diffusion dispersion matrix which is composed of diffusion df and mechanical dispersion dp parts by definition of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient αl and the transversal dispersion coefficient αt the dispersion matrix is expressed by 7 d p α l α t v v v α t v i 3 2 biochemical reactions 3 2 1 overall kinetically controlled reaction model similar to the work done by fauriel and laloui 2012 and van wijngaarden et al 2011 an overall kinetically controlled reaction model is adopted to describe urea hydrolysis and calcite precipitation in micp in this model the chemical reactions are assumed to be first order irreversible reactions and controlled by an overall kinetic rate krea the overall kinetic rate is defined by adjusting the michaelis menten kinetics which is typically used for enzyme catalysed reactions 8 k r e a u c u r e a k m c u r e a e x p t t d where km is the half saturation constant at which the reaction rate is reduced by 50 curea is the concentration of urea related research performed by van paassen 2009 fauriel and laloui 2012 and van wijngaarden et al 2011 suggested that the reaction rate could decrease throughout the treatment since several processes during biochemical reactions are likely to reduce the reaction activity of the microorganisms on the one hand oxygen and nutrientsare continuously consumed in the system without further supply the reactions would be restrained due to insufficient oxygen or nutrients on the other hand the bacteria can be encapsulated by the precipitated calcite which hinders not only the contact of urea with bacteria but also transmission of the nutrients between bacteria and solution to consider the possible reduction in the reaction activity over time the time constant td is introduced eq 8 in eq 8 u is the coefficient for the maximum ureolytic activity of bacteria which is further determined by the current bacterial concentration 9 u u s p c b a c t where usp is the maximum urease constant cbact is the total bacterial concentration that is composed of the immobile bacterial concentration that attach to the solid grains cbacs and the suspended bacterial concentration in the pore fluid cbacl 3 2 2 bacterial behaviour in this model bacterial decay and attachment are considered in most micp applications before injection bacteria are first accumulated in the laboratory to obtain a desired concentration and activity after that bacterial decay dominates de muynck et al 2010 therefore in the model bacterial growth is neglected it is also postulated that the bacterial decay is linear with a constant decay rate kd and that the decay rate for the attached and suspended biomass is identical therefore the temporal variation in the total bacterial concentration is given by 10 c b a c t t k d c b a c t bacterial attachment is assumed to be dependent on the currently suspended bacterial concentration in the system similar to most previous studies on micp bacterial attachment is simplified by a first order kinetic model with constant attachment rate katt 11 c b a c s t k a t t c b a c l k d c b a c l accordingly the decrease in suspended bacterial concentration is calculated as 12 c b a c l t k a t t c b a c l k d c b a c s 3 3 field equations darcy s law is applied to describe the advection term in the flow equation eq 4 13 q k μ l p l ρ l g where k is the intrinsic permeability μl is the liquid viscosity g is the gravity acceleration vector and pl is the liquid pressure choosing liquid pressure as the primary variable for the flow equation and according to the chain rule the left hand side of eq 4 can be rewritten as 14 ϕ ρ l t ϕ ρ l p l p l t ρ l ϕ p l p l t ρ l p l t ϕ β l ϕ p l the liquid phase is considered to be low

final partial differential equations pdes to be solved in the model are composed of eqs 20 21 22 23 and 24 3 4 porosity and permeability variations according to the experimental observations the major contribution to the decrease of porosity and permeability is due to the filling of the precipitated calcite in the pore space therefore similar to several previous studies e g van wijngaarden et al 2011 van wijngaarden et al 2013 van wijngaarden et al 2016 fauriel and laloui 2012 cuthbert et al 2013 the decreased total pore volume is assumed to be equal to the produced calcite volume then the total variation in porosity is given by 25 δ ϕ t o t δ v p o r e v t o t a l δ v c a c o 3 v t o t a l m c a c o 3 ϕ t o t δ c c a c o 3 ρ c a c o 3 where ρ caco3 is the density of calcite and c caco3 is the amount of produced calcite in mol with respect to the unit volume of liquid according to eq 19 by assuming a small time interval the decrease rate of the total porosity can be obtained by 26 ϕ t o t t 1 ρ c a c o 3 m c a c o 3 ϕ t o t c c a c o 3 t 1 ρ c a c o 3 m c a c o 3 ϕ t o t k r e a upon the derived variation in porosity the permeability reduction could be obtained by utilization of a proper model for the description of the porosity permeability constitutive relations many different models regarding porosity permeability relations have been developed and applied to simulate different geochemical and geomechanical processes that can alter the pore space of porous media hommel et al 2018 among these models and due to its simple implementation the kozeny carman kc equation which was established based on experimental findings has been widely used to describe the porosity and permeability changes caused by mineral precipitation dissolution and biomass accumulation for instance in several current micp models van wijngaarden et al 2011 2013 2016 fauriel and laloui 2012 the unmodified kc equation is adopted however calcite precipitation could cause the closing of pore throats especially by small pore spaces and narrow pore throats as a consequence isolated non permeable areas could be formed fig 2 a although not all pore volumes in those areas are fully filled with calcium carbonate this phenomenon has already been observed in experiments through results from scanning electron microscopy sem and optical microscopy wang et al 2018 qabany and k soga 2013 wang et al 2017 terzis and laloui 2018 cuthbert et al 2012 since those isolated areas can no longer contribute to the flow path the pore space in such isolated areas should be removed by the calculation of a new permeability after calcite precipitation furthermore the behaviour of the permeability reduction during micp could be significantly different in different soil types with different pore properties caused by e g different grain sizes specific surface and roughness of the grain surface however in the unmodified kc equation to obtain the current permeability only the calculation of the initial and current porosity is required 27 k i f ϕ 0 ϕ i k 0 ϕ i 3 1 ϕ i 2 1 ϕ 0 2 ϕ 0 3 where the influence of further pore altering during micp e g closing the pore throats on permeability reduction cannot be captured to capture the different possible features of the abovementioned permeability reductions during micp the effective porosity concept is adopted in the numerical model effective porosity is defined as part of the total porosity and represents the volume fraction of pore space that is still interconnected after calcite precipitation according to the approach proposed in koponen et al 1997 the effective porosity is given by 28 ϕ e f f a x 3 2 a ϕ c x 2 a 1 ϕ c x 29 x ϕ t o t ϕ c 1 ϕ c where ϕtot is the total porosity a is a constant and ϕc is the critical porosity below which the permeability is equal to zero usually the values of a and ϕc vary depending on the characterization of the pore space they can be determined by fitting the measured porosity permeability relationships eq 28 has the form of the most general polynomial with a third order in which the natural constraints of porosity are fulfilled to be specific ϕ e f f 1 at ϕ t o t 1 ϕ e f f 0 at ϕ t o t ϕ c and for all ϕtot 1 ϕeff ϕtot an example of the relationship between the effective and total porosity is illustrated in fig 2 b it can be seen from this figure that a reasonable dependence of effective porosity on total porosity can be obtained using eqs 28 and 29 specifically by a relatively high total porosity the material reveals good permeable property the effective porosity could be identical to the total porosity e g dashed line in fig 2 b when the total porosity is higher than 0 8 however with the decrease in the total porosity more pore spaces tend to be isolated as a consequence the difference between effective and total porosity becomes large in the context of effective porosity the kc equation is modified in which the calculation of permeability variation is based on the change in the effective porosity instead of the change in the total porosity 30 k k x k y k z d m 2 180 ϕ e f f 3 1 ϕ e f f 2 where dm is the mean particle size of the subsurface medium since the initial porosity and permeability are usually known the current permeability at time step i can be calculated from the initial effective porosity permeability and the current effective porosity 31 k i k 0 ϕ e f f i 3 1 ϕ e f f i 2 1 ϕ e f f 0 2 ϕ e f f 0 3 where k 0 and ϕeff 0 are the initial permeability and initial effective porosity respectively 3 5 numerical solution strategy in this model three processes are solved i e flow transport h mass transport c and biochemical reactions b regarding the aqueous phase pl curea c c a 2 c n h 4 and cbacl are chosen as primary variables the pdes are solved using the finite element method fem based on the code opengeosys ogs kolditz et al 2012 in the ogs code there are preexisting modules pertaining to the multispecies transport and saturated and partially saturated flow the overall kinetically controlled reaction model has been coupled with the multispecies transport module in ogs the effective porosity concept as well as the porosity permeability relationship have been implemented in the ogs code in the numerical treatment two way couplings between the flow multispecies transport and biochemical processes are considered the coupled problem between the hydraulic field h and biochemical field bc is solved using a staggered scheme in which the hydraulic process and reactive mass transport are solved separately however the biochemical reactions b are solved with the mass transport c process together the major coupling effects are incorporated into the system as the dependency of the parameters and primary variables involved in different processes the coupling concept is illustrated in fig 3 iterations have been made between the liquid flow and reactive mass transport processes in every time step in the first iteration the liquid density the total as well as effective porosity and permeability are updated with the corresponding results calculated from the previous time step under the assumption that the permeability as well as the porosity are constant within a small time step the liquid flow eq 20 is solved to obtain the advective velocity as the input information for the multispecies transport equations eqs 21 22 23 and 24 the biochemical reactions are coupled with the multispecies transport based on a global implicit gi approach in which the reaction terms calculated from the overall kinetically controlled biochemical reaction model are incorporated into the corresponding mass transport equations as source sink terms then the reactive mass transport equations are solved to derive the current distribution of aqueous components of urea calcium suspended bacteria and ammonium as solid components the calcite and the attached bacteria are assumed to be immobile and their concentration with respect to liquid volume is calculated locally on each node 32 c c a c o 3 i n c c a c o 3 i 1 n k r e a i n δ t 33 c b a c s i n c b a c s i 1 n k a t t c b a c l i n δ t k d c b a c s i 1 n δ t where the subscript n refers to the n th node and i refers to the i th timestep after the determination of the calcite concentration an increased calcite volume can be obtained therefore the porosity change can be subsequently derived upon the results calculated from the first iteration liquid density total and effective porosity and permeability are updated with these new material properties the next iteration between h and bc is started following the same sequence as the first iteration a criterion for stopping the iteration is defined as 34 x i k 1 x i k 2 x i k 2 10 6 where x i k 1 and x i k are the vectors of the primary variables at the i th time step by the k 1 th and k th iterations respectively 4 model application two laboratory experiments from different literature contributions have been simulated the simulation of the first experiment half metre scale column tests martinez et al 2013 simulation case 1 is to validate whether this model can reasonably predict the spatial distribution of the produced calcite and the final hydraulic conductivity the second simulation case is about a set of small scale batch tests tan et al 2017 the purpose of the second simulation case is to estimate whether this model can be applied to predict the temporal evolution of permeability during micp treatment 4 1 simulation of half metre scale column tests case 1 in martinez et al 2013 several laboratory tests of micp treatments on half metre sand columns ottawa 50 70 sand with d 50 0 21 m m e min 0 55 e max 0 87 under different conditions were conducted among those tests three different tests were simulated the simulation of test 3b is used for calibration of the model parameters to validate and evaluate the predictive ability of the numerical model test 1b and test 3a were simulated the properties of the sand columns used in these three tests are listed in table 1 the treatment strategies of each test are summarized in table 2 all tests experienced two injection phases namely biological and chemical treatment during the biological treatment the solution containing cells of bacteria s pasteurii was continuously injected into the sample from the top the biological injection was followed by a no flow retention period which allowed bacterial attachment on the surface of the solid grain following the retention period chemical treatment was performed during which the solution containing urea calcium and ammonia was pumped from the column base via two different injection methods samples in test 3b and test 1b were treated by the continuous injection cf method test 3a was treated by stop flow sf injection in the sf injection method each injection interval was followed by a retention time of approximately 2 hours in each injection interval approximately 1 5 pore volumes of chemical solutions were injected 4 1 1 model setup as the diameter of the sand column 5 cm is much smaller than its length 50 cm the variation in the radial direction is neglected hence a one dimensional model with a length of 50 cm was set up the initial parameters of the model correspond to the measured values table 1 initially all concentrations in the model domain are equal to zero the initial pore pressure is assumed to be equal to the atmospheric pressure patm the biological b chemical injection phases c and the retention r time between phases b and c are considered in the modelling correspondingly the boundary conditions in each phase are defined table 3 the model parameters are listed in table 4 since coupled multifield problems are considered in the model the parameters are divided into hydraulic chemical and biological parameters most model parameters were obtained from the literature whereas other parameters were estimated by fitting the experimental data of test 3b more details about the parameter calibration as well as model estimation are discussed in the next section 4 1 2 simulation results results of test 3b during the biological treatment part of the biomass was adsorbed onto the mineral matrix and part of the biomass remained suspended and was transported by the advective flow and diffusion process bacterial adhesion which governs attachment behaviour can be affected by many environmental factors e g chemistry the flow rate of pore water temperature mineralogy ph value ionic strength etc scholl et al 1990 therefore the attachment rate is usually determined through calibration against the corresponding experiments qin et al 2016 hommel et al 2015 cuthbert et al 2013 van wijngaarden et al 2016 ebigbo et al 2012 in our modelling the value of the attachment rate table 4 is calibrated by fitting the measured normalized unattached cell density profile normalized to the injected initial cell density fig 4 a compared to the values reported in taylor and jaffé 1990 and ebigbo et al 2012 where the attachment rate is equal to 635 d 1 7 35e 3 s 1 and 9 9e 4 s 1 respectively our calibrated value of 1 2e 3 s 1 is in the comparable range as shown in fig 4 a the concentration of the suspended cells decreases from the injection source top to the bottom of the column it can be seen from the comparison of the computed results neglecting bacterial attachment dashed line with the measured profile that bacterial attachment is the main source causing the nonuniform bacterial distribution along the column the numerically predicted distributions of the attached cell concentration by the end of biological injection and after 8 hours of the retention period are illustrated in fig 4 b the attached bacterial concentration along the column after retention is generally higher than the concentration immediately after injection which indicates that additional biomass was attached on the solid grain during the 8 hour retention of injection similar to the distribution of the suspended bacterial distribution more biomass attached near the injection source than in the area further from the injection source according to the experimental observations the suspended bacterial cells could be flushed out at the early stage of the chemical injection therefore calcite precipitation is predominately induced by the activity of the attached biomass following the injection of urea calcium carbonate was produced gradually along the column due to microbial urease activity the value of the maximum urease constant usp table 4 is calibrated by fitting the measured carbonate profile fig 5 the measured calcite profile reveals that the bacterial distribution has an obvious influence on the spatial distribution of calcite although urea was injected opposite to the biological injection source due to the higher biomass more calcite was produced near the biological source top than near the chemical source bottom in general the spatial distribution of calcite concentration is determined jointly by the distributions of bacteria and urea and the relations between reaction rate and transport mechanisms the values of the constants a and ϕc in the effective porosity concept are determined by fitting the measured final hydraulic conductivity where the measured and computed hydraulic conductivity reduced to 0 017 cm s from its initial value of 0 024 cm s results of test 1b and test 3a using the parameters calibrated in the modelling of test 3b simulations of test 1b and test 3a were performed although the treatment strategies of test 3a and test 1b are quite different from the treatment strategy of test 3b table 2 without recalibration of any model parameters the observed features in both tests can be reasonably captured the comparison of the computed and measured temporal changes in aqueous chemistry in test 3a at the location of 40 cm away from the injection source is shown in fig 6 both computed and measured results show that urea is consumed continuously by hydrolysis producing twice of the ammonium concentration as the depleted urea concentration moreover the calcium concentration decreases as calcite precipitates fig 6 the chemistry of test 1b is not shown here since the measured data are not well known similarly the trend of carbonate profiles along the column can be well captured in the model fig 7 a despite the different injection strategies one by continuous flow and one by stop flow similar uniform calcite distributions were observed in test 3b and test 3a in test 3a the carbonate distribution in the upper area of the column was well predicted in the model however in the lower area it was overestimated in test 1b due to the higher injected concentration than test 3b higher calcite contents were precipitated the calcite profile in test 1b is more non uniform compare to that in test 3a and test 3b the measured and predicted maximum carbonate concentration is found near the injection source of chemical solutions and the concentration decreases from bottom to top the comparison of the computed and measured final hydraulic conductivity is shown in fig 7 b because the maximum carbonate concentration in test 1b is much higher than those in test 3a and test 3b the final hydraulic conductivity in test 1b is significantly lower than those in the other two tests in martinez et al 2013 a correlation was obtained between the measured final hydraulic conductivity and the maximum carbonate concentration in all tests through adoption of the effective porosity concept a similar correlation between the hydraulic conductivity and maximum carbonate contents can be obtained in the model 4 2 simulation of the laboratory small scale batch tests case 2 the second simulation considers the laboratory batch tests that were carried out by the nanjing hydraulic research institute nhri in 2016 tan et al 2017 in the experiment four cylindrical sand columns with a height of 7 5 cm and a diameter of 3 5 cm were treated using micp the four samples tested in the experiment have different grain sizes and porosities and therefore different hydraulic conductivities table 5 before the micp treatment all samples were fully saturated and the bacterial stock solution was then inoculated into each sample at a constant pumping rate during bacterial inoculation the cell number in the effluent was continuously monitored according to the recorded cell number in the effluent the initial adsorbed bacterial concentration in the sand columns at the beginning of the chemical treatment was determined after the biological treatment the chemical solution with 0 5 mol l urea and 0 5 mol l calcium chloride was pumped into the samples at a constant injection rate of 0 97 ml min the injection was stopped 72 hours later during the injection hydraulic conductivity was measured every 12 hours by the end of the micp test the mass increase in each sample was measured to estimate the final calcite mass produced 4 2 1 model description an axis symmetric model of 7 5 cm height and 1 75 cm radius fig 8 was set up to simulate this laboratory experiment in the modelling only the 72 hour chemical treatment phase is considered since the data regarding the biological treatment are not sufficient for modelling corresponding to the experimental conditions at the injection boundary neumann s boundary condition of a constant advective fluid flux of 0 97 ml min is imposed for the liquid flow and dirichlet s boundary condition with a constant urea calcium concentration of 0 5 mol l is imposed for the mass transport similar to simulation case 1 at the opposite boundary bottom of the sample to the injection boundary the fluid pressure is set equal to the atmospheric pressure for mass flux a natural boundary condition is assigned to this boundary where the mass flux can freely pass through advection the confining boundary is set as a no flow as well as a no mass flux boundary initially the concentrations of all chemical components are set to 0 over the domain the measured initial porosity and hydraulic conductivity table 5 are assigned as the corresponding initial model parameters for each sample according to the measurements table 5 the initially adsorbed bacterial cell numbers are different due to the different pore properties specifically the samples with high initial porosity have good hydraulic conductivity but weak adsorption ability of bacterial cells according to the experimental observations the unattached bacteria were almost flushed out of the sample before the start of the chemical treatment therefore in the model only the attached bacteria are considered due to the small size of samples and the unknown spatial distribution of bacteria a constant initial bacterial concentration is applied over the model domain which corresponds to the measured attached bacterial cell table 5 to calibrate the model parameters first the simulation of the test on sample 2 was carried out the reason for selecting sample 2 as the reference model is because of its representativeness on the one hand the initial porosity of sample 2 is at an intermediate value compared to those porosities of sample 1 and sample 4 on the other hand the measured data evolution of the hydraulic conductivity and the calcite mass in sample 2 were found at the average level among the four samples the calibration of the hydraulic parameters especially a and ϕc in eq 28 table 4 is mainly based on fitting the measured hydraulic conductivity evolution the estimation of the maximum urease constant usp is through fitting the final measured calcite mass produced compared to simulation case 1 the calibrated value of the maximum urease constant in simulation case 2 is lower due to the larger sample size and the higher initial porosity of samples tested in experiment 1 than in experiment 2 better conditions of urea and oxygen supply and thus better bacterial urease activities are expected in case 1 than in case 2 moreover due to the different pore structures of the tested samples in these two experiments the constants in the effective porosity concept are different between the two simulation cases 4 2 2 modelling results results of sample 2 the computed temporal change in urea calcite and porosity in sample 2 at three representative points p1 p2 and p3 in fig 8 are shown in fig 9 only during the early stage fig 9 a is the urea concentration in the points near the bottom lower than the concentration far away after approximately 50 minutes of injection an overall homogeneous urea distribution with a constant concentration of 0 5 mol l was reached fig 9 b even though there was a continuous consumption of urea by the reactions the reason for the overall constant concentration is due to the continuous supply of urea from the top in this case the advection followed by the injection downwards and the diffusion due to the concentration gradient tend to balance the chemical consumption due to the relatively higher advection flow rate with respect to the reaction rate and the small sample size the state of overall homogeneous urea concentration that is equal to the inflow concentration can be reached quickly as a consequence a homogeneous micp performance i e homogeneous calcite and porosity distribution in the sample can be quickly achieved in practice an inhomogeneous micp performance would be expected in the case of an inhomogeneous distribution of urea as in simulation case 1 fig 5 a homogeneous distribution of reactants would be achieved later since the reaction activity is expected to decrease over time results of all samples maintaining the same model parameters as adopted in the modelling of sample 2 simulations of the tests on the other three samples 1 3 and 4 were performed the comparisons of the computed results of all samples with the measured data are illustrated in fig 10 generally the observed features in the experiment can be well captured in the modelling due to the adoption of the time constant the observed behaviour in the reduction of hydraulic conductivity which clearly slows after 24 hours progressively and then becomes stable can be well reproduced in the model concerning the produced calcite mass initially fewer bacteria were attached table 5 although in samples with higher initial porosity more calcite was finally produced this indicates that instead of the initial bacterial concentration the initial pore properties play an essential role in the calcite precipitation during these micp tests according to tan et al 2017 the grain size and thus the tortuosity are quite different in the four samples as a consequence the blockage behaviour of the flow path and thus the local mass transfer are expected to be different the limitation of mass transfer caused by blockage in the pore space is expected to be more significant in the samples with smaller grain sizes therefore less calcium carbonate was produced in sample 1 than in sample 4 in the simulations of sample 2 and sample 3 which have intermediate porosity good agreement can be achieved between the calculated and measured results with regard to the temporal evolution of hydraulic conductivity and final precipitated calcium carbonate mass by adopting the effective porosity concept the general tendency of the reduction in hydraulic conductivity over time can be well captured in all four samples however in quantity a distinct difference was found between the measured and calculated results for sample 1 and sample 4 which have the lowest and highest porosities respectively in sample 1 the produced calcite is overestimated in the model accordingly the magnitude of the calculated hydraulic conductivity decrease is overestimated in contrast the calcite mass in sample 4 is underestimated in the simulation which resulted in an underestimation of the reduction in hydraulic conductivity regarding the present modelling concept the values of effective reaction rates in samples 1 and 4 could be slightly different from that in samples 2 and 3 due to the different initial pore structures 5 analysis of the model features 5 1 influence of the maximum urease constant in the literature different values of the maximum urease constant usp are reported for comparison not only the original value but also the converted value in mol m 3 s are listed in table 6 according to several previous studies thiele 1939 li et al 2007 wood et al 2007 the reaction rate especially fluid solid reactions is usually dependent on the specific reaction surface porosity and the roughness of the flow path thus the observed maximum urease constant in the different samples or under different experimental conditions could be different nevertheless the values of the maximum urease constant reported in the literature as well as calibrated in our model belong to the range of 1e 2 to 1e 1 mol m 3 s to analyse the influence of usp on the spatial distribution of calcite simulations using different usp values were performed the calcite profiles in test 3a of experiment 1 calculated using different usp values were shown in fig 11 as the maximum urease constant increases the reaction rate increases significantly therefore more calcium carbonate mass is produced by the adoption of a smaller maximum urease constant the area of maximum calcite contents moves towards the biological injection source in contrast with the increase in the maximum urease constant the area of maximum calcium carbonate contents shifts gradually towards the chemical injection source in the case with low usp values e g by u sp1 and u sp2 the reaction rate is much lower than the rate of transport and the system is transport dominated the homogeneous distribution of urea concentration could be reached quickly even before the start of the reaction after that the reaction takes place slowly from the biological source due to the high bacterial concentration there further production of calcium carbonate would be expected within a longer reaction time even under the condition of no chemical injection in contrast in the case with a great urease constant e g u s p 0 5 the reaction is much faster than the transport and thus the system is governed primarily by the reactions in these cases a non uniform distribution of the calcium carbonate profile is expected since the total urea mass could be consumed before it can be transported to the area further from the injection source according to the measurements in case 2 it is postulated that the effective reaction rate could be different among the tested samples due to their remarkably different pore structures compared to samples 2 and 3 the effective reaction rate in sample 4 could be higher whereas the reaction rate in sample 1 is expected to be lower to estimate this assumption different simulations were performed with a lower urease constant of 1 7e 3 mol m 3sod for sample 1 and a higher urease constant of 1 7e 2 mol m 3 sodfor sample 4 the results of the variations are illustrated in fig 12 the computed mass is slightly higher than the final measured mass because a small part of the precipitated calcite mass might be flushed out of the samples before being weighed by fitting the produced calcite mass the temporal evolution of hydraulic conductivity is automatically well reproduced by the adoption of the effective porosity concept 5 2 influence of effective porosity to analyse the influence of effective porosity different simulations were conducted with three different porosity permeability relationships among these relationships one is the classical kozeny carman kc relationship eq 27 the other two are power law relationship and exponential relationship where the porosity permeability relationships are expressed as eq 35 and eq 36 respectively 35 k i k 0 ϕ i ϕ 0 n 36 k i k 0 1 e ϵ ϕ i 1 e ϵ ϕ 0 where n and ϵ are constants the reasons for choosing these three porosity permeability relationships as references are that all three relationships are commonly used and general in the application however the effective porosity is not considered in the simulation case 1 the values of n and ϵ table 4 were calibrated based on the measured final hydraulic conductivity in test 3b using the calibrated values from test 3b simulations on test 3a and test 1b were carried out the calculated final hydraulic conductivity and the maximum carbonate contents of each test using different porosity permeability relationships were compared with the results using the effective porosity concept and the measured data fig 13 no obvious difference in maximum carbonate contents is obtained using different porosity permeability relationships due to the similar measured maximum calcite content and final hydraulic conductivity between test 3a and test 3b the measured hydraulic conductivity of test 3a can be relatively well captured by all porosity permeability relationships however in the case when a higher maximum carbonate concentration was precipitated as in test 1b the final hydraulic conductivity was significantly overestimated by all porosity permeability relationships expect the relationship using effective porosity similarly calculations using different porosity permeability relationships have been conducted for simulation case 2 fig 14 a shows the comparison of the computed evolution of hydraulic conductivity based on the unmodified kc equation with the measured results without consideration of the effective porosity the reduction in conductivity is significantly underestimated for instance in sample 2 the computed final hydraulic conductivity is approximately 10 times higher than the measured hydraulic conductivity as well as the computed hydraulic conductivity using the effective porosity the comparison of the computed evolution of hydraulic conductivity using the power law and exponential relationships with the measured data is shown in fig 14 b the values of the constants n and ϵ in simulation case 2 are estimated by fitting the measured evolution of hydraulic conductivity in sample 2 notice that the values of the maximum urease constant adopted here in the simulations of sample 1 and sample 4 are the same as the values adopted in the variation simulations described in section 5 1 since we want to ensure that the calcite mass is well fitted in both samples fig 12 b which would not cause additional deviations in the measured and calculated hydraulic conductivity fig 14 b shows that when using both the power law and exponential relations the evolution of the hydraulic conductivity in sample 1 is obviously overestimated whereas that in sample 4 is underestimated in contrast if the calcite mass is well fitted the evolution of the hydraulic conductivity in sample 1 and sample 4 can be well reproduced using the effective porosity approach fig 12 a 5 3 applicability of the numerical model in the present model a relatively simple kinetic approach for biochemical reactions is implemented in that the most relevant biochemical reactions and the major reactants and products in micp have been considered compared to the model considering complicated reaction processes in which usually the determination of numerous model parameters is required in this model only two reaction related parameters needed to be estimated namely the rate of bacterial attachment and the maximum urease constant through the calibration of these parameters this model could be applied to simulate micp reactions in different soil types especially in large scale in situ tests the simple model has advantages in computational efficiency and model calibration since the complicated conditions and high uncertainties in large scale applications usually make the calibration of such models quite difficult furthermore one of the most important features of this model is to predict the permeability reduction during micp which is a key factor to evaluate the micp performance with the modification of the kc equation only two parameters are additionally introduced through adjustment of these two parameters the model is estimated to have the capacity to predict permeability evolution in different micp treatments in the chemical model the reaction is according to michaelis menten kinetics and dependent on the bacterial and urea concentrations however the influence of calcium concentration is not considered therefore this chemical model may be valid only under the condition that sufficient inorganic calcium is present in the system before precipitation occurs this condition is usually fulfilled in most micp applications since sufficient calcium is usually first provided to optimize calcite precipitation according to the work of lauchnor et al 2015 the influence of ph value on micp performance is minimal compared to the effects of bacterial and urea concentrations in this model the ph effects are hence not considered if ph value has to be considered in some cases the dependency of usp on ph value could be established or the michaelis menten kinetics could be modified by adding a ph related term in this study the kinetics of the reactions are assumed to be whole bacterial cell based rather than biofilm induced since during both simulated experiments no observations on biofilm formulation were reported besides in the experiments of biofilm predominated micp usually biofilm needs to be cultured before the chemical treatment cuthbert et al 2012 phillips et al 2013 however in the case of high bacterial density or biofilm formulation as suggested in lauchnor et al 2015 the kinetic term might have to be modified accordingly similar to the cell based micp in the biofilm induced precipitation permeability reduction is expected to be mainly caused by the infilling of calcite in pore space moreover according to the observations in cuthbert et al 2012 the isolation of the areas where the porosity is not completely infilled could play a significant role in the permeability reduction therefore the effective porosity concept could have the potential to be applied to describe the permeability reduction in the case of biofilm induced calcite precipitation 6 conclusion in the present work we performed numerical analyses of the coupled processes between the biogeochemical and hydraulic fields for micp treatment in the soil in this study two laboratory experiments on micp were simulated the experimental observations on the hydraulic conductivity evolution and calcite precipitation can be well reproduced in the model the results show that the model is able to capture the most relevant features when using micp to reduce the permeability of the sand columns therefore this coupled model is of great interest for the design of laboratory and in situ experiments as well as for future work to determine the strategy for treatment and optimization of micp in engineering applications according to the modelling results the spatial distribution of the precipitated calcite is heavily dependent on the bacterial distribution and the relation between the reaction rate and mass transport rate in practice the reaction rate could be first predicted through experiment or numerical modelling using the designed biochemical solution and then the injection rate can be adjusted based on the predicted reaction rate as a key fact to evaluate micp performance the constitutive relationship between porosity and permeability has been analysed based on both modelling and experimental results to evaluate the proposed effective porosity concept simulations using different commonly used porosity permeability relations were performed the results of simulations suggested the necessity of considering of the effective porosity and the critical porosity to describe the permeability evolution during the micp treatment according to the observations in the experiment considered in the second simulation case different distributions of initial grain size can lead to different behaviours in calcite precipitation and hydraulic conductivity evolution it is suggested that pore structure might have non ignorable effects on the reaction rate to capture the pore effects on reactions an additional coupling mechanism between the pore structure h and reaction rate c should be considered in the current coupling concept fig 1 for a detailed analysis of further pore effects e g pore structure specific surface roughness of the solid surface on biochemical reactions further experimental and numerical investigations are required specifically experiments should be carried out that were designed regarding the reaction rate in samples with different pore characterizations in the modelling aspect the

488,this paper is concerned with the estimation of the effective transport characteristics of fluid saturated porous media via rigorous microstructure property relations we are particularly interested in predicting the formation factor f mean survival time τ principal nmr diffusion relaxation time t 1 principal viscous relaxation time θ1 and fluid permeability k to do so we employ rigorous methods to estimate the fluid permeability and these other transport properties of hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform models of porous media from microstructural information disordered hyperuniform materials are exotic amorphous states of matter that have attracted great attention in the physical mathematical and biological science but little is known about their fluid transport characteristics in carrying out this investigation we not only draw from ideas and results of the emerging field of hyperuniformity but from homogenization theory statistical geometry differential equations spectrum of laplace and stokes operators and the covering and quantizer problems of discrete geometry among other results we derive a fourier representation of a classic rigorous upper bound on the fluid permeability that depends on the spectral density to infer how the permeabilities of hyperuniform porous media perform relative to those of nonhyperuniform ones we find that the velocity fields in nonhyperuniform porous media are generally much more localized over the pore space compared to those in their hyperuniform counterparts which has implications for their permeabilities rigorous bounds on transport properties suggest a new approximate formula for the fluid permeability that provides reasonably accurate permeability predictions of a certain class of hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform porous media these comparative studies shed new light on the microstructural characteristics that determine the transport properties of general porous media our findings also have implications for the design of porous materials with desirable transport properties 1 introduction the physical properties of fluid saturated porous media are fundamentally controlled by the underlying complex microstructures of these heterogeneous media across length scales knowledge of their transport properties is of central importance in hydrology petroleum engineering and reservoir engineering todd and mays 2004 øren et al 2002 dandekar 2013 while these physical properties can be ascertained experimentally by retrieving physical samples and testing them in the laboratory such methods can be tedious and often do not yield insights about the microstructures this emphasizes the need for sophisticated mathematical and computational tools that are capable of modeling the complex microstructures and their physical properties such methods have been developed over the last several decades this includes homogenization and averaging methods to estimate the effective transport properties quintard and whitaker 1994a 1994b milton 2002 torquato 2002b sahimi 2003 moreover x ray microtomographic techniques which provide three dimensional 3d digitized images of porous media at the pore scale in a nondestructive manner kinney and nichols 1992 coker et al 1996 blunt et al 2013 have been combined with computational reconstruction techniques yeong and torquato 1998a 1998b jiao et al 2009 tahmasebi and sahimi 2013 tahmasebi 2018 to produce a wide class of realistic microstructures at will subsequently such computer generated microstructures can be structurally characterized and their physical properties can be estimated via computer simulations sahimi 2003 wood et al bijeljic and blunt 2006 blunt et al 2013 vasseur and wadsworth 2017 aramideh et al 2018 the effective transport electromagnetic and mechanical properties of porous and other heterogeneous media generally require information about an infinite set of correlation functions brown 1955 beran 1965 milton 1987 sen and torquato 1989 torquato 1997 milton 2002 torquato 2002a since such complete information is almost never available in practice for general microstructures theoretical estimates of the effective properties are based either on approximate methods scheidegger 1974 johnson et al 1986 thompson et al 1987 martys et al 1994 milton 2002 torquato 2002a sahimi 2003 or rigorous upper and lower bounds that account for a finite set of correlation functions beran 1965 milton 2002 torquato 2002a the bounds tighten as progressively more microstructural information is properly incorporated our focus in this paper is the use of rigorous theoretical methods to estimate the following effective transport properties of fluid saturated porous media in terms of various n point correlation functions 1 formation factor f 2 mean survival time τ 3 principal nmr diffusion relaxation time t 1 4 principal viscous relaxation time θ1 5 fluid permeability k among these physical properties which are defined more precisely in section 3 the most challenging to predict for general microstructures is the fluid permeability k which is defined by darcy s law the permeability k has dimensions of the square of length and roughly speaking may be regarded as an effective pore channel area of the dynamically connected part of the pore space torquato 2002a by dynamically connected we mean the topologically connected portion of the pore space that carries the flow which eliminates isolated pores and dead ends and connected regions with very little flow for example fig 1 gives visual sense of the dynamically connected pore space for two dimensional stokes flow through a bed of nonoverlapping disks remarkably all of the other transport properties in the list above f τ t 1 and θ1 are intimately related to the fluid permeability k as we will discuss and exploit subsequently we are particularly interested in hyperuniform porous media a hyperuniform state of matter is characterized by an anomalous suppression of density or volume fraction fluctuations at infinitely long wavelengths relative to those in typical disordered systems such as liquids and structural glasses torquato and stillinger 2003 zachary and torquato 2009 torquato 2018a hyperuniform states include all perfect crystals many quasicrystals as well as special disordered systems disordered hyperuniform materials are exotic amorphous states of matter that are like crystals in the manner in which their large scale density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed and yet behave like liquids or glasses in that they are statistically isotropic without any bragg peaks they have been the subject of fundamental interest across a variety of fields including physical torquato et al 2008 batten et al 2008 hexner and levine 2015 weijs et al 2015 thien et al 2017 chen and torquato 2018 ding et al 2018 lomba et al 2018 mathematical ghosh and lebowitz 2018 brauchart et al 2019 torquato et al 2019 and biological jiao et al 2014 mayer et al 2015 sciences it is being discovered that disordered hyperuniform materials can have remarkable physical properties including cellular materials with complete isotropic photonic band gaps florescu et al 2009 man et al 2013 froufe pérez et al 2017 optimal thermal diffusive and elastic properties zhou et al 2016 chen and torquato 2018 kim and torquato 2019b dense but transparent materials leseur et al 2016 and devices for enhanced directional light extraction gorsky et al 2019 little is known about the fluid transport characteristics of disordered hyperuniform porous media one exception is a recent study that demonstrated that electrical or fluid transport through disordered hyperuniform networks is optimized in the limit that the porosity tends to zero torquato and chen 2018 a major aim of this article is to use rigorous methods to shed light on the fluid permeability and other transport properties of models of disordered hyperuniform porous media and to contrast their transport characteristics with those of nonhyperuniform disordered models in carrying out this investigation we not only draw from the ideas and results of the emerging field of hyperuniformity but from homogenization theory statistical geometry differential equations spectrum of laplace and stokes operators and the covering and quantizer problems of discrete geometry in section 2 we define relevant microstructural descriptors and hyperuniformity including how to measure hyperuniformity in section 3 we briefly review the homogenized relations that determine all of the transport properties of interest to us in this work i e f τ t 1 and θ1 and k as well as rigorous cross property relations linking k to the other transport properties in section 4 we state the microstructure dependent formulas that we will employ to estimate the various effective properties in section 5 we describe hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform porous media models that we examine and present their spectral densities and pore size probability functions in section 6 we compute the effective transport properties of a variety of different hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform models of porous media we also derive a fourier representation of the classic two point void upper bound on the fluid permeability that depends on the spectral density this new formula enables us to infer the salient microstructural features that determine the permeabilities of hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform porous media we use rigorous bounds on individual effective properties as well as cross property relations to suggest a new approximate formula for the fluid permeability that provides reasonably accurate permeability predictions of the class of hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform porous media in which the pore space is well connected in section 7 we make concluding remarks and discuss problems for future research 2 definitions of microstructural descriptors and hyperuniformity two phase heterogeneous media abound in nature and synthetic situations examples of such materials include composites and porous media biological media foams polymer blends granular media cellular solids and colloids torquato 2002a sahimi 2003 there is a panoply of different statistical descriptors of the microstructure of two phase media see ref torquato 2002a and references therein the most relevant for the purposes of this paper are the n point correlation functions and pore size distributions defined briefly below we also highlight the hyperuniformity concept that we will apply in subsequent sections 2 1 n point correlation functions a two phase random medium is a domain of space v r d that is partitioned into two disjoint regions that make up v a phase 1 region v 1 of volume fraction ϕ 1 and a phase 2 region v 2 of volume fraction ϕ 2 torquato 2002a the phase indicator function i i x ω for a given realization ω is defined as 1 i i x ω 1 x v i 0 x v i the statistical properties of each phase of the system are specified by the countably infinite set of n correlation functions s n i which are defined by torquato and stell 1982 stoyan et al 1995 and torquato 2002a 2 s n i x 1 x n j 1 n i i x j ω where angular brackets denote an ensemble average over realizations the n point correlation function s n i x 1 x n has a probabilistic interpretation it gives the probability of finding the ends of the vectors x 1 x n all in phase i for this reason s n i x 1 x n is sometimes referred to as the n point probability function if the medium is statistically homogeneous s n i x 1 x n is translationally invariant and in particular the one point correlation function is independent of position and equal to the volume fraction of phase i 3 s 1 i x ϕ i while the two point correlation function s 2 i r depends on the displacement vector r x 2 x 1 for statistically homogeneous media the two point correlation function for phase 2 is simply related to that for phase 1 via the expression s 2 2 r s 2 1 r 2 ϕ 1 1 and hence the autocovariance function is given by 4 χ v r s 2 1 r ϕ 1 2 s 2 2 r ϕ 2 2 which we see is the same for phase 1 and phase 2 at the extreme limits of its argument χ v has the following asymptotic behavior 5 χ v r 0 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 lim r χ v r 0 the latter limit applying when the medium possesses no long range order if the medium is statistically homogeneous and isotropic then the autocovariance function χ v r depends only on the magnitude of its argument r r and hence is a radial function in such instances its slope at the origin is directly related to the specific surface s interface area per unit volume specifically we have in any space dimension d the asymptotic form torquato 2002a 6 χ v r ϕ 1 ϕ 2 β d s r o r 2 where 7 β d γ d 2 2 π γ d 1 2 and γ x is the gamma function the nonnegative spectral density χ v k which can be obtained from scattering experiments debye and bueche 1949 debye et al 1957 is the fourier transform of χ v r i e 8 χ v k r d χ v r e i k r d r 0 for all k for a general statistically homogeneous two phase medium the spectral density must obey the following sum rule 9 1 2 π d r d χ v k d k χ v r 0 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 this follows immediately from the fourier representation of the autocovariance function i e 10 χ v r 1 2 π d r d χ v k e i k r d k for isotropic media the spectral density only depends on k k and as a consequence of 6 its decay in the large k limit is controlled by the exact following power law form 11 χ v k γ d s k d 1 k where 12 γ d 2 d π d 1 2 γ d 1 2 β d is a d dimensional constant and β d is given by 7 2 2 volume fraction fluctuations and hyperuniformity a hyperuniform point process in d dimensional euclidean space r d is one in which the variance associated with the number of points within a spherical observation window of radius r grows more slowly than rd i e window volume in the large r limit torquato and stillinger 2003 equivalently it is one in which the structure factor 13 s k 1 ρ h k tends to zero as the wavenumber k k tends to zero torquato and stillinger 2003 where h k is the fourier transform of the total correlation function h r g 2 r 1 and g 2 r is the standard pair correlation function typical disordered systems such as liquids and structural glasses possess local number variances that grow as the window volume that is proportional to rd all perfect crystals and many perfect quasicrystals are hyperuniform moreover there are special disordered systems that are hyperuniform they are exotic ideal states of amorphous matter have attracted great attention because they have characteristics that lie between a crystal and liquid they are like perfect crystals in the way they suppress large scale density fluctuations and yet are like liquids or glasses in that they are statistically isotropic with no bragg peaks and hence lack any conventional long range order torquato 2018a these unusual attributes can endow disordered hyperuniform systems with novel optical mechanical and transport properties torquato 2018a ding et al 2018 the hyperuniformity concept was generalized to the case of two phase heterogeneous materials zachary and torquato 2009 here the phase volume fraction fluctuates within a finite sized spherical window of radius r see fig 2 which can be characterized by the local volume fraction variance σ v 2 r which in turn can be related to the autocovariance function as follows lu and torquato 1990 14 σ v 2 r 1 v 1 r r d χ v r α r r d r where α r r is intersection volume of two identical spheres of radius r scaled by the volume of a sphere whose centers are separated by a distance r which is known analytically in any space dimension torquato and stillinger 2003 2006 the alternative fourier representation of σ v 2 r was obtained in ref zachary and torquato 2009 15 σ v 2 r 1 v 1 r 2 π d r d χ v k α k r d k where α k r 4 π d 2 γ 1 d 2 j d 2 2 k r k d is the fourier transform of α r r torquato and stillinger 2003 zachary and torquato 2009 and jν x is the bessel function of the first kind of order ν for typical disordered two phase media the variance σ v 2 r for large r goes to zero like r d lu and torquato 1990 quintanilla and torquato 1997 and hence the value of r at which the product σ v 2 r r d first effectively reaches its asymptote provides a linear measure of the representative elementary volume however for hyperuniform disordered two phase media σ v 2 r goes to zero asymptotically more rapidly than the inverse of the window volume i e faster than r d which is equivalent to the following condition on the spectral density defined in section 2 16 lim k 0 χ v k 0 stealthy hyperuniform two phase media are a subclass of hyperuniform systems in which χ v k is zero for a range of wave vectors around the origin i e 17 χ v k 0 for 0 k k where k is some positive number as in the case of hyperuniform point configurations torquato and stillinger 2003 zachary and torquato 2009 2011 torquato 2018a there are three different scaling regimes classes when the spectral density goes to zero with the power law form χ v k k α that describe the associated large r behaviors of local volume fraction variance 18 σ v 2 r r d 1 α 1 class i r d 1 ln r α 1 class ii r d α 0 α 1 class iii where the exponent α is a positive constant thus the linear measure of the representative elementary volume for a hyperuniform medium will depend on the hyperuniformity class scaling class i is the strongest hyperuniformity class which includes all perfect periodic packings as well as some disordered packings such as disordered stealthy packings described in section 5 2 2 we call a packing in r d a collection of nonoverlapping particles torquato 2018b while all class i have local volume fraction variances that scale as r d 1 for large r the coefficient b v multiplying r d 1 is different among them and hence b v provides a hyperuniformity order metric that can be used to rank order different structures according to degree that they suppress large scale local volume fraction fluctuations torquato and stillinger 2003 zachary and torquato 2009 torquato 2018a torquato et al 2015 these previous results indicate that the body centered cubic bcc lattice packing in three dimensions has the smallest hyperuniformity order metric b v most ordered with respect to this metric when compared to other packings at the same number density and packing fraction fig 3 schematically shows the ranking of this order metric for some selected packings we will see that the bcc packing plays a special role in various problems described in this paper in the case of a packing of identical spheres of radius a at number density ρ the spectral density χ v k is directly related to the structure factor s k of the sphere centers torquato 2002a 2016a 19 χ v k ρ m 2 k a s k where m k a is the fourier transform of a sphere indicator function given by 20 m k a 2 π a k d 2 j d 2 k a asymptotic analysis of 20 for large values of k and comparison to relation 11 reveals the expected result for the specific surface of any packing of identical spheres namely 21 s 3 ϕ 2 a where ϕ 2 is the packing fraction fraction of space covered by the spheres which is given by 22 ϕ 2 ρ v 1 a and 23 v 1 a π d 2 a d γ 1 d 2 is the volume of a d dimensional sphere of radius a 2 3 pore size distribution we also characterize the pore phase by determining the probability f δ that a randomly placed sphere of radius δ centered in the pore space v 1 lies entirely in v 1 by definition f 0 1 and f 0 the quantity f δ is the complementary cumulative distribution function associated with the corresponding pore size probability density function p δ f δ δ at the extreme values of p δ we have that p 0 s ϕ 1 and p 0 the nth moment of the pore size probability density is defined by torquato 2002a 24 δ n 0 δ n p δ d δ n 0 δ n 1 f δ d δ we will be particularly interested in the mean pore size δ and the second moment δ 2 25 δ 0 f δ d δ 26 δ 2 2 0 δ f δ d δ we will see that these characteristic length scales of the pore phase can be related to certain diffusion properties of the porous medium note that the pore size probability function f δ can be easily extracted from 3d digitized images of real porous media coker et al 1996 for models of porous media consisting of distributions of identical spheres of radius a nonoverlapping or not the complementary cumulative pore size distribution f δ is trivially related to the so called void exclusion probability ev r via the relation torquato 2002a 27 f δ e v δ a ϕ 1 δ 0 the exclusion probability ev r gives the probability that a test sphere of radius r that is placed randomly in the medium does not contain any sphere center the quantity 28 h v r e v r r is the associated void nearest neighbor probability density function 3 local differential equations and effective transport properties 3 1 formation factor and tortuosity of the pore space consider a porous medium whose pore space v 1 is filled with an electrically conducting fluid of conductivity σ 1 and a solid phase that is perfectly insulating σ 2 0 at steady state the scaled electric field e actual electric field divided by the modulus of the ensemble averaged electric field satisfies 29 e 0 in v 1 30 e 0 in v 1 31 e n 0 on v 1 where n is the unit outward normal at the pore solid interface v 1 homogenization theory provides the conditions under which the scaled effective conductivity of the porous medium σe σ 1 has the well known energy representation 32 σ e σ 1 f 1 e e where f denotes the formation factor which is the commonly employed designation for σ 1 σe and angular brackets denote an ensemble average the formation factor f is a measure of the tortuosity of the entire pore space including topologically connected parts of the pore space as well as disconnected portions e g isolated pores if the pore space does not percolate then f is unbounded or equivalently σ e σ 1 0 roughly speaking the formation factor f quantifies the degree of windiness for electrical transport pathways across a macroscopic sample 3 2 diffusion nmr relaxation problem and effective time scales nuclear magnetic resonance nmr relaxation times of porous media provide useful probes of the pore phase microstructure mitra et al 1992 1993 bergman and dunn 1994 sen and hürlimann 1994 øren et al 2002 let m r t denote the magnetization density at local position r and time t inside the pore phase v 1 in which there are generally paramagnetic impurities at the pore solid interface v that will tend to demagnetize the diffusing particle when it strikes the interface the magnetization density obeys the time dependent diffusion equation in the pore region v 1 33 m t d m m o δ t in v 1 34 d m n κ m 0 on v here d is the diffusion coefficient κ is the surface rate constant is the laplacian operator mo is the initial magnetization density and δ t is the dirac delta function in the diffusion controlled regime the diffusing species takes a long time to diffuse to the pore trap interface relative to the characteristic time associated with the surface reaction for infinite surface reaction κ the traps are perfect absorbers and thus the interface condition is of the dirichlet kind with m 0 on the other hand in the reaction controlled regime the characteristic time associated with surface reaction is large compared with the diffusion time to the pore trap interface for vanishing surface reaction κ 0 the traps are perfect reflectors and hence the interface condition is of the neumann kind with m n 0 the solution of 33 and 34 can be expressed as an expansion in orthonormal functions torquato and avellaneda 1991 the diffusion relaxation times tn are inversely related to the eigenvalues λn by t n 1 d λ n the survival probability s t which gives the fraction of brownian particles that survive until time t is a monotonically decreasing function of time that is explicitly known to be an infinite sum involving the entire spectrum of relaxation times torquato and avellaneda 1991 the long time behavior of the survival probability s t is determined by the largest or principal relaxation time t 1 which in turn is intimately linked to pore size fluctuations using homogenization theory rubinstein and torquato 1988 it was shown that the mean survival time τ which is defined by 35 τ u ϕ 1 d where u is the scaled magnetization density satisfying the steady state diffusion equation 36 u 1 in v 1 37 u n κ u 0 on v the mean survival time gives the average time for a brownian particle to survive before it gets trapped and interestingly can also be obtained from nmr relaxation since it is the area under the survival time curve torquato and avellaneda 1991 i e 38 τ 0 s t d t the times τ and t 1 are intimately linked to characteristic length scales of the pore region as in the case of the formation factor f they account for the entire pore space whether topologically connected or not whereas the mean survival time τ is determined by the average pore size the principal largest relaxation time t 1 is governed by diffusion occurring in the largest pores in the system torquato and avellaneda 1991 have shown that the mean survival time τ is bounded from above and below in terms of the principal relaxation t 1 for example the upper bound on τ is given by 39 τ t 1 3 3 fluid permeability homogenization theory was applied to show that the isotropic fluid permeability k arising in darcy s law of a random porous medium can be expressed as the ensemble average of a scaled velocity field rubinstein and torquato 1989 specifically the permeability is given by 40 k w e where w is scaled vector velocity field that satisfies 41 w π e in v 1 42 w 0 in v 1 43 w 0 on v π is a scaled pressure field and e is a unit vector in the direction of the applied pressure gradient now consider the unsteady stokes equations for the fluid velocity vector field v r t at position r and time t in v 1 44 v t p ρ ν v v 0 e δ t in v 1 45 v 0 in v 1 46 v 0 on v here p r t is the pressure ρ is the constant fluid density ν is the kinematic viscosity v 0 is a constant and e is an arbitrary unit vector avellaneda and torquato 1991 used the solutions of 44 46 which can be expressed as a sum of normal modes to derive the first rigorous relation connecting the fluid permeability k to the formation factor of the porous medium and a length scale l that is determined by the eigenvalues of the stokes operator specifically the fluid permeability is exactly given by 47 k l 2 f where l is a certain weighted sum over the viscous relaxation timesθ n associated with the time dependent stokes equations i e inversely proportional to the eigenvalues of the stokes operator the reader should note that the length scale l appearing in 47 absorbs a factor of 8 compared to the definition l given in ref avellaneda and torquato 1991 specifically l l 8 avellaneda and torquato 1991 also showed how to explicitly relate the spectrum θ n to the dynamic fluid permeability k ω where ω is the frequency associated with an imposed oscillatory pressure gradient 4 microstructure dependent effective property estimates 4 1 formation factor rigorous upper and lower bounds have been derived on the effective conductivity σe of two phase media that incorporate various n point correlation functions see refs milton 2002 and torquato 2002a and references therein in the special case of a conducting fluid of phase conductivity σ 1 and a perfectly insulating solid phase σ 2 0 one can trivially extract the formation factor f defined by 32 for example a tight lower bound on f for any such 3d porous medium that accounts for up to four point correlation function information can be obtained from ref torquato 1985 48 f 1 1 2 γ 2 ζ 2 1 2 ζ 2 1 2 1 2 ζ 2 1 4 γ 2 ζ 2 ϕ 2 1 1 2 γ 2 ζ 2 1 2 ζ 2 1 1 2 ζ 2 1 2 γ 2 ζ 2 ϕ 2 where the three point microstructural parameter ζ 2 is a certain weighted integral that involves the correlation functions s 1 2 s 2 2 and s 3 2 of phase 2 cf 2 and the four point microstructural parameter γ 2 is a certain weighted integral that involves the correlation functions s 1 2 s 2 2 s 3 2 and s 4 2 the reader is referred to ref torquato 1985 for detailed discussions of these parameters the corresponding upper bound on f diverges to infinity because it corresponds to microstructures in which the pore space is fully topologically disconnected for a wide class of ordered and disordered packings in which the particles form phase 2 theoretical arguments were presented to show that the four point parameter is equal to zero to a very good approximation this conclusion together with 48 led to the following approximation for such media in terms of the three point parameter ζ 2 0 1 49 f 2 ϕ 2 ϕ 1 ζ 2 ϕ 1 2 ζ 2 the high predictive power of this approximation and its more general counterpart that applies to the effective conductivity σe for any phase contrast ratio σ 2 σ 1 torquato 1985 has been validated by computer simulations of the effective conductivity of a variety of ordered and disordered dispersions of spheres in a matrix torquato 1985 kim and torquato 1991 robinson and friedman 2005 gillman and matouš 2014 gillman et al 2015 nguyen et al 2016 note that when ζ 2 0 relation 49 reduces to the optimal hashin shtrikman lower bound on f given the volume fraction and two point correlation function information hashin and shtrikman 1962 torquato 2002a the hashin shtrikman upper and lower bounds on the effective conductivity for arbitrary phase contrast ratios σ 2 σ 1 are optimal because their effective conductivities are exactly realized by certain multiscale dispersions including the coated spheres model in three dimensions and the coated cylinders model in two dimensions which is depicted in fig 4 such two phase media consist of composite spheres each of which is composed of a spherical core of one phase dispersed phase that is surrounded by a concentric spherical shell of the other phase such that the fraction of space occupied by the dispersed phase is equal to its overall phase volume fraction the composite spheres fill all space implying that their sizes range down to the infinitesimally small interestingly it has recently been proved that these highly degenerate optimal hashin shtrikman multiscale dispersions are hyperuniform kim and torquato 2019b 2019a which apparently is an important structural attribute to attain optimal effective conductivities and elastic properties hashin and shtrikman 1963 4 2 nmr time scales the mean survival time τ for a general porous medium with porosity ϕ 1 1 ϕ 2 is rigorously bounded from below according to torquato and avellaneda 1991 50 τ δ 2 d ϕ 1 κ s where δ is the mean pore size defined by 25 and s is the specific surface in the diffusion controlled limit in which κ d this lower bound reduces to one first derived by prager 1963 the mean survival time is bounded from above by the following weighted integral of the autocovariance function torquato and rubinstein 1989 51 d τ 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 2 ℓ p 2 where 52 ℓ p 2 0 χ v r r d r the inequality 51 has been referred as the two point void upper bound on τ torquato and rubinstein 1989 the two point void bound has been generalized to treat two dimensional media as well as dimensions higher than three torquato 2002a it has been shown that for the hyperuniform coated spheres model for d 3 and coated cylinders model for d 2 discussed in section 4 1 and depicted in fig 4 realize the corresponding two point void upper bound and hence maximize the mean survival times among all microstructures that share the same porosities ϕ 1 and and pore length scales ℓ p torquato and pham 2004 for general porous media the two point interfacial surface bound on the mean survival time doi 1976 rubinstein and torquato 1988 provides an even tighter upper bound on τ which is briefly described in the appendix including its new fourier representation rigorous lower bounds on the principal relaxation time t 1 have been derived for any value of the surface rate constant κ in the diffusion controlled regime asymptotic analysis of this lower bound yields 53 t 1 δ 2 d 3 ϕ 1 δ 2 4 κ s δ 2 where δ 2 is the second moment of the pore size function defined by 26 note that in the diffusion controlled limit this inequality reduces to the result due to prager 1963 4 3 fluid permeability 4 3 1 rigorous bounds the two point void upper bound on the fluid permeability of a general porous medium with porosity ϕ 1 1 ϕ 2 is given by 54 k 2 3 ϕ 2 2 ℓ p 2 where ℓ p is exactly the same length scale 52 that arises in the analogous two point void bound 51 on the mean survival time τ the two point void bound 54 was originally derived by prager 1961 with an incorrect constant prefactor this prefactor was subsequently corrected by berryman and milton 1985 and rubinstein and torquato 1989 using different variational approaches the two point void bound 54 on the fluid permeability has been generalized to treat two dimensional media as well as dimensions higher than three torquato 2002a it is noteworthy that for the hyperuniform coated cylinders model in two dimensions see fig 4 the two point void upper bound maximizes the permeability among all microstructures that share the same porosity ϕ 1 and pore length scale ℓ p torquato and pham 2004 for general porous media the two point interfacial surface bound on the fluid permeability doi 1976 rubinstein and torquato 1988 provides an even tighter upper bound on k which is briefly described in the appendix including its new fourier representation 4 3 2 rigorous cross property relations torquato 1990 derived the first rigorous relation connecting the fluid permeability tensor to an effective diffusion parameter namely the mean survival time τ associated with steady state diffusion of reactants in the fluid region of a porous medium containing perfectly absorbing pore walls i e infinite surface rate constant κ see section 3 2 this takes the form of an inequality and its scalar version valid for arbitrary isotropic media bounds the fluid permeability k from above in terms of τ is given by 55 k d τ ϕ 1 where d is the diffusion coefficient and ϕ 1 is the porosity the upper bound 55 becomes an equality for transport interior to parallel tubes of arbitrary cross section in the direction of the tubes this cross property bound is relatively tight for flow around dilute arrays of obstacles but not for a high concentration of obstacles the latter instance highlights the fact that the mean survival time τ cannot distinguish between pore channels involving significant momentum transport from those involving little or no momentum transport moreover for any disconnected pore space k is zero while τ is nonzero note that in the more general case of partially reflecting pore walls κ τ κ τ τ and hence one has the generally weaker inequality 56 k d τ κ ϕ 1 using the characteristics of the stokes operator avellaneda and torquato 1991 derived sharper cross property bounds relating the permeability to viscous and diffusion time scales as well as the formation factor specifically they proved that 57 k ν θ 1 f where ν is the kinematic viscosity and θ1 is the principal largest viscous relaxation time as discussed in section 3 3 they showed that since νθ1 dt 1 where t 1 is the principal largest diffusion relaxation time see section 3 2 the previous bound leads to the following somewhat weaker bound for arbitrary κ 58 k d t 1 f it immediately follows from 47 and 58 that exact length scale l is bounded from above in terms of t 1 according to 59 l 2 d t 1 as noted earlier t 1 can be obtained from nmr experiments thus via inequality 58 the permeability is related to purely diffusional transport parameters i e t 1 and f which can be readily measured it has been shown that 58 provides relatively accurate estimates of the permeability of versatile grain consolidation models torquato and kim 1992 since t 1 is closely related to the second moment of the pore size function see 53 the accuracy of the estimate 58 highlights the importance of the second moment δ 2 of the pore size probability density function in determining the square of the exact length scale l and hence the fluid permeability of certain porous media as will be elaborated below 5 model microstructures and their structural characteristics we study and characterize a variety of different models of hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform porous media ordered and disordered packings of spheres overlapping spheres and debye random media of particular interest is the spectral density χ v k and pore size probability function f δ for these models in most of the cases these statistical descriptors can be obtained as closed form analytical expressions 5 1 nonhyperuniform disordered models we study three different nonhyperuniform disordered model microstructures equilibrium packings overlapping spheres and debye random media 5 1 1 equilibrium packings equilibrium gibbs ensembles of identical hard spheres of radius a hansen and mcdonald 1986 and torquato 2018b are examined in particular we consider such disordered packings along the stable disordered fluid branch in the phase diagram torquato 2002a 2018b all such states are nonhyperuniform 5 1 2 overlapping spheres systems of particles whose centroids are uncorrelated poisson distributed that can fully overlap are useful models of heterogeneous media weissberg 1963 torquato 2002a here we focus on the case in which the particles are identical spheres of radius a at number density ρ which we henceforth refer to as overlapping spheres it is well known that the autocovariance function of identical overlapping spheres in three dimensions is given by weissberg 1963 and torquato 2002a 60 χ v r exp η 1 3 r 4 a r 3 16 a 3 exp 2 η for r 2a and zero otherwise where η ρ 4 π a 3 3 ln ϕ 1 is a reduced density and its specific surface is 61 s 3 ϕ 1 η a it is noteworthy that the particle phase percolates for 0 29 ϕ 2 1 rintoul and torquato 1997 while the pore phase percolates for 0 ϕ 2 0 97 elam et al 1984 rintoul 2000 thus the overlapping spheres model is bicontinuous both phases simultaneously percolate for 0 29 ϕ 2 0 97 5 1 3 debye random media debye et al debye et al 1957 hypothesized that the following autocovariance function characterizes isotropic random media in which the phases form domains of random shape and size 62 χ v r ϕ 1 ϕ 2 exp r a where a is a characteristic length scale however many years passed since the publication of this work before it was shown that such autocovariances are actually realizable by two phase media in two dimensions it was shown that debye random media are realizable stoyan et al 1995 yeong and torquato 1998a theoretical analyses indicate that such media are realizable in three and higher dimensions jiao et al 2007 but no such explicit constructions have heretofore been identified motivated by the implications of our analysis of rigorous permeability estimates in the present work we provide a 3d realization of a debye random medium see section 6 3 the taylor expansion of 62 about r 0 and comparison to 6 reveals that the specific surface s of a debye random medium in any space dimension is given by 63 s ϕ 1 ϕ 2 β d a for d 3 our main interest in this paper this formula yields 64 s 4 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 a 5 2 hyperuniform model microstructures we also consider hyperuniform packings of identical spheres of radius a with packing fraction ϕ 2 including ordered and disordered varieties 5 2 1 lattice packings we study nonoverlapping spheres arranged on the sites of simple cubic sc face centered cubic fcc and body centered cubic bcc lattices ashcroft and mermin 1976 chaikin and lubensky 1995 conway and sloane 1998 such ordered packings which are necessarily hyperuniform and stealthy torquato and stillinger 2003 torquato et al 2015 such idealized packing models are useful since their transport properties can be determined exactly in principle subsequently we show that the bcc lattice which is known to be optimal for various problems that arise in many body physics torquato and stillinger 2003 and discrete geometry conway and sloane 1998 torquato 2010 has a special status in the case of fluid permeability when the sites of the bcc lattice are decorated with identical nonoverlapping spheres for example the bcc lattice is believed to be the point configuration that minimizes a certain measure of large scale density fluctuations torquato and stillinger 2003 moreover the bcc lattice provides the best known covering in three dimensional space r 3 conway and sloane 1998 torquato 2010 the covering problem asks for the point configuration in d dimensional euclidean space r d that minimizes the radius of overlapping spheres circumscribed around each of the points required to cover r d finally the bcc lattice also provides the best known quantizer in r 3 conway and sloane 1998 torquato 2010 klatt et al 2019 the quantizer problem is concerned with finding the point configuration in r d that minimizes a distance error associated with a randomly placed point and the nearest point of the point process it is noteworthy for what follows that the quantizer and covering optimization problems have been reformulated as certain ground state problems involving the void exclusion probability ev r torquato 2010 which was defined in section 2 3 for example the quantizer problem minimizes the first moment of ev r or equivalently the second moment of the associated nearest neighbor probability function hv r cf 28 since the first moment of ev r is directly connected to the second moment δ 2 of the pore size probability function 26 for a packing then it is expected that δ 2 among packings of identical spheres at the same packing fraction is minimized by the bcc packing all of these results suggest that the size of the largest probe sphere that can traverse the pore space of a packing in the infinite volume limit at packing fraction ϕ 2 is given by the bcc packing for 0 ϕ 2 ϕ max b c c where ϕ max b c c 3 π 8 0 68017 is the maximum packing fraction for the bcc lattice consistent with the nonoverlap constraint note that the corresponding maximum packing fractions for sc and fcc lattices are ϕ max s c π 6 0 52359 and ϕ max f c c π 18 0 74048 respectively conway and sloane 1998 5 2 2 disordered packings we consider two different disordered hyperuniform packing models the first is a maximally random jammed mrj packing which can be regarded to be the most random packing subject to strict jamming constraint torquato et al 2000 torquato 2018b this jamming condition implies that each sphere is in contact with its nearest neighbors such that there can be no collective particle motions that lead to unjamming and they are stable against both uniform compression and shear deformations we also study stealthy packings which are disordered and hyperuniform and hence have spectral densities that satisfy the condition 17 where k is the exclusion sphere radius in fourier reciprocal space such packings have been created by decorating stealthy point configurations generated via the so called collective coordinate optimization technique uche et al 2004 batten et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 by spheres of radius a such that spheres cannot overlap zhang et al 2016b disordered stealthy point configurations generated by this optimization procedure are actually classical ground states of systems of particles interacting with bounded long ranged pair potentials the control parameter is the exclusion sphere radius k when k is sufficiently small compared to the number of degrees of freedom the ground states are disordered stealthy and highly degenerate however when k reaches a certain critical value there is a phase transition to ordered ground states it is noteworthy that at the highest value of k in three dimensions the ground state is uniquely the bcc lattice torquato et al 2015 it is also remarkable that among all hyperuniform point configurations in three dimensions the bcc lattice is believed to be the one that minimizes large scale density fluctuations torquato and stillinger 2003 zachary and torquato 2009 we will see that these properties of the bcc lattice impart singular fluid permeability properties to bcc packings 5 3 corresponding spectral densities and pore size statistics we note that for any periodic point configuration of n points within a fundamental cell of volume vf in three dimensions the angular averaged structure factor can be expressed as follows torquato 2018a 65 s k 8 π 3 v f j 1 z j 4 π k 2 δ k q j where zj is the number of points in reciprocal space at the bragg peak wavenumber qj and δ r is the radial dirac delta function the quantities zj and qj are encoded in the theta series for the lattice conway and sloane 1998 eq 65 together with 19 yields the corresponding analytical expression for the spectral density of general crystal packing of identical spheres of radius a 66 χ v k 3 π ϕ 2 2 a 3 v f m 2 k a j 1 z j k 2 δ k q j this expression clearly reveals that lattice packings are stealthy cf 17 and hyperuniform since the envelope of m 2 k a is a rapidly decaying function of k the weights of the delta functions decrease as k increases as shown in fig 5 for the case of the simple cubic lattice with ϕ 2 1 2 the spectral density for hyperuniform mrj sphere packings at ϕ 2 0 636 determined from large scale computer simulations klatt and torquato 2016 as well as for a stealthy packing at ϕ 2 0 1 are also shown in fig 5 the latter is obtained using theoretically derived approximation formulas for the structure factor for stealthy point configurations torquato et al 2015 expression 19 and the numerically determined radii provided in ref zhang et al 2016b in fig 6 we compare the spectral densities for the aforementioned three nonhyperuniform models each at ϕ 2 0 4 the spectral density for debye random media in any space dimension is given by 67 χ v k ϕ 1 ϕ 2 c d a d 1 k a 2 d 1 2 where c d 2 d π d 1 2 γ d 1 2 the spectral density χ v k for overlapping spheres is straightforwardly obtained by taking the fourier transform of 60 for equilibrium hard spheres the spectral density at packing fraction ϕ 2 is obtained from eq 19 and the percus yevick approximation torquato and stell 1985 torquato 2002a the exact pore size probability function f δ for each of the three lattice packings is easily obtained from exact results for the exclusion probability ev r torquato 2010 and then applying the mapping 27 since a test sphere of radius δc and larger cannot be inserted in a lattice packing f δ has compact support i e f δ 0 for δ δc the pore size function f δ for the mrj packing has been determined from large scale computer simulations in refs donev et al 2005 and klatt and torquato 2016 from recent theoretical and computer simulation studies of the exclusion probability of stealthy systems torquato et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a we can extract the pore size function f δ for disordered stealthy packings it follows that since disordered stealthy point configurations have the property that ev r has compact support zhang et al 2017 ghosh and lebowitz 2018 an unusual behavior for a disordered system the pore size function f δ of a disordered stealth packing of identical spheres will also have compact support using accurate formulas for the exclusion probability ev r torquato et al 1990 the pore size function f δ has been determined for equilibrium hard spheres torquato 2002a using 27 in three dimensions the pore size probability for overlapping spheres is exactly given by torquato 2002a 68 f δ 1 ϕ 1 exp η 1 δ a 3 note that 68 has infinite support which implies that the pore space possesses arbitrarily large holes in the infinite volume limit this characteristic of nonhyperuniform overlapping spheres applies as well to nonhyperuniform equilibrium packings torquato 2002a which has important implications for nmr time scales as described in the next section this is due to the fact the pore size function f δ in each of these nonhyperuniform models has infinite support it is noteworthy that the pore size functions of debye random media have yet to be determined it is useful to compare the pore size function of stealthy hyperuniform packings to those of hyperuniform bcc packings and nonhyperuniform overlapping spheres fig 7 provides such a comparison of f δ on a log scale at ϕ 2 not surprisingly the two stealthy cases exhibit similar behaviors i e f δ dropping precipitously as δ approaches its maximum values which is in stark contrast to the very gradual drop of f δ with δ for the overlapping spheres case 6 estimates of effective properties for hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform models 6 1 formation factor in fig 8 we compare the formation factor f as a function of ϕ 2 for two hyperuniform systems bcc and stealthy packings and two nonhyperuniform systems equilibrium hard sphere packings and overlapping spheres such a comparison has heretofore not been presented we also include the hashin shtrikman lower bound to see how close these formation factors are to being extremal data for the bcc and stealthy packings are taken from numerical studies of the effective conductivity from refs mckenzie et al 1978 and zhang et al 2016b respectively the formation factor for equilibrium hard sphere packings was determined from a highly accurate microstructure dependent approximation formula 49 torquato 1985 as well as computer simulation data kim and torquato 1991 for the effective conductivity note that the formation factors for the stealthy packings are effectively optimal i e they are the same as the hashin shtrikman lower bound zhang et al 2016b to three significant figures and hence cannot be distinguished from one another on the scale of this figure not surprisingly formation factors for overlapping spheres deviate the most from the optimal lower bound and increasingly so as ϕ 2 increases 6 2 nmr time scales now we consider results for nmr time scales in the pure diffusion controlled limit i e infinite surface reaction κ implying perfect absorption at the trap pore interface recently the mean survival time τ and principal relaxation time t 1 have been computed for stealthy packings in which the particles are perfect absorbers zhang et al 2016b in the present work we compare them for the first time to earlier corresponding results for bcc packings from a computer simulation study of torquato and kim 1992 for brevity it suffices here to report such a comparison for t 1 see refs zhang et al 2016b and torquato and stillinger 2002 for results for the means survival time fig 9 shows a comparison of the principal relaxation time t 1 of a stealthy packing at ϕ 2 0 2 to the corresponding result for a bcc packing this figure also includes bcc results for other packing fractions it is seen that the stealthy packing has a principal relaxation time that is very nearly equal to that of the bcc packing at ϕ 2 0 2 this is expected since both systems are not only hyperuniform but stealthy and hence are characterized by appreciably diminished pore size fluctuations as noted in section 5 3 in vivid contrast to these results is the fact that t 1 for both nonhyperuniform overlapping spheres and nonhyperuniform equilibrium packings become unbounded in the infinite volume limit torquato 1990 since the pore space possesses arbitrarily large holes in this limit as discussed in section 5 3 6 3 fluid permeability 6 3 1 two point void bound we utilize the two point void bound 54 to infer how the permeabilities of hyperuniform porous media perform relative to those of nonhyperuniform ones however it may be difficult to evaluate numerically the integral in the direct space formula 52 for the length scale ℓ p since the integrand of 52 can be both positive and negative due positive and negative correlations that would be reflected in χ v r it becomes especially nontrivial to compute if χ v r slowly converges as in the case of many hyperuniform media where one must not only estimate χ v r precisely but rely on a complex extrapolation technique known as α convergence torquato and stillinger 2003 klatt and torquato 2018 see also the appendix for additional details since it is crucial to capture accurately the long range structural behavior of hyperuniform media i e the tail of the autocovariance function χ v r we derive here an alternative fourier representation of the relevant length scale ℓ p cf 52 that arises in the bound 54 first we recall parseval s theorem for direct space functions f r and g r with well defined corresponding fourier transforms f k and g k in three dimensional euclidean space 69 r 3 f r g r d r 1 2 π 3 r 3 f k g k d k now we let f r 1 4 π r and g r χ v r and recognize that the fourier transform of f r exists in the sense of distributions i e f k k 2 thus we find the alternative fourier form of the length scale 70 ℓ p 2 1 2 π 2 0 χ v k d k the analogous fourier representation of the interfacial surface upper bound on k is provided in the appendix formula 70 has great advantages over the direct space representation 52 first the integrand of 70 is always nonnegative and hence not subject to the aforementioned to the precision issues in evaluating 52 where the medium is hyperuniform or not another advantage of the fourier representation 70 occurs when the autocovariance function χ v r oscillates and slowly decays to zero such as in crystal periodic packings for a crystal packing of identical spheres of radius a combination of 19 65 and 70 leads to the following expression for the length scale ℓ p 71 ℓ p 2 ϕ 2 v f v 1 a j 1 z j q j 2 m 2 q j a moreover we see that truncation of the infinite series bounds the exact result from below since each term in the series 71 is positive in summary the new formula 70 conveniently captures the long range correlations without a complex extrapolation required to compute 52 accurately and hence more precise estimates can be obtained with greater ease it is quite versatile and easily applied to other models including polydisperse sphere packings for example we employ the spectral densities of various packings of identical spheres of radius a described in section 5 3 to compute the corresponding void bound on k using formula 70 for ℓ p specifically the void bound is calculated for the hyperuniform sc fcc and bcc lattice packings disordered stealthy packings and mrj packing as well as nonhyperuniform equilibrium packings at selected values of the packing fraction ϕ 2 these results are tabulated in table 1 where the fluid permeability is scaled by a 2 the natural choice for nonoverlapping spheres of radius a importantly while the void bound is not very tight it does provide the proper ranking for the lattice packings for which we know the permeabilities accurately sangani and acrivos 1982 namely at fixed ϕ 2 a sc packing has slightly higher value of k than a fcc packing which in turn is slightly higher than the permeability of a bcc packing we see that the stealthy hyperuniform packings have permeabilities that are slightly greater those of the sc packing but much smaller than the corresponding values for the nonhyperuniform equilibrium packing note also the permeability of the hyperuniform mrj packing at ϕ 2 0 636 which is in very good agreement with the numerical result reported in ref klatt and torquato 2018 using the direct space formula 52 is not appreciably larger than the corresponding values for the fcc and bcc packings at this packing fraction generally speaking relative to nonhyperuniform porous media hyperuniform ones are expected to have velocity fields that are more uniform throughout the pore space indeed a recent microfluidics study in two dimensions confirms this conclusion ding et al 2018 moreover stealthy hyperuniform packings which include all of the lattice packings and disordered ones cannot tolerate large holes for transport and hence in each of these cases the velocity field over the pore space is highly delocalized and the entire pore space is more uniformly dynamically connected thus one expects the fluid permeability to be lower in all of the stealthy cases relative to the nonhyperuniform equlibrium instances in which the velocity field is more localized over the pore space due greater variability in the geometry of the pore channels the degree of delocalization of the velocity field in the case of hyperuniform porous media can be rigorously quantified by appealing to the generalization of the hyperuniformity concept to vector fields torquato 2016b to get a visual sense of the distinctions between the pore space in hyperuniform versus nonhyperuniform porous media we dilate the solid phase region radially in equilibrium mrj and disordered stealthy packings so that the resulting pore space has a porosity of 1 it is important to recall that while the mrj packing is hyperuniform it is not stealthy the initial packing fractions are ϕ 2 0 25 ϕ 2 0 2 and ϕ 2 0 636 for the equilibrium mrj and stealthy disordered packings respectively the resulting pore spaces are depicted in fig 10 the large variability in the size and shapes of the resultant pore regions in the nonhyperuniform equilibrium case relative to those in the hyperuniform instances is readily apparent moreover the spatial distribution of the mrj pore regions are less uniform than those of the disordered stealthy packing we also compute the two point void bound for overlapping spheres and debye random media each of which depart appreciably from hyperuniformity in order to compare these two distinctly different models we utilize the square of the specific surface s 2 to scale the fluid permeability these results are tabulated in table 2 it is noteworthy that the upper bound on the scaled permeability for debye random media is generally substantially larger than that for overlapping spheres at the same value of ϕ 2 this strongly suggests that debye random media are characterized by substantially larger pores larger flow channels than those in the overlapping sphere model indeed this is quantitatively corroborated by the fact that the autocovariance function of debye random media has infinite support cf 62 while that of overlapping spheres has compact support cf 60 as noted in section 5 3 the actual pore size function 68 of overlapping spheres has infinite support the pore space possesses arbitrarily large holes in the infinite volume limit to verify whether this conclusion about the pore statistics of debye random media can be inferred from the void bound we have applied the yeong and torquato 1998a stochastic optimization construction technique to generate a digitized 3d debye random medium with ϕ 2 1 2 in a cube under periodic boundary conditions in order to visualize it such a digitized realization in which the two phases are statistically identical is shown in fig 11 we also directly generated a corresponding digitized realization of overlapping spheres by randomly placing spheres in a cubic box under periodic boundary conditions at the same porosity specific surface s and resolution it is clear that each phase in the debye random medium is characterized by large clusters and pore sizes that are appreciably larger than those of its overlapping sphere counterpart this speaks to the utility of the two point void bound to infer nontrivial microstructural information about the porous medium 6 3 2 new estimate of the fluid permeability while the two point void bound 54 is able to capture the proper trends of how the permeability changes as the microstructures varies it is not capable of providing sharp estimates of k let us assume there exists a class of porous media in which the inequality 53 on t 1 in the diffusion controlled limit and the inequality 59 on l 2 can be treated as equalities then using the exact result 47 we obtain the following approximation for the fluid permeability 72 k δ 2 f which implies that the exact length scale l that appears in the exact relation 47 for the permeability is given by 73 l 2 δ 2 to test the validity of formula 72 we compare in fig 12 numerical data for the fluid permeability of bcc packings obtained by sangani and acrivos 1982 to the approximation formula 72 we see that formula 72 provides an excellent approximation of the simulation data of the fluid permeability thus formula 72 should provide relatively accurate predictions of the permeability for microstructures in which the pore space is well connected including equilibrium packings mrj packings and lattice packings in which the spheres are not necessarily monodisperse we compare the predictions of formula 72 for stealthy equilibrium and bcc packings in fig 13 formula 72 for equilibrium sphere packings was computed using previous results for the effective conductivity torquato 1985 kim and torquato 1991 and δ 2 torquato and avellaneda 1991 note that the permeability estimates for stealthy packings are substantially closer to those for the bcc packings which is fully consistent with inferences we drew from the behavior of the void bound 7 conclusions and discussion we have investigated and applied rigorous microstructure property relations to estimate effective transport characteristics of hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform models of fluid saturated porous media including the formation factor f mean survival time τ principal nmr diffusion relaxation time t 1 principal viscous relaxation time θ1 and fluid permeability k among other results we derived a fourier representation of the classic two point upper bound on the fluid permeability that depends on the spectral density to infer how the permeabilities of hyperuniform porous media perform relative to those of nonhyperuniform ones we found that the velocity fields in nonhyperuniform porous media are generally much more localized over the pore space compared to those in their hyperuniform counterparts in which the velocity fields are more uniform throughout the pore space the fluid permeability is expected to be lower in all of the stealthy hyperuniform cases relative to the nonhyperuniform equlibrium instances due to their greater variability in the geometry of the pore channels our analysis of the void bounds on the permeability for the sc fcc and bcc lattice packings provides the first quantitative explanation for why the bcc lattice packing minimizes the permeability among these crystal structures at fixed ϕ 2 this bound also enabled us to correctly infer that nonhyperuniform debye random media should be characterized by substantially large pore regions which was verified by constructing a realization of such a porous medium rigorous bounds on individual effective properties as well as cross property relations suggested a new approximate formula 72 for the permeability given in terms of the formation factor f and the second moment δ 2 of the pore size probability density the latter of which can be easily extracted from 3d digitized images of real porous media coker et al 1996 formula 72 provides reasonably accurate permeability predictions of the class of hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform porous media in which the pore space is well connected the permeability estimates for disordered stealthy hyperuniform packings were shown to be substantially closer to those for the bcc packings which is fully consistent with inferences we drew from the behavior of the void bound these comparative studies have shed new light on the microstructural characteristics that determine the transport properties of general porous media an outstanding problem for future research is the direct stokes flow simulations of models of disordered hyperuniform porous media to determine their fluid permeabilities part of such a program could include the creation of disordered hyperuniform pore network models of porous media at arbitrary porosities and the computation of their transport properties another interesting problem for future research is the determination of the pore size functions of debye random media since there is a degeneracy of microstructures with an autocovariance function specified by 62 but with different higher order statistics the pore size function of debye random media will depend on the stochastic rules to construct them we note that our findings also have implications for the design of disordered hyperuniform porous materials with desirable transport properties specifically such 3d porous media can be fabricated using 3d additive manufacturing techniques kim and torquato 2019b we close this section with simple observations about an outstanding optimization problem posed by jung and torquato jung and torquato 2005 in the light of the hyperuniformity concept they asked what microstructure s under periodic boundary conditions in a cubic fundamental unit cell of unit side length maximizes the isotropic fluid permeability k at some porosity they focused on the case ϕ 1 1 2 and computed the permeabilities of a variety of different candidate structures including triply periodic minimal surfaces due to their optimality for other physical properties torquato et al 2002 torquato and donev 2004 they conjectured that the triply periodic two phase bicontinuous porous medium with an interface that is the schwartz primitive p minimal surface see fig 14 maximizes the isotropic fluid permeability this surmise follows from another conjecture that they put forth and supported by calculations torquato et al 2002 and analysis jung et al 2007 namely the schwartz p structure has the minimal specific surface under the aforementioned constraints this is still a fascinating open question and is a type of isoperimetric problem in the same spirit as kelvin s famous conjecture about foams weaire and phelan 1994 finally we observe that the conjectured extremal schwartz p structure for the fluid permeability is stealthy and

surface correlation functions such as the surface surface correlation function fss r and surface void correlation function fsv r torquato 2002a are crucial in determining transport properties of porous media when the interface plays a major role such as the mean survival time and fluid permeability doi 1976 rubinstein and torquato 1988 1989 until recently the difficulty of sampling surface correlation functions of porous media has been a stumbling block in their widespread use it has recently been shown that one can reduce the computational complexity of brute force sampling without

analogously to the void bound the direct space formula a 2 is numerically very challenging klatt and torquato 2018 addressed these challenges to compute the interfacial surface bound for disordered monodisperse sphere packings including equilibrium and mrj packings by deriving the corresponding analytic formulas for finite samples however as in the case of the void bound it is substantially easier numerically to employ a fourier based formula especially for hyperuniform media to derive the fourier representation of the length scale ℓ s we first define the relevant autocovariance

488,this paper is concerned with the estimation of the effective transport characteristics of fluid saturated porous media via rigorous microstructure property relations we are particularly interested in predicting the formation factor f mean survival time τ principal nmr diffusion relaxation time t 1 principal viscous relaxation time θ1 and fluid permeability k to do so we employ rigorous methods to estimate the fluid permeability and these other transport properties of hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform models of porous media from microstructural information disordered hyperuniform materials are exotic amorphous states of matter that have attracted great attention in the physical mathematical and biological science but little is known about their fluid transport characteristics in carrying out this investigation we not only draw from ideas and results of the emerging field of hyperuniformity but from homogenization theory statistical geometry differential equations spectrum of laplace and stokes operators and the covering and quantizer problems of discrete geometry among other results we derive a fourier representation of a classic rigorous upper bound on the fluid permeability that depends on the spectral density to infer how the permeabilities of hyperuniform porous media perform relative to those of nonhyperuniform ones we find that the velocity fields in nonhyperuniform porous media are generally much more localized over the pore space compared to those in their hyperuniform counterparts which has implications for their permeabilities rigorous bounds on transport properties suggest a new approximate formula for the fluid permeability that provides reasonably accurate permeability predictions of a certain class of hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform porous media these comparative studies shed new light on the microstructural characteristics that determine the transport properties of general porous media our findings also have implications for the design of porous materials with desirable transport properties 1 introduction the physical properties of fluid saturated porous media are fundamentally controlled by the underlying complex microstructures of these heterogeneous media across length scales knowledge of their transport properties is of central importance in hydrology petroleum engineering and reservoir engineering todd and mays 2004 øren et al 2002 dandekar 2013 while these physical properties can be ascertained experimentally by retrieving physical samples and testing them in the laboratory such methods can be tedious and often do not yield insights about the microstructures this emphasizes the need for sophisticated mathematical and computational tools that are capable of modeling the complex microstructures and their physical properties such methods have been developed over the last several decades this includes homogenization and averaging methods to estimate the effective transport properties quintard and whitaker 1994a 1994b milton 2002 torquato 2002b sahimi 2003 moreover x ray microtomographic techniques which provide three dimensional 3d digitized images of porous media at the pore scale in a nondestructive manner kinney and nichols 1992 coker et al 1996 blunt et al 2013 have been combined with computational reconstruction techniques yeong and torquato 1998a 1998b jiao et al 2009 tahmasebi and sahimi 2013 tahmasebi 2018 to produce a wide class of realistic microstructures at will subsequently such computer generated microstructures can be structurally characterized and their physical properties can be estimated via computer simulations sahimi 2003 wood et al bijeljic and blunt 2006 blunt et al 2013 vasseur and wadsworth 2017 aramideh et al 2018 the effective transport electromagnetic and mechanical properties of porous and other heterogeneous media generally require information about an infinite set of correlation functions brown 1955 beran 1965 milton 1987 sen and torquato 1989 torquato 1997 milton 2002 torquato 2002a since such complete information is almost never available in practice for general microstructures theoretical estimates of the effective properties are based either on approximate methods scheidegger 1974 johnson et al 1986 thompson et al 1987 martys et al 1994 milton 2002 torquato 2002a sahimi 2003 or rigorous upper and lower bounds that account for a finite set of correlation functions beran 1965 milton 2002 torquato 2002a the bounds tighten as progressively more microstructural information is properly incorporated our focus in this paper is the use of rigorous theoretical methods to estimate the following effective transport properties of fluid saturated porous media in terms of various n point correlation functions 1 formation factor f 2 mean survival time τ 3 principal nmr diffusion relaxation time t 1 4 principal viscous relaxation time θ1 5 fluid permeability k among these physical properties which are defined more precisely in section 3 the most challenging to predict for general microstructures is the fluid permeability k which is defined by darcy s law the permeability k has dimensions of the square of length and roughly speaking may be regarded as an effective pore channel area of the dynamically connected part of the pore space torquato 2002a by dynamically connected we mean the topologically connected portion of the pore space that carries the flow which eliminates isolated pores and dead ends and connected regions with very little flow for example fig 1 gives visual sense of the dynamically connected pore space for two dimensional stokes flow through a bed of nonoverlapping disks remarkably all of the other transport properties in the list above f τ t 1 and θ1 are intimately related to the fluid permeability k as we will discuss and exploit subsequently we are particularly interested in hyperuniform porous media a hyperuniform state of matter is characterized by an anomalous suppression of density or volume fraction fluctuations at infinitely long wavelengths relative to those in typical disordered systems such as liquids and structural glasses torquato and stillinger 2003 zachary and torquato 2009 torquato 2018a hyperuniform states include all perfect crystals many quasicrystals as well as special disordered systems disordered hyperuniform materials are exotic amorphous states of matter that are like crystals in the manner in which their large scale density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed and yet behave like liquids or glasses in that they are statistically isotropic without any bragg peaks they have been the subject of fundamental interest across a variety of fields including physical torquato et al 2008 batten et al 2008 hexner and levine 2015 weijs et al 2015 thien et al 2017 chen and torquato 2018 ding et al 2018 lomba et al 2018 mathematical ghosh and lebowitz 2018 brauchart et al 2019 torquato et al 2019 and biological jiao et al 2014 mayer et al 2015 sciences it is being discovered that disordered hyperuniform materials can have remarkable physical properties including cellular materials with complete isotropic photonic band gaps florescu et al 2009 man et al 2013 froufe pérez et al 2017 optimal thermal diffusive and elastic properties zhou et al 2016 chen and torquato 2018 kim and torquato 2019b dense but transparent materials leseur et al 2016 and devices for enhanced directional light extraction gorsky et al 2019 little is known about the fluid transport characteristics of disordered hyperuniform porous media one exception is a recent study that demonstrated that electrical or fluid transport through disordered hyperuniform networks is optimized in the limit that the porosity tends to zero torquato and chen 2018 a major aim of this article is to use rigorous methods to shed light on the fluid permeability and other transport properties of models of disordered hyperuniform porous media and to contrast their transport characteristics with those of nonhyperuniform disordered models in carrying out this investigation we not only draw from the ideas and results of the emerging field of hyperuniformity but from homogenization theory statistical geometry differential equations spectrum of laplace and stokes operators and the covering and quantizer problems of discrete geometry in section 2 we define relevant microstructural descriptors and hyperuniformity including how to measure hyperuniformity in section 3 we briefly review the homogenized relations that determine all of the transport properties of interest to us in this work i e f τ t 1 and θ1 and k as well as rigorous cross property relations linking k to the other transport properties in section 4 we state the microstructure dependent formulas that we will employ to estimate the various effective properties in section 5 we describe hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform porous media models that we examine and present their spectral densities and pore size probability functions in section 6 we compute the effective transport properties of a variety of different hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform models of porous media we also derive a fourier representation of the classic two point void upper bound on the fluid permeability that depends on the spectral density this new formula enables us to infer the salient microstructural features that determine the permeabilities of hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform porous media we use rigorous bounds on individual effective properties as well as cross property relations to suggest a new approximate formula for the fluid permeability that provides reasonably accurate permeability predictions of the class of hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform porous media in which the pore space is well connected in section 7 we make concluding remarks and discuss problems for future research 2 definitions of microstructural descriptors and hyperuniformity two phase heterogeneous media abound in nature and synthetic situations examples of such materials include composites and porous media biological media foams polymer blends granular media cellular solids and colloids torquato 2002a sahimi 2003 there is a panoply of different statistical descriptors of the microstructure of two phase media see ref torquato 2002a and references therein the most relevant for the purposes of this paper are the n point correlation functions and pore size distributions defined briefly below we also highlight the hyperuniformity concept that we will apply in subsequent sections 2 1 n point correlation functions a two phase random medium is a domain of space v r d that is partitioned into two disjoint regions that make up v a phase 1 region v 1 of volume fraction ϕ 1 and a phase 2 region v 2 of volume fraction ϕ 2 torquato 2002a the phase indicator function i i x ω for a given realization ω is defined as 1 i i x ω 1 x v i 0 x v i the statistical properties of each phase of the system are specified by the countably infinite set of n correlation functions s n i which are defined by torquato and stell 1982 stoyan et al 1995 and torquato 2002a 2 s n i x 1 x n j 1 n i i x j ω where angular brackets denote an ensemble average over realizations the n point correlation function s n i x 1 x n has a probabilistic interpretation it gives the probability of finding the ends of the vectors x 1 x n all in phase i for this reason s n i x 1 x n is sometimes referred to as the n point probability function if the medium is statistically homogeneous s n i x 1 x n is translationally invariant and in particular the one point correlation function is independent of position and equal to the volume fraction of phase i 3 s 1 i x ϕ i while the two point correlation function s 2 i r depends on the displacement vector r x 2 x 1 for statistically homogeneous media the two point correlation function for phase 2 is simply related to that for phase 1 via the expression s 2 2 r s 2 1 r 2 ϕ 1 1 and hence the autocovariance function is given by 4 χ v r s 2 1 r ϕ 1 2 s 2 2 r ϕ 2 2 which we see is the same for phase 1 and phase 2 at the extreme limits of its argument χ v has the following asymptotic behavior 5 χ v r 0 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 lim r χ v r 0 the latter limit applying when the medium possesses no long range order if the medium is statistically homogeneous and isotropic then the autocovariance function χ v r depends only on the magnitude of its argument r r and hence is a radial function in such instances its slope at the origin is directly related to the specific surface s interface area per unit volume specifically we have in any space dimension d the asymptotic form torquato 2002a 6 χ v r ϕ 1 ϕ 2 β d s r o r 2 where 7 β d γ d 2 2 π γ d 1 2 and γ x is the gamma function the nonnegative spectral density χ v k which can be obtained from scattering experiments debye and bueche 1949 debye et al 1957 is the fourier transform of χ v r i e 8 χ v k r d χ v r e i k r d r 0 for all k for a general statistically homogeneous two phase medium the spectral density must obey the following sum rule 9 1 2 π d r d χ v k d k χ v r 0 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 this follows immediately from the fourier representation of the autocovariance function i e 10 χ v r 1 2 π d r d χ v k e i k r d k for isotropic media the spectral density only depends on k k and as a consequence of 6 its decay in the large k limit is controlled by the exact following power law form 11 χ v k γ d s k d 1 k where 12 γ d 2 d π d 1 2 γ d 1 2 β d is a d dimensional constant and β d is given by 7 2 2 volume fraction fluctuations and hyperuniformity a hyperuniform point process in d dimensional euclidean space r d is one in which the variance associated with the number of points within a spherical observation window of radius r grows more slowly than rd i e window volume in the large r limit torquato and stillinger 2003 equivalently it is one in which the structure factor 13 s k 1 ρ h k tends to zero as the wavenumber k k tends to zero torquato and stillinger 2003 where h k is the fourier transform of the total correlation function h r g 2 r 1 and g 2 r is the standard pair correlation function typical disordered systems such as liquids and structural glasses possess local number variances that grow as the window volume that is proportional to rd all perfect crystals and many perfect quasicrystals are hyperuniform moreover there are special disordered systems that are hyperuniform they are exotic ideal states of amorphous matter have attracted great attention because they have characteristics that lie between a crystal and liquid they are like perfect crystals in the way they suppress large scale density fluctuations and yet are like liquids or glasses in that they are statistically isotropic with no bragg peaks and hence lack any conventional long range order torquato 2018a these unusual attributes can endow disordered hyperuniform systems with novel optical mechanical and transport properties torquato 2018a ding et al 2018 the hyperuniformity concept was generalized to the case of two phase heterogeneous materials zachary and torquato 2009 here the phase volume fraction fluctuates within a finite sized spherical window of radius r see fig 2 which can be characterized by the local volume fraction variance σ v 2 r which in turn can be related to the autocovariance function as follows lu and torquato 1990 14 σ v 2 r 1 v 1 r r d χ v r α r r d r where α r r is intersection volume of two identical spheres of radius r scaled by the volume of a sphere whose centers are separated by a distance r which is known analytically in any space dimension torquato and stillinger 2003 2006 the alternative fourier representation of σ v 2 r was obtained in ref zachary and torquato 2009 15 σ v 2 r 1 v 1 r 2 π d r d χ v k α k r d k where α k r 4 π d 2 γ 1 d 2 j d 2 2 k r k d is the fourier transform of α r r torquato and stillinger 2003 zachary and torquato 2009 and jν x is the bessel function of the first kind of order ν for typical disordered two phase media the variance σ v 2 r for large r goes to zero like r d lu and torquato 1990 quintanilla and torquato 1997 and hence the value of r at which the product σ v 2 r r d first effectively reaches its asymptote provides a linear measure of the representative elementary volume however for hyperuniform disordered two phase media σ v 2 r goes to zero asymptotically more rapidly than the inverse of the window volume i e faster than r d which is equivalent to the following condition on the spectral density defined in section 2 16 lim k 0 χ v k 0 stealthy hyperuniform two phase media are a subclass of hyperuniform systems in which χ v k is zero for a range of wave vectors around the origin i e 17 χ v k 0 for 0 k k where k is some positive number as in the case of hyperuniform point configurations torquato and stillinger 2003 zachary and torquato 2009 2011 torquato 2018a there are three different scaling regimes classes when the spectral density goes to zero with the power law form χ v k k α that describe the associated large r behaviors of local volume fraction variance 18 σ v 2 r r d 1 α 1 class i r d 1 ln r α 1 class ii r d α 0 α 1 class iii where the exponent α is a positive constant thus the linear measure of the representative elementary volume for a hyperuniform medium will depend on the hyperuniformity class scaling class i is the strongest hyperuniformity class which includes all perfect periodic packings as well as some disordered packings such as disordered stealthy packings described in section 5 2 2 we call a packing in r d a collection of nonoverlapping particles torquato 2018b while all class i have local volume fraction variances that scale as r d 1 for large r the coefficient b v multiplying r d 1 is different among them and hence b v provides a hyperuniformity order metric that can be used to rank order different structures according to degree that they suppress large scale local volume fraction fluctuations torquato and stillinger 2003 zachary and torquato 2009 torquato 2018a torquato et al 2015 these previous results indicate that the body centered cubic bcc lattice packing in three dimensions has the smallest hyperuniformity order metric b v most ordered with respect to this metric when compared to other packings at the same number density and packing fraction fig 3 schematically shows the ranking of this order metric for some selected packings we will see that the bcc packing plays a special role in various problems described in this paper in the case of a packing of identical spheres of radius a at number density ρ the spectral density χ v k is directly related to the structure factor s k of the sphere centers torquato 2002a 2016a 19 χ v k ρ m 2 k a s k where m k a is the fourier transform of a sphere indicator function given by 20 m k a 2 π a k d 2 j d 2 k a asymptotic analysis of 20 for large values of k and comparison to relation 11 reveals the expected result for the specific surface of any packing of identical spheres namely 21 s 3 ϕ 2 a where ϕ 2 is the packing fraction fraction of space covered by the spheres which is given by 22 ϕ 2 ρ v 1 a and 23 v 1 a π d 2 a d γ 1 d 2 is the volume of a d dimensional sphere of radius a 2 3 pore size distribution we also characterize the pore phase by determining the probability f δ that a randomly placed sphere of radius δ centered in the pore space v 1 lies entirely in v 1 by definition f 0 1 and f 0 the quantity f δ is the complementary cumulative distribution function associated with the corresponding pore size probability density function p δ f δ δ at the extreme values of p δ we have that p 0 s ϕ 1 and p 0 the nth moment of the pore size probability density is defined by torquato 2002a 24 δ n 0 δ n p δ d δ n 0 δ n 1 f δ d δ we will be particularly interested in the mean pore size δ and the second moment δ 2 25 δ 0 f δ d δ 26 δ 2 2 0 δ f δ d δ we will see that these characteristic length scales of the pore phase can be related to certain diffusion properties of the porous medium note that the pore size probability function f δ can be easily extracted from 3d digitized images of real porous media coker et al 1996 for models of porous media consisting of distributions of identical spheres of radius a nonoverlapping or not the complementary cumulative pore size distribution f δ is trivially related to the so called void exclusion probability ev r via the relation torquato 2002a 27 f δ e v δ a ϕ 1 δ 0 the exclusion probability ev r gives the probability that a test sphere of radius r that is placed randomly in the medium does not contain any sphere center the quantity 28 h v r e v r r is the associated void nearest neighbor probability density function 3 local differential equations and effective transport properties 3 1 formation factor and tortuosity of the pore space consider a porous medium whose pore space v 1 is filled with an electrically conducting fluid of conductivity σ 1 and a solid phase that is perfectly insulating σ 2 0 at steady state the scaled electric field e actual electric field divided by the modulus of the ensemble averaged electric field satisfies 29 e 0 in v 1 30 e 0 in v 1 31 e n 0 on v 1 where n is the unit outward normal at the pore solid interface v 1 homogenization theory provides the conditions under which the scaled effective conductivity of the porous medium σe σ 1 has the well known energy representation 32 σ e σ 1 f 1 e e where f denotes the formation factor which is the commonly employed designation for σ 1 σe and angular brackets denote an ensemble average the formation factor f is a measure of the tortuosity of the entire pore space including topologically connected parts of the pore space as well as disconnected portions e g isolated pores if the pore space does not percolate then f is unbounded or equivalently σ e σ 1 0 roughly speaking the formation factor f quantifies the degree of windiness for electrical transport pathways across a macroscopic sample 3 2 diffusion nmr relaxation problem and effective time scales nuclear magnetic resonance nmr relaxation times of porous media provide useful probes of the pore phase microstructure mitra et al 1992 1993 bergman and dunn 1994 sen and hürlimann 1994 øren et al 2002 let m r t denote the magnetization density at local position r and time t inside the pore phase v 1 in which there are generally paramagnetic impurities at the pore solid interface v that will tend to demagnetize the diffusing particle when it strikes the interface the magnetization density obeys the time dependent diffusion equation in the pore region v 1 33 m t d m m o δ t in v 1 34 d m n κ m 0 on v here d is the diffusion coefficient κ is the surface rate constant is the laplacian operator mo is the initial magnetization density and δ t is the dirac delta function in the diffusion controlled regime the diffusing species takes a long time to diffuse to the pore trap interface relative to the characteristic time associated with the surface reaction for infinite surface reaction κ the traps are perfect absorbers and thus the interface condition is of the dirichlet kind with m 0 on the other hand in the reaction controlled regime the characteristic time associated with surface reaction is large compared with the diffusion time to the pore trap interface for vanishing surface reaction κ 0 the traps are perfect reflectors and hence the interface condition is of the neumann kind with m n 0 the solution of 33 and 34 can be expressed as an expansion in orthonormal functions torquato and avellaneda 1991 the diffusion relaxation times tn are inversely related to the eigenvalues λn by t n 1 d λ n the survival probability s t which gives the fraction of brownian particles that survive until time t is a monotonically decreasing function of time that is explicitly known to be an infinite sum involving the entire spectrum of relaxation times torquato and avellaneda 1991 the long time behavior of the survival probability s t is determined by the largest or principal relaxation time t 1 which in turn is intimately linked to pore size fluctuations using homogenization theory rubinstein and torquato 1988 it was shown that the mean survival time τ which is defined by 35 τ u ϕ 1 d where u is the scaled magnetization density satisfying the steady state diffusion equation 36 u 1 in v 1 37 u n κ u 0 on v the mean survival time gives the average time for a brownian particle to survive before it gets trapped and interestingly can also be obtained from nmr relaxation since it is the area under the survival time curve torquato and avellaneda 1991 i e 38 τ 0 s t d t the times τ and t 1 are intimately linked to characteristic length scales of the pore region as in the case of the formation factor f they account for the entire pore space whether topologically connected or not whereas the mean survival time τ is determined by the average pore size the principal largest relaxation time t 1 is governed by diffusion occurring in the largest pores in the system torquato and avellaneda 1991 have shown that the mean survival time τ is bounded from above and below in terms of the principal relaxation t 1 for example the upper bound on τ is given by 39 τ t 1 3 3 fluid permeability homogenization theory was applied to show that the isotropic fluid permeability k arising in darcy s law of a random porous medium can be expressed as the ensemble average of a scaled velocity field rubinstein and torquato 1989 specifically the permeability is given by 40 k w e where w is scaled vector velocity field that satisfies 41 w π e in v 1 42 w 0 in v 1 43 w 0 on v π is a scaled pressure field and e is a unit vector in the direction of the applied pressure gradient now consider the unsteady stokes equations for the fluid velocity vector field v r t at position r and time t in v 1 44 v t p ρ ν v v 0 e δ t in v 1 45 v 0 in v 1 46 v 0 on v here p r t is the pressure ρ is the constant fluid density ν is the kinematic viscosity v 0 is a constant and e is an arbitrary unit vector avellaneda and torquato 1991 used the solutions of 44 46 which can be expressed as a sum of normal modes to derive the first rigorous relation connecting the fluid permeability k to the formation factor of the porous medium and a length scale l that is determined by the eigenvalues of the stokes operator specifically the fluid permeability is exactly given by 47 k l 2 f where l is a certain weighted sum over the viscous relaxation timesθ n associated with the time dependent stokes equations i e inversely proportional to the eigenvalues of the stokes operator the reader should note that the length scale l appearing in 47 absorbs a factor of 8 compared to the definition l given in ref avellaneda and torquato 1991 specifically l l 8 avellaneda and torquato 1991 also showed how to explicitly relate the spectrum θ n to the dynamic fluid permeability k ω where ω is the frequency associated with an imposed oscillatory pressure gradient 4 microstructure dependent effective property estimates 4 1 formation factor rigorous upper and lower bounds have been derived on the effective conductivity σe of two phase media that incorporate various n point correlation functions see refs milton 2002 and torquato 2002a and references therein in the special case of a conducting fluid of phase conductivity σ 1 and a perfectly insulating solid phase σ 2 0 one can trivially extract the formation factor f defined by 32 for example a tight lower bound on f for any such 3d porous medium that accounts for up to four point correlation function information can be obtained from ref torquato 1985 48 f 1 1 2 γ 2 ζ 2 1 2 ζ 2 1 2 1 2 ζ 2 1 4 γ 2 ζ 2 ϕ 2 1 1 2 γ 2 ζ 2 1 2 ζ 2 1 1 2 ζ 2 1 2 γ 2 ζ 2 ϕ 2 where the three point microstructural parameter ζ 2 is a certain weighted integral that involves the correlation functions s 1 2 s 2 2 and s 3 2 of phase 2 cf 2 and the four point microstructural parameter γ 2 is a certain weighted integral that involves the correlation functions s 1 2 s 2 2 s 3 2 and s 4 2 the reader is referred to ref torquato 1985 for detailed discussions of these parameters the corresponding upper bound on f diverges to infinity because it corresponds to microstructures in which the pore space is fully topologically disconnected for a wide class of ordered and disordered packings in which the particles form phase 2 theoretical arguments were presented to show that the four point parameter is equal to zero to a very good approximation this conclusion together with 48 led to the following approximation for such media in terms of the three point parameter ζ 2 0 1 49 f 2 ϕ 2 ϕ 1 ζ 2 ϕ 1 2 ζ 2 the high predictive power of this approximation and its more general counterpart that applies to the effective conductivity σe for any phase contrast ratio σ 2 σ 1 torquato 1985 has been validated by computer simulations of the effective conductivity of a variety of ordered and disordered dispersions of spheres in a matrix torquato 1985 kim and torquato 1991 robinson and friedman 2005 gillman and matouš 2014 gillman et al 2015 nguyen et al 2016 note that when ζ 2 0 relation 49 reduces to the optimal hashin shtrikman lower bound on f given the volume fraction and two point correlation function information hashin and shtrikman 1962 torquato 2002a the hashin shtrikman upper and lower bounds on the effective conductivity for arbitrary phase contrast ratios σ 2 σ 1 are optimal because their effective conductivities are exactly realized by certain multiscale dispersions including the coated spheres model in three dimensions and the coated cylinders model in two dimensions which is depicted in fig 4 such two phase media consist of composite spheres each of which is composed of a spherical core of one phase dispersed phase that is surrounded by a concentric spherical shell of the other phase such that the fraction of space occupied by the dispersed phase is equal to its overall phase volume fraction the composite spheres fill all space implying that their sizes range down to the infinitesimally small interestingly it has recently been proved that these highly degenerate optimal hashin shtrikman multiscale dispersions are hyperuniform kim and torquato 2019b 2019a which apparently is an important structural attribute to attain optimal effective conductivities and elastic properties hashin and shtrikman 1963 4 2 nmr time scales the mean survival time τ for a general porous medium with porosity ϕ 1 1 ϕ 2 is rigorously bounded from below according to torquato and avellaneda 1991 50 τ δ 2 d ϕ 1 κ s where δ is the mean pore size defined by 25 and s is the specific surface in the diffusion controlled limit in which κ d this lower bound reduces to one first derived by prager 1963 the mean survival time is bounded from above by the following weighted integral of the autocovariance function torquato and rubinstein 1989 51 d τ 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 2 ℓ p 2 where 52 ℓ p 2 0 χ v r r d r the inequality 51 has been referred as the two point void upper bound on τ torquato and rubinstein 1989 the two point void bound has been generalized to treat two dimensional media as well as dimensions higher than three torquato 2002a it has been shown that for the hyperuniform coated spheres model for d 3 and coated cylinders model for d 2 discussed in section 4 1 and depicted in fig 4 realize the corresponding two point void upper bound and hence maximize the mean survival times among all microstructures that share the same porosities ϕ 1 and and pore length scales ℓ p torquato and pham 2004 for general porous media the two point interfacial surface bound on the mean survival time doi 1976 rubinstein and torquato 1988 provides an even tighter upper bound on τ which is briefly described in the appendix including its new fourier representation rigorous lower bounds on the principal relaxation time t 1 have been derived for any value of the surface rate constant κ in the diffusion controlled regime asymptotic analysis of this lower bound yields 53 t 1 δ 2 d 3 ϕ 1 δ 2 4 κ s δ 2 where δ 2 is the second moment of the pore size function defined by 26 note that in the diffusion controlled limit this inequality reduces to the result due to prager 1963 4 3 fluid permeability 4 3 1 rigorous bounds the two point void upper bound on the fluid permeability of a general porous medium with porosity ϕ 1 1 ϕ 2 is given by 54 k 2 3 ϕ 2 2 ℓ p 2 where ℓ p is exactly the same length scale 52 that arises in the analogous two point void bound 51 on the mean survival time τ the two point void bound 54 was originally derived by prager 1961 with an incorrect constant prefactor this prefactor was subsequently corrected by berryman and milton 1985 and rubinstein and torquato 1989 using different variational approaches the two point void bound 54 on the fluid permeability has been generalized to treat two dimensional media as well as dimensions higher than three torquato 2002a it is noteworthy that for the hyperuniform coated cylinders model in two dimensions see fig 4 the two point void upper bound maximizes the permeability among all microstructures that share the same porosity ϕ 1 and pore length scale ℓ p torquato and pham 2004 for general porous media the two point interfacial surface bound on the fluid permeability doi 1976 rubinstein and torquato 1988 provides an even tighter upper bound on k which is briefly described in the appendix including its new fourier representation 4 3 2 rigorous cross property relations torquato 1990 derived the first rigorous relation connecting the fluid permeability tensor to an effective diffusion parameter namely the mean survival time τ associated with steady state diffusion of reactants in the fluid region of a porous medium containing perfectly absorbing pore walls i e infinite surface rate constant κ see section 3 2 this takes the form of an inequality and its scalar version valid for arbitrary isotropic media bounds the fluid permeability k from above in terms of τ is given by 55 k d τ ϕ 1 where d is the diffusion coefficient and ϕ 1 is the porosity the upper bound 55 becomes an equality for transport interior to parallel tubes of arbitrary cross section in the direction of the tubes this cross property bound is relatively tight for flow around dilute arrays of obstacles but not for a high concentration of obstacles the latter instance highlights the fact that the mean survival time τ cannot distinguish between pore channels involving significant momentum transport from those involving little or no momentum transport moreover for any disconnected pore space k is zero while τ is nonzero note that in the more general case of partially reflecting pore walls κ τ κ τ τ and hence one has the generally weaker inequality 56 k d τ κ ϕ 1 using the characteristics of the stokes operator avellaneda and torquato 1991 derived sharper cross property bounds relating the permeability to viscous and diffusion time scales as well as the formation factor specifically they proved that 57 k ν θ 1 f where ν is the kinematic viscosity and θ1 is the principal largest viscous relaxation time as discussed in section 3 3 they showed that since νθ1 dt 1 where t 1 is the principal largest diffusion relaxation time see section 3 2 the previous bound leads to the following somewhat weaker bound for arbitrary κ 58 k d t 1 f it immediately follows from 47 and 58 that exact length scale l is bounded from above in terms of t 1 according to 59 l 2 d t 1 as noted earlier t 1 can be obtained from nmr experiments thus via inequality 58 the permeability is related to purely diffusional transport parameters i e t 1 and f which can be readily measured it has been shown that 58 provides relatively accurate estimates of the permeability of versatile grain consolidation models torquato and kim 1992 since t 1 is closely related to the second moment of the pore size function see 53 the accuracy of the estimate 58 highlights the importance of the second moment δ 2 of the pore size probability density function in determining the square of the exact length scale l and hence the fluid permeability of certain porous media as will be elaborated below 5 model microstructures and their structural characteristics we study and characterize a variety of different models of hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform porous media ordered and disordered packings of spheres overlapping spheres and debye random media of particular interest is the spectral density χ v k and pore size probability function f δ for these models in most of the cases these statistical descriptors can be obtained as closed form analytical expressions 5 1 nonhyperuniform disordered models we study three different nonhyperuniform disordered model microstructures equilibrium packings overlapping spheres and debye random media 5 1 1 equilibrium packings equilibrium gibbs ensembles of identical hard spheres of radius a hansen and mcdonald 1986 and torquato 2018b are examined in particular we consider such disordered packings along the stable disordered fluid branch in the phase diagram torquato 2002a 2018b all such states are nonhyperuniform 5 1 2 overlapping spheres systems of particles whose centroids are uncorrelated poisson distributed that can fully overlap are useful models of heterogeneous media weissberg 1963 torquato 2002a here we focus on the case in which the particles are identical spheres of radius a at number density ρ which we henceforth refer to as overlapping spheres it is well known that the autocovariance function of identical overlapping spheres in three dimensions is given by weissberg 1963 and torquato 2002a 60 χ v r exp η 1 3 r 4 a r 3 16 a 3 exp 2 η for r 2a and zero otherwise where η ρ 4 π a 3 3 ln ϕ 1 is a reduced density and its specific surface is 61 s 3 ϕ 1 η a it is noteworthy that the particle phase percolates for 0 29 ϕ 2 1 rintoul and torquato 1997 while the pore phase percolates for 0 ϕ 2 0 97 elam et al 1984 rintoul 2000 thus the overlapping spheres model is bicontinuous both phases simultaneously percolate for 0 29 ϕ 2 0 97 5 1 3 debye random media debye et al debye et al 1957 hypothesized that the following autocovariance function characterizes isotropic random media in which the phases form domains of random shape and size 62 χ v r ϕ 1 ϕ 2 exp r a where a is a characteristic length scale however many years passed since the publication of this work before it was shown that such autocovariances are actually realizable by two phase media in two dimensions it was shown that debye random media are realizable stoyan et al 1995 yeong and torquato 1998a theoretical analyses indicate that such media are realizable in three and higher dimensions jiao et al 2007 but no such explicit constructions have heretofore been identified motivated by the implications of our analysis of rigorous permeability estimates in the present work we provide a 3d realization of a debye random medium see section 6 3 the taylor expansion of 62 about r 0 and comparison to 6 reveals that the specific surface s of a debye random medium in any space dimension is given by 63 s ϕ 1 ϕ 2 β d a for d 3 our main interest in this paper this formula yields 64 s 4 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 a 5 2 hyperuniform model microstructures we also consider hyperuniform packings of identical spheres of radius a with packing fraction ϕ 2 including ordered and disordered varieties 5 2 1 lattice packings we study nonoverlapping spheres arranged on the sites of simple cubic sc face centered cubic fcc and body centered cubic bcc lattices ashcroft and mermin 1976 chaikin and lubensky 1995 conway and sloane 1998 such ordered packings which are necessarily hyperuniform and stealthy torquato and stillinger 2003 torquato et al 2015 such idealized packing models are useful since their transport properties can be determined exactly in principle subsequently we show that the bcc lattice which is known to be optimal for various problems that arise in many body physics torquato and stillinger 2003 and discrete geometry conway and sloane 1998 torquato 2010 has a special status in the case of fluid permeability when the sites of the bcc lattice are decorated with identical nonoverlapping spheres for example the bcc lattice is believed to be the point configuration that minimizes a certain measure of large scale density fluctuations torquato and stillinger 2003 moreover the bcc lattice provides the best known covering in three dimensional space r 3 conway and sloane 1998 torquato 2010 the covering problem asks for the point configuration in d dimensional euclidean space r d that minimizes the radius of overlapping spheres circumscribed around each of the points required to cover r d finally the bcc lattice also provides the best known quantizer in r 3 conway and sloane 1998 torquato 2010 klatt et al 2019 the quantizer problem is concerned with finding the point configuration in r d that minimizes a distance error associated with a randomly placed point and the nearest point of the point process it is noteworthy for what follows that the quantizer and covering optimization problems have been reformulated as certain ground state problems involving the void exclusion probability ev r torquato 2010 which was defined in section 2 3 for example the quantizer problem minimizes the first moment of ev r or equivalently the second moment of the associated nearest neighbor probability function hv r cf 28 since the first moment of ev r is directly connected to the second moment δ 2 of the pore size probability function 26 for a packing then it is expected that δ 2 among packings of identical spheres at the same packing fraction is minimized by the bcc packing all of these results suggest that the size of the largest probe sphere that can traverse the pore space of a packing in the infinite volume limit at packing fraction ϕ 2 is given by the bcc packing for 0 ϕ 2 ϕ max b c c where ϕ max b c c 3 π 8 0 68017 is the maximum packing fraction for the bcc lattice consistent with the nonoverlap constraint note that the corresponding maximum packing fractions for sc and fcc lattices are ϕ max s c π 6 0 52359 and ϕ max f c c π 18 0 74048 respectively conway and sloane 1998 5 2 2 disordered packings we consider two different disordered hyperuniform packing models the first is a maximally random jammed mrj packing which can be regarded to be the most random packing subject to strict jamming constraint torquato et al 2000 torquato 2018b this jamming condition implies that each sphere is in contact with its nearest neighbors such that there can be no collective particle motions that lead to unjamming and they are stable against both uniform compression and shear deformations we also study stealthy packings which are disordered and hyperuniform and hence have spectral densities that satisfy the condition 17 where k is the exclusion sphere radius in fourier reciprocal space such packings have been created by decorating stealthy point configurations generated via the so called collective coordinate optimization technique uche et al 2004 batten et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 by spheres of radius a such that spheres cannot overlap zhang et al 2016b disordered stealthy point configurations generated by this optimization procedure are actually classical ground states of systems of particles interacting with bounded long ranged pair potentials the control parameter is the exclusion sphere radius k when k is sufficiently small compared to the number of degrees of freedom the ground states are disordered stealthy and highly degenerate however when k reaches a certain critical value there is a phase transition to ordered ground states it is noteworthy that at the highest value of k in three dimensions the ground state is uniquely the bcc lattice torquato et al 2015 it is also remarkable that among all hyperuniform point configurations in three dimensions the bcc lattice is believed to be the one that minimizes large scale density fluctuations torquato and stillinger 2003 zachary and torquato 2009 we will see that these properties of the bcc lattice impart singular fluid permeability properties to bcc packings 5 3 corresponding spectral densities and pore size statistics we note that for any periodic point configuration of n points within a fundamental cell of volume vf in three dimensions the angular averaged structure factor can be expressed as follows torquato 2018a 65 s k 8 π 3 v f j 1 z j 4 π k 2 δ k q j where zj is the number of points in reciprocal space at the bragg peak wavenumber qj and δ r is the radial dirac delta function the quantities zj and qj are encoded in the theta series for the lattice conway and sloane 1998 eq 65 together with 19 yields the corresponding analytical expression for the spectral density of general crystal packing of identical spheres of radius a 66 χ v k 3 π ϕ 2 2 a 3 v f m 2 k a j 1 z j k 2 δ k q j this expression clearly reveals that lattice packings are stealthy cf 17 and hyperuniform since the envelope of m 2 k a is a rapidly decaying function of k the weights of the delta functions decrease as k increases as shown in fig 5 for the case of the simple cubic lattice with ϕ 2 1 2 the spectral density for hyperuniform mrj sphere packings at ϕ 2 0 636 determined from large scale computer simulations klatt and torquato 2016 as well as for a stealthy packing at ϕ 2 0 1 are also shown in fig 5 the latter is obtained using theoretically derived approximation formulas for the structure factor for stealthy point configurations torquato et al 2015 expression 19 and the numerically determined radii provided in ref zhang et al 2016b in fig 6 we compare the spectral densities for the aforementioned three nonhyperuniform models each at ϕ 2 0 4 the spectral density for debye random media in any space dimension is given by 67 χ v k ϕ 1 ϕ 2 c d a d 1 k a 2 d 1 2 where c d 2 d π d 1 2 γ d 1 2 the spectral density χ v k for overlapping spheres is straightforwardly obtained by taking the fourier transform of 60 for equilibrium hard spheres the spectral density at packing fraction ϕ 2 is obtained from eq 19 and the percus yevick approximation torquato and stell 1985 torquato 2002a the exact pore size probability function f δ for each of the three lattice packings is easily obtained from exact results for the exclusion probability ev r torquato 2010 and then applying the mapping 27 since a test sphere of radius δc and larger cannot be inserted in a lattice packing f δ has compact support i e f δ 0 for δ δc the pore size function f δ for the mrj packing has been determined from large scale computer simulations in refs donev et al 2005 and klatt and torquato 2016 from recent theoretical and computer simulation studies of the exclusion probability of stealthy systems torquato et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a we can extract the pore size function f δ for disordered stealthy packings it follows that since disordered stealthy point configurations have the property that ev r has compact support zhang et al 2017 ghosh and lebowitz 2018 an unusual behavior for a disordered system the pore size function f δ of a disordered stealth packing of identical spheres will also have compact support using accurate formulas for the exclusion probability ev r torquato et al 1990 the pore size function f δ has been determined for equilibrium hard spheres torquato 2002a using 27 in three dimensions the pore size probability for overlapping spheres is exactly given by torquato 2002a 68 f δ 1 ϕ 1 exp η 1 δ a 3 note that 68 has infinite support which implies that the pore space possesses arbitrarily large holes in the infinite volume limit this characteristic of nonhyperuniform overlapping spheres applies as well to nonhyperuniform equilibrium packings torquato 2002a which has important implications for nmr time scales as described in the next section this is due to the fact the pore size function f δ in each of these nonhyperuniform models has infinite support it is noteworthy that the pore size functions of debye random media have yet to be determined it is useful to compare the pore size function of stealthy hyperuniform packings to those of hyperuniform bcc packings and nonhyperuniform overlapping spheres fig 7 provides such a comparison of f δ on a log scale at ϕ 2 not surprisingly the two stealthy cases exhibit similar behaviors i e f δ dropping precipitously as δ approaches its maximum values which is in stark contrast to the very gradual drop of f δ with δ for the overlapping spheres case 6 estimates of effective properties for hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform models 6 1 formation factor in fig 8 we compare the formation factor f as a function of ϕ 2 for two hyperuniform systems bcc and stealthy packings and two nonhyperuniform systems equilibrium hard sphere packings and overlapping spheres such a comparison has heretofore not been presented we also include the hashin shtrikman lower bound to see how close these formation factors are to being extremal data for the bcc and stealthy packings are taken from numerical studies of the effective conductivity from refs mckenzie et al 1978 and zhang et al 2016b respectively the formation factor for equilibrium hard sphere packings was determined from a highly accurate microstructure dependent approximation formula 49 torquato 1985 as well as computer simulation data kim and torquato 1991 for the effective conductivity note that the formation factors for the stealthy packings are effectively optimal i e they are the same as the hashin shtrikman lower bound zhang et al 2016b to three significant figures and hence cannot be distinguished from one another on the scale of this figure not surprisingly formation factors for overlapping spheres deviate the most from the optimal lower bound and increasingly so as ϕ 2 increases 6 2 nmr time scales now we consider results for nmr time scales in the pure diffusion controlled limit i e infinite surface reaction κ implying perfect absorption at the trap pore interface recently the mean survival time τ and principal relaxation time t 1 have been computed for stealthy packings in which the particles are perfect absorbers zhang et al 2016b in the present work we compare them for the first time to earlier corresponding results for bcc packings from a computer simulation study of torquato and kim 1992 for brevity it suffices here to report such a comparison for t 1 see refs zhang et al 2016b and torquato and stillinger 2002 for results for the means survival time fig 9 shows a comparison of the principal relaxation time t 1 of a stealthy packing at ϕ 2 0 2 to the corresponding result for a bcc packing this figure also includes bcc results for other packing fractions it is seen that the stealthy packing has a principal relaxation time that is very nearly equal to that of the bcc packing at ϕ 2 0 2 this is expected since both systems are not only hyperuniform but stealthy and hence are characterized by appreciably diminished pore size fluctuations as noted in section 5 3 in vivid contrast to these results is the fact that t 1 for both nonhyperuniform overlapping spheres and nonhyperuniform equilibrium packings become unbounded in the infinite volume limit torquato 1990 since the pore space possesses arbitrarily large holes in this limit as discussed in section 5 3 6 3 fluid permeability 6 3 1 two point void bound we utilize the two point void bound 54 to infer how the permeabilities of hyperuniform porous media perform relative to those of nonhyperuniform ones however it may be difficult to evaluate numerically the integral in the direct space formula 52 for the length scale ℓ p since the integrand of 52 can be both positive and negative due positive and negative correlations that would be reflected in χ v r it becomes especially nontrivial to compute if χ v r slowly converges as in the case of many hyperuniform media where one must not only estimate χ v r precisely but rely on a complex extrapolation technique known as α convergence torquato and stillinger 2003 klatt and torquato 2018 see also the appendix for additional details since it is crucial to capture accurately the long range structural behavior of hyperuniform media i e the tail of the autocovariance function χ v r we derive here an alternative fourier representation of the relevant length scale ℓ p cf 52 that arises in the bound 54 first we recall parseval s theorem for direct space functions f r and g r with well defined corresponding fourier transforms f k and g k in three dimensional euclidean space 69 r 3 f r g r d r 1 2 π 3 r 3 f k g k d k now we let f r 1 4 π r and g r χ v r and recognize that the fourier transform of f r exists in the sense of distributions i e f k k 2 thus we find the alternative fourier form of the length scale 70 ℓ p 2 1 2 π 2 0 χ v k d k the analogous fourier representation of the interfacial surface upper bound on k is provided in the appendix formula 70 has great advantages over the direct space representation 52 first the integrand of 70 is always nonnegative and hence not subject to the aforementioned to the precision issues in evaluating 52 where the medium is hyperuniform or not another advantage of the fourier representation 70 occurs when the autocovariance function χ v r oscillates and slowly decays to zero such as in crystal periodic packings for a crystal packing of identical spheres of radius a combination of 19 65 and 70 leads to the following expression for the length scale ℓ p 71 ℓ p 2 ϕ 2 v f v 1 a j 1 z j q j 2 m 2 q j a moreover we see that truncation of the infinite series bounds the exact result from below since each term in the series 71 is positive in summary the new formula 70 conveniently captures the long range correlations without a complex extrapolation required to compute 52 accurately and hence more precise estimates can be obtained with greater ease it is quite versatile and easily applied to other models including polydisperse sphere packings for example we employ the spectral densities of various packings of identical spheres of radius a described in section 5 3 to compute the corresponding void bound on k using formula 70 for ℓ p specifically the void bound is calculated for the hyperuniform sc fcc and bcc lattice packings disordered stealthy packings and mrj packing as well as nonhyperuniform equilibrium packings at selected values of the packing fraction ϕ 2 these results are tabulated in table 1 where the fluid permeability is scaled by a 2 the natural choice for nonoverlapping spheres of radius a importantly while the void bound is not very tight it does provide the proper ranking for the lattice packings for which we know the permeabilities accurately sangani and acrivos 1982 namely at fixed ϕ 2 a sc packing has slightly higher value of k than a fcc packing which in turn is slightly higher than the permeability of a bcc packing we see that the stealthy hyperuniform packings have permeabilities that are slightly greater those of the sc packing but much smaller than the corresponding values for the nonhyperuniform equilibrium packing note also the permeability of the hyperuniform mrj packing at ϕ 2 0 636 which is in very good agreement with the numerical result reported in ref klatt and torquato 2018 using the direct space formula 52 is not appreciably larger than the corresponding values for the fcc and bcc packings at this packing fraction generally speaking relative to nonhyperuniform porous media hyperuniform ones are expected to have velocity fields that are more uniform throughout the pore space indeed a recent microfluidics study in two dimensions confirms this conclusion ding et al 2018 moreover stealthy hyperuniform packings which include all of the lattice packings and disordered ones cannot tolerate large holes for transport and hence in each of these cases the velocity field over the pore space is highly delocalized and the entire pore space is more uniformly dynamically connected thus one expects the fluid permeability to be lower in all of the stealthy cases relative to the nonhyperuniform equlibrium instances in which the velocity field is more localized over the pore space due greater variability in the geometry of the pore channels the degree of delocalization of the velocity field in the case of hyperuniform porous media can be rigorously quantified by appealing to the generalization of the hyperuniformity concept to vector fields torquato 2016b to get a visual sense of the distinctions between the pore space in hyperuniform versus nonhyperuniform porous media we dilate the solid phase region radially in equilibrium mrj and disordered stealthy packings so that the resulting pore space has a porosity of 1 it is important to recall that while the mrj packing is hyperuniform it is not stealthy the initial packing fractions are ϕ 2 0 25 ϕ 2 0 2 and ϕ 2 0 636 for the equilibrium mrj and stealthy disordered packings respectively the resulting pore spaces are depicted in fig 10 the large variability in the size and shapes of the resultant pore regions in the nonhyperuniform equilibrium case relative to those in the hyperuniform instances is readily apparent moreover the spatial distribution of the mrj pore regions are less uniform than those of the disordered stealthy packing we also compute the two point void bound for overlapping spheres and debye random media each of which depart appreciably from hyperuniformity in order to compare these two distinctly different models we utilize the square of the specific surface s 2 to scale the fluid permeability these results are tabulated in table 2 it is noteworthy that the upper bound on the scaled permeability for debye random media is generally substantially larger than that for overlapping spheres at the same value of ϕ 2 this strongly suggests that debye random media are characterized by substantially larger pores larger flow channels than those in the overlapping sphere model indeed this is quantitatively corroborated by the fact that the autocovariance function of debye random media has infinite support cf 62 while that of overlapping spheres has compact support cf 60 as noted in section 5 3 the actual pore size function 68 of overlapping spheres has infinite support the pore space possesses arbitrarily large holes in the infinite volume limit to verify whether this conclusion about the pore statistics of debye random media can be inferred from the void bound we have applied the yeong and torquato 1998a stochastic optimization construction technique to generate a digitized 3d debye random medium with ϕ 2 1 2 in a cube under periodic boundary conditions in order to visualize it such a digitized realization in which the two phases are statistically identical is shown in fig 11 we also directly generated a corresponding digitized realization of overlapping spheres by randomly placing spheres in a cubic box under periodic boundary conditions at the same porosity specific surface s and resolution it is clear that each phase in the debye random medium is characterized by large clusters and pore sizes that are appreciably larger than those of its overlapping sphere counterpart this speaks to the utility of the two point void bound to infer nontrivial microstructural information about the porous medium 6 3 2 new estimate of the fluid permeability while the two point void bound 54 is able to capture the proper trends of how the permeability changes as the microstructures varies it is not capable of providing sharp estimates of k let us assume there exists a class of porous media in which the inequality 53 on t 1 in the diffusion controlled limit and the inequality 59 on l 2 can be treated as equalities then using the exact result 47 we obtain the following approximation for the fluid permeability 72 k δ 2 f which implies that the exact length scale l that appears in the exact relation 47 for the permeability is given by 73 l 2 δ 2 to test the validity of formula 72 we compare in fig 12 numerical data for the fluid permeability of bcc packings obtained by sangani and acrivos 1982 to the approximation formula 72 we see that formula 72 provides an excellent approximation of the simulation data of the fluid permeability thus formula 72 should provide relatively accurate predictions of the permeability for microstructures in which the pore space is well connected including equilibrium packings mrj packings and lattice packings in which the spheres are not necessarily monodisperse we compare the predictions of formula 72 for stealthy equilibrium and bcc packings in fig 13 formula 72 for equilibrium sphere packings was computed using previous results for the effective conductivity torquato 1985 kim and torquato 1991 and δ 2 torquato and avellaneda 1991 note that the permeability estimates for stealthy packings are substantially closer to those for the bcc packings which is fully consistent with inferences we drew from the behavior of the void bound 7 conclusions and discussion we have investigated and applied rigorous microstructure property relations to estimate effective transport characteristics of hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform models of fluid saturated porous media including the formation factor f mean survival time τ principal nmr diffusion relaxation time t 1 principal viscous relaxation time θ1 and fluid permeability k among other results we derived a fourier representation of the classic two point upper bound on the fluid permeability that depends on the spectral density to infer how the permeabilities of hyperuniform porous media perform relative to those of nonhyperuniform ones we found that the velocity fields in nonhyperuniform porous media are generally much more localized over the pore space compared to those in their hyperuniform counterparts in which the velocity fields are more uniform throughout the pore space the fluid permeability is expected to be lower in all of the stealthy hyperuniform cases relative to the nonhyperuniform equlibrium instances due to their greater variability in the geometry of the pore channels our analysis of the void bounds on the permeability for the sc fcc and bcc lattice packings provides the first quantitative explanation for why the bcc lattice packing minimizes the permeability among these crystal structures at fixed ϕ 2 this bound also enabled us to correctly infer that nonhyperuniform debye random media should be characterized by substantially large pore regions which was verified by constructing a realization of such a porous medium rigorous bounds on individual effective properties as well as cross property relations suggested a new approximate formula 72 for the permeability given in terms of the formation factor f and the second moment δ 2 of the pore size probability density the latter of which can be easily extracted from 3d digitized images of real porous media coker et al 1996 formula 72 provides reasonably accurate permeability predictions of the class of hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform porous media in which the pore space is well connected the permeability estimates for disordered stealthy hyperuniform packings were shown to be substantially closer to those for the bcc packings which is fully consistent with inferences we drew from the behavior of the void bound these comparative studies have shed new light on the microstructural characteristics that determine the transport properties of general porous media an outstanding problem for future research is the direct stokes flow simulations of models of disordered hyperuniform porous media to determine their fluid permeabilities part of such a program could include the creation of disordered hyperuniform pore network models of porous media at arbitrary porosities and the computation of their transport properties another interesting problem for future research is the determination of the pore size functions of debye random media since there is a degeneracy of microstructures with an autocovariance function specified by 62 but with different higher order statistics the pore size function of debye random media will depend on the stochastic rules to construct them we note that our findings also have implications for the design of disordered hyperuniform porous materials with desirable transport properties specifically such 3d porous media can be fabricated using 3d additive manufacturing techniques kim and torquato 2019b we close this section with simple observations about an outstanding optimization problem posed by jung and torquato jung and torquato 2005 in the light of the hyperuniformity concept they asked what microstructure s under periodic boundary conditions in a cubic fundamental unit cell of unit side length maximizes the isotropic fluid permeability k at some porosity they focused on the case ϕ 1 1 2 and computed the permeabilities of a variety of different candidate structures including triply periodic minimal surfaces due to their optimality for other physical properties torquato et al 2002 torquato and donev 2004 they conjectured that the triply periodic two phase bicontinuous porous medium with an interface that is the schwartz primitive p minimal surface see fig 14 maximizes the isotropic fluid permeability this surmise follows from another conjecture that they put forth and supported by calculations torquato et al 2002 and analysis jung et al 2007 namely the schwartz p structure has the minimal specific surface under the aforementioned constraints this is still a fascinating open question and is a type of isoperimetric problem in the same spirit as kelvin s famous conjecture about foams weaire and phelan 1994 finally we observe that the conjectured extremal schwartz p structure for the fluid permeability is stealthy and

surface correlation functions such as the surface surface correlation function fss r and surface void correlation function fsv r torquato 2002a are crucial in determining transport properties of porous media when the interface plays a major role such as the mean survival time and fluid permeability doi 1976 rubinstein and torquato 1988 1989 until recently the difficulty of sampling surface correlation functions of porous media has been a stumbling block in their widespread use it has recently been shown that one can reduce the computational complexity of brute force sampling without sacrificing accuracy by extracting the necessary interfacial information from a cut of a statistically homogeneous and isotropic d dimensional medium in continuous and discrete spaces with an infinitely long line ma and torquato 2018 the two point interfacial surface upper bound on the isotropic fluid permeability doi 1976 rubinstein and torquato 1989 is given by a 1 k 2 3 ℓ s 2 where a 2 ℓ s 2 0 ϕ 1 2 s 2 f s s r 2 ϕ 1 s f s v r f v v r r d r where f v v r s 2 1 r this bound is generally sharper than the void bound 54 which involves s 2 1 r alone doi 1976 rubinstein and torquato 1989 analogously to the void bound the direct space formula a 2 is numerically very challenging klatt and torquato 2018 addressed these challenges to compute the interfacial surface bound for disordered monodisperse sphere packings including equilibrium and mrj packings by deriving the corresponding analytic formulas for finite samples however as in the case of the void bound it is substantially easier numerically to employ a fourier based formula especially for hyperuniform media to derive the fourier representation of the length scale ℓ s we first define the relevant autocovariance functions for statistically homogeneous media specifically a 3 χ s r f s s r s 2 is the autocovariance function associated with fss r and a 4 χ s v r f s v r s ϕ 1 is the cross covariance function associated with fsv r the corresponding spectral densities χ s k and χ s v k are obtained by taking the fourier transforms of χ s r and χ s v r respectively application of parseval s theorem in the

489,the problem of a spatially discontinuous diffusion coefficient d x is one that may be encountered in hydrogeologic systems due to natural geological features or as a consequence of numerical discretization of flow properties to date mass transfer particle tracking mtpt methods a family of lagrangian methods in which diffusion is jointly simulated by random walk and diffusive mass transfers have been unable to solve this problem this manuscript presents a new mass transfer mt algorithm that enables mtpt methods to accurately solve the problem of discontinuous d x to achieve this we derive a semi analytical solution to the discontinuous d x problem by employing a predictor corrector approach and we use this semi analytical solution as the weighting function in a reformulated mt algorithm this semi analytical solution is generalized for cases with multiple 1d interfaces as well as for 2d cases including a 2 2 tiling of 4 subdomains that corresponds to a numerically generated diffusion field the solutions generated by this new mass transfer algorithm closely agree with an analytical 1d solution or in more complicated cases trusted numerical results demonstrating the success of our proposed approach keywords lagrangian modeling particle methods mass transfer particle tracking imperfect mixing diffusion reaction equation composite porous media discontinuous diffusion coefficients 1 introduction simulating diffusive transport under the condition of a spatially discontinuous diffusion coefficient is a challenging problem that is frequently encountered in hydrogeological contexts uffink 1983 labolle et al 2000 appuhamillage et al 2010 semra et al 1970 oukili et al 2019 physically this can occur wherever there is an abrupt change in the material properties of a medium like the sharp interfaces between different depositional units sharp discontinuities can also be seen in for example fractured or composite media local compaction zones or at the interface between a saturated and unsaturated zone from a numerical perspective any non constant hydraulic conductivity field that is discretized will generate a diffusion dispersion field containing numerous discontinuities interpolation or averaging methods have been used in the past to smooth these discontinuities and these can be effective as long as the differences in magnitude of the parameter s across the interface is sufficiently small in general less than an order of magnitude however when the difference in diffusion coefficients between cells or regions of a domain becomes sufficiently large the simplest versions of these methods can fail and overcoming this challenge requires a more nuanced approach random walk particle tracking rwpt methods are a class of stochastic lagrangian mesh free or gridless methods that are commonly used to simulate advective diffusive transport these methods were originally formulated in the context of conservative non chemically reactive transport or cases of simple linear reactions such as sorbing solutes or first order decay labolle et al 1996 salamon et al 2006 they are popular because they introduce no numerical diffusion into the simulation of the advection hyperbolic operator and they also escape the burden imposed by restrictive stability conditions in eulerian grid based methods resulting in lower run times than corresponding eulerian methods benson et al 2017 further because rwpt is a stochastic algorithm statistics of concentrations can be readily generated instead of expected values point estimates in this context the problem of discontinuous diffusion coefficients has received much attention resulting in various methods for overcoming the difficulties of simulating such a system e g uffink 1983 appuhamillage et al 2010 semra et al 1970 hoteit et al 2002 bechtold et al 2011 oukili et al 2019 bagtzoglou et al 1992 labolle et al 1996 2000 each with their own merits and drawbacks one of the major advantages of classical rwpt is its speed due to the fact that every particle is completely independent of its neighbors however this also means that complex reactions cannot be simulated since particle interactions are not allowed recent developments in the field of rwpt have enabled methods to simulate complex and nonlinear chemical reactions in the presence of transport using either collision based reactions between particles of opposite species benson and meerschaert 2008 paster et al 2014 bolster et al 2016 schmidt et al 2017 sole mari et al 2017 sole mari and fernàndez garcia 2018 or by treating individual particles as reaction volumes that communicate via diffusive mass transfers benson and bolster 2016 the latter referred to as mass transfer particle tracking mtpt algorithms offer the increased flexibility of being able to model arbitrarily complex chemical reactions at relatively low computational cost engdahl et al 2017 schmidt et al 2019b including generalized reactions such as the aging of water parcels benson et al 2019b the mass transfer mt portion of these mtpt methods has been demonstrated to solve the diffusion equation to o δ t schmidt et al 2018 and exhibit superlinear convergence as particle numbers grow large schmidt et al 2019a additionally a method for parallelizing the mtpt method via domain decomposition has recently been developed and achieves linear speedup up to hundreds of computational cores subdomains engdahl et al 2019 mtpt methods have also been shown to be related to smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph methods e g herrera et al 2009 herrera and beckie 2013 gingold and monaghan 1977 monaghan 2012 under specific modeling choices including the use of a gaussian spatial kernel sole mari et al 2019b despite these advances past work on mtpt methods has neither addressed the impact of a discrete parameter field on the mass transfer operations nor accounted for the possible errors that may be incurred all previously mentioned random walk methods may be employed for diffusion coefficients with spatial discontinuities because they are capable of simulating small scale mixing and non mixed spreading of solute separately benson et al 2019a in other words spreading may be simulated by a random walk and mixing as a mass transfer however accuracy of the mass transfer step is only preserved for a smoothly varying field i e one in which interpolation may be reasonably performed and the current mtpt schemes incur error when there is a sharp discontinuity this is similar to the problems identified by labolle et al 2000 for classical rwpt mtpt has clear applications for highly accurate simulations of mixing limited reactive transport but this issue undermines its accuracy thus the purpose of the current paper is to address this deficiency and ensure that mtpt methods remain accurate even in such a case in section 2 we outline the specific mathematical problem on which we will focus and introduce the methods used to solve the problem in section 3 in section 3 1 we provide a brief overview of rwpt methods and discuss how the problem of discontinuous diffusion coefficients is typically handled with specific focus on a particular predictor corrector technique labolle et al 2000 that we extend to mtpt in section 3 2 we outline our approach to solving the discontinuous diffusion coefficient problem with an mtpt method by employing an alternative mass transfer kernel section 4 is devoted to discussing the results of applying the new mtpt method finally section 5 presents the conclusions drawn from our work 2 analytic model we consider a chemically conservative single species purely diffusive system that may be described by the heterogeneous diffusion equation 1 c t d x c x ω r d t 0 where c t x mol l d is the concentration of the single species d x l 2 t 1 is the scalar diffusion coefficient which for our purposes may be a function of space for this work we concern ourselves with the condition where d may be discontinuous this case leads to infinite spatial derivatives at all discontinuities so the question is how best to numerically evaluate the d term within the chosen method to minimize artifacts of the discontinuity the discontinuity we use for this study is created by partitioning the domain ω into n ω subdomains such that ω ω 1 ω 2 ω n ω where each subdomain has its own constant valued diffusion coefficient d i i 1 n ω and the interface between subdomains i and j is denoted γij 3 computational methods 3 1 random walk particle tracking method the classical lagrangian method for simulating the system of interest is standard random walk particle tracking rwpt thomson 1987 labolle et al 1996 in these methods masses are divided among particles that simulate diffusion via the langevin equation formulated for homogeneous d 2 x i t δ t x i t ξ i 2 d δ t where x i t is the position of particle i at time t δt is the chosen simulated timestep and ξ i is a d dimensional vector of random numbers drawn from a standard normal n 0 1 distribution in this basic form rwpt methods are unable to simulate the problem of discontinuous diffusion coefficients d x described in section 2 conceptually the problem is that during the course of a single step random walk a particle may see diffusion at the rates on both sides of the discontinuity in d x however there are well documented strategies for overcoming this the first general group of strategies are reflection methods uffink 1983 appuhamillage et al 2010 semra et al 1970 hoteit et al 2002 which may include a nonlinearly decomposed time step bechtold et al 2011 interpolation methods bagtzoglou et al 1992 or a combination thereof labolle et al 1996 a selection of these are reviewed and compared in labolle et al 1998 and the conclusion reached therein is that among the methods considered those of uffink 1983 semra et al 1970 provide the best accuracy a benchmark comparison of various methods is also conducted by lejay and pichot 2016 who distinguish between methods that preserve or lose important physical and numerical properties and recent work of the same authors presents a method that employs skew brownian motion densities with exponential timestepping to capture the dynamics of the discontinuous d x problem lejay et al 2019 another recent approach oukili et al 2019 employs negative mass particles in a partial reflection scheme so as to keep the total mass in a system constant and maintain particle independence to demonstrate how discontinuous d x is handled with rwpt and because we later use this method to generate reference solutions we briefly discuss the work of labolle et al 2000 we consider this method because it bears resemblance to the algorithm we present in section 3 2 also it is relatively simple to implement and the extension to greater than one spatial dimension is straightforward unlike some other approaches this method may be thought of as a predictor corrector approach and is formulated as 3 x i x i t ξ i 2 d x i δ t 4 x i t δ t x i t ξ i 2 d x i δ t in words a predictor random walk is first taken from x i t to x i in 3 to determine the diffusion coefficient that is then used in the corrected random walk from x i t to x i t δ t in 4 a subtle but important point is that the same random number ξ i must be used in 4 that was generated for 3 3 2 mass transfer particle tracking method another family of lagrangian methods that has gained attention recently are the mass transfer particle tracking mtpt methods which are the focus of this work benson and bolster 2016 engdahl et al 2017 schmidt et al 2018 2019a 2019b these methods are quite similar to rwpt methods in that diffusion is typically still simulated in part by random walks however the important distinction is that particle masses are no longer fixed and can be transferred among particles according to an algorithm that also simulates diffusion the mt algorithm may be given as 5 m i t δ t m i t j 1 n w i j m j t m i t where mi t is the mass carried by particle i at time t n is the number of particles and 6 w i j w x i x j h ρ i j note that this formulation is equivalent to choosing β 1 in the context of sole mari et al 2019b above w is a gaussian weighting function that determines the amount of mass transferred from particle j to particle i or vice versa because w in this case is symmetric with respect to x i and x j and ρij is a normalizing constant that ensures conservation of mass we specify here that this normalization would not be required in the limiting infinite particle case but for any finite number of particles n samples from the weighting function w which is necessarily a density will not sum to unity and thus not conserve mass as such we normalize our discretized density according to 6 in the case of isotropic diffusion we have 7 w x i x j d i d j δ t 2 π d i d j δ t d 2 exp x j x i 2 2 d i d j δ t where d 1 2 3 is the number of spatial dimensions and dk d x k the matrix vector form of 5 is written as 8 m t δ t t m t in which 9 t i w diag w 1 where i is the n n identity matrix 1 is an n 1 vector of ones and diag x is a square matrix with the entries of vector x on its main diagonal a popular choice for ρij that results in symmetric w and thus conservation of mass by the operator t is 10 ρ i j w 1 i 1 t w j 2 or in words ρij is the arithmetic mean of the sums of row i and column j we see in the formulation outlined above that 7 is the analytical solution to the diffusion equation over the interval 0 δt as a function of position x j given a unit point source located at x i or vice versa with respect to x i and x j if we rewrite 7 as 11 w x i x j d i d j δ t 2 π d i d j δ t d 2 exp x j x i 2 2 d i d j δ t 4 π d i d j 2 δ t d 2 exp x j x i 2 4 d i d j 2 δ t 4 π d δ t d 2 exp x j x i 2 4 d δ t we see that his formulation computes an effective diffusion coefficient d as the arithmetic mean of the diffusion coefficients at particle locations x i and x j or equivalently linearly interpolates the diffusion coefficients between these two points and chooses the value located at the midpoint however as discussed in labolle et al 1996 this linear interpolation fails in the case of discontinuous diffusion coefficients without the inclusion of some sort of reflection scheme to account for the infinite divergence in d at the interface put simply this method only yields favorable results when d x can be reasonably approximated with a linear fit over distances on the order of ℓ d i d j δ t and clearly a linear approximation of an infinitely steep gradient will not suffice we note here that if we employ a harmonic mean to compute d in 11 we can obtain low error results in 1d and in certain 2d cases but this approximation is not reliable in general as such it would seem that we need a more flexible functional form for our weighting function w and the best possible choice would be the analytical solution to the diffusion equation that accounts for discontinuities in d x 3 2 1 analytical solution for mass transfer weight function carslaw and jaeger 1959 present a relatively simple solution in 1d for the problem of two subdomains we generalize that solution here for an instantaneous pulse of unit concentration at location x x 0 and time t 0 i e c t 0 x δ x x 0 more specifically for a chosen γ we define the subdomains to be ω 1 γ and ω 2 γ each with constant diffusion coefficients d 1 and d 2 respectively see fig 1 a for a conceptual depiction of this system if x 0 γ we have 12 c a t x c 1 t x d 1 d 2 i ω 1 x c 2 t x d 1 d 2 i ω 2 x where ia z is the indicator function on the set a such that 13 i a z 1 z a 0 z a and 14 c 1 t x d 1 d 2 d 2 d 1 π d 1 d 2 t 1 2 d 2 d 1 d 1 d 2 exp x γ x 0 γ d 1 d 2 2 4 d 1 t 15 c 2 t x d 1 d 2 1 2 π d 2 t exp x x 0 2 4 d 2 t d 2 d 1 d 1 d 2 2 d 2 d 1 d 1 d 2 π d 2 t exp x x 0 2 γ 2 4 d 2 t and if x 0 γ the complementary solution is 16 c a t x c 2 t x d 2 d 1 i ω 1 x c 1 t x d 2 d 1 i ω 2 x for the sake of compact notation we may combine 12 and 16 into 17 w a t x c a t x x 0 i ω 1 x 0 c a t x x 0 i ω 2 x 0 we note that the solution given in 17 is not symmetric with respect to x and x 0 this is seen most clearly in the numerator of the exponential term in 14 however in application and due to the sharp decay in the exponential 17 is typically symmetric to the order of machine precision as our objective is to eliminate errors including those from a lack of symmetry we alter the mass transfer algorithm given in 5 such that 18 m i t δ t m i t j 1 n w i j m j t j 1 n w j i m i t in which the mass of particle i at time t δ t is its mass at time t plus the sum of all the incoming mass transfers minus the sum of all outgoing mass transfers also because w i j w j i we now strictly define w i j to be the normalized weight for the mass transfer from particle j to particle i the converse is no longer true eq 18 may be rewritten in an analogous form to 8 with 19 t i w diag 1 t w if we use 17 as our weighting function in 19 again employing the symmetric normalization given in 10 to form w because w is almost certainly symmetric to machine precision then we obtain a mass transfer method that generates very little error in simulating this system the algorithm for conducting a single mass transfer within a timestep of length δt according to this method is given in algorithm 1 in which wtfunction is defined to be 17 a major drawback of this method is that we must possess an analytic solution to the system of interest granted for small δt this solution is still relatively flexible for example we can still use this solution in the case of a 1d domain with three subdomains considered in section 4 provided that the time step is sufficiently small or the magnitude of diffusion in the center domain is low enough that mass transfers do not see two subdomain boundaries at the same time calculating an analytical solution is a non trivial enterprise in spatial dimensions greater than one particularly if we have a more complicated interface for instance a 2 2 tiling of 4 subdomains in 2d which we consider in section 4 in fact even for the relatively simple 2d problem of two half planes split by the line x γ as considered in section 4 2 the analytical solution is quite complex and likely infeasible as a mass transfer kernel see shendeleva 2001 as such we seek a semi analytical solution to the discontinuous d x problem valid for small δt that will be flexible enough that it may be applied by extension to higher dimensional problems we discuss this approach in the following section 3 2 2 semi analytical solution for mass transfer weight function in order to formulate our semi analytical solution to the problem of a discontinuous diffusion coefficient we take a predictor corrector approach much like that described in section 3 1 labolle et al 2000 we consider the same 1d problem setup outlined in section 3 2 1 however for x 0 γ our semi analytical solution shall have the form 20 c s t x c r x d 1 δ t i x c x c k x d 2 δ t i ω 2 x where the subscript k stands for keep because this represents the amount of solute that is kept in the domain where it started and is distributed according to a diffusion coefficient of d 2 and the subscript r stands for redistribute because this represents the mass that is redistributed according to a diffusion coefficient of d 1 and xc is some corrected x value that alters the support of the cr solution so that 20 conserves mass also we make the distinction that ck and cr are parameterized by the necessarily small time step δt rather than being functions of t because this solution is only valid for short time in 20 we define 21 c k x d 2 δ t 1 4 π d 2 δ t exp x x 0 2 4 d 2 δ t 22 c r x d 1 δ t 1 4 π d 1 δ t exp x x 0 2 4 d 1 δ t integrating each of these expressions over their respective support in order to compute the total mass in each branch of the total solution gives 23 m k γ c k x d x 1 2 1 erf γ x 0 4 d 2 δ t 24 m r x c c r x d x 1 2 1 erf x 0 x c 4 d 1 δ t where erf is the error function setting m total 1 m k m r and solving for xc yields 25 x c x 0 x 0 γ d 1 d 2 and we may repeat the calculations above for x 0 γ with the solution 26 c s t x c k x d 1 δ t i ω 1 x c r x d 2 δ t i x c x to find 27 x c x 0 x 0 γ d 2 d 1 as in section 3 2 1 we may combine 20 and 26 into one general solution namely 28 w s t x c s δ t x x 0 i ω 1 x 0 c s δ t x x 0 i ω 2 x 0 unfortunately if we use ws as the wtfunction in algorithm 1 we obtain solutions that display a troubling amount of oscillation near the subdomain boundary see fig 2 this is because we no longer have a symmetric weight matrix even numerically due to ws lacking symmetry with respect to x and x 0 and as a result it also no longer makes sense to apply the symmetric normalization given in 10 in order for the mass transfer method to both conserve mass and generate solutions with low error we must make the following changes 1 we normalize the weight matrix and form w by employing the sinkhorn knopp sk algorithm knight 2008 a computationally efficient iterative method for obtaining a doubly stochastic matrix that is mathematically equivalent to alternately normalizing the rows and the columns of a matrix to sum to unity in order to conserve mass the columns must be normalized last and must sum to unity with high precision we find that for all of the cases we considered 1000 iterations produced satisfactory results 2 we employ a weight matrix that is the transpose of that used in algorithm 1 i e w i j w s δ t x x j x 0 x i to contrast note that if we use 28 in algorithm 1 we have w i j w s δ t x x i x 0 x j this is done purely for numerical convenience as applying the sk algorithm to w converges more reliably to the desired stochastic matrix w than applying sk to w in fact starting with w leads to solutions that display a kink near the boundary and much greater resolution in both time and space is required to generate acceptable solutions written in the sum form of 5 and 18 after normalizing w via sk to form w the above amounts to 29 or in matrix vector form we have 30 m t δ t w m t the algorithm for conducting mass transfers within a timestep of length δt according to this modified method is presented in pseudocode in algorithm 2 in which wtfunction is defined to be 28 we note that the normalization conducted at lines 6 9 in algorithm 2 is not strictly the sk algorithm but is instead meant to be demonstrative rather than computationally efficient extension to 2d a major advantage of our semi analytical solution is that it is straightforward to extend to 2d by applying the same strategy as used in 1d let us first consider the case of 2 subdomains that are split by the line x γ ω 1 γ r and ω 2 γ r with respective constant diffusion coefficients d 1 d 2 the initial condition is again the instantaneous point source c t 0 x δ x x 0 and x 0 x 0 y 0 see fig 1 b for a conceptual depiction of this system in this case our general solution is nearly identical to the 1d case namely 31 w s t x c s δ t x x 0 i ω 1 x 0 c s δ t x x 0 i ω 2 x 0 where cs and c s are the same as in 20 and 26 and the form of ck and cr are merely altered to contain 2d gaussian functions i e 32 c i 2d x d δ t 1 4 π d δ t exp x x 0 2 4 d δ t i k r d d 1 d 2 the extension to a more complicated subdomain interface is also straightforward in this case we consider a 2 2 tiling of 4 subdomains in 2d and this condition captures the challenges presented by a highly heterogeneous diffusion velocity field that is discretized on a grid perhaps generated by a finite difference method specifically the challenge is that mass originating in a given quadrant can end up in any or all of the three neighboring quadrants with the most complicated path being the diagonal one across the origin for this problem the full domain ω is split along the lines x γ x and y γ y thus we have ω 1 γ x γ y ω 2 γ x γ y ω 3 γ x γ y ω 4 γ x γ y with respective constant diffusion coefficients d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 once again the initial condition has the form c t 0 x δ x x 0 with x 0 x 0 y 0 see fig 1 c for a conceptual depiction of this system the general solution may be written 33 w s t x c s 1 δ t x x 0 i ω 1 x 0 c s 2 δ t x x 0 i ω 2 x 0 c s 3 δ t x x 0 i ω 3 x 0 c s 4 δ t x x 0 i ω 4 x 0 above the portion of the solution corresponding to x 0 ω1 is composed of the sum of four local solutions with the form of 32 namely 34 c s 1 t x c k 2d x d 1 δ t i ω 1 x c r 2d x d 2 δ t i x c 12 γ y x c r 2d x d 3 δ t i x c 13 y c 13 x c r 2d x d 4 δ t i γ x y c 14 x where x c i j and y c i j are the x and or y corrections for the mass transfers from subdomain ω i to ω j and are calculated so as to ensure conservation of mass similar to the 1d problem we have 35 x c 12 x 0 x 0 γ x d 2 d 1 x c 13 x 0 x 0 γ x d 3 d 1 y c 13 y 0 y 0 γ y d 3 d 1 y c 14 y 0 y 0 γ y d 4 d 1 and the calculations are analogous for the portions of 33 corresponding to the other subdomains as in the 1d case the solutions given in 31 and 33 do not conserve mass if they are used as the wtfunction in algorithm 1 but they do conserve mass and generate minimal error if they are used in algorithm 2 4 results in this section we consider the results of applying the mtpt algorithm described in section 3 2 to solve a series of increasingly complicated test problems involving discontinuous d x to do this we constrain our tests to only the mass transfer mt portion of the mtpt algorithm i e stationary particles that do not random walk and we compare the results of our simulation to known solutions in the simple 1d case of 2 subdomains we compare our mtpt results to an analytical solution and in all other cases we use the established rwpt predictor corrector method of labolle et al 2000 as our baseline for comparison we note that the idealized case of stationary evenly spaced particles we consider does not appear to bear much resemblance to an actual lagrangian or particle tracking method in which particles are stochastically positioned due to random walk diffusion however even when particles random walk the mt algorithm is fully deterministic within each timestep and in fact is conceptually a finite difference scheme with a stochastic stencil in previous work the evenly spaced stationary condition is shown to bear more similarity to the random walking particle case than it does to a randomly spaced stationary condition sole mari et al 2019b the reason for this is that when particles random walk they are on average equally spaced at any given time whereas randomly spaced stationary particles inevitably contain persistent gaps between particles that degrade solution accuracy as a result in order to isolate the performance of the mt algorithm and analyze its accuracy we choose to simulate the algorithm on evenly spaced stationary particles from an algorithmic standpoint we generate the mtpt results according to algorithm 2 and we use the appropriate semi analytical solution as wtfunction for the mtpt case we model the initial condition by assigning the mass corresponding to unit mass to the particle located at x 0 and in the rwpt case we place all particles at location x 0 each with mass 1 n we then simulate a purely diffusive system with discontinuous d x up to final time t for mtpt constructing the numerical solution at final time is as simple as plotting the concentration on each particle versus its position however in the case of rwpt particles must first be binned to construct concentrations equal length in 1d and equal area squares in 2d and the number of bins was chosen in each case so as to balance between low resolution and noisiness lastly for simplicity all dimensioned quantities are unitless all numerical simulations were conducted in matlab using a macbook pro with a 2 9 ghz intel core i5 processor and 8 gb of ram the code used to generate the results in this section is available at http doi org 10 5281 zenodo 3706926 schmidt 2020 4 1 1d results we begin with the simplest case of a 1d domain with two subdomains as described in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 and we hold d 1 5 0 constant while we test 3 values of d 2 ranging from half the magnitude of d 1 to two orders of magnitude smaller in the simulations we employ 5000 particles for the mtpt simulations and 1 million particles in the rwpt simulations grouped into 100 bins for plotting we choose a timestep of length δ t 10 2 with a total simulation time t 6 we first examine what occurs when we apply the original mtpt method that our proposed algorithm is based upon i e using 7 as the weighting function in 9 benson and bolster 2016 schmidt et al 2018 benson et al 2020 these results are shown in fig 3 and we see that the original mt algorithm holds up for a small magnitude difference in the diffusion coefficient as when d 1 d 2 5 2 5 however when the disparity becomes larger the accuracy deteriorates and the mtpt solution is quite poor for d 1 d 2 5 0 05 as compared to the analytical solution and the rwpt results the results of applying our new mt algorithm i e the semi analytical solution given in 28 used within algorithm 2 are depicted in fig 4 comparing mtpt results both to the analytical solution given in 17 and the rwpt results we see very close agreement between all solutions indicating that our proposed approach is successful here and that we may move on to more complicated cases the next experiment we conduct focuses on a 1d problem with three subdomains ω1 ω2 and ω3 with their own respective diffusion coefficients representing diffusion in for example a layered system we hold d 1 5 0 and d 3 0 05 so as to span two orders of magnitude and we test three values of d 2 2 5 1 0 0 5 in the central subdomain in the simulations we employ 5000 particles for the mtpt simulations and 1 million particles in the rwpt simulations grouped into 100 bins for plotting and we choose a timestep of length δ t 10 2 with a total simulation time of t 6 the results of this experiment are displayed in fig 5 because this problem has no simple analytical solution we take the rwpt results as our baseline case and find very close agreement of the mtpt results with the baseline 4 2 2d results moving to 2d we first consider the case of 2 subdomains split along the line x γ corresponding to the semi analytical solution given in 31 for these simulations we hold d 1 5 0 and test d 2 2 5 1 0 0 5 in the simulations we employ 10201 particles for the mtpt simulations 101 101 equally spaced particles with the number chosen so as to capture the integer valued source location and 10 million particles in the rwpt simulations grouped into 6400 bins for plotting and choose a timestep of length δ t 10 1 with a total simulation time of t 6 the results of this experiment are shown in figs 6 and 7 in fig 6 we see good visual agreement of the mtpt solutions to the rwpt baseline and this is verified by plotting the constant concentration contours on the same axes in fig 7 where the match is seen to be nearly exact aside from the slight noise induced by the randomness in the rwpt simulation the next problem we consider is the 2d example of 4 subdomains split along the lines x γ x and y γ y corresponding to the semi analytical solution given in 33 for these simulations the four cases we consider in terms of choices for d i i 1 4 are 1 4 different values for di spanning an order of magnitude and 3 equal values for di and one value that is an order of magnitude smaller with 2 source location in a subdomain laterally adjacent to the small value of di 3 source location in the subdomain containing the small value value of di and 4 source location in a subdomain diagonally adjacent to the small value of di of these four cases case 4 is the least interesting as the majority of solute remains in the three subdomains with large di so we do not depict results of this simulation though they were always favorable in the simulations we employ 40 401 particles for the mtpt simulations 201 201 equally spaced particles and 10 million particles in the rwpt simulations grouped into 6400 bins for plotting and we choose a timestep of length δ t 10 1 for the mtpt simulations and δ t 10 2 for the rwpt simulations this was required to generate smooth enough results for comparison with a total simulation time of t 3 the results of this experiment are shown in figs 8 and 9 in fig 8 we see favorable visual agreement of the mtpt solutions to the rwpt baseline and this is confirmed by the overlaid constant concentration contour plots depicted in fig 9 we note that in the 2d experiments we only consider a single order or magnitude difference between diffusion coefficients this was in favor of fast run times as the required number of particles for a mtpt simulation is dictated by the inter particle spacing which must be on the order of ℓ 2 d δ t where d is the smallest diffusion coefficient in the system however there are no theoretical barriers to considering larger disparities in d x 4 3 speed and accuracy here we address two measures of algorithmic performance for our proposed mtpt method for discontinuous d x first as to speed run times for the mtpt method are consistently lower than those for corresponding rwpt solutions for example to generate the 1d 2 subdomain results discussed in section 4 1 and depicted in fig 4 the mtpt simulations run approximately 4 5 times faster than the rwpt simulations to which the solutions are compared for the 2d 4 subdomain case discussed in section 4 2 and depicted in figs 6 and 9 the mtpt simulations run approximately 1 5 times faster than the rwpt simulations this speedup for mtpt can primarily be attributed to the fact that mass transfer interactions only occur among nearest neighbors and this allows for speedup via sparse linear algebra note however that these run time comparisons are for reference only as both algorithms can be optimized in various ways and that was not the goal of this work as to accuracy we perform a convergence analysis for the proposed mtpt algorithm to see how error is affected by the level of discretization i e refinements in time step length δt or increase in particle number n this convergence analysis considers the 1d 2 subdomain case and we compute error in comparison to the analytical solution given in section 3 2 1 for each convergence analysis we employ all of the same parameters as were used to generate the results in section 4 1 and depicted in fig 4 varying only δt or n in successive refinements the results for a convergence analysis in terms of δt are depicted in fig 10 and therein we plot error in terms of the ℓ and ℓ2 norms as a function of δt for each of the three values of d 2 we consider in section 4 1 fig 4 for each of the error curves we also plot a reference o δ t p line of best fit to obtain the order of convergence p and we see the general trend of what appears to be p 1 2 order of convergence and this is demonstrated most clearly in the ℓ norm the results for a convergence analysis in terms of n are depicted in fig 11 and therein we plot error in terms of the ℓ norm and root mean squared error rmse as a function of n for each of the three values of d 2 we consider in section 4 1 fig 4 we note that we employ rmse here as opposed to the ℓ2 norm to normalize for varying vector length in this case we see a period of rapid convergence with increasing n before error levels off to a minimal level that is controlled by the time discretization and this is the expected behavior that is commonly seen in mtpt methods schmidt et al 2018 2019a 5 conclusions discontinuous diffusion coefficients arise naturally within simulations of transport through heterogeneous porous media but accurately modeling diffusion across these interfaces has remained an outstanding problem for mtpt algorithms here we have generalized mtpt algorithms to addresses this deficiency including for multi dimensional systems this is a significant advance both from a numerical perspective and in terms of improving the realism of such simulations additionally these results serve to eliminate one of the few remaining barriers that limit the capabilities of lagrangian methods in comparison to their eulerian counterparts in particular within the current work we have 1 generalized the mt algorithm to incorporate non symmetric mass transfer kernels 2 presented an mt algorithm that employs a relatively simple 1d analytic solution to the discontinuous d x problem 3 derived a semi analytical solution to the discontinuous d x problem that is straightforward to generalize to higher dimensions and complicated subdomain interfaces 4 presented an mt algorithm that incorporates this semi analytical solution 5 applied this updated mtpt algorithm to a variety of test cases including a 2d problem that corresponds to a standard velocity grid with order of magnitude differences in d x 6 attained favorable results of this application of the new mtpt algorithm additionally while not considered in this work it would be a simple matter to handle moving subdomain interfaces with this algorithm this is because particle interactions occur pairwise and to make the relevant mass transfer the only required information is each particle s mass position and local diffusion coefficient which are easy enough to establish within a timestep no matter the current orientation of a subdomain boundary open questions remain in this direction however for instance what would be the effect of running a hybrid version of mtpt including diffusive random walks in the algorithm and how would it affect the accuracy of solutions or how might the solution be generalized to subdomains that possess more complicated geometry for example boundaries that are not right angles such as on a triangulated grid or boundaries that are not straight lines at all e g sole mari et al 2019a additionally we have only considered the scalar or isotropic d x case because it is common in the mtpt literature to simulate large scale anisotropic spreading by random walks and the micro scale isotropic mixing process by mass transfers schmidt et al 2018 benson et al 2019a in summary we have extended the capabilities of mtpt methods to solve the problem of discontinuous diffusion coefficients thus adding flexibility to a tool that already is able to model arbitrarily complex reactions including fluid solid interactions separately simulate macro scale spreading and micro scale mixing capture arbitrarily fine resolution

489,the problem of a spatially discontinuous diffusion coefficient d x is one that may be encountered in hydrogeologic systems due to natural geological features or as a consequence of numerical discretization of flow properties to date mass transfer particle tracking mtpt methods a family of lagrangian methods in which diffusion is jointly simulated by random walk and diffusive mass transfers have been unable to solve this problem this manuscript presents a new mass transfer mt algorithm that enables mtpt methods to accurately solve the problem of discontinuous d x to achieve this we derive a semi analytical solution to the discontinuous d x problem by employing a predictor corrector approach and we use this semi analytical solution as the weighting function in a reformulated mt algorithm this semi analytical solution is generalized for cases with multiple 1d interfaces as well as for 2d cases including a 2 2 tiling of 4 subdomains that corresponds to a numerically generated diffusion field the solutions generated by this new mass transfer algorithm closely agree with an analytical 1d solution or in more complicated cases trusted numerical results demonstrating the success of our proposed approach keywords lagrangian modeling particle methods mass transfer particle tracking imperfect mixing diffusion reaction equation composite porous media discontinuous diffusion coefficients 1 introduction simulating diffusive transport under the condition of a spatially discontinuous diffusion coefficient is a challenging problem that is frequently encountered in hydrogeological contexts uffink 1983 labolle et al 2000 appuhamillage et al 2010 semra et al 1970 oukili et al 2019 physically this can occur wherever there is an abrupt change in the material properties of a medium like the sharp interfaces between different depositional units sharp discontinuities can also be seen in for example fractured or composite media local compaction zones or at the interface between a saturated and unsaturated zone from a numerical perspective any non constant hydraulic conductivity field that is discretized will generate a diffusion dispersion field containing numerous discontinuities interpolation or averaging methods have been used in the past to smooth these discontinuities and these can be effective as long as the differences in magnitude of the parameter s across the interface is sufficiently small in general less than an order of magnitude however when the difference in diffusion coefficients between cells or regions of a domain becomes sufficiently large the simplest versions of these methods can fail and overcoming this challenge requires a more nuanced approach random walk particle tracking rwpt methods are a class of stochastic lagrangian mesh free or gridless methods that are commonly used to simulate advective diffusive transport these methods were originally formulated in the context of conservative non chemically reactive transport or cases of simple linear reactions such as sorbing solutes or first order decay labolle et al 1996 salamon et al 2006 they are popular because they introduce no numerical diffusion into the simulation of the advection hyperbolic operator and they also escape the burden imposed by restrictive stability conditions in eulerian grid based methods resulting in lower run times than corresponding eulerian methods benson et al 2017 further because rwpt is a stochastic algorithm statistics of concentrations can be readily generated instead of expected values point estimates in this context the problem of discontinuous diffusion coefficients has received much attention resulting in various methods for overcoming the difficulties of simulating such a system e g uffink 1983 appuhamillage et al 2010 semra et al 1970 hoteit et al 2002 bechtold et al 2011 oukili et al 2019 bagtzoglou et al 1992 labolle et al 1996 2000 each with their own merits and drawbacks one of the major advantages of classical rwpt is its speed due to the fact that every particle is completely independent of its neighbors however this also means that complex reactions cannot be simulated since particle interactions are not allowed recent developments in the field of rwpt have enabled methods to simulate complex and nonlinear chemical reactions in the presence of transport using either collision based reactions between particles of opposite species benson and meerschaert 2008 paster et al 2014 bolster et al 2016 schmidt et al 2017 sole mari et al 2017 sole mari and fernàndez garcia 2018 or by treating individual particles as reaction volumes that communicate via diffusive mass transfers benson and bolster 2016 the latter referred to as mass transfer particle tracking mtpt algorithms offer the increased flexibility of being able to model arbitrarily complex chemical reactions at relatively low computational cost engdahl et al 2017 schmidt et al 2019b including generalized reactions such as the aging of water parcels benson et al 2019b the mass transfer mt portion of these mtpt methods has been demonstrated to solve the diffusion equation to o δ t schmidt et al 2018 and exhibit superlinear convergence as particle numbers grow large schmidt et al 2019a additionally a method for parallelizing the mtpt method via domain decomposition has recently been developed and achieves linear speedup up to hundreds of computational cores subdomains engdahl et al 2019 mtpt methods have also been shown to be related to smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph methods e g herrera et al 2009 herrera and beckie 2013 gingold and monaghan 1977 monaghan 2012 under specific modeling choices including the use of a gaussian spatial kernel sole mari et al 2019b despite these advances past work on mtpt methods has neither addressed the impact of a discrete parameter field on the mass transfer operations nor accounted for the possible errors that may be incurred all previously mentioned random walk methods may be employed for diffusion coefficients with spatial discontinuities because they are capable of simulating small scale mixing and non mixed spreading of solute separately benson et al 2019a in other words spreading may be simulated by a random walk and mixing as a mass transfer however accuracy of the mass transfer step is only preserved for a smoothly varying field i e one in which interpolation may be reasonably performed and the current mtpt schemes incur error when there is a sharp discontinuity this is similar to the problems identified by labolle et al 2000 for classical rwpt mtpt has clear applications for highly accurate simulations of mixing limited reactive transport but this issue undermines its accuracy thus the purpose of the current paper is to address this deficiency and ensure that mtpt methods remain accurate even in such a case in section 2 we outline the specific mathematical problem on which we will focus and introduce the methods used to solve the problem in section 3 in section 3 1 we provide a brief overview of rwpt methods and discuss how the problem of discontinuous diffusion coefficients is typically handled with specific focus on a particular predictor corrector technique labolle et al 2000 that we extend to mtpt in section 3 2 we outline our approach to solving the discontinuous diffusion coefficient problem with an mtpt method by employing an alternative mass transfer kernel section 4 is devoted to discussing the results of applying the new mtpt method finally section 5 presents the conclusions drawn from our work 2 analytic model we consider a chemically conservative single species purely diffusive system that may be described by the heterogeneous diffusion equation 1 c t d x c x ω r d t 0 where c t x mol l d is the concentration of the single species d x l 2 t 1 is the scalar diffusion coefficient which for our purposes may be a function of space for this work we concern ourselves with the condition where d may be discontinuous this case leads to infinite spatial derivatives at all discontinuities so the question is how best to numerically evaluate the d term within the chosen method to minimize artifacts of the discontinuity the discontinuity we use for this study is created by partitioning the domain ω into n ω subdomains such that ω ω 1 ω 2 ω n ω where each subdomain has its own constant valued diffusion coefficient d i i 1 n ω and the interface between subdomains i and j is denoted γij 3 computational methods 3 1 random walk particle tracking method the classical lagrangian method for simulating the system of interest is standard random walk particle tracking rwpt thomson 1987 labolle et al 1996 in these methods masses are divided among particles that simulate diffusion via the langevin equation formulated for homogeneous d 2 x i t δ t x i t ξ i 2 d δ t where x i t is the position of particle i at time t δt is the chosen simulated timestep and ξ i is a d dimensional vector of random numbers drawn from a standard normal n 0 1 distribution in this basic form rwpt methods are unable to simulate the problem of discontinuous diffusion coefficients d x described in section 2 conceptually the problem is that during the course of a single step random walk a particle may see diffusion at the rates on both sides of the discontinuity in d x however there are well documented strategies for overcoming this the first general group of strategies are reflection methods uffink 1983 appuhamillage et al 2010 semra et al 1970 hoteit et al 2002 which may include a nonlinearly decomposed time step bechtold et al 2011 interpolation methods bagtzoglou et al 1992 or a combination thereof labolle et al 1996 a selection of these are reviewed and compared in labolle et al 1998 and the conclusion reached therein is that among the methods considered those of uffink 1983 semra et al 1970 provide the best accuracy a benchmark comparison of various methods is also conducted by lejay and pichot 2016 who distinguish between methods that preserve or lose important physical and numerical properties and recent work of the same authors presents a method that employs skew brownian motion densities with exponential timestepping to capture the dynamics of the discontinuous d x problem lejay et al 2019 another recent approach oukili et al 2019 employs negative mass particles in a partial reflection scheme so as to keep the total mass in a system constant and maintain particle independence to demonstrate how discontinuous d x is handled with rwpt and because we later use this method to generate reference solutions we briefly discuss the work of labolle et al 2000 we consider this method because it bears resemblance to the algorithm we present in section 3 2 also it is relatively simple to implement and the extension to greater than one spatial dimension is straightforward unlike some other approaches this method may be thought of as a predictor corrector approach and is formulated as 3 x i x i t ξ i 2 d x i δ t 4 x i t δ t x i t ξ i 2 d x i δ t in words a predictor random walk is first taken from x i t to x i in 3 to determine the diffusion coefficient that is then used in the corrected random walk from x i t to x i t δ t in 4 a subtle but important point is that the same random number ξ i must be used in 4 that was generated for 3 3 2 mass transfer particle tracking method another family of lagrangian methods that has gained attention recently are the mass transfer particle tracking mtpt methods which are the focus of this work benson and bolster 2016 engdahl et al 2017 schmidt et al 2018 2019a 2019b these methods are quite similar to rwpt methods in that diffusion is typically still simulated in part by random walks however the important distinction is that particle masses are no longer fixed and can be transferred among particles according to an algorithm that also simulates diffusion the mt algorithm may be given as 5 m i t δ t m i t j 1 n w i j m j t m i t where mi t is the mass carried by particle i at time t n is the number of particles and 6 w i j w x i x j h ρ i j note that this formulation is equivalent to choosing β 1 in the context of sole mari et al 2019b above w is a gaussian weighting function that determines the amount of mass transferred from particle j to particle i or vice versa because w in this case is symmetric with respect to x i and x j and ρij is a normalizing constant that ensures conservation of mass we specify here that this normalization would not be required in the limiting infinite particle case but for any finite number of particles n samples from the weighting function w which is necessarily a density will not sum to unity and thus not conserve mass as such we normalize our discretized density according to 6 in the case of isotropic diffusion we have 7 w x i x j d i d j δ t 2 π d i d j δ t d 2 exp x j x i 2 2 d i d j δ t where d 1 2 3 is the number of spatial dimensions and dk d x k the matrix vector form of 5 is written as 8 m t δ t t m t in which 9 t i w diag w 1 where i is the n n identity matrix 1 is an n 1 vector of ones and diag x is a square matrix with the entries of vector x on its main diagonal a popular choice for ρij that results in symmetric w and thus conservation of mass by the operator t is 10 ρ i j w 1 i 1 t w j 2 or in words ρij is the arithmetic mean of the sums of row i and column j we see in the formulation outlined above that 7 is the analytical solution to the diffusion equation over the interval 0 δt as a function of position x j given a unit point source located at x i or vice versa with respect to x i and x j if we rewrite 7 as 11 w x i x j d i d j δ t 2 π d i d j δ t d 2 exp x j x i 2 2 d i d j δ t 4 π d i d j 2 δ t d 2 exp x j x i 2 4 d i d j 2 δ t 4 π d δ t d 2 exp x j x i 2 4 d δ t we see that his formulation computes an effective diffusion coefficient d as the arithmetic mean of the diffusion coefficients at particle locations x i and x j or equivalently linearly interpolates the diffusion coefficients between these two points and chooses the value located at the midpoint however as discussed in labolle et al 1996 this linear interpolation fails in the case of discontinuous diffusion coefficients without the inclusion of some sort of reflection scheme to account for the infinite divergence in d at the interface put simply this method only yields favorable results when d x can be reasonably approximated with a linear fit over distances on the order of ℓ d i d j δ t and clearly a linear approximation of an infinitely steep gradient will not suffice we note here that if we employ a harmonic mean to compute d in 11 we can obtain low error results in 1d and in certain 2d cases but this approximation is not reliable in general as such it would seem that we need a more flexible functional form for our weighting function w and the best possible choice would be the analytical solution to the diffusion equation that accounts for discontinuities in d x 3 2 1 analytical solution for mass transfer weight function carslaw and jaeger 1959 present a relatively simple solution in 1d for the problem of two subdomains we generalize that solution here for an instantaneous pulse of unit concentration at location x x 0 and time t 0 i e c t 0 x δ x x 0 more specifically for a chosen γ we define the subdomains to be ω 1 γ and ω 2 γ each with constant diffusion coefficients d 1 and d 2 respectively see fig 1 a for a conceptual depiction of this system if x 0 γ we have 12 c a t x c 1 t x d 1 d 2 i ω 1 x c 2 t x d 1 d 2 i ω 2 x where ia z is the indicator function on the set a such that 13 i a z 1 z a 0 z a and 14 c 1 t x d 1 d 2 d 2 d 1 π d 1 d 2 t 1 2 d 2 d 1 d 1 d 2 exp x γ x 0 γ d 1 d 2 2 4 d 1 t 15 c 2 t x d 1 d 2 1 2 π d 2 t exp x x 0 2 4 d 2 t d 2 d 1 d 1 d 2 2 d 2 d 1 d 1 d 2 π d 2 t exp x x 0 2 γ 2 4 d 2 t and if x 0 γ the complementary solution is 16 c a t x c 2 t x d 2 d 1 i ω 1 x c 1 t x d 2 d 1 i ω 2 x for the sake of compact notation we may combine 12 and 16 into 17 w a t x c a t x x 0 i ω 1 x 0 c a t x x 0 i ω 2 x 0 we note that the solution given in 17 is not symmetric with respect to x and x 0 this is seen most clearly in the numerator of the exponential term in 14 however in application and due to the sharp decay in the exponential 17 is typically symmetric to the order of machine precision as our objective is to eliminate errors including those from a lack of symmetry we alter the mass transfer algorithm given in 5 such that 18 m i t δ t m i t j 1 n w i j m j t j 1 n w j i m i t in which the mass of particle i at time t δ t is its mass at time t plus the sum of all the incoming mass transfers minus the sum of all outgoing mass transfers also because w i j w j i we now strictly define w i j to be the normalized weight for the mass transfer from particle j to particle i the converse is no longer true eq 18 may be rewritten in an analogous form to 8 with 19 t i w diag 1 t w if we use 17 as our weighting function in 19 again employing the symmetric normalization given in 10 to form w because w is almost certainly symmetric to machine precision then we obtain a mass transfer method that generates very little error in simulating this system the algorithm for conducting a single mass transfer within a timestep of length δt according to this method is given in algorithm 1 in which wtfunction is defined to be 17 a major drawback of this method is that we must possess an analytic solution to the system of interest granted for small δt this solution is still relatively flexible for example we can still use this solution in the case of a 1d domain with three subdomains considered in section 4 provided that the time step is sufficiently small or the magnitude of diffusion in the center domain is low enough that mass transfers do not see two subdomain boundaries at the same time calculating an analytical solution is a non trivial enterprise in spatial dimensions greater than one particularly if we have a more complicated interface for instance a 2 2 tiling of 4 subdomains in 2d which we consider in section 4 in fact even for the relatively simple 2d problem of two half planes split by the line x γ as considered in section 4 2 the analytical solution is quite complex and likely infeasible as a mass transfer kernel see shendeleva 2001 as such we seek a semi analytical solution to the discontinuous d x problem valid for small δt that will be flexible enough that it may be applied by extension to higher dimensional problems we discuss this approach in the following section 3 2 2 semi analytical solution for mass transfer weight function in order to formulate our semi analytical solution to the problem of a discontinuous diffusion coefficient we take a predictor corrector approach much like that described in section 3 1 labolle et al 2000 we consider the same 1d problem setup outlined in section 3 2 1 however for x 0 γ our semi analytical solution shall have the form 20 c s t x c r x d 1 δ t i x c x c k x d 2 δ t i ω 2 x where the subscript k stands for keep because this represents the amount of solute that is kept in the domain where it started and is distributed according to a diffusion coefficient of d 2 and the subscript r stands for redistribute because this represents the mass that is redistributed according to a diffusion coefficient of d 1 and xc is some corrected x value that alters the support of the cr solution so that 20 conserves mass also we make the distinction that ck and cr are parameterized by the necessarily small time step δt rather than being functions of t because this solution is only valid for short time in 20 we define 21 c k x d 2 δ t 1 4 π d 2 δ t exp x x 0 2 4 d 2 δ t 22 c r x d 1 δ t 1 4 π d 1 δ t exp x x 0 2 4 d 1 δ t integrating each of these expressions over their respective support in order to compute the total mass in each branch of the total solution gives 23 m k γ c k x d x 1 2 1 erf γ x 0 4 d 2 δ t 24 m r x c c r x d x 1 2 1 erf x 0 x c 4 d 1 δ t where erf is the error function setting m total 1 m k m r and solving for xc yields 25 x c x 0 x 0 γ d 1 d 2 and we may repeat the calculations above for x 0 γ with the solution 26 c s t x c k x d 1 δ t i ω 1 x c r x d 2 δ t i x c x to find 27 x c x 0 x 0 γ d 2 d 1 as in section 3 2 1 we may combine 20 and 26 into one general solution namely 28 w s t x c s δ t x x 0 i ω 1 x 0 c s δ t x x 0 i ω 2 x 0 unfortunately if we use ws as the wtfunction in algorithm 1 we obtain solutions that display a troubling amount of oscillation near the subdomain boundary see fig 2 this is because we no longer have a symmetric weight matrix even numerically due to ws lacking symmetry with respect to x and x 0 and as a result it also no longer makes sense to apply the symmetric normalization given in 10 in order for the mass transfer method to both conserve mass and generate solutions with low error we must make the following changes 1 we normalize the weight matrix and form w by employing the sinkhorn knopp sk algorithm knight 2008 a computationally efficient iterative method for obtaining a doubly stochastic matrix that is mathematically equivalent to alternately normalizing the rows and the columns of a matrix to sum to unity in order to conserve mass the columns must be normalized last and must sum to unity with high precision we find that for all of the cases we considered 1000 iterations produced satisfactory results 2 we employ a weight matrix that is the transpose of that used in algorithm 1 i e w i j w s δ t x x j x 0 x i to contrast note that if we use 28 in algorithm 1 we have w i j w s δ t x x i x 0 x j this is done purely for numerical convenience as applying the sk algorithm to w converges more reliably to the desired stochastic matrix w than applying sk to w in fact starting with w leads to solutions that display a kink near the boundary and much greater resolution in both time and space is required to generate acceptable solutions written in the sum form of 5 and 18 after normalizing w via sk to form w the above amounts to 29 or in matrix vector form we have 30 m t δ t w m t the algorithm for conducting mass transfers within a timestep of length δt according to this modified method is presented in pseudocode in algorithm 2 in which wtfunction is defined to be 28 we note that the normalization conducted at lines 6 9 in algorithm 2 is not strictly the sk algorithm but is instead meant to be demonstrative rather than computationally efficient extension to 2d a major advantage of our semi analytical solution is that it is straightforward to extend to 2d by applying the same strategy as used in 1d let us first consider the case of 2 subdomains that are split by the line x γ ω 1 γ r and ω 2 γ r with respective constant diffusion coefficients d 1 d 2 the initial condition is again the instantaneous point source c t 0 x δ x x 0 and x 0 x 0 y 0 see fig 1 b for a conceptual depiction of this system in this case our general solution is nearly identical to the 1d case namely 31 w s t x c s δ t x x 0 i ω 1 x 0 c s δ t x x 0 i ω 2 x 0 where cs and c s are the same as in 20 and 26 and the form of ck and cr are merely altered to contain 2d gaussian functions i e 32 c i 2d x d δ t 1 4 π d δ t exp x x 0 2 4 d δ t i k r d d 1 d 2 the extension to a more complicated subdomain interface is also straightforward in this case we consider a 2 2 tiling of 4 subdomains in 2d and this condition captures the challenges presented by a highly heterogeneous diffusion velocity field that is discretized on a grid perhaps generated by a finite difference method specifically the challenge is that mass originating in a given quadrant can end up in any or all of the three neighboring quadrants with the most complicated path being the diagonal one across the origin for this problem the full domain ω is split along the lines x γ x and y γ y thus we have ω 1 γ x γ y ω 2 γ x γ y ω 3 γ x γ y ω 4 γ x γ y with respective constant diffusion coefficients d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 once again the initial condition has the form c t 0 x δ x x 0 with x 0 x 0 y 0 see fig 1 c for a conceptual depiction of this system the general solution may be written 33 w s t x c s 1 δ t x x 0 i ω 1 x 0 c s 2 δ t x x 0 i ω 2 x 0 c s 3 δ t x x 0 i ω 3 x 0 c s 4 δ t x x 0 i ω 4 x 0 above the portion of the solution corresponding to x 0 ω1 is composed of the sum of four local solutions with the form of 32 namely 34 c s 1 t x c k 2d x d 1 δ t i ω 1 x c r 2d x d 2 δ t i x c 12 γ y x c r 2d x d 3 δ t i x c 13 y c 13 x c r 2d x d 4 δ t i γ x y c 14 x where x c i j and y c i j are the x and or y corrections for the mass transfers from subdomain ω i to ω j and are calculated so as to ensure conservation of mass similar to the 1d problem we have 35 x c 12 x 0 x 0 γ x d 2 d 1 x c 13 x 0 x 0 γ x d 3 d 1 y c 13 y 0 y 0 γ y d 3 d 1 y c 14 y 0 y 0 γ y d 4 d 1 and the calculations are analogous for the portions of 33 corresponding to the other subdomains as in the 1d case the solutions given in 31 and 33 do not conserve mass if they are used as the wtfunction in algorithm 1 but they do conserve mass and generate minimal error if they are used in algorithm 2 4 results in this section we consider the results of applying the mtpt algorithm described in section 3 2 to solve a series of increasingly complicated test problems involving discontinuous d x to do this we constrain our tests to only the mass transfer mt portion of the mtpt algorithm i e stationary particles that do not random walk and we compare the results of our simulation to known solutions in the simple 1d case of 2 subdomains we compare our mtpt results to an analytical solution and in all other cases we use the established rwpt predictor corrector method of labolle et al 2000 as our baseline for comparison we note that the idealized case of stationary evenly spaced particles we consider does not appear to bear much resemblance to an actual lagrangian or particle tracking method in which particles are stochastically positioned due to random walk diffusion however even when particles random walk the mt algorithm is fully deterministic within each timestep and in fact is conceptually a finite difference scheme with a stochastic stencil in previous work the evenly spaced stationary condition is shown to bear more similarity to the random walking particle case than it does to a randomly spaced stationary condition sole mari et al 2019b the reason for this is that when particles random walk they are on average equally spaced at any given time whereas randomly spaced stationary particles inevitably contain persistent gaps between particles that degrade solution accuracy as a result in order to isolate the performance of the mt algorithm and analyze its accuracy we choose to simulate the algorithm on evenly spaced stationary particles from an algorithmic standpoint we generate the mtpt results according to algorithm 2 and we use the appropriate semi analytical solution as wtfunction for the mtpt case we model the initial condition by assigning the mass corresponding to unit mass to the particle located at x 0 and in the rwpt case we place all particles at location x 0 each with mass 1 n we then simulate a purely diffusive system with discontinuous d x up to final time t for mtpt constructing the numerical solution at final time is as simple as plotting the concentration on each particle versus its position however in the case of rwpt particles must first be binned to construct concentrations equal length in 1d and equal area squares in 2d and the number of bins was chosen in each case so as to balance between low resolution and noisiness lastly for simplicity all dimensioned quantities are unitless all numerical simulations were conducted in matlab using a macbook pro with a 2 9 ghz intel core i5 processor and 8 gb of ram the code used to generate the results in this section is available at http doi org 10 5281 zenodo 3706926 schmidt 2020 4 1 1d results we begin with the simplest case of a 1d domain with two subdomains as described in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 and we hold d 1 5 0 constant while we test 3 values of d 2 ranging from half the magnitude of d 1 to two orders of magnitude smaller in the simulations we employ 5000 particles for the mtpt simulations and 1 million particles in the rwpt simulations grouped into 100 bins for plotting we choose a timestep of length δ t 10 2 with a total simulation time t 6 we first examine what occurs when we apply the original mtpt method that our proposed algorithm is based upon i e using 7 as the weighting function in 9 benson and bolster 2016 schmidt et al 2018 benson et al 2020 these results are shown in fig 3 and we see that the original mt algorithm holds up for a small magnitude difference in the diffusion coefficient as when d 1 d 2 5 2 5 however when the disparity becomes larger the accuracy deteriorates and the mtpt solution is quite poor for d 1 d 2 5 0 05 as compared to the analytical solution and the rwpt results the results of applying our new mt algorithm i e the semi analytical solution given in 28 used within algorithm 2 are depicted in fig 4 comparing mtpt results both to the analytical solution given in 17 and the rwpt results we see very close agreement between all solutions indicating that our proposed approach is successful here and that we may move on to more complicated cases the next experiment we conduct focuses on a 1d problem with three subdomains ω1 ω2 and ω3 with their own respective diffusion coefficients representing diffusion in for example a layered system we hold d 1 5 0 and d 3 0 05 so as to span two orders of magnitude and we test three values of d 2 2 5 1 0 0 5 in the central subdomain in the simulations we employ 5000 particles for the mtpt simulations and 1 million particles in the rwpt simulations grouped into 100 bins for plotting and we choose a timestep of length δ t 10 2 with a total simulation time of t 6 the results of this experiment are displayed in fig 5 because this problem has no simple analytical solution we take the rwpt results as our baseline case and find very close agreement of the mtpt results with the baseline 4 2 2d results moving to 2d we first consider the case of 2 subdomains split along the line x γ corresponding to the semi analytical solution given in 31 for these simulations we hold d 1 5 0 and test d 2 2 5 1 0 0 5 in the simulations we employ 10201 particles for the mtpt simulations 101 101 equally spaced particles with the number chosen so as to capture the integer valued source location and 10 million particles in the rwpt simulations grouped into 6400 bins for plotting and choose a timestep of length δ t 10 1 with a total simulation time of t 6 the results of this experiment are shown in figs 6 and 7 in fig 6 we see good visual agreement of the mtpt solutions to the rwpt baseline and this is verified by plotting the constant concentration contours on the same axes in fig 7 where the match is seen to be nearly exact aside from the slight noise induced by the randomness in the rwpt simulation the next problem we consider is the 2d example of 4 subdomains split along the lines x γ x and y γ y corresponding to the semi analytical solution given in 33 for these simulations the four cases we consider in terms of choices for d i i 1 4 are 1 4 different values for di spanning an order of magnitude and 3 equal values for di and one value that is an order of magnitude smaller with 2 source location in a subdomain laterally adjacent to the small value of di 3 source location in the subdomain containing the small value value of di and 4 source location in a subdomain diagonally adjacent to the small value of di of these four cases case 4 is the least interesting as the majority of solute remains in the three subdomains with large di so we do not depict results of this simulation though they were always favorable in the simulations we employ 40 401 particles for the mtpt simulations 201 201 equally spaced particles and 10 million particles in the rwpt simulations grouped into 6400 bins for plotting and we choose a timestep of length δ t 10 1 for the mtpt simulations and δ t 10 2 for the rwpt simulations this was required to generate smooth enough results for comparison with a total simulation time of t 3 the results of this experiment are shown in figs 8 and 9 in fig 8 we see favorable visual agreement of the mtpt solutions to the rwpt baseline and this is confirmed by the overlaid constant concentration contour plots depicted in fig 9 we note that in the 2d experiments we only consider a single order or magnitude difference between diffusion coefficients this was in favor of fast run times as the required number of particles for a mtpt simulation is dictated by the inter particle spacing which must be on the order of ℓ 2 d δ t where d is the smallest diffusion coefficient in the system however there are no theoretical barriers to considering larger disparities in d x 4 3 speed and accuracy here we address two measures of algorithmic performance for our proposed mtpt method for discontinuous d x first as to speed run times for the mtpt method are consistently lower than those for corresponding rwpt solutions for example to generate the 1d 2 subdomain results discussed in section 4 1 and depicted in fig 4 the mtpt simulations run approximately 4 5 times faster than the rwpt simulations to which the solutions are compared for the 2d 4 subdomain case discussed in section 4 2 and depicted in figs 6 and 9 the mtpt simulations run approximately 1 5 times faster than the rwpt simulations this speedup for mtpt can primarily be attributed to the fact that mass transfer interactions only occur among nearest neighbors and this allows for speedup via sparse linear algebra note however that these run time comparisons are for reference only as both algorithms can be optimized in various ways and that was not the goal of this work as to accuracy we perform a convergence analysis for the proposed mtpt algorithm to see how error is affected by the level of discretization i e refinements in time step length δt or increase in particle number n this convergence analysis considers the 1d 2 subdomain case and we compute error in comparison to the analytical solution given in section 3 2 1 for each convergence analysis we employ all of the same parameters as were used to generate the results in section 4 1 and depicted in fig 4 varying only δt or n in successive refinements the results for a convergence analysis in terms of δt are depicted in fig 10 and therein we plot error in terms of the ℓ and ℓ2 norms as a function of δt for each of the three values of d 2 we consider in section 4 1 fig 4 for each of the error curves we also plot a reference o δ t p line of best fit to obtain the order of convergence p and we see the general trend of what appears to be p 1 2 order of convergence and this is demonstrated most clearly in the ℓ norm the results for a convergence analysis in terms of n are depicted in fig 11 and therein we plot error in terms of the ℓ norm and root mean squared error rmse as a function of n for each of the three values of d 2 we consider in section 4 1 fig 4 we note that we employ rmse here as opposed to the ℓ2 norm to normalize for varying vector length in this case we see a period of rapid convergence with increasing n before error levels off to a minimal level that is controlled by the time discretization and this is the expected behavior that is commonly seen in mtpt methods schmidt et al 2018 2019a 5 conclusions discontinuous diffusion coefficients arise naturally within simulations of transport through heterogeneous porous media but accurately modeling diffusion across these interfaces has remained an outstanding problem for mtpt algorithms here we have generalized mtpt algorithms to addresses this deficiency including for multi dimensional systems this is a significant advance both from a numerical perspective and in terms of improving the realism of such simulations additionally these results serve to eliminate one of the few remaining barriers that limit the capabilities of lagrangian methods in comparison to their eulerian counterparts in particular within the current work we have 1 generalized the mt algorithm to incorporate non symmetric mass transfer kernels 2 presented an mt algorithm that employs a relatively simple 1d analytic solution to the discontinuous d x problem 3 derived a semi analytical solution to the discontinuous d x problem that is straightforward to generalize to higher dimensions and complicated subdomain interfaces 4 presented an mt algorithm that incorporates this semi analytical solution 5 applied this updated mtpt algorithm to a variety of test cases including a 2d problem that corresponds to a standard velocity grid with order of magnitude differences in d x 6 attained favorable results of this application of the new mtpt algorithm additionally while not considered in this work it would be a simple matter to handle moving subdomain interfaces with this algorithm this is because particle interactions occur pairwise and to make the relevant mass transfer the only required information is each particle s mass position and local diffusion coefficient which are easy enough to establish within a timestep no matter the current orientation of a subdomain boundary open questions remain in this direction however for instance what would be the effect of running a hybrid version of mtpt including diffusive random walks in the algorithm and how would it affect the accuracy of solutions or how might the solution be generalized to subdomains that possess more complicated geometry for example boundaries that are not right angles such as on a triangulated grid or boundaries that are not straight lines at all e g sole mari et al 2019a additionally we have only considered the scalar or isotropic d x case because it is common in the mtpt literature to simulate large scale anisotropic spreading by random walks and the micro scale isotropic mixing process by mass transfers schmidt et al 2018 benson et al 2019a in summary we have extended the capabilities of mtpt methods to solve the problem of discontinuous diffusion coefficients thus adding flexibility to a tool that already is able to model arbitrarily complex reactions including fluid solid interactions separately simulate macro scale spreading and micro scale mixing capture arbitrarily fine resolution
