25,land surface depressions play a central role in the transformation of rainfall to ponding infiltration and runoff yet digital elevation models dems used by spatially distributed hydrologic models that resolve land surface processes rarely capture land surface depressions at spatial scales relevant to this transformation methods to generate dems through processing of remote sensing data such as optical and light detection and ranging lidar have favored surfaces without depressions to avoid adverse slopes that are problematic for many hydrologic routing methods here we present a new topographic conditioning workflow depression preserved dem processing d2p algorithm which is designed to preserve physically meaningful surface depressions for depression integrated and efficient hydrologic modeling d2p includes several features 1 an adaptive screening interval for delineation of depressions 2 the ability to filter out anthropogenic land surface features e g bridges 3 the ability to blend river smoothing e g a general downslope profile and depression resolving functionality from a case study in the goodwin creek experimental watershed d2p successfully resolved 86 of the ponds at a dem resolution of 10 m topographic conditioning was achieved with minimum impact as d2p reduced the number of modified cells from the original dem by 51 compared to a conventional algorithm furthermore hydrologic simulation using a d2p processed dem resulted in a more robust characterization on surface water dynamics based on higher surface water storage as well as an attenuated and delayed peak streamflow keywords surface depressions topographic processing hydrologic modeling digital elevation model 1 introduction surface depressions have a direct impact on surface and subsurface flows through hydrologic biochemical and biological exchanges cohen et al 2016 primarily runoff can be modulated and delayed by surface depressions through fill spill dynamics and storage effect ameli and creed 2017 brooks et al 2018 this has been shown to improve downstream water quality and support habitat functions because of longer residence times biggs et al 2017 cheng and basu 2017 jones et al 2018 in addition large scale surface depressions in the form of wetlands and lakes can be critical for water supply as they replenish aquifers through seepage during dry conditions liu et al 2016 with a growing emphasis on the impact of surface depressions on hydrologic processes semi distributed hydrologic models have been widely used to provide new insights evenson et al 2016 wang et al 2021 one approach is to aggregate surface depressions within each subbasin into a lumped depression that functions conceptually as a bucket water is stored in the bucket and spills as runoff when it exceeds a parameterized threshold volume hay et al 2018 liu and schwartz 2011 rajib et al 2020 this type of approach is simple to implement but fails to account for the spatial distribution of the depressions in reality some surface depressions may fill and contribute runoff water earlier than the others but in the lumped approach water is only released to the streams when all the surface depressions i e the aggregated depression are fully filled the other approach is to model surface depressions as individual units which better represents wetlands and their hydrologic connectivity for example chu et al 2013 developed a puddle to puddle p2p model where the study domains were divided into multiple puddle based units pbu each pbu contains the highest level puddle and its contributing area the pbu can drain to a downstream pbu based on an overflow threshold and the same applies for its embedded lower level puddles based on a puddle delineation pd algorithm chu et al 2010 building on the pd algorithm and pbu concept subsequent improvements were made to account for infiltration and unsaturated flow yang and chu 2015 improve the channel puddle cascading mechanism nasab et al 2017 and enhance computational efficiency wang and chu 2020 fully distributed hydrologic models have different needs for topographic data compared to semi distributed models given that the former is designed to resolve flow paths along and into the land surface golden et al 2014 which in turn supports numerous geophysical applications such as material transport and reactive flows golden et al 2017 2014 jones et al 2019 in particular fully distributed models require careful attention to spatial distribution of land surface heights as this drives the spatiotemporal variability of land surface storage infiltration runoff and soil moisture amado et al 2018 liu et al 2016 hence fully distributed hydrologic modeling at fine resolution calls for careful attention to the source of topographic data which is generally supplied by a digital elevation model dem gardner et al 2018 jan et al 2018 tavares da costa et al 2019 dems are developed in many different ways but fine resolution dems used in hydrologic modeling are typically derived from aerial lidar data or optical data with photogrammetric methods lidberg et al 2017 raw point cloud data is filtered to differentiate ground surface points from vegetation canopy and then gridded to produce a preliminary dem subsequently dems are hydro conditioned i e filling or breaching topographic cells to limit variability or noise in land surface slopes for smoother flow routing i e lower chance of computational instability chow and ben zvi 1973 rieger 1998 zhang and cundy 1989 yet this process often removes physical land surface depressions that are highly relevant to hydrologic processes at the land surface previous studies have worked to identify land surface depressions for the purpose of characterizing the location and size of land surface features such as wetland and karsts bertassello et al 2020 li et al 2011 moreno gómez et al 2019 wu et al 2016 but these work did not focus specifically on creating a dem suited to resolving fine scale land surface processes with spatially distributed hydrologic models hence the objective of this study is to present a novel topographic processing workflow referred to as depression preserved dem processing d2p algorithm with the aim of resolving surface depressions based on the scale of interest and smoothing small scale non physical variability in dems e g sanders 2007 for depression integrated and efficient modeling of land surface hydrology our approach is designed for hydrologic models that calculate flow across 4 cell faces i e d4 but can be modified easily to handle more flow directions e g d8 alongside a processed dem the algorithm also generates slopes across the cell faces this adds to the limited number of dem processing algorithms that can generate slope inputs for d4 routing models using finite difference methods condon and maxwell 2019 in this study we detail the workflow of d2p and examine its utility in processing the dem as an input for the integrated hydrologic model parflow ashby and falgout 1996 jones and woodward 2001 kollet and maxwell 2006 maxwell 2013 we compare the processed dem and evaluate the hydrologic simulation against the traditional filling method by condon and maxwell 2019 using a case study on the goodwin creek experimental watershed gcew 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area gcew is located in northern mississippi united statesand the area of the watershed is 21 7 km2 with an elevation ranging from 64 8 m to 129 1 m above mean sea level fig 1 the land use is mainly idle pasture followed by forest and cultivated land and there is a high density of small water bodies such as farm ponds yasarer et al 2018 based on the satellite imagery from the national wetlands inventory nwi provided by united states fish and wildlife service usfws https www fws gov wetlands there are a total of 93 fresh water ponds ranging in size from 500 m2 to 11 000 m2 the dem used in this study was downloaded from a derived lidar product by the mississippi automated resource information system the dem represents bare earth surface that was created from lidar points collected from 2009 to 2010 by the u s army corps of engineers usace for the mississippi delta phase 1 project https www maris state ms us html data elevation html gsc tab 0 and was hydro flattened the spatial resolution is 1 m and the vertical accuracy is 0 09 m root mean square error the dem was first smoothed by a median filter to remove roughness and aggregated to 10 m resolution to keep the hydrologic simulation computationally manageable 2 2 overview of depression preserved dem processing d2p algorithm the d2p algorithm comprises six steps as shown in the flowchart in fig 2 using dem and nwi wetland as input data it identifies surface depressions that are likely to be physically meaningful and generates a processed dem that is smoothened to reduce fine scale variability while preserving those depressions slope data is then derived from the processed dem details of steps 1 to 6 of the flowchart are explained from sections 2 2 1 to 2 2 6 2 2 1 topographic sink extraction a depression less dem was first obtained by filling the sinks using priority flood a depression filling tool barnes et al 2014 all the topographic depressions comprising real depressions and artifacts were then extracted by subtracting the input dem from the depression less dem the artifacts are caused by systematic and random errors from the precision of data acquisition instrument and processing techniques zhu et al 2013 2 2 2 removal of small scale depressions in dem from the extracted topographic depressions section 2 2 1 an improved adaptation of the level set method wu et al 2019 was applied to characterize the depressions in terms of their geometric properties and hierarchy a depression hierarchy describes the relationship between each depression whereby depressions can themselves contain smaller ones the most nested depression is referred to as a level 1 depression and the level increases as the depressions combine to form bigger depressions supporting information text s1 the level set method by wu et al 2019 establishes the hierarchy by screening each depression from the highest elevation and moving downwards to determine the spill point at which depressions combine supporting information text s2 one disadvantage of this method is that the screening was performed at fixed intervals and could overlook certain depressions barnes et al 2019 to avoid this the screening interval must be reduced but the computation can become inefficient supporting information text s3 therefore we modified the method to screen at each unique dem cell elevation within the depression instead of at fixed intervals this ensures that each depression is assigned the correct level in the hierarchy the level of each depression will be used in section 2 2 4 after establishing the hierarchy the area of each depression was determined and the average depth of each depression d was calculated using eq 1 1 d i 1 n z s z i n where n is the number of dem cells within the depression zs is the spill elevation and zi is the elevation of the ith cell in the depression finally average depth and area thresholds of 0 0036 m and 900 m2 were applied the motivation of the thresholds was to identify and remove small scale depressions that are deemed to be inconsequential to the overall hydrologic process since they tend to fill easily and lose their function as closed basins in most rainfall events li et al 2011 the thresholds also help to filter out small scale non physical variabilities from the dem to improve computational efficiency these small scale depressions were removed by filling to generate a modified dem the thresholds were derived from a sensitivity assessment of the final delineated depressions using different threshold values to achieve a balance between matching the wetland data from nwi and excessive false matches supporting information text s4 the considerations for the setting of the thresholds are also discussed in section 4 1 2 2 3 watershed analysis the watershed analysis was implemented using the grass module r watershed grass development team 2020 an a least cost search algorithm hart et al 1968 metz et al 2011 was applied on the modified dem from 2 2 2 to generate flow direction and river network this algorithm does not require the dem to be further altered to determine flow direction and extracts the path of rivers through depressions more accurately compared to traditional methods planchon and darboux 2001 wang and liu 2006 with sink filling metz et al 2011 2 2 4 classify riverine depressions for targeted preservation in this section we focus on riverine depressions after having removed small scale depressions from the dem section 2 2 2 dems are especially prone to errors along rivers due to the difficulty of sensors in penetrating thick riparian vegetation and water bodies as well as the resolution limits in resolving the channel bottom elevation lindsay 2016a schwanghart and scherler 2017 this creates spurious topographic variability along rivers leading to depressions inside the channel width with discontinuous bottom slopes that can cause model instability hengl 2006 iserles 2009 yu et al 2020 in addition high resolution lidar derived dems can contain false hydrologic barriers such as bridges or roads carlson and danner 2010 that will form false depressions during the depression extraction process in section 2 2 1 such false depressions are rarely addressed in previous depression integrated studies hence our goal is to filter out the aforementioned spurious depressions within the channel width fig 3 a and depressions arising from false hydrologic barriers fig 3b to finally keep the remaining water bodies that partially coincide with rivers fig 3c to achieve this we developed a new metric that takes advantage of the hierarchy of depression levels the metric referred herein as the river to depression ratio rtd provides a measure of the contribution of the river to the makeup of the depression the rtd was calculated for each highest level depression using the formula in eq 2 2 r t d n r n n l 1 r n l 1 in eq 2 n is the number of dem cells within the highest level depression and nr is a subset number of cells from n that are within the river channel width while n l 1 is the number of dem cells in all level 1 depressions i e the most nested depressions within the highest level depression and n l 1 r is a subset number of cells from n l 1 that are within the river channel width the equation is a product of two ratios the first ratio is a measure of the extent of the depression that coincides with the river the higher the first ratio the larger the portion of the depression falling within the river channel width fig 3a the second ratio was introduced to specifically distinguish between false depressions arising from roads or bridges and actual water bodies that partially coincide with the river it does so by drawing on the depression hierarchy from section 2 2 2 to gage the geometry of the depression ponds and wetlands generally have a bowl like structure with a flat bottom which manifests itself by the level 1 cells spreading beyond the river resulting in a lower n l 1 r n l 1 fig 3c on the other hand in false depressions arising from road or bridge crossings level 1 cells are mostly concentrated within the river channel width resulting in a higher n l 1 r n l 1 fig 3b using eq 2 depressions with rtd lower than a certain threshold would be selected for preservation in the next section as their geometry suggests that they are more likely to be physically meaningful depressions that intersect with a river e g fig 3c in other words the threshold is the maximum rtd for a physically meaningful depression in the study area to determine the threshold the rtd was calculated for each depression from nwi data and the maximum calculated rtd was set as the threshold by this point we had identified physically meaningful depressions that we wanted to preserve in the dem the preserved depressions compared well against the wetlands in the nwi data fig 4 the excluded depressions namely small scale depressions depressions within the channel width and depressions associated with false hydrologic barriers were all assumed to be artifacts 2 2 5 river network smoothening we applied a quantile regression algorithm to smoothen the river while preserving the depressions partially coinciding with the river identified in section 2 2 4 the smoothening aims to maintain the general profile while reducing fine scale variability and adverse slopes previous studies smoothen the river profile by modifying the elevation universally based on the average slope of the reach barnes et al 2016 condon and maxwell 2019 the approach we adopt here offers the flexibility to process the river segment intersecting with depression differently from other segments generally the algorithm works by minimizing the sum of absolute values of the residuals given by the difference between the smoothened elevation and the raw elevation as well as the roughness the underlying optimization function of the algorithm known as the constrained regularized smoothing crs algorithm is shown in eq 3 schwanghart and scherler 2017 3 arg min i 1 n ρ τ z x i i z τ x i s z τ x 2 dx where z xi is the unsmoothed elevation along river profiles x distance upstream of the watershed outlet n is the number of elevations i is the identity matrix τ 0 1 is the constant chosen according to which quantile needs to be estimated in this case τ was set at 0 5 z τ is the estimated elevation ρ τ is a loss function dependent on the residuals ri given by 4 ρ τ r i τ r i 0 r i where r i is defined as z x i i z τ x i and is an indicator function that has a value of 1 if the residual r i is less than 0 and a value of 0 otherwise s dictates the degree of smoothening and is defined by 5 s δ x 2 k n p where δx is the resolution of the dem p is the number of second derivative terms in eq 3 k is the parameter that scales the degree of smoothing in schwanghart scherler 2017 the river profile was forced to decrease in the downstream direction and the degree of smoothening s was set to be uniform throughout the entire river network to avoid distorting the actual depressions that intersect the river path e g fig 3c we introduced separate conditions to process river segments within depressions and river segments outside of depressions for river segments outside depressions the downstream elevation was forced to be lower than the upstream by a minimum difference ε as shown in eq 6 6 z τ x z τ x δ x ε this was not applied for river segments inside depressions to avoid removing the depressions in addition s was set to be higher for river segments outside of depressions but lower in river segments within depressions to preserve any high curvature structures e g dams downstream of the depressions lastly to prevent the river cell being raised inadvertently creating depressions outside the river we introduced a new condition whereby the elevation of the river segment was globally set not to exceed that of the riverbanks by ε 7 z τ x min z τ y δ y x z τ y δ y x ε fig 5 illustrates the different constraints that were imposed on the river segments within the depressions and outside the depressions the modified algorithm will be referred to as the adapted crs algorithm following the implementation of the adapted crs algorithm we temporarily masked out the stream segments and preserved depressions and applied filling on any sinks created as a by product in the dem barnes et al 2014 a final processed dem was obtained 2 2 6 slope calculation the outcome of the above steps was a processed dem with smoothened rivers and retained depressions in this step slopes in the north south and east west directions were calculated for each cell the north south slope is defined at the upper cell face between a cell and the adjacent cell to the north while the east west slope is defined at the right cell face between a call and the adjacent cell to the east the calculated slope direction for cells outside of depressions was adjusted to match the flow direction by reversing the sign whenever there was a discrepancy the slope magnitude remained unchanged but subject to a maximum slope threshold and a minimum slope threshold 2 3 comparative analysis to assess the performance of d2p we evaluated the extent and magnitude of its modification on the raw dem and the subsequent impact on overland flow since parflow is used in this study we chose priorityflow condon and maxwell 2019 a recent dem conditioning algorithm developed for parflow to be compared against d2p the algorithm followed the traditional way of removing all the sinks and the approach is justified when a kinematic wave approximation is used for the overland flow simulation dem processing algorithms are known to introduce errors since it is difficult to ascertain the origin of each depression so the algorithm should ideally achieve a reasonable flow path with minimal modification to the dem lindsay and creed 2005 hence we quantified the change in elevation of the processed dem relative to the source dem as a measure of the change to the landscape in addition we performed a rainfall recession simulation in parflow using the processed dems and the raw dem by applying a rainfall rate of 5 mm hr for 10 hrs followed by 20 hrs of recession similar to the test used by barnes et al 2016 and condon and maxwell 2019 the simulation was performed on an impervious surface to focus on surface water processes diffusive wave approximation was used for overland flow table 1 summarizes the five dems that were used in the comparative study the raw dem the processed dem from the conventional algorithm and the processed dem from d2p are represented by case 0 case 1 and case 4 respectively case 1 fills the depressions first and smoothens the river by enforcing a constant average slope between two ends of each reach due to the fundamental differences between the conventional algorithm and d2p in terms of the treatment of the depression and river smoothening two cases were added to isolate the effect of each change on the dem from case 1 to case 4 case 2 changes the river smoothening in case 1 to the use of the adapted crs with the uniform constraint of elevation decreasing downstream eq 6 case 3 uses the adapted crs with uniform constraint of elevation decreasing downstream before filling case 3 is the closest to case 4 in terms of the processed dem except that select depressions are preserved during the adapted crs step and the filling step in case 4 in summary cases 1 to 3 condition dems using different combination of depression treatment and stream smoothening methods without preserving any depression while case 4 incorporates select depressions an example of a processed river segment from case 0 to case 4 is illustrated in supporting information fig s9 3 results 3 1 evaluation of identified depressions to evaluate the accuracy of the delineated depressions by d2p algorithm 1 m resolution aerial imagery from the national agriculture imagery program naip https www fsa usda gov programs and services aerial photography imagery programs naip imagery was used to manually delineate the ponds as a benchmark for comparison the imagery was chosen from july 2009 to match the date of the lidar dem used in this study alongside the dem resampled to 10 m resolution the comparison was also done at the original lidar dem resolution of 1 m and two other resampled resolutions of 5 m and 20 m the area and depth thresholds are set the same for all the resolutions to solely investigate the impact of dem resolution on depression identification from fig 6 a d the d2p algorithm was able to identify at least 85 of the delineated ponds from the naip imagery 56 out of 66 at the dem resolutions of 1 m 5 m and 10 m but the performance dropped to 35 23 out of 66 at the coarsest resolution of 20 m this indicates the inability of the 20 m resolution dem to resolve the scale and geometry of the depressions in the study area most of the naip ponds had an area of the same order of magnitude 400 m2 to 4000 m2 as the 20 m by 20 m grid cell so the depressions in the dem could easily be lost during the resampling of the dem we compared the area of the depressions identified by d2p against the naip ponds and found a close agreement with a coefficient of determination r 2 of at least 0 75 across all the resolutions in general there is an overestimation in the area of the depressions delineated by d2p as shown in fig 6e this is because the d2p depression area is determined by filling the depressions in the raw dem up to the spill point elevation which makes it the maximum possible area the manually delineated areas from naip reflect the state of the pond at a specific time but may not be the maximum given the tendency to fluctuate depending on the climate moreover vegetation and shadows in the naip imagery may mask the true boundary of the ponds during manual delineation and result in underestimation of the pond extent yasarer et al 2018 notably the positive bias tends to increase with the dem resolution because the dem at higher resolution is better able to represent the boundary of the maximum depression area more closely on the other hand a coarser resolution dem may fail to capture the irregular boundary of the depression and underestimate the area as is the case for the 20 m dem especially for the smaller ponds another statistical analysis in the form of the binary pattern metrics shown in table 2 was conducted to further examine the degree to which the d2p depressions agree with the naip ponds in terms of location and extent the results affirmed the performance of d2p as the probability of detection pod indicated that more than 85 of the depressions matched the ponds for dem resolutions 10 m and lower d2p produced false alarms across all four dem resolutions with the false alarm rate far ranging from 44 to 53 this is to be expected due to the tendency to overestimate the depression area as explained previously and the fact that not all depressions may result in the formation of a pond in general as the dem resolution increases the pod increases but this is offset by an increase in the far so the resulting critical success index csi is similar for the dem resolutions of 1 m 5 m and 10 m at about 50 however at the dem resolution of 20 m we observe that the pod drops drastically but the far does not decrease in tandem and this causes the csi to decrease significantly to 32 from the above comparisons we have shown that d2p is able to reasonably identify depressions provided that the dem resolution is able to resolve the scale of the depressions of interest while d2p will perform better in capturing both the location and geometry of the known depressions from existing datasets e g nwi naip with a higher resolution dem it also generates a higher number of unknown depressions which can be hard to validate without ground truth data 3 2 effect of processing methods on dem the extent and magnitude of the impact to the raw dem by the different methods decreased gradually from case 1 to case 4 as shown by the percentage of modified cells and mean absolute elevation offset in table 3 this agrees with previous research lindsay 2016b which showed filling case 1 and case 2 to have a bigger impact on the dem than a hybrid of breaching and filling case 3 and case 4 between case 4 and case 1 d2p reduced the percentage of modified cells for the entire watershed from 11 3 to 5 58 and the mean absolute elevation offset by 5 fold from 0 0745 m to 0 0145 m compared to the conventional algorithm focusing on the river network which was more likely to have changed due to the additional smoothing step the elevation of practically all the cells in case 1 were modified compared to only 30 6 of the cells in case 4 in addition the magnitude of modification was also smaller in case 4 with a mean absolute elevation offset of 0 223 m compared to 0 648 m in case 1 from the boxplot in fig 7 there was a predominant increase in elevation in case 1 and case 2 but not case 3 and 4 due to the nature of the filling algorithm at the same time the elevation offsets were highly variable in case 1 1 5 m to 2 m and case 2 0 6 m to 1 m compared to case 3 0 4 m to 0 4 m and case 4 0 4 m to 0 4 m overall the differences between the river profile from the processed dem and the raw dem were the highest in case 1 followed by case 2 and finally cases and 3 and 4 which were similar 3 3 effect of processing methods on hydrologic simulation to understand the impact of the processing methods on hydrologic simulation we compared the distribution of the simulated surface water depth and the time series of the surface water storage and streamflow fig 8 shows the instantaneous surface water depth distribution for a selected location in the watershed with a high density of ponds 10 hrs into the simulation at the end of the heavy rainfall fig 8c the location and extent of the ponds in both case 0 and case 4 generally matched that of the ponds extracted from naip however artifactual depressions could be observed in case 0 such as the one in the black circle as a result of using the raw dem this is a classic example of a false depression arising when a road crosses over the river in cases 1 2 and 3 the depression removal process created flat terrain in the naip pond areas resulting in minimal accumulation of water less than 0 1 m in depth notably case 1 resulted in a larger flooded area compared to cases 2 and 3 as the elevation of the river profile was raised gradually upstream to maintain a constant slope thereby reducing the capacity of the channels 30 hrs into the simulation at the end of the recession fig 8d the residual water in flat areas in cases 1 to 3 had already dried out on the other hand the depressions in case 4 functioned as storage by trapping the water and formed isolated ponds the result was not available for case 0 as the model stopped running at the 11th hour due to the numerical instability from using the raw dem overall the dem in case 4 allowed ponding to be modeled realistically and the choice of dem processing resulted in significant difference in the spatial distribution of ponding refer to supporting information fig s10 for a similar comparison at another location within the watershed next we analyzed the surface water storage time series for all cases the total surface water storage fig 9 a was broken down into a river storage component fig 9b and a non river storage component fig 9c in fig 9a the total surface water storage was highest in case 0 up to the point when the model terminated prematurely this is because the drainage was poorest in case 0 due to the lack of a smoothened river network that could direct water to flow between cell faces the water from the rainfall became trapped in sinks and could barely reach the outlet of the watershed of the other cases the total surface water storage was highest in case 4 due to retention of water by the preserved depressions although the total surface water storage was similar across all depression less simulations i e cases 1 2 and 3 the choice of river smoothening mechanism and depression treatment resulted in a large difference in the distribution of storage between the river and non river components in fig 9b the river storage was lower in cases 1 and 2 than case 3 this can be attributed to the shallower channel depth see table 4 from the use of filling to remove depressions in cases 1 and 2 conversely the shallower channel depth makes the river more prone to overflowing and results in a higher non river surface water storage in case 1 and 2 compared to case 3 fig 9c by preserving and integrating depressions in the hydrologic simulation the river storage in case 4 was reduced compared to case 3 fig 9b because surface runoff was intercepted as non river storage after the rain had stopped the non river storage in case 4 decreased much slower than other cases due to the retention effect of the depressions fig 10 shows the hydrographs at the outlet of the watershed without any dem processing the peak flow was substantially lower in case 0 as it was difficult for the water to flow past the rugged terrain to the outlet of the watershed this corresponds with the behavior of storage in fig 9 whereby most of the water arriving as rainfall remained as surface water storage after getting trapped by the sinks until the 10th hr the streamflow took about the same time to peak for cases 1 2 and 3 however the peak streamflow in case 3 was visibly higher than case 1 and case 2 because of the higher flow depth at the outlet comparing case 4 and case 3 an attenuation of the peak streamflow was observed in the former due to the preserved depressions the peak stream flow in case 4 was reduced by 10 compared to case 3 and the hydrograph for case 4 lagged that of case 3 by 0 4 hr 4 discussion 4 1 threshold for removal of artifacts for this study to distinguish farm ponds from depressions too small to be significant to the hydrologic simulation we set a minimum threshold depression depth of 0 0036 m and area of 900 m2 based on nwi data there is not a universal value that can be applied to all cases and the threshold should ideally be determined based on the scale of interest knowledge of the existing site dem resolution and computational efficiency of the hydrologic simulation for example to investigate malaria vector habitat dynamics in africa the hydrologic model needs to consider smaller 100 m2 and shallower depressions 0 5 m as the dominant malaria vectors prefer transient pools for breeding minakawa et al 1999 on the other hand the threshold will be very different for a reservoir simulation considering that the scale of the water body of interest is much bigger any existing site information will also be helpful in refining the thresholds guided by the minnesota karst feature database kfdb wu et al 2016 used a minimum depression area of 100 m2 and minimum depression depth of 0 5 m to identify natural sinkholes in a separate experiment conducted on the prairie pothole region of north dakota a different threshold of a minimum depression size of 2000 m2 and minimum depression depth of 0 3 m was chosen based on spatial data from us geological survey wu et al 2019 area and depth thresholds can also vary with dem resolution from the sensitivity analysis in supporting information text s4 the performance of the tested thresholds in the successful identification of wetlands from nwi data by d2p generally increased with dem resolution higher resolution dems typically require larger area threshold as there is a higher probability of small artifactual depressions that need to be removed li et al 2011 however the same trend was not observed in our study instead the optimal area threshold across the resolutions of 1 m 5 m 10 m were all around 800 m2 to 900 m2 this could be due to the quality and nature of the nwi data which is a record of wetlands and not all depressions in the study area on the other hand a lower depth threshold may be needed for lower resolution dems obtained by aggregating a higher resolution dem aggregating a higher resolution dem has the effect of averaging out the topographic variability resulting in shallower depressions another factor to consider is the trade off between the realism of the topographic representation and computational efficiency while setting a low threshold would allow the dem to capture most of the depressions it will also increase the variability in the topography which could inadvertently introduce slope discontinuities and develop oscillation and instability issues for some models for instance setting the threshold area too low increases the chances of including deep yet small depressions that are anomalous and can greatly hurt the numerical performance surface depressions within the channel width and depressions associated with false hydrologic barriers were removed based on a calculated rtd threshold a threshold that is set too low causes more depressions intersecting with the river to be removed including ponds and wetlands along rivers fig 3c that could serve important hydrologic functions on the other hand a higher threshold would cause more depressions intersecting with the river to be preserved including false depressions arising from roads or bridges and also result in a more rugged river profile in this study the threshold was inferred based on known depression locations from nwi data in general the rtd threshold decreases as the resolution increases the calculated rtd thresholds were 0 8 0 54 0 33 and 0 076 for dem resolutions of 20 m 10 m 5 m and 1 m respectively this is due to the overestimation of the areal representation of the river at lower resolutions the performance of the rtd threshold in distinguishing false depressions associated with roads or bridges from water bodies that coincide with the river drops as the resolution decreases this is due to the inability of the dem to fully resolve the depression hierarchy at lower resolutions at 20 m dem resolution the far table 2 was particularly high which can be attributed to the inclusion of false depressions 4 2 implication of dem processing algorithm on hydrologic simulation filling vs hybrid many studies have compared the influence of different dem processing algorithms on the dem in terms of elevation slope and hydrological attributes callow et al 2007 lindsay 2016b lindsay and creed 2005 woodrow et al 2016 in line with those studies our comparison across the four cases shows that the filling based algorithms in case 1 and case 2 produced a greater impact on the dem quantified by the number of modified cells and elevation offset in table 3 and fig 7 however the impact of the dem processing algorithms on the hydrological simulation is rarely discussed from the rainfall recession simulation we observe local differences in the pattern of the ponding between filling and hybrid algorithms especially around false depressions arising from the crossing of a road over a river in case 1 and case 2 filling raised the elevation of the upstream river valley to at least match the level of the road crossing and this resulted in inundation over a large area upstream of the road crossing with relatively similar elevation in extreme cases the flat inundated area could create an obstruction to the incoming river and cause the flow to back up increasing the computational demands on the other hand the hybrid algorithm in case 3 breached the road crossing and allowed water to flow through the river channel relatively easily in addition we observe that both the filling and hybrid algorithms resulted in roughly similar mean channel slopes but the former reduced the channel depth by 22 to 25 compared to the latter this could cause overestimation of fluvial flooding as alluded to by the higher non river storage in fig 9c and potentially result in overly conservative flood management policies 4 3 implication of depression integrated hydrologic simulation depression vs depression less we show in our rainfall recession simulation that the inclusion of depression modified the hydrologic response of the watershed we observe an attenuation in streamflow at the watershed outlet and increase in lag time of the hydrograph as the depressions stored some of the rainfall and delayed the arrival of runoff to the rivers this mechanism is widely acknowledged by other similar studies nasab and chu 2020 yasarer et al 2018 zeng et al 2020 at the same time by explicitly representing the depressions in the dem we present a viable means to capture the hydrologic connectivity between the depressions which is rarely achieved in the existing depression integrated hydrologic models the connectivity between ponds headwater streams and downstream waters was evident in case 4 at the end of the rainfall event in fig 8c long after the rainfall event when the supply of water had stopped the connecting streams that were ephemeral in nature gradually dried up resulting in geographically isolated ponds in fig 8d this process was absent in case 3 as there was no storage function with a depression less dem the impact of the depressions on the hydrologic response can vary with the magnitude of rainfall to illustrate this we increased the rainfall rate applied in the first 10 h of the simulation from 5 mm hr to 10 mm hr as shown in fig 11 at 5 mm hr rainfall rate the total runoff volume i e area under the hydrograph in case 4 is 14 lower than that of case 3 at the higher rainfall rate of 10 mm hr the relative difference in total runoff volume reduces to 9 this implies that the higher the rainfall intensity the lower the impact of the depressions on the hydrologic response the finding is consistent with the study by costabile et al 2022 one reason is because at the higher rainfall intensity the depressions tend to fill up more easily and the storage volume becomes less significant compared to the runoff volume by accounting for depression storage in model simulations it is possible to improve the accuracy of flood hazard studies and allow surface depressions to be leveraged as part of a holistic approach in mitigating flood risk and preventing overpredictions beyond flood hazard studies depression integrated hydrologic modeling has the potential to augment water resources management by enhancing the spatial delineation of water across the watershed and providing a more effective guide for local irrigation and crop rotation strategies rajib et al 2020 lastly it is feasible to explicitly represent the connectivity between depressions and streams in studies to understand the effects of the transport of materials and biological fluxes within aquatic ecosystems leibowitz et al 2019 4 4 limitation of the algorithm there are three main limitations to d2p firstly the artifactual riverine depressions were removed if the rtd was below the threshold which requires knowledge of locations of wetlands in the study area especially those that intersect with the river in our case we derived the rtd threshold from nwi data which is only available within the united states for future applications outside of the united states there is a need to check the local database for similar information or resort to other means to determine the rtd threshold such as through field survey if the above is still not feasible the threshold can be estimated iteratively by a sensitivity analysis secondly a d2p processed dem can result in higher computational demands in distributed hydrological modeling than depression free dems by comparing the number of solver iterations among the five cases in fig 12 case 4 generally had a higher computational demand than cases 1 to 3 the number of iterations increased sharply near the 5th time step where the water was just starting to fill the depression this process was harder to solve in parflow at the point when the overland flow component was activated from the 7th to 10th timestep case 1 required the highest number of iterations than cases 2 to 4 one possible reason was that the flat areas created by the filling process in case 1 obstructed the incoming flow from the river and caused it to back up increasing the computational demands after the rain stopped the surface water flow in cases 1 to 3 decreased and became gradually easier to solve compared to case 4 where water was retained by the depressions notably the number of iterations required in case 0 was substantially higher than the other cases indicating that some degree of dem processing was necessary for modeling purposes finally we note that hydro conditioned dems produced by the d2p workflow are optimized for hydrologic routing methodologies that rely on topographic slopes such as parflow consequently d2p dems may not necessarily be optimal for hydrologic models that rely directly on topographic heights or in flood hazard simulation where the extent and depth of ponded areas are sensitive to certain topographic features along the river hodges 2015 sanders and schubert 2019 in sections 2 2 4 and 2 2 5 we removed all depressions within the river channel width as shown in fig 3a as we could not distinguish artificial depressions from real features such as riffles and pools however the d2p workflow could be adapted to meet slightly different needs with respect to removing some features in the dem and retaining others for example the rtd threshold can be adjusted higher to retain more stream depressions and exempt them from the enforcement of the downslope condition in the adapted crs algorithm 5 summary and conclusions despite the growing emphasis on the impact of surface depressions on hydrologic processes there is a lack of a formalized dem processing tool that can resolve surface depressions of interest for fully distributed hydrologic modeling to address this gap we present the depression preserved dem processing d2p algorithm a novel automated workflow that provides a representation of the land surface consistent with hydrologic processes being resolved while removing small scale non physical variability in the dem for computational efficiency to achieve the above the d2p algorithm includes several features namely 1 improved delineation of surface depressions by screening depressions at variable instead of fixed intervals 2 adoption of a new metric rtd leveraging depression hierarchy to filter out artifactual riverine depressions and 3 adaptation of a hybrid approach to smoothen the river in a way that enforces the general downslope profile while preserving surface depressions that intersect the river path the application of the proposed algorithm in a case study in gcew minimizes the modification to the original dem and the identified depressions match well with the delineated ponds from naip imagery the performance of d2p in identifying depressions was evaluated over four different resolutions of 1 m 5 m 10 m and 20 m in addition the use of the d2p processed dem in a distributed hydrologic model also highlights the difference that the incorporation of depressions makes to the simulated ponding water storage and streamflow following are the conclusions drawn from the study 1 the d2p algorithm was able to identify at least 85 of the delineated ponds from naip satellite imagery at the dem resolution of 1 m 5 m and 10 m but not at 20 m the performance of d2p did not vary much as the dem resolution decreased from 1 m to 10 m 2 compared to a conventional dem processing algorithm which removes all the depressions the d2p algorithm has a significantly lower impact on the raw dem by reducing the percentage of modified cells for the entire watershed by 51 and the mean absolute elevation offset by 81 3 the hydrologic simulation for the rainfall recession test showcases the ability of d2p to capture the spatial distribution of physically meaningful depressions and their storage function the depression integrated simulation results in higher total surface water storage as well as an attenuated and delayed peak streamflow due to retention of water by the preserved depressions although lidar dems are generally of high accuracy and can provide a good representation of the landscape the direct use of the raw dem in hydrologic models using topographic slopes to route flow results in significant computational demands the proposed d2p algorithm provides a systematic means to balance the need to process dem for ease of computation and the preservation of surface depressions of interest while we have only demonstrated the application of d2p for small water bodies in gcew the algorithm can also be used to process dems in the context of larger water bodies such as prairie potholes the choice of hydrologic model would have to be tailored to the nature and geometry of the water bodies of interest our case study of a test rainfall event clearly suggests that the treatment of surface depressions and the choice of method for smoothening topographic variability e g filling and breaching have a significant influence on the hydrologic simulation results d2p adopts a minimum impact approach to avoid distorting terrain attributes unnecessarily while offering the user flexibility in altering depressions under different settings future work involves testing and evaluating the d2p algorithms across different landscapes d2p facilitates depression integrated studies using more fully distributed hydrologic models like parflow this can provide new insights into complex hydrologic systems and help improve water resources management and environmental sustainability decisions code

25,land surface depressions play a central role in the transformation of rainfall to ponding infiltration and runoff yet digital elevation models dems used by spatially distributed hydrologic models that resolve land surface processes rarely capture land surface depressions at spatial scales relevant to this transformation methods to generate dems through processing of remote sensing data such as optical and light detection and ranging lidar have favored surfaces without depressions to avoid adverse slopes that are problematic for many hydrologic routing methods here we present a new topographic conditioning workflow depression preserved dem processing d2p algorithm which is designed to preserve physically meaningful surface depressions for depression integrated and efficient hydrologic modeling d2p includes several features 1 an adaptive screening interval for delineation of depressions 2 the ability to filter out anthropogenic land surface features e g bridges 3 the ability to blend river smoothing e g a general downslope profile and depression resolving functionality from a case study in the goodwin creek experimental watershed d2p successfully resolved 86 of the ponds at a dem resolution of 10 m topographic conditioning was achieved with minimum impact as d2p reduced the number of modified cells from the original dem by 51 compared to a conventional algorithm furthermore hydrologic simulation using a d2p processed dem resulted in a more robust characterization on surface water dynamics based on higher surface water storage as well as an attenuated and delayed peak streamflow keywords surface depressions topographic processing hydrologic modeling digital elevation model 1 introduction surface depressions have a direct impact on surface and subsurface flows through hydrologic biochemical and biological exchanges cohen et al 2016 primarily runoff can be modulated and delayed by surface depressions through fill spill dynamics and storage effect ameli and creed 2017 brooks et al 2018 this has been shown to improve downstream water quality and support habitat functions because of longer residence times biggs et al 2017 cheng and basu 2017 jones et al 2018 in addition large scale surface depressions in the form of wetlands and lakes can be critical for water supply as they replenish aquifers through seepage during dry conditions liu et al 2016 with a growing emphasis on the impact of surface depressions on hydrologic processes semi distributed hydrologic models have been widely used to provide new insights evenson et al 2016 wang et al 2021 one approach is to aggregate surface depressions within each subbasin into a lumped depression that functions conceptually as a bucket water is stored in the bucket and spills as runoff when it exceeds a parameterized threshold volume hay et al 2018 liu and schwartz 2011 rajib et al 2020 this type of approach is simple to implement but fails to account for the spatial distribution of the depressions in reality some surface depressions may fill and contribute runoff water earlier than the others but in the lumped approach water is only released to the streams when all the surface depressions i e the aggregated depression are fully filled the other approach is to model surface depressions as individual units which better represents wetlands and their hydrologic connectivity for example chu et al 2013 developed a puddle to puddle p2p model where the study domains were divided into multiple puddle based units pbu each pbu contains the highest level puddle and its contributing area the pbu can drain to a downstream pbu based on an overflow threshold and the same applies for its embedded lower level puddles based on a puddle delineation pd algorithm chu et al 2010 building on the pd algorithm and pbu concept subsequent improvements were made to account for infiltration and unsaturated flow yang and chu 2015 improve the channel puddle cascading mechanism nasab et al 2017 and enhance computational efficiency wang and chu 2020 fully distributed hydrologic models have different needs for topographic data compared to semi distributed models given that the former is designed to resolve flow paths along and into the land surface golden et al 2014 which in turn supports numerous geophysical applications such as material transport and reactive flows golden et al 2017 2014 jones et al 2019 in particular fully distributed models require careful attention to spatial distribution of land surface heights as this drives the spatiotemporal variability of land surface storage infiltration runoff and soil moisture amado et al 2018 liu et al 2016 hence fully distributed hydrologic modeling at fine resolution calls for careful attention to the source of topographic data which is generally supplied by a digital elevation model dem gardner et al 2018 jan et al 2018 tavares da costa et al 2019 dems are developed in many different ways but fine resolution dems used in hydrologic modeling are typically derived from aerial lidar data or optical data with photogrammetric methods lidberg et al 2017 raw point cloud data is filtered to differentiate ground surface points from vegetation canopy and then gridded to produce a preliminary dem subsequently dems are hydro conditioned i e filling or breaching topographic cells to limit variability or noise in land surface slopes for smoother flow routing i e lower chance of computational instability chow and ben zvi 1973 rieger 1998 zhang and cundy 1989 yet this process often removes physical land surface depressions that are highly relevant to hydrologic processes at the land surface previous studies have worked to identify land surface depressions for the purpose of characterizing the location and size of land surface features such as wetland and karsts bertassello et al 2020 li et al 2011 moreno gómez et al 2019 wu et al 2016 but these work did not focus specifically on creating a dem suited to resolving fine scale land surface processes with spatially distributed hydrologic models hence the objective of this study is to present a novel topographic processing workflow referred to as depression preserved dem processing d2p algorithm with the aim of resolving surface depressions based on the scale of interest and smoothing small scale non physical variability in dems e g sanders 2007 for depression integrated and efficient modeling of land surface hydrology our approach is designed for hydrologic models that calculate flow across 4 cell faces i e d4 but can be modified easily to handle more flow directions e g d8 alongside a processed dem the algorithm also generates slopes across the cell faces this adds to the limited number of dem processing algorithms that can generate slope inputs for d4 routing models using finite difference methods condon and maxwell 2019 in this study we detail the workflow of d2p and examine its utility in processing the dem as an input for the integrated hydrologic model parflow ashby and falgout 1996 jones and woodward 2001 kollet and maxwell 2006 maxwell 2013 we compare the processed dem and evaluate the hydrologic simulation against the traditional filling method by condon and maxwell 2019 using a case study on the goodwin creek experimental watershed gcew 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area gcew is located in northern mississippi united statesand the area of the watershed is 21 7 km2 with an elevation ranging from 64 8 m to 129 1 m above mean sea level fig 1 the land use is mainly idle pasture followed by forest and cultivated land and there is a high density of small water bodies such as farm ponds yasarer et al 2018 based on the satellite imagery from the national wetlands inventory nwi provided by united states fish and wildlife service usfws https www fws gov wetlands there are a total of 93 fresh water ponds ranging in size from 500 m2 to 11 000 m2 the dem used in this study was downloaded from a derived lidar product by the mississippi automated resource information system the dem represents bare earth surface that was created from lidar points collected from 2009 to 2010 by the u s army corps of engineers usace for the mississippi delta phase 1 project https www maris state ms us html data elevation html gsc tab 0 and was hydro flattened the spatial resolution is 1 m and the vertical accuracy is 0 09 m root mean square error the dem was first smoothed by a median filter to remove roughness and aggregated to 10 m resolution to keep the hydrologic simulation computationally manageable 2 2 overview of depression preserved dem processing d2p algorithm the d2p algorithm comprises six steps as shown in the flowchart in fig 2 using dem and nwi wetland as input data it identifies surface depressions that are likely to be physically meaningful and generates a processed dem that is smoothened to reduce fine scale variability while preserving those depressions slope data is then derived from the processed dem details of steps 1 to 6 of the flowchart are explained from sections 2 2 1 to 2 2 6 2 2 1 topographic sink extraction a depression less dem was first obtained by filling the sinks using priority flood a depression filling tool barnes et al 2014 all the topographic depressions comprising real depressions and artifacts were then extracted by subtracting the input dem from the depression less dem the artifacts are caused by systematic and random errors from the precision of data acquisition instrument and processing techniques zhu et al 2013 2 2 2 removal of small scale depressions in dem from the extracted topographic depressions section 2 2 1 an improved adaptation of the level set method wu et al 2019 was applied to characterize the depressions in terms of their geometric properties and hierarchy a depression hierarchy describes the relationship between each depression whereby depressions can themselves contain smaller ones the most nested depression is referred to as a level 1 depression and the level increases as the depressions combine to form bigger depressions supporting information text s1 the level set method by wu et al 2019 establishes the hierarchy by screening each depression from the highest elevation and moving downwards to determine the spill point at which depressions combine supporting information text s2 one disadvantage of this method is that the screening was performed at fixed intervals and could overlook certain depressions barnes et al 2019 to avoid this the screening interval must be reduced but the computation can become inefficient supporting information text s3 therefore we modified the method to screen at each unique dem cell elevation within the depression instead of at fixed intervals this ensures that each depression is assigned the correct level in the hierarchy the level of each depression will be used in section 2 2 4 after establishing the hierarchy the area of each depression was determined and the average depth of each depression d was calculated using eq 1 1 d i 1 n z s z i n where n is the number of dem cells within the depression zs is the spill elevation and zi is the elevation of the ith cell in the depression finally average depth and area thresholds of 0 0036 m and 900 m2 were applied the motivation of the thresholds was to identify and remove small scale depressions that are deemed to be inconsequential to the overall hydrologic process since they tend to fill easily and lose their function as closed basins in most rainfall events li et al 2011 the thresholds also help to filter out small scale non physical variabilities from the dem to improve computational efficiency these small scale depressions were removed by filling to generate a modified dem the thresholds were derived from a sensitivity assessment of the final delineated depressions using different threshold values to achieve a balance between matching the wetland data from nwi and excessive false matches supporting information text s4 the considerations for the setting of the thresholds are also discussed in section 4 1 2 2 3 watershed analysis the watershed analysis was implemented using the grass module r watershed grass development team 2020 an a least cost search algorithm hart et al 1968 metz et al 2011 was applied on the modified dem from 2 2 2 to generate flow direction and river network this algorithm does not require the dem to be further altered to determine flow direction and extracts the path of rivers through depressions more accurately compared to traditional methods planchon and darboux 2001 wang and liu 2006 with sink filling metz et al 2011 2 2 4 classify riverine depressions for targeted preservation in this section we focus on riverine depressions after having removed small scale depressions from the dem section 2 2 2 dems are especially prone to errors along rivers due to the difficulty of sensors in penetrating thick riparian vegetation and water bodies as well as the resolution limits in resolving the channel bottom elevation lindsay 2016a schwanghart and scherler 2017 this creates spurious topographic variability along rivers leading to depressions inside the channel width with discontinuous bottom slopes that can cause model instability hengl 2006 iserles 2009 yu et al 2020 in addition high resolution lidar derived dems can contain false hydrologic barriers such as bridges or roads carlson and danner 2010 that will form false depressions during the depression extraction process in section 2 2 1 such false depressions are rarely addressed in previous depression integrated studies hence our goal is to filter out the aforementioned spurious depressions within the channel width fig 3 a and depressions arising from false hydrologic barriers fig 3b to finally keep the remaining water bodies that partially coincide with rivers fig 3c to achieve this we developed a new metric that takes advantage of the hierarchy of depression levels the metric referred herein as the river to depression ratio rtd provides a measure of the contribution of the river to the makeup of the depression the rtd was calculated for each highest level depression using the formula in eq 2 2 r t d n r n n l 1 r n l 1 in eq 2 n is the number of dem cells within the highest level depression and nr is a subset number of cells from n that are within the river channel width while n l 1 is the number of dem cells in all level 1 depressions i e the most nested depressions within the highest level depression and n l 1 r is a subset number of cells from n l 1 that are within the river channel width the equation is a product of two ratios the first ratio is a measure of the extent of the depression that coincides with the river the higher the first ratio the larger the portion of the depression falling within the river channel width fig 3a the second ratio was introduced to specifically distinguish between false depressions arising from roads or bridges and actual water bodies that partially coincide with the river it does so by drawing on the depression hierarchy from section 2 2 2 to gage the geometry of the depression ponds and wetlands generally have a bowl like structure with a flat bottom which manifests itself by the level 1 cells spreading beyond the river resulting in a lower n l 1 r n l 1 fig 3c on the other hand in false depressions arising from road or bridge crossings level 1 cells are mostly concentrated within the river channel width resulting in a higher n l 1 r n l 1 fig 3b using eq 2 depressions with rtd lower than a certain threshold would be selected for preservation in the next section as their geometry suggests that they are more likely to be physically meaningful depressions that intersect with a river e g fig 3c in other words the threshold is the maximum rtd for a physically meaningful depression in the study area to determine the threshold the rtd was calculated for each depression from nwi data and the maximum calculated rtd was set as the threshold by this point we had identified physically meaningful depressions that we wanted to preserve in the dem the preserved depressions compared well against the wetlands in the nwi data fig 4 the excluded depressions namely small scale depressions depressions within the channel width and depressions associated with false hydrologic barriers were all assumed to be artifacts 2 2 5 river network smoothening we applied a quantile regression algorithm to smoothen the river while preserving the depressions partially coinciding with the river identified in section 2 2 4 the smoothening aims to maintain the general profile while reducing fine scale variability and adverse slopes previous studies smoothen the river profile by modifying the elevation universally based on the average slope of the reach barnes et al 2016 condon and maxwell 2019 the approach we adopt here offers the flexibility to process the river segment intersecting with depression differently from other segments generally the algorithm works by minimizing the sum of absolute values of the residuals given by the difference between the smoothened elevation and the raw elevation as well as the roughness the underlying optimization function of the algorithm known as the constrained regularized smoothing crs algorithm is shown in eq 3 schwanghart and scherler 2017 3 arg min i 1 n ρ τ z x i i z τ x i s z τ x 2 dx where z xi is the unsmoothed elevation along river profiles x distance upstream of the watershed outlet n is the number of elevations i is the identity matrix τ 0 1 is the constant chosen according to which quantile needs to be estimated in this case τ was set at 0 5 z τ is the estimated elevation ρ τ is a loss function dependent on the residuals ri given by 4 ρ τ r i τ r i 0 r i where r i is defined as z x i i z τ x i and is an indicator function that has a value of 1 if the residual r i is less than 0 and a value of 0 otherwise s dictates the degree of smoothening and is defined by 5 s δ x 2 k n p where δx is the resolution of the dem p is the number of second derivative terms in eq 3 k is the parameter that scales the degree of smoothing in schwanghart scherler 2017 the river profile was forced to decrease in the downstream direction and the degree of smoothening s was set to be uniform throughout the entire river network to avoid distorting the actual depressions that intersect the river path e g fig 3c we introduced separate conditions to process river segments within depressions and river segments outside of depressions for river segments outside depressions the downstream elevation was forced to be lower than the upstream by a minimum difference ε as shown in eq 6 6 z τ x z τ x δ x ε this was not applied for river segments inside depressions to avoid removing the depressions in addition s was set to be higher for river segments outside of depressions but lower in river segments within depressions to preserve any high curvature structures e g dams downstream of the depressions lastly to prevent the river cell being raised inadvertently creating depressions outside the river we introduced a new condition whereby the elevation of the river segment was globally set not to exceed that of the riverbanks by ε 7 z τ x min z τ y δ y x z τ y δ y x ε fig 5 illustrates the different constraints that were imposed on the river segments within the depressions and outside the depressions the modified algorithm will be referred to as the adapted crs algorithm following the implementation of the adapted crs algorithm we temporarily masked out the stream segments and preserved depressions and applied filling on any sinks created as a by product in the dem barnes et al 2014 a final processed dem was obtained 2 2 6 slope calculation the outcome of the above steps was a processed dem with smoothened rivers and retained depressions in this step slopes in the north south and east west directions were calculated for each cell the north south slope is defined at the upper cell face between a cell and the adjacent cell to the north while the east west slope is defined at the right cell face between a call and the adjacent cell to the east the calculated slope direction for cells outside of depressions was adjusted to match the flow direction by reversing the sign whenever there was a discrepancy the slope magnitude remained unchanged but subject to a maximum slope threshold and a minimum slope threshold 2 3 comparative analysis to assess the performance of d2p we evaluated the extent and magnitude of its modification on the raw dem and the subsequent impact on overland flow since parflow is used in this study we chose priorityflow condon and maxwell 2019 a recent dem conditioning algorithm developed for parflow to be compared against d2p the algorithm followed the traditional way of removing all the sinks and the approach is justified when a kinematic wave approximation is used for the overland flow simulation dem processing algorithms are known to introduce errors since it is difficult to ascertain the origin of each depression so the algorithm should ideally achieve a reasonable flow path with minimal modification to the dem lindsay and creed 2005 hence we quantified the change in elevation of the processed dem relative to the source dem as a measure of the change to the landscape in addition we performed a rainfall recession simulation in parflow using the processed dems and the raw dem by applying a rainfall rate of 5 mm hr for 10 hrs followed by 20 hrs of recession similar to the test used by barnes et al 2016 and condon and maxwell 2019 the simulation was performed on an impervious surface to focus on surface water processes diffusive wave approximation was used for overland flow table 1 summarizes the five dems that were used in the comparative study the raw dem the processed dem from the conventional algorithm and the processed dem from d2p are represented by case 0 case 1 and case 4 respectively case 1 fills the depressions first and smoothens the river by enforcing a constant average slope between two ends of each reach due to the fundamental differences between the conventional algorithm and d2p in terms of the treatment of the depression and river smoothening two cases were added to isolate the effect of each change on the dem from case 1 to case 4 case 2 changes the river smoothening in case 1 to the use of the adapted crs with the uniform constraint of elevation decreasing downstream eq 6 case 3 uses the adapted crs with uniform constraint of elevation decreasing downstream before filling case 3 is the closest to case 4 in terms of the processed dem except that select depressions are preserved during the adapted crs step and the filling step in case 4 in summary cases 1 to 3 condition dems using different combination of depression treatment and stream smoothening methods without preserving any depression while case 4 incorporates select depressions an example of a processed river segment from case 0 to case 4 is illustrated in supporting information fig s9 3 results 3 1 evaluation of identified depressions to evaluate the accuracy of the delineated depressions by d2p algorithm 1 m resolution aerial imagery from the national agriculture imagery program naip https www fsa usda gov programs and services aerial photography imagery programs naip imagery was used to manually delineate the ponds as a benchmark for comparison the imagery was chosen from july 2009 to match the date of the lidar dem used in this study alongside the dem resampled to 10 m resolution the comparison was also done at the original lidar dem resolution of 1 m and two other resampled resolutions of 5 m and 20 m the area and depth thresholds are set the same for all the resolutions to solely investigate the impact of dem resolution on depression identification from fig 6 a d the d2p algorithm was able to identify at least 85 of the delineated ponds from the naip imagery 56 out of 66 at the dem resolutions of 1 m 5 m and 10 m but the performance dropped to 35 23 out of 66 at the coarsest resolution of 20 m this indicates the inability of the 20 m resolution dem to resolve the scale and geometry of the depressions in the study area most of the naip ponds had an area of the same order of magnitude 400 m2 to 4000 m2 as the 20 m by 20 m grid cell so the depressions in the dem could easily be lost during the resampling of the dem we compared the area of the depressions identified by d2p against the naip ponds and found a close agreement with a coefficient of determination r 2 of at least 0 75 across all the resolutions in general there is an overestimation in the area of the depressions delineated by d2p as shown in fig 6e this is because the d2p depression area is determined by filling the depressions in the raw dem up to the spill point elevation which makes it the maximum possible area the manually delineated areas from naip reflect the state of the pond at a specific time but may not be the maximum given the tendency to fluctuate depending on the climate moreover vegetation and shadows in the naip imagery may mask the true boundary of the ponds during manual delineation and result in underestimation of the pond extent yasarer et al 2018 notably the positive bias tends to increase with the dem resolution because the dem at higher resolution is better able to represent the boundary of the maximum depression area more closely on the other hand a coarser resolution dem may fail to capture the irregular boundary of the depression and underestimate the area as is the case for the 20 m dem especially for the smaller ponds another statistical analysis in the form of the binary pattern metrics shown in table 2 was conducted to further examine the degree to which the d2p depressions agree with the naip ponds in terms of location and extent the results affirmed the performance of d2p as the probability of detection pod indicated that more than 85 of the depressions matched the ponds for dem resolutions 10 m and lower d2p produced false alarms across all four dem resolutions with the false alarm rate far ranging from 44 to 53 this is to be expected due to the tendency to overestimate the depression area as explained previously and the fact that not all depressions may result in the formation of a pond in general as the dem resolution increases the pod increases but this is offset by an increase in the far so the resulting critical success index csi is similar for the dem resolutions of 1 m 5 m and 10 m at about 50 however at the dem resolution of 20 m we observe that the pod drops drastically but the far does not decrease in tandem and this causes the csi to decrease significantly to 32 from the above comparisons we have shown that d2p is able to reasonably identify depressions provided that the dem resolution is able to resolve the scale of the depressions of interest while d2p will perform better in capturing both the location and geometry of the known depressions from existing datasets e g nwi naip with a higher resolution dem it also generates a higher number of unknown depressions which can be hard to validate without ground truth data 3 2 effect of processing methods on dem the extent and magnitude of the impact to the raw dem by the different methods decreased gradually from case 1 to case 4 as shown by the percentage of modified cells and mean absolute elevation offset in table 3 this agrees with previous research lindsay 2016b which showed filling case 1 and case 2 to have a bigger impact on the dem than a hybrid of breaching and filling case 3 and case 4 between case 4 and case 1 d2p reduced the percentage of modified cells for the entire watershed from 11 3 to 5 58 and the mean absolute elevation offset by 5 fold from 0 0745 m to 0 0145 m compared to the conventional algorithm focusing on the river network which was more likely to have changed due to the additional smoothing step the elevation of practically all the cells in case 1 were modified compared to only 30 6 of the cells in case 4 in addition the magnitude of modification was also smaller in case 4 with a mean absolute elevation offset of 0 223 m compared to 0 648 m in case 1 from the boxplot in fig 7 there was a predominant increase in elevation in case 1 and case 2 but not case 3 and 4 due to the nature of the filling algorithm at the same time the elevation offsets were highly variable in case 1 1 5 m to 2 m and case 2 0 6 m to 1 m compared to case 3 0 4 m to 0 4 m and case 4 0 4 m to 0 4 m overall the differences between the river profile from the processed dem and the raw dem were the highest in case 1 followed by case 2 and finally cases and 3 and 4 which were similar 3 3 effect of processing methods on hydrologic simulation to understand the impact of the processing methods on hydrologic simulation we compared the distribution of the simulated surface water depth and the time series of the surface water storage and streamflow fig 8 shows the instantaneous surface water depth distribution for a selected location in the watershed with a high density of ponds 10 hrs into the simulation at the end of the heavy rainfall fig 8c the location and extent of the ponds in both case 0 and case 4 generally matched that of the ponds extracted from naip however artifactual depressions could be observed in case 0 such as the one in the black circle as a result of using the raw dem this is a classic example of a false depression arising when a road crosses over the river in cases 1 2 and 3 the depression removal process created flat terrain in the naip pond areas resulting in minimal accumulation of water less than 0 1 m in depth notably case 1 resulted in a larger flooded area compared to cases 2 and 3 as the elevation of the river profile was raised gradually upstream to maintain a constant slope thereby reducing the capacity of the channels 30 hrs into the simulation at the end of the recession fig 8d the residual water in flat areas in cases 1 to 3 had already dried out on the other hand the depressions in case 4 functioned as storage by trapping the water and formed isolated ponds the result was not available for case 0 as the model stopped running at the 11th hour due to the numerical instability from using the raw dem overall the dem in case 4 allowed ponding to be modeled realistically and the choice of dem processing resulted in significant difference in the spatial distribution of ponding refer to supporting information fig s10 for a similar comparison at another location within the watershed next we analyzed the surface water storage time series for all cases the total surface water storage fig 9 a was broken down into a river storage component fig 9b and a non river storage component fig 9c in fig 9a the total surface water storage was highest in case 0 up to the point when the model terminated prematurely this is because the drainage was poorest in case 0 due to the lack of a smoothened river network that could direct water to flow between cell faces the water from the rainfall became trapped in sinks and could barely reach the outlet of the watershed of the other cases the total surface water storage was highest in case 4 due to retention of water by the preserved depressions although the total surface water storage was similar across all depression less simulations i e cases 1 2 and 3 the choice of river smoothening mechanism and depression treatment resulted in a large difference in the distribution of storage between the river and non river components in fig 9b the river storage was lower in cases 1 and 2 than case 3 this can be attributed to the shallower channel depth see table 4 from the use of filling to remove depressions in cases 1 and 2 conversely the shallower channel depth makes the river more prone to overflowing and results in a higher non river surface water storage in case 1 and 2 compared to case 3 fig 9c by preserving and integrating depressions in the hydrologic simulation the river storage in case 4 was reduced compared to case 3 fig 9b because surface runoff was intercepted as non river storage after the rain had stopped the non river storage in case 4 decreased much slower than other cases due to the retention effect of the depressions fig 10 shows the hydrographs at the outlet of the watershed without any dem processing the peak flow was substantially lower in case 0 as it was difficult for the water to flow past the rugged terrain to the outlet of the watershed this corresponds with the behavior of storage in fig 9 whereby most of the water arriving as rainfall remained as surface water storage after getting trapped by the sinks until the 10th hr the streamflow took about the same time to peak for cases 1 2 and 3 however the peak streamflow in case 3 was visibly higher than case 1 and case 2 because of the higher flow depth at the outlet comparing case 4 and case 3 an attenuation of the peak streamflow was observed in the former due to the preserved depressions the peak stream flow in case 4 was reduced by 10 compared to case 3 and the hydrograph for case 4 lagged that of case 3 by 0 4 hr 4 discussion 4 1 threshold for removal of artifacts for this study to distinguish farm ponds from depressions too small to be significant to the hydrologic simulation we set a minimum threshold depression depth of 0 0036 m and area of 900 m2 based on nwi data there is not a universal value that can be applied to all cases and the threshold should ideally be determined based on the scale of interest knowledge of the existing site dem resolution and computational efficiency of the hydrologic simulation for example to investigate malaria vector habitat dynamics in africa the hydrologic model needs to consider smaller 100 m2 and shallower depressions 0 5 m as the dominant malaria vectors prefer transient pools for breeding minakawa et al 1999 on the other hand the threshold will be very different for a reservoir simulation considering that the scale of the water body of interest is much bigger any existing site information will also be helpful in refining the thresholds guided by the minnesota karst feature database kfdb wu et al 2016 used a minimum depression area of 100 m2 and minimum depression depth of 0 5 m to identify natural sinkholes in a separate experiment conducted on the prairie pothole region of north dakota a different threshold of a minimum depression size of 2000 m2 and minimum depression depth of 0 3 m was chosen based on spatial data from us geological survey wu et al 2019 area and depth thresholds can also vary with dem resolution from the sensitivity analysis in supporting information text s4 the performance of the tested thresholds in the successful identification of wetlands from nwi data by d2p generally increased with dem resolution higher resolution dems typically require larger area threshold as there is a higher probability of small artifactual depressions that need to be removed li et al 2011 however the same trend was not observed in our study instead the optimal area threshold across the resolutions of 1 m 5 m 10 m were all around 800 m2 to 900 m2 this could be due to the quality and nature of the nwi data which is a record of wetlands and not all depressions in the study area on the other hand a lower depth threshold may be needed for lower resolution dems obtained by aggregating a higher resolution dem aggregating a higher resolution dem has the effect of averaging out the topographic variability resulting in shallower depressions another factor to consider is the trade off between the realism of the topographic representation and computational efficiency while setting a low threshold would allow the dem to capture most of the depressions it will also increase the variability in the topography which could inadvertently introduce slope discontinuities and develop oscillation and instability issues for some models for instance setting the threshold area too low increases the chances of including deep yet small depressions that are anomalous and can greatly hurt the numerical performance surface depressions within the channel width and depressions associated with false hydrologic barriers were removed based on a calculated rtd threshold a threshold that is set too low causes more depressions intersecting with the river to be removed including ponds and wetlands along rivers fig 3c that could serve important hydrologic functions on the other hand a higher threshold would cause more depressions intersecting with the river to be preserved including false depressions arising from roads or bridges and also result in a more rugged river profile in this study the threshold was inferred based on known depression locations from nwi data in general the rtd threshold decreases as the resolution increases the calculated rtd thresholds were 0 8 0 54 0 33 and 0 076 for dem resolutions of 20 m 10 m 5 m and 1 m respectively this is due to the overestimation of the areal representation of the river at lower resolutions the performance of the rtd threshold in distinguishing false depressions associated with roads or bridges from water bodies that coincide with the river drops as the resolution decreases this is due to the inability of the dem to fully resolve the depression hierarchy at lower resolutions at 20 m dem resolution the far table 2 was particularly high which can be attributed to the inclusion of false depressions 4 2 implication of dem processing algorithm on hydrologic simulation filling vs hybrid many studies have compared the influence of different dem processing algorithms on the dem in terms of elevation slope and hydrological attributes callow et al 2007 lindsay 2016b lindsay and creed 2005 woodrow et al 2016 in line with those studies our comparison across the four cases shows that the filling based algorithms in case 1 and case 2 produced a greater impact on the dem quantified by the number of modified cells and elevation offset in table 3 and fig 7 however the impact of the dem processing algorithms on the hydrological simulation is rarely discussed from the rainfall recession simulation we observe local differences in the pattern of the ponding between filling and hybrid algorithms especially around false depressions arising from the crossing of a road over a river in case 1 and case 2 filling raised the elevation of the upstream river valley to at least match the level of the road crossing and this resulted in inundation over a large area upstream of the road crossing with relatively similar elevation in extreme cases the flat inundated area could create an obstruction to the incoming river and cause the flow to back up increasing the computational demands on the other hand the hybrid algorithm in case 3 breached the road crossing and allowed water to flow through the river channel relatively easily in addition we observe that both the filling and hybrid algorithms resulted in roughly similar mean channel slopes but the former reduced the channel depth by 22 to 25 compared to the latter this could cause overestimation of fluvial flooding as alluded to by the higher non river storage in fig 9c and potentially result in overly conservative flood management policies 4 3 implication of depression integrated hydrologic simulation depression vs depression less we show in our rainfall recession simulation that the inclusion of depression modified the hydrologic response of the watershed we observe an attenuation in streamflow at the watershed outlet and increase in lag time of the hydrograph as the depressions stored some of the rainfall and delayed the arrival of runoff to the rivers this mechanism is widely acknowledged by other similar studies nasab and chu 2020 yasarer et al 2018 zeng et al 2020 at the same time by explicitly representing the depressions in the dem we present a viable means to capture the hydrologic connectivity between the depressions which is rarely achieved in the existing depression integrated hydrologic models the connectivity between ponds headwater streams and downstream waters was evident in case 4 at the end of the rainfall event in fig 8c long after the rainfall event when the supply of water had stopped the connecting streams that were ephemeral in nature gradually dried up resulting in geographically isolated ponds in fig 8d this process was absent in case 3 as there was no storage function with a depression less dem the impact of the depressions on the hydrologic response can vary with the magnitude of rainfall to illustrate this we increased the rainfall rate applied in the first 10 h of the simulation from 5 mm hr to 10 mm hr as shown in fig 11 at 5 mm hr rainfall rate the total runoff volume i e area under the hydrograph in case 4 is 14 lower than that of case 3 at the higher rainfall rate of 10 mm hr the relative difference in total runoff volume reduces to 9 this implies that the higher the rainfall intensity the lower the impact of the depressions on the hydrologic response the finding is consistent with the study by costabile et al 2022 one reason is because at the higher rainfall intensity the depressions tend to fill up more easily and the storage volume becomes less significant compared to the runoff volume by accounting for depression storage in model simulations it is possible to improve the accuracy of flood hazard studies and allow surface depressions to be leveraged as part of a holistic approach in mitigating flood risk and preventing overpredictions beyond flood hazard studies depression integrated hydrologic modeling has the potential to augment water resources management by enhancing the spatial delineation of water across the watershed and providing a more effective guide for local irrigation and crop rotation strategies rajib et al 2020 lastly it is feasible to explicitly represent the connectivity between depressions and streams in studies to understand the effects of the transport of materials and biological fluxes within aquatic ecosystems leibowitz et al 2019 4 4 limitation of the algorithm there are three main limitations to d2p firstly the artifactual riverine depressions were removed if the rtd was below the threshold which requires knowledge of locations of wetlands in the study area especially those that intersect with the river in our case we derived the rtd threshold from nwi data which is only available within the united states for future applications outside of the united states there is a need to check the local database for similar information or resort to other means to determine the rtd threshold such as through field survey if the above is still not feasible the threshold can be estimated iteratively by a sensitivity analysis secondly a d2p processed dem can result in higher computational demands in distributed hydrological modeling than depression free dems by comparing the number of solver iterations among the five cases in fig 12 case 4 generally had a higher computational demand than cases 1 to 3 the number of iterations increased sharply near the 5th time step where the water was just starting to fill the depression this process was harder to solve in parflow at the point when the overland flow component was activated from the 7th to 10th timestep case 1 required the highest number of iterations than cases 2 to 4 one possible reason was that the flat areas created by the filling process in case 1 obstructed the incoming flow from the river and caused it to back up increasing the computational demands after the rain stopped the surface water flow in cases 1 to 3 decreased and became gradually easier to solve compared to case 4 where water was retained by the depressions notably the number of iterations required in case 0 was substantially higher than the other cases indicating that some degree of dem processing was necessary for modeling purposes finally we note that hydro conditioned dems produced by the d2p workflow are optimized for hydrologic routing methodologies that rely on topographic slopes such as parflow consequently d2p dems may not necessarily be optimal for hydrologic models that rely directly on topographic heights or in flood hazard simulation where the extent and depth of ponded areas are sensitive to certain topographic features along the river hodges 2015 sanders and schubert 2019 in sections 2 2 4 and 2 2 5 we removed all depressions within the river channel width as shown in fig 3a as we could not distinguish artificial depressions from real features such as riffles and pools however the d2p workflow could be adapted to meet slightly different needs with respect to removing some features in the dem and retaining others for example the rtd threshold can be adjusted higher to retain more stream depressions and exempt them from the enforcement of the downslope condition in the adapted crs algorithm 5 summary and conclusions despite the growing emphasis on the impact of surface depressions on hydrologic processes there is a lack of a formalized dem processing tool that can resolve surface depressions of interest for fully distributed hydrologic modeling to address this gap we present the depression preserved dem processing d2p algorithm a novel automated workflow that provides a representation of the land surface consistent with hydrologic processes being resolved while removing small scale non physical variability in the dem for computational efficiency to achieve the above the d2p algorithm includes several features namely 1 improved delineation of surface depressions by screening depressions at variable instead of fixed intervals 2 adoption of a new metric rtd leveraging depression hierarchy to filter out artifactual riverine depressions and 3 adaptation of a hybrid approach to smoothen the river in a way that enforces the general downslope profile while preserving surface depressions that intersect the river path the application of the proposed algorithm in a case study in gcew minimizes the modification to the original dem and the identified depressions match well with the delineated ponds from naip imagery the performance of d2p in identifying depressions was evaluated over four different resolutions of 1 m 5 m 10 m and 20 m in addition the use of the d2p processed dem in a distributed hydrologic model also highlights the difference that the incorporation of depressions makes to the simulated ponding water storage and streamflow following are the conclusions drawn from the study 1 the d2p algorithm was able to identify at least 85 of the delineated ponds from naip satellite imagery at the dem resolution of 1 m 5 m and 10 m but not at 20 m the performance of d2p did not vary much as the dem resolution decreased from 1 m to 10 m 2 compared to a conventional dem processing algorithm which removes all the depressions the d2p algorithm has a significantly lower impact on the raw dem by reducing the percentage of modified cells for the entire watershed by 51 and the mean absolute elevation offset by 81 3 the hydrologic simulation for the rainfall recession test showcases the ability of d2p to capture the spatial distribution of physically meaningful depressions and their storage function the depression integrated simulation results in higher total surface water storage as well as an attenuated and delayed peak streamflow due to retention of water by the preserved depressions although lidar dems are generally of high accuracy and can provide a good representation of the landscape the direct use of the raw dem in hydrologic models using topographic slopes to route flow results in significant computational demands the proposed d2p algorithm provides a systematic means to balance the need to process dem for ease of computation and the preservation of surface depressions of interest while we have only demonstrated the application of d2p for small water bodies in gcew the algorithm can also be used to process dems in the context of larger water bodies such as prairie potholes the choice of hydrologic model would have to be tailored to the nature and geometry of the water bodies of interest our case study of a test rainfall event clearly suggests that the treatment of surface depressions and the choice of method for smoothening topographic variability e g filling and breaching have a significant influence on the hydrologic simulation results d2p adopts a minimum impact approach to avoid distorting terrain attributes unnecessarily while offering the user flexibility in altering depressions under different settings future work involves testing and evaluating the d2p algorithms across different landscapes d2p facilitates depression integrated studies using more fully distributed hydrologic models like parflow this can provide new insights into complex hydrologic systems and help improve water resources management and environmental sustainability decisions code

26,the nonstationary hydrological frequency analysis ns hfa aids in assessing the recurrence of hydrological extremes under nonstationarity but its reliability is often questioned due to relatively limited record lengths the metastatistical extreme value mev distribution which harnesses the ordinary event records along with the extremes has proven advantageous under stationarity and in instances with limited records yet nonstationary applications of the mev distribution are lacking and only modified versions such as the simplified mev smev and block based mev mevbb distributions have been proposed this paper develops the nonstationary version of the mev distribution for ns hfa called the mev based model which incorporates an explicit nonstationary structure and preserves the stochastic interannual variability of ordinary events the developed model is assessed using several benchmark models in both simulation studies and real applications for both in sample fitting and out of sample prediction from the perspectives of uncertainty accuracy and fitting efficiency the benchmark models for comparison included the mevbb as well as the smev and generalized extreme value distribution gev based models the results demonstrated that the proposed mev based model outperformed the mevbb regarding overfitting and captured the underlying process more efficiently accurately and with less uncertainty in addition the mev based model was superior to the gev based model due to its higher accuracy equivalent or better fitting efficiency and lower uncertainty furthermore although the mev based model performed overall equivalently to the smev based the mev based model was shown advantageous for adopting nonstationary stochastic physical covariates and facilitating out of sample predictions overall these results demonstrated that the proposed mev based model has distinct advantages for the ns hfa and consequently promotes its implementation keywords nonstationarity uncertainty ordinary events extreme events metastatistical extreme value distribution data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in the field of hydrological engineering and water resources the recurrence of extreme precipitation and flood events is commonly assessed through the hydrological frequency analysis hfa the hfa is often conducted based on extreme event records such as annual maximum series and the generalized extreme value gev distribution has become a popular choice during the last decades katz et al 2002 nerantzaki and papalexiou 2021 stedinger et al 1993 zhang et al 2020 extreme value theory states that the independent and identically distributed block maxima converge to one of three distribution families namely types i gumbel ii fréchet and iii reversed weibull distributions which can be combined into the gev distribution coles 2001 katz et al 2002 the gev distribution relies on the assumption that the number of events per block tends to infinity i e the asymptotic assumption however this assumption may be inappropriate in hydrometeorological variables such as rainfall and streamflow as the number of events per block is generally far from infinity in addition only the small portion of measurements corresponding to extremes are analyzed and ignores the rest of the available information on ordinary events the information content of ordinary events could be critical to improving the hfa since its estimates are sensitive to even subtle differences in the sample of extremes liu et al 2022 and the estimation of the distribution tail is often difficult due to the scarcity of data as a result the validity of the asymptotic assumption and the sample size limitations are two major hurdles to producing reliable estimations using the gev distribution in the hfa during the last few years the metastatistical framework has emerged as an alternative to the gev distribution marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 the metastatistical approach relies on the theoretical framework of superstatistics or compound statistics de michele and avanzi 2018 porporato et al 2006 serinaldi et al 2020 which refers to the stochastic characterization of the parameters of a given probability distribution through additional distributions the metastatistical approach bypasses the asymptotic assumption of the gev distribution and employs records of independent ordinary events to estimate the recurrence of extremes the rationale behind this approach is that the distribution of maxima arises from the distribution of ordinary events and thus the extreme event distribution can be inferred from independent realizations from the ordinary event distribution the metastatistical extreme value mev distribution which is a compound distribution treating the parameters of the ordinary event distribution and the number of ordinary events per block as stochastic variables is the cornerstone of the metastatistical approach the mev distribution has shown advantages in reducing the uncertainty in the hfa especially for return periods larger than the sample size de michele and avanzi 2018 marra et al 2018 miniussi et al 2020 miniussi and marani 2020 zorzetto et al 2016 the mev distribution is particularly attractive due to its ability to exploit information embedded in ordinary event datasets the conventional stationarity assumption of hfa is generally and often call into question because of the well known changes in the hydrometeorological system occurring both at local and global scales blöschl et al 2019 milly et al 2008 papalexiou and montanari 2019 nonstationary hfa ns hfa approaches where the distribution changes through time according to defined nonstationary structures have recently emerged to deal with these scenarios françois et al 2019 ragno et al 2019 salas et al 2018 schlef et al 2023 slater et al 2021 the nonstationary structure is a deterministic function that governs the evolution of the distribution parameters moments based on the selected covariate s commonly used nonstationary structures in the literature include linear functions of time or physical covariate s depicting the evolution of the distribution s location and or scale parameters however a known limitation of the mev distribution is its inability to explicitly deal with nonstationarity while accounting for the stochastic interannual variability of ordinary events the applicability of the metastatistical approach in the ns hfa remains limited due to the absence of explicit nonstationary formulations i e incorporating a nonstationary structure into the distribution this gap has been evaded by modified versions of the mev distribution so far for instance the simplified mev smev distribution is a variation of the mev distribution as it introduces a nonstationary structure at the expense of neglecting the stochastic interannual variability of ordinary events marra et al 2019 hence the smev distribution loses the distinctive feature of the mev distribution of capturing the stochastic interannual variabilities in fact the smev reduces to the distribution of block maxima derived from the theory of order statistics under independence considering the average number of observations per block serinaldi et al 2020 vidrio sahagún and he 2022a demonstrated and assessed the use of the smev distribution in the ns hfa other studies did not tackle the absence of a nonstationary structure in the mev distribution either but indirectly investigated the nonstationarity using a set of stationary samples of the mev distribution parameterized independently in each block often each year amponsah et al 2022 dallan et al 2022 hosseini et al 2020 marra et al 2022 miniussi and marani 2020 vidrio sahagún and he 2022a this approach using stationary block based mev distributions called mevbb throughout this paper assumes that the inter block e g interannual changes primarily emerge from the nonstationarity rather than random natural variability thus the mevbb is in fact equivalent to using a set of stationary smev distributions and does not employ a nonstationary structure for instance miniussi and marani 2020 examined long term trends in quantiles estimated by block based parameterizations of the mev distribution similarly dallan et al 2022 parameterized smev distributions and estimated their quantiles on an annual basis and then tested the presence of significant trends in the distribution parameters and quantiles estimates a few other studies amponsah et al 2022 hosseini et al 2020 marra et al 2022 also adopted the mevbb approach to investigate nonstationary signatures in extreme rainfall and the occurrence probability of hurricanes despite the accomplishments of these studies the mevbb approach is prone to overfitting and cannot produce out of sample predictions based upon a covariate due to the absence of the nonstationary structure vidrio sahagún and he 2022a thus the application of the mev distribution for ns hfa is still constrained and the development of its nonstationary formulation is needed the incorporation of a nonstationary structure into the mev distribution is key to its further development as it would enable the deterministic depiction of the distribution evolution and conduct the ns hfa using the metastatistical approach the existence of a deterministic component behind the observed changes is indispensable to justify the ns hfa koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 serinaldi et al 2018 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 yet this requirement does not imply the need for its perfect characterization but can be inferred through deductive reasoning serinaldi et al 2018 for instance complex human induced changes such as changes in hydrometeorological variables resulting from climate change can be represented by their long term deterministic signal of change despite its envelope of stochastic variability due to chaotic nonlinear internal dynamics and unpredictable natural forcings milly et al 2015 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 hence the mev distribution can advance the ns hfa by expressing its parameters as a function of covariates to deterministically depict their nonstationary changes while also capturing their random variability due to complex interactions within the hydrometeorological system in the ns hfa using physical covariates e g temperature precipitation and climate oscillation indices is overall desirable and has been pursued previously prosdocimi et al 2015 šraj and bezak 2020 yet it involves several challenges for instance the dependence of the nonstationary patterns on the physical drivers or causative processes is often relatively weak to moderate archfield et al 2016 burn and whitfield 2017 ray and goel 2019 which makes the identification of physical covariates a challenge the use of physical covariates also commonly involves a covariate dependent characterization without considering the temporal evolution of the extreme events el adlouni et al 2007 ouarda et al 2018 2019 thiombiano et al 2017 such a characterization often leads to undesirable irregular fluctuations of frequency estimates over time hesarkazzazi et al 2021 o brien and burn 2018 vu and mishra 2019 this accordingly hampers the practical applications of the nonstationary frequency estimates that typically require a temporal description in addition when performing out of sample predictions it is required to predict the physical covariates since these covariates are treated as deterministic variables in the vast majority of the ns hfa literature agilan and umamahesh 2017 ouarda et al 2019 ragno et al 2019 ray and goel 2019 deterministic predictions would be needed which might be very difficult if not impossible instead these physical covariates are often seen as stochastic variables which need to also be nonstationary to justify the use of the ns hfa hesarkazzazi et al 2021 in the face of these challenges time is often adopted as the covariate in the ns hfa as a proxy for time dependent physical drivers behind the nonstationarity obeysekera and salas 2014 prosdocimi and kjeldsen 2021 serago and vogel 2018 therefore methodologies that facilitate the use of nonstationary stochastic physical covariates in the ns hfa for out of sample predictions become necessary this paper aims to advance the use of mev distribution by incorporating an explicit nonstationary structure for conducting the ns hfa the developed nonstationary mev distribution denoted here as the mev based model is compared with benchmark models that have been previously used in ns hfa which include the mevbb smev and gev based models the assessment of the proposed mev based model is performed using a simulation study and a real case study for both in sample fitting and out of sample prediction considering accuracy fitting efficiency and uncertainty in addition an alternative formulation that uses nonstationary stochastic physical covariates was formulated and applied to a real example 2 methodology this section provides a short review of the mev distribution before introducing the proposed mev based model for the ns hfa the benchmark models which are compared with the proposed model are also briefly presented followed by the introduction of methods used for parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification for all models note that throughout this section the random variables and their realizations are denoted by uppercase and lowercase letters respectively while the vectors are denoted by boldface letters 2 1 the mev distribution the compound mev distribution of block maxima relies on the number of ordinary events per block n and the parameter vector θ of the distribution f of ordinary events x marani and ignaccolo 2015 both n and θ are considered stochastic variables that follow certain distributions and consequently the notation of ψ mev x n θ is adopted in the metastatistical formulation here θ is a latent variable i e an unobservable variable that can only be indirectly estimated through a model and related observations and its distribution is known as latent distribution the unconditional ψ mev distribution is obtained through the law of total probability namely by integrating over θ and thus the mev cumulative distribution is defined as zorzetto et al 2016 1 ψ m e v x θ n ω n ω θ f x θ n g θ n d θ where ω n and ω θ are the discrete and continuous parameters spaces of n and θ respectively g θ n is the joint probability distribution of n and θ and f is the cumulative distribution of x the weibull distribution has been commonly adopted for f when analyzing rainfall and its use has been justified physically and supported by empirical evidence especially for the tail region of the distribution de michele and avanzi 2018 marra et al 2023 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 wilson and toumi 2005 since analytical solutions of compound distributions like eq 1 are rarely available they are commonly estimated by numerical approximations de michele 2019 for practical applications the mev distribution is approximated by its expectation using the sample average computed over the observational period by zorzetto et al 2016 2 ψ m e v x θ n e f x θ n 1 m j 1 m f x θ j n j 1 m j 1 m 1 exp x λ j β j n j where m is the number of blocks θ is composed of λ and b which are the scale and shape parameters of the weibull distribution respectively and θ j λ j β j and nj are the estimated values of θ λ b and n in the jth block respectively without loss of generality the blocks are herein defined as years the probability density of the mev distribution is hence given by 3 ψ m e v x θ n d ψ m e v x θ n d x 1 m j 1 m d f x θ j n j d x 1 m j 1 m n j f x θ j f x θ j n j 1 1 m j 1 m n j β j λ j x λ j β j 1 exp x λ j β j 1 exp x λ j β j n j 1 since eq 1 is numerically approximated rather than analytically solved in the metastatistical approach the calculations of the inverse distribution and therefore quantiles also require numerical approximation the extreme event quantile estimate ψ m e v 1 x n θ i e the extreme event magnitude associated with the return period t 1 p where p is the exceedance probability is numerically estimated by finding the xt that satisfies ψ mev xt n θ 1 p zorzetto et al 2016 2 2 the proposed nonstationary mev based model a new formulation of the metastatistical approach that explicitly incorporates a nonstationary structure into the mev distribution is proposed in this formulation the distribution of the ordinary events exhibits interannual random behavior due to the natural variability of its parameter set and also changes over time according to a deterministic function similarly the number of events per year also changes over time deterministically in addition to its stochastic natural variability hence the underlying process is considered a double stochastic and nonstationary process under independence such a process is modeled by a nonstationary mev distribution whose unconditional cumulative distribution is defined as 4 ψ m e v x θ t n t ω n ω θ f x θ t n t g θ t n t d θ t where nt and θ t denote the nonstationary stochastic versions of n and θ respectively it is worth highlighting that unlike the smev distribution see section 2 3 the proposed formulation does not neglect the stochastic interannual variability of the ordinary event distributions and the number of events per year following the usual convention the nonstationary mev distribution is approximated by its expectation from the available sample considering that g is the sample distribution derived from observations marani and ignaccolo 2015 serinaldi et al 2020 zorzetto et al 2016 thus 5 ψ m e v x θ t n t e f x θ t n t e 1 exp x λ t b t n t where n t h δ t where δ t v t t δ θ t k ζ t where ζ t v t t ζ where h and k denote the corresponding probability distributions of nt and θ t respectively δ t and ζ t are the time dependent deterministic hyperparameters of h and k respectively v t is the vector of deterministic covariates and δ and ζ are the vectors of regression coefficients for δ t and ζ t respectively for instance a linear temporal trend in the parameter λ t of the ordinary event weibull distribution would be given by λ t k λ t ζ λ t where ζ λ t 1 t ζ λ 0 ζ λ 1 t ζ λ 0 ζ λ 1 t to examine the performance of the mev based model four different linear nonstationary structures were adopted following the principle of parsimony using simple rather than complex model structures chebana and ouarda 2021 koutsoyiannis 2016 serago and vogel 2018 thus λ t and or b t and or nt are expressed as linear functions of the selected covariate vt the mev based model structures are given by 6 m e v k l m m e v λ t b t n t λ t n μ λ t σ λ t where μ λ t μ λ 0 π k μ λ 1 v t σ λ t constant b t n μ b t σ b t where μ b t μ b 0 π l μ b 1 v t σ b t constant n t n μ n t σ n t where μ n t μ n 0 π m μ n 1 v t σ n t constant where k l and m are model specific subindices used to denote the nonstationary structure and are set to 1 or 0 to indicate whether λ b and n are expressed as a function of vt or time invariant respectively i is the indicator function which takes the value of 1 if its argument is 1 and 0 otherwise n denotes the normal distribution and μ and σ are its hyperparameters and μ 0 and μ 1 are the linear regression coefficients of the corresponding hyperparameters following this notation the four mev based model structures considered in this paper are mev 1 0 0 mev 1 1 0 mev 1 0 1 and mev 1 1 1 for instance in mev 1 0 0 λ varies with vt as μ λ t μ λ 0 μ λ 1 v t while both μ b t and μ n t are constant whereas in mev 1 1 1 λ b and n all vary with vt as μ λ t μ λ 0 μ λ 1 v t μ b t μ b 0 μ b 1 v t and μ n t μ n 0 μ n 1 v t the use of the normal distribution as latent distribution for the weibull distribution parameters θ and n has been previously suggested by de michele and avanzi 2018 based on a global scale investigation of daily precipitation as illustrated above and as outlined in the ns hfa literature both time t and physical covariates are considered deterministic i e denoted by vt whereas the proposed mev based model can be extended to use nonstationary stochastic physical covariates vt such as air temperature precipitation and climate indices which can be seen as the superposition of stationary stochastic and deterministic time dependent components koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 milly et al 2015 serinaldi et al 2018 vidrio sahagún and he 2022b the alternative formulation of the mev based model in which the covariates are considered nonstationary stochastic rather than deterministic variables is also presented herein since the model parameters are nonstationary and stochastic in the mev based model their conditional nonstationary expected value can be conveniently characterized as 7 e n t e v t t δ e θ t e v t t ζ where δ and ζ are the regression coefficients for e nt and e θ t respectively here both the stochasticity and temporal dependence of nt and or θ t emerge from vt for instance let s consider the case of vt being first order nonstationary i e nonstationary in the first statistical moment only and a linear relationship between λ t and vt in this case eq 7 becomes 8 e λ t 1 e v t ζ λ 0 ζ λ 1 ζ λ 0 ζ λ 1 e v t where e vt is time dependent nonstationary unlike eq 5 in eq 8 the covariate contains the stochastic component that would follow a certain distribution indeed eq 8 could lead to a similar characterization of λ t when vt t in mev 1 0 0 except that the temporal description is directly inferred from vt to illustrate the use of vt in this alternative formulation the mev based model structures eq 6 were adapted considering that the stochasticity of λ t b t and or nt arise from vt as illustrated in eq 8 and that v t n μ v t σ v t with constant σ v t while μ v t exhibits a linear law of time hence these model structures herein denoted as m e v 1 0 0 a m e v 1 1 0 a m e v 1 0 1 a and m e v 1 1 1 a are equivalent to those of the previous formulation in terms of nonstationary structures but differ in the way that the covariate is handled i e as a nonstationary stochastic variable instead of a deterministic variable 2 3 benchmark ns hfa models the block based mevs smev based and gev based models the benchmark models include the block based mev distributions mevbb as well as the smev and gev based ns hfa models the mev distribution has been argued to be capable of implicitly capturing the potential underlying nonstationarity through the interannual variability of multiple block based parameterizations the mevbb was adopted by amponsah et al 2022 dallan et al 2022 marra et al 2022 miniussi and marani 2020 and vidrio sahagún and he 2022a the comparison with mevbb was used particularly to demonstrate the improvement of the proposed mev based model over the existing implementation of the metastatistical approach here the set of annual samples of the mev distribution is denoted as mevbb and given by 9 m e v b b m e v λ j β j n j 1 j m in the smev distribution the interannual stochastic variability of both θ and n is neglected as these variables are considered deterministic marra et al 2019 consequently these parameters are denoted as θ and n herein besides under nonstationarity the smev distribution varies over time by using time dependent distribution parameters the cumulative distribution and probability density of the smev distribution are given respectively by 10 ψ s m e v x θ t n t f x θ t n t 1 exp x λ t β t n t 11 ψ s m e v x θ t n t d ψ s m e v x θ t n t d x d f x θ t n t d x n t f x θ t f x θ t n t 1 n t β t λ t x λ t β t 1 exp x λ t β t 1 exp x λ t β t n t 1 similar to the mev based model the smev based model adopted parsimonious linear nonstationary structures in which λ t β t and or nt are expressed as linear functions of the selected covariate the smev based ns hfa model structures are given by 12 s m e v k l m s m e v λ t β t n t λ t λ 0 i k λ 1 v t β t β 0 i l β 1 v t n t n 0 i m n 1 v t where k l and m indicate whether λ β and n are expressed as a function of vt respectively and λ0 and λ1 β0 and β1 as well as n 0 and n 1 are the regression coefficients of λ β and n respectively following this notation the four smev based model structures considered in this paper are smev 1 0 0 smev 1 1 0 smev 1 0 1 and smev 1 1 1 for instance in smev 1 0 0 λ varies with vt as λ t λ0 λ1 vt while both β and n are constant whereas in smev 1 1 1 λ β and n all vary with vt as λ t λ0 λ1 vt β t β0 β1 vt and nt n 0 n 1 vt the cumulative gev function of the random variable y which corresponds to the annual maxima of n ordinary events x of each year i e yj max x j 1 x j n is defined as 13 f y θ f y ξ α κ exp 1 κ y ξ α 1 κ κ 0 exp exp y ξ α κ 0 where the parameter vector θ is composed of the shape κ scale α and location ξ parameters under nonstationarity ξ and α were employed to depict the nonstationary and expressed as a linear function of vt whereas κ was assumed constant considering its difficult estimation due to limited sample sizes and consequently its unrealistic time variant characterization coles 2001 salas et al 2018 the gev based ns hfa model structures are given by 14 g e v k l 0 g e v ξ t α t κ ξ t ξ 0 i k ξ 1 v t α t α 0 i l α 1 v t κ c o n s t a n t where k and l indicate whether ξ and α are expressed as a function of vt respectively and ξ0 and ξ1 and α0 and α1 are the regression coefficients of ξ and α respectively following this notation the two gev based model structures considered in this paper are gev 1 0 0 and gev 1 1 0 for instance in gev 1 1 0 ξ and α both vary with vt as ξ t ξ0 ξ1 vt and α t α0 α1 vt 2 4 parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification the parameter estimation of the mevbb and smev and gev based models was conducted using the maximum likelihood ml method which has the advantage of easily incorporating the nonstationary structure into the probability distribution in the smev based model the n was estimated as the sample average of nj when m 0 in eq 12 while n 0 and n 1 for nt when m 1 in eq 12 was estimated using the non parametric theil sen trend estimator in contrast the proposed mev based model cannot be parameterized directly by applying the conventional ml method as the model parameters follow a distribution whose hyperparameters need to be estimated from the estimates of the latent variables thus the parameter estimation and subsequent frequency estimates of the mev based model were conducted with the following steps 1 fit the ordinary event distribution independently in each block j similar to the mevbb using the ml method to derive a time series of parameter estimates θ j this procedure is necessary to derive block based realizations from the latent nonstationary stochastic process θ t 2 then the hyperparameters of the latent distributions n here which can be either stationary or nonstationary depending on the mev based model structure employed are estimated using the conventional ml method and the series of θ j and nj in this way both the nonstationary and stochastic nature of the ordinary event distribution parameters and or the number of events per block are properly accounted for 3 lastly the stationary or nonstationary expected values of the latent distributions are used to derive the point estimates of θ t and n t which are in turn used to produce the nonstationary frequency estimates effective return periods or quantiles at any given point in time furthermore in practice the low magnitude observations may negatively impact the estimation of the right tail of the ordinary event distribution in the metastatistical approach marra et al 2019 miniussi and marra 2021 observed datasets are often left censored to mitigate this impact marra et al 2019 2020 vidrio sahagún and he 2022a the left censored version of the ml method cohn 2005 helsel 2011 vidrio sahagún and he 2022a was employed herein for estimating the distribution parameters when dealing with observational datasets note that the threshold for censoring the data is case specific and has been commonly determined through various analysis methods such as optimizing some relevant metric formetta et al 2022 marra et al 2019 2020 miniussi and marra 2021 vidrio sahagún and he 2022a the threshold was thus determined by maximizing the fitting efficiency while ensuring that the left censored data still follow the weibull distribution herein in this paper the uncertainty was quantified using the data driven bootstrap resampling method which has been widely adopted to quantify the uncertainty in the ns hfa gilleland and katz 2016 ouarda et al 2019 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 this method is advantageous as it is independent of the parameter estimation method straightforward regardless of the model complexity and it can yield relatively asymmetric confidence intervals the parametric bootstrap which generates samples from a parametric model fitted to the data has been proven superior to the non parametric bootstrap kyselý 2008 2010 panagoulia et al 2014 thus the uncertainty of the benchmark models was quantified using the conventional parametric bootstrap method note that in the smev based and mevbb models the ns are deterministic rather than stochastic and thus their sample average and observed values respectively were employed to quantify the uncertainty in the mev based model the bootstrap method was modified due to its compounding nature here the confidence intervals at an α significance level around the estimated quantiles were derived as follows 1 a parametric estimate ψ of the population ψ is derived from the available observed sample of m blocks using the parameter estimation procedure based on the ml method 2 nsamp synthetic samples consisting of n i j observations per block and m blocks are generated from the parametric estimate ψ these synthetic samples are generated by randomly sampling the ordinary event distribution f with randomly sampled θ t values from the latent distributions the values of n i j are also randomly sampled from the corresponding distribution 3 the mev based model is now fitted to each synthetic sample and the model parameters θ i n i i 1 2 n s a m p and the quantiles x i ψ 1 p θ i n i are estimated for each synthetic sample using the aforementioned ml procedure 4 lastly the confidence intervals are obtained using the quantiles from the set of nsamp estimated x i s the lower bound of the confidence interval at a 1 α 100 significance level is the α 2 percentile while the upper bound is the 1 α 2 percentile of the resampled x i s 2 5 model evaluation and comparison the performance of all models was assessed from the perspectives of fitting efficiency accuracy and uncertainty the normalized akaike information criterion naic which captures the trade off between the goodness of fit and complexity of the model and takes the sample size into account was used to assess the fitting efficiency the relative root mean square error rrmse was employed to assess the accuracy of the model estimates these two metrics are given by 15 n a i c 2 l θ 2 d m 16 r r m s e 1 m t 1 m r t t p t t r t t 2 where d is the number of model parameters l θ is the calculated log likelihood of the model and r t t and p t t are the true and the estimated quantiles associated with t at time t respectively note that the rrmse was only calculated when the true quantiles are known beforehand i e in the simulation study section 3 the uncertainty was quantified using the relative average bandwidth raw and the relative coverage width index rcwi of the confidence intervals the rcwi combines the raw and the percentage of coverage poc of the confidence intervals which conflict with each other these metrics are given by 17 r a w 1 m t 1 m p t t u p t t l p t t 18 p o c 1 m t 1 m c t t where c t t 1 t s t p t t l r t t p t t u 0 elsewhere 19 r c w i r a w exp 1 α c w i p o c 100 2 where p t t u and p t t l are the upper and lower uncertainty bounds at t and t respectively and α cwi is the significance level 0 05 similar to the rrmse the calculation of the poc and rcwi requires knowing the true quantiles a priori and thus the rcwi was only computed in the simulation study 3 simulation study a simulation study was conducted to compare the proposed mev based model and the benchmark models using synthetic ordinary event datasets the datasets were generated from nonstationary compound distributions with a priori known statistical characteristics fig 1 specifically the ordinary event datasets were generated by randomly sampling n times per block from the weibull distribution under four different nonstationary scenarios which were denoted as s1 s2 s3 and s4 and given by 20 s 1 x t weibull λ t b where λ t n μ λ t σ λ 0 where μ λ t μ λ 0 μ λ 1 t σ λ 0 constant b n μ b 0 σ b 0 where μ b 0 constant σ b 0 constant n n μ n 0 σ n 0 where μ n 0 constant σ n 0 constant 21 s 2 x t weibull λ t b t where λ t n μ λ t σ λ 0 where μ λ t μ λ 0 μ λ 1 2 t σ λ 0 constant b t n μ b t σ b 0 where μ b t μ b 0 μ b 1 2 t σ b 0 constant n n μ n 0 σ n 0 where μ n 0 constant σ n 0 constant 22 s 3 x t weibull λ t b where λ t n μ λ t σ λ 0 where μ λ t μ λ 0 μ λ 1 t σ λ 0 constant b n μ b 0 σ b 0 where μ b 0 constant σ b 0 constant n t n μ n t σ n 0 where μ n t μ n 0 μ n 1 t σ n 0 constant 23 s 4 x t weibull λ t b t where λ t n μ λ t σ λ 0 where μ λ t μ λ 0 μ λ 1 2 t σ λ 0 constant b t n μ b t σ b 0 where μ b t μ b 0 μ b 1 2 t σ b 0 constant n t n μ n t σ n 0 where μ n t μ n 0 μ n 1 t σ n 0 constant where μ λ 0 8 μ λ 1 0 125 σ λ 0 1 μ b 0 1 μ b 1 0 004 σ b 0 0 015 μ n 0 50 μ n 1 0 2 and σ n 0 3 these hyperparameters were selected to keep the expected values of λ b and n three standard deviations within their commonly reported ranges of 5 λ 25 0 5 b 1 1 and 40 n 80 de michele and avanzi 2018 marani and ignaccolo 2015 marra et al 2018 2019 2020 miniussi and marani 2020 zorzetto and marani 2020 note that these hyperparameters are also close to those of the real rainfall datasets employed in this paper a record length of m 50 years was employed for the simulation study to reflect typical sample size limitations all synthetic datasets were verified to align with the defined nonstationary scenarios to guarantee a fair comparison of the proposed model with the benchmark models significant trends were detected in the annual maximum series ams extracted from the synthetic datasets using the mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 and thus exhibited nonstationary signatures the ordinary event distribution parameters estimated on an annual basis i e λ j β j nj also presented significant temporal trends consistent with nonstationary scenarios s1 s2 s3 and s4 moreover the amss were also properly fitted by the gev based model according to both the two sample kolmogorov smirnov ks massey jr 1951 and the modified anderson darling mad tests with critical values determined by monte carlo simulation ahmad et al 1988 anderson and darling 1952 shin et al 2012 the standard transformation was applied to the nonstationary amss using the corresponding reference model coles 2001 ragno et al 2019 to allow such verification all the statistical tests were conducted at the 0 05 significance level in this simulation study 1 000 datasets were generated for each nonstationary scenario and thus a total of 4 000 datasets were employed the model comparison was conducted in terms of both in sample fitting and out of sample prediction i e in the future using the temporal covariate i e vt t to assess the model performance for in sample fitting the rrmse as well as the raw and rcwi were calculated at t 10 50 and 100 years to evaluate the accuracy and uncertainty respectively the empirical and true naics were calculated using the sample ams and 100 true quantiles derived from the true nonstationary distribution of extremes with equally spaced exceedance probability at each time slice respectively these metrics reflect the models fitting efficiency in capturing the sample ams and the underlying nonstationary stochastic process of extremes respectively the true quantiles for calculating the performance metrics in each nonstationary scenario were derived by monte carlo simulation by a generating 1 107 blocks with nt ordinary events each sampled from the weibull distribution with θ t at a given time tk being nt and θ t randomly sampled from their corresponding distribution eqs 20 23 b extracting the annual maximum from each block at tk which is equivalent to having 1 107 realizations from the nonstationary extreme event stochastic process at tk and c obtaining the t year extreme event quantiles from this large sample of block maxima using the unbiased weibull plotting position formula these steps were repeated for every tk of interest and nonstationary scenario when examining the model performance for out of sample prediction the true naic rrmse and rcwi were used the horizon length in the future equal to m i e 50 years was adopted in the assessment 4 application on real study cases the proposed mev based model was further compared with the benchmark models using observational datasets to assess their practical feasibility the datasets used are daily rainfall measured at the hydrometeorological stations of león dge conagua 11095 los castillos conagua 11040 and abasolo conagua 11001 in mexico these datasets have lengths of 72 72 and 70 years and are referred to as d1 d2 and d3 respectively d1 and d2 have missing data only in two years 1950 and 1958 and one year 1950 respectively as illustrated in figs 2 a c the amss of the datasets d1 d2 and d3 exhibit significant temporal trends in the mean detected by the mann kendall test which are indicative of the presence of nonstationarity in extreme rainfall whereas no significant temporal trends were detected in the n of the datasets similar to the simulation study the ordinary event datasets and amss of the selected real datasets were verified to be properly fitted by the weibull distribution on the annual basis using the conventional ks test and the gev based model using the ks and mad tests respectively the time was adopted as the covariate for comparing the mev based model and benchmark models in real applications i e vt t in addition the two formulations of the mev based model which consider vt and vt respectively were compared using nonstationary stochastic physical covariates among the three datasets d3 was selected as an illustrative study case at the site of d3 year round daily air temperature records are available during 1962 2018 figs 2 d and e the candidate covariates considered herein included the maximum and minimum daily air temperatures tmax and tmin on the days when ams were recorded and the annual average maximum and minimum daily air temperatures ann ave tmax and tmin the ann ave tmin was found to be correlated with the rainfall amss as indicated by the significant spearman s rho correlation coefficient of ρ 0 38 in addition the ann ave tmin exhibited significant nonstationary signatures fig 2 d therefore the ann ave tmin was selected as the covariate in the mev based model note that the detailed attribution of the nonstationarity to physical covariate s is beyond the scope of this paper furthermore the suitability of the n as the distribution of vt in the alternative formulation of the mev based model was verified using the lilliefors test after removing the detected trend the comparison of mev based and benchmark models using the temporal covariate was conducted in two settings in one setting the observational datasets were split into two continuous periods for assessing the fitting performance using the first half of the observations and the out of sample prediction performance using the remaining half of the observations in the other setting only the fitting performance was assessed using the full sample to improve the model parameterization whereas the comparison between the two formulations of the mev based model using the physical covariate was conducted using the full sample the model performance was assessed using the empirical naic and raw in all the cases of this section because unlike the simulation study the true quantiles are unknown in practice 5 results and discussion 5 1 simulation study fig 3 illustratively compares the proposed mev 1 0 0 with the mevbb and smev 1 0 0 models for s1 as an example these models handle the model parameters distinctly namely as random realizations from a stochastic process in mevbb as deterministic variables in smev 1 0 0 and as stochastic variables captured by latent distributions in mev 1 0 0 as displayed in fig 3 a all models can directly or indirectly account for the nonstationarity in λ while figs 3 b and c reflect the time invariant behavior of β and n as shown in the estimated extreme event distributions in figs 3 d the mevbb model which lacks a nonstationary structure produces chaotic variations in the annual distributions of extremes and thus is unfeasible for out of sample prediction whereas the mev 1 0 0 and smev 1 0 0 models yield annual distributions of extremes following deterministic patterns can perform out of sample prediction and their prediction reliability would depend on whether the nonstationarity in the future can be acceptably modeled by their nonstationary structures identified in the fitting period yet differing from the smev based model the mev based one considers the natural stochastic interannual variability of the model parameters 5 1 1 model performance for in sample fitting fig 4 displays the empirical and true naics and rrmse of all the models as shown in fig 4 a among these models the mevbb model yielded the lowest empirical naics and thus fitted the sample amss most efficiently in all four nonstationary scenarios the mevbb model also produced slightly narrower interquartile and full ranges of empirical naic while all other models yielded equivalent empirical naics in the scenarios in general in contrast when assessing the models in terms of true naic fig 4 b the mevbb model was the least fitting efficient in all scenarios among all models in general as indicated by its higher true naics and its wider interquartile ranges nevertheless the gev based model consistently produced the highest maximum true naics in all four scenarios furthermore as shown in figs 4 c e displaying the rrmses of the estimated quantiles at the selected ts the mev and smev based models yielded lower rrmses and narrower interquartile and full ranges than the other two models the mevbb model produced the highest rrmses overall although the gev based model yielded the highest maximum rrmses in all cases these results revealed that the mev and the smev based models outperformed the mevbb and gev based models in terms of true naics but not in empirical naics this suggests that the mev and smev based models tended to capture the underlying nonstationary stochastic process better than the mevbb and gev based models although they were not superior to the mevbb model in fitting the sample amss according to the empirical naics the spuriously better performance of the mevbb model when fitting samples could be ascribed to its susceptibility to overfitting vidrio sahagún and he 2022a the overfitting of the mevbb model can be ascribed to the fact that this model neglects the presence of natural variability and unrealistically attributes all the interannual changes of the annual distributions to the nonstationarity hence the mevbb model which indirectly accounts for the nonstationarity may lead to questionable estimates therefore the mev and smev based models overall performed equivalently and both outperformed the mevbb and gev based models in terms of both fitting efficiency and accuracy across all scenarios in terms of uncertainty the mev and smev based models consistently yielded lower raws and rcwis than the mevbb and gev based models throughout all ts and nonstationary scenarios as shown in fig 5 interestingly the raws and rcwis of the mev based model appeared to be independent of the nonstationary structure as the values among all the model structures were approximately the same in particular mev 1 0 0 and mev 1 0 1 produced slightly higher raws and rcwis than the smev 1 0 0 and smev 1 0 1 but mev 1 1 0 and mev 1 1 1 which have more complex nonstationary structures yielded slightly lower raws and rcwis than smev 1 1 0 and smev 1 1 1 irrespective of the ts and the nonstationary scenarios in addition the interquartile ranges of raws and rcwis of the mev based model were roughly the same as those of the smev based model in general although the mev based model produced slightly higher maximum values in s1 and s2 these results revealed that the mev and smev based models performed roughly equivalent from the uncertainty perspective and both were notably superior to the mevbb and gev based models besides the mev and smev based models exhibited more robustness than their counterparts as demonstrated by their narrower ranges these results are not surprising the mevbb and gev based models are parameterized using the data of individual blocks separately and the ams respectively whereas the mev and smev based models estimate their parameters using more data i e both the ordinary events of all blocks and amss over the observation period and consequently yield more reliable estimates as shown in fig 5 there are no obvious differences in uncertainty among all mev based model structures while smev 1 0 0 and smev 1 0 1 always performed better than the other two smev based model structures moreover an interesting characteristic of the mev based model is that its uncertainty appeared to be relatively insensitive to the nonstationary structure compared to the benchmark models the mev based model incorporates latent distributions for describing the model parameters which in turn might depict the uncertainty in the parameter estimates to some degree this intermediate layer that partially accounts for uncertainty might stabilize the uncertainty of quantile estimates when using the expected values of the parameters all these results demonstrated that the mev based model improved over the mevbb model outperformed the gev based model and performed approximately equivalent to the smev based model regarding the fitting efficiency accuracy and uncertainty for fitting purposes 5 1 2 model performance for out of sample prediction fig 6 displays the true naics and rrmses of the models for out of sample prediction note that the mevbb model was not included due to its inability of making out of sample predictions based on the covariate similar to the fitting performance assessment the mev and smev based models generally yielded lower true naics narrower interquartile and full ranges and lower maximum values of true naics than those of the gev based model throughout all nonstationary scenarios fig 6 a both mev and smev based models performed roughly equivalent when adopting the true nonstationary structures throughout all scenarios furthermore compared to the in sample fitting assessment fig 4 the rrmses figs 6 b d of all models exhibited higher variability the mev 1 1 0 and mev 1 1 1 yielded slightly lower rrmses and narrower or approximately the same interquartile and full ranges of rrmses than the benchmark models in s2 and s4 whereas the smev 1 0 0 and smev 1 0 1 generally produced lower rrmses and narrower or roughly equivalent interquartile and full ranges of rrmses compared to the mev based model in s1 and s3 furthermore fig 7 shows the raws and rcwis of the models for out of sample prediction similarly mev 1 1 0 and mev 1 1 1 yielded lower and narrower interquartile ranges and full ranges of raws and rcwis than all other models in s2 and s4 whereas smev 1 0 0 and smev 1 0 1 yielded slightly lower and narrower interquartile and full ranges of raws and rcwis in s1 and s3 the variabilities in raws and rcwis among the mev based model structures were also lower compared to those among the smev based model structures throughout all scenarios these results supported that the mev based model was competitive or advantageous for out of sample prediction compared to all the examined benchmark models on one hand the mev based model which explicitly depicts the nonstationarity and considers the stochasticity in the model parameters might be beneficial for future prediction in terms of fitting efficiency and accuracy depending on the underlying nonstationary scenario and nonstationary structure adopted the results in general suggest that the selection of the nonstationary structure may be particularly more important when performing out of sample predictions compared to in sample fitting this is rational as the model structures that were inappropriately fitted in the fitting period would deviate more notoriously as the process keeps evolving in the future the mev and smev based models employ considerably larger samples compared to the gev based model for the parametrization the model parametrization includes the estimation of the nonstationary structure parameters e g μ λ 0 and μ λ 1 in mev 1 0 0 as well as λ0 and λ1 in smev 1 0 0 the mev and smev based models thus might approximate the actual nonstationary patterns of the extreme events more accurately due to their potential to yield more accurate parameters based on large samples this feature would be a key for successfully implementing the ns hfa especially for investigations over the future horizon on the other hand these results also advocated for the mev based model from the uncertainty point of view similar to in sample fitting the predictive uncertainty estimates of the mev based model were less sensitive to the nonstationary structure selection whereas the uncertainty was more sensitive to the model complexity in the smev and gev based models namely the simpler model structures i e smev 1 0 0 smev 1 0 1 and gev 1 0 0 consistently produced lower uncertainties than their corresponding more complex counterparts i e smev 1 1 0 smev 1 1 1 and gev 1 1 0 additionally the mev based model was less uncertain and preferable when dealing with more complex nonstationary patterns e g s2 and s4 therefore these results also demonstrate the advantages and competence of the mev based approach for conducting out of sample prediction from all performance perspectives 5 2 illustrative application on observational datasets the observational datasets required threshold setting for left censoring after analysis of the data the thresholds for left censoring the ordinary event datasets for the mevbb mev and smev based models were set at the 30 th 50 th and 50 th quantiles for d1 d2 and d3 respectively these thresholds maximized the empirical naic in the fitting periods at the two splitting percentages and ensured the suitability of the weibull distribution vidrio sahagún and he 2022a all the models were confirmed to be statistically appropriate for d1 d2 and d3 by the ks and or mad tests 5 2 1 applications using the temporal covariate fig 8 displays the ratios of the empirical naic and raw to the minimum values of each metric renaic and rraw of all model structures for fitting 50 and 100 of the samples respectively the solid black boxes highlight the best nonstationary structure for each model and dataset the mevbb model consistently yielded the lowest renaics throughout all datasets at the two splitting percentages while all other models produced similar renaics in general fig 8 a the renaics of the best mev based model structures only differed from 1 to 4 with respect to the renaics of the best smev and gev based model structures in contrast the mev and smev based models yielded evidently lower rraws than the mevbb and gev based models in all cases figs 8 b d the best mev based model structures always outperformed the best gev based ones in raw in ranges from 72 to 827 while the best smev based model structures outperformed the best mev based ones in the range from 4 to 15 the ranges of rraws among the mev and smev based models roughly overlapped yet those of the mev based model were generally narrower in particular the parsimonious smev 1 0 0 and smev 1 0 1 model structures always produced lower rraws than the smev 1 1 0 and smev 1 1 1 model structures whereas the mev 1 1 1 and mev 1 1 0 model structures produced lower rraws than the mev 1 0 1 and mev 1 0 0 model structures in all cases as discussed previously in the simulation study the mevbb model has a tendency of overfitting these results reaffirmed that the mev based model might avoid the overfitting issue and substantially decrease the uncertainty compared to the mevbb model in terms of fitting efficiency the mev smev and gev based models performed equivalently as the differences in the renaics among these models were essentially negligible whereas from the uncertainty perspective the mev based model clearly outperformed the gev based model and performed equivalently as the smev based model furthermore similar to the simulation study the uncertainty of the mev based model was more insensitive to the nonstationary structure selection than the smev based model therefore the mev based model was preferable than the mevbb and gev based models as it can reduce the uncertainty without degrading the fitting efficiency for in sample fitting while it was competitive to the smev based model but less subject to the impacts of the nonstationary structure fig 9 displays the renaics and rraws of the model structures for out of sample prediction at the splitting percentage of 50 the performance discrepancy in the renaic between the best mev based model structure and the best benchmark model structures was very small ranging from 1 to 2 besides differing from in sample fitting the mev based model always produced the lowest rraws among all models suggesting that it was optimal in terms of uncertainty interestingly these results showed that the same optimal mev based model structure would be selected based on both the fitting efficiency and uncertainty whereas different optimal smev based model structures would be selected according to different selection criteria e g the fitting efficiency and uncertainty a more comprehensive assessment is desired to verify the generality of such a feature of the mev based model overall these results also suggested that the mev based model is a suitable choice for making out of sample predictions in the ns hfa 5 2 2 application using the nonstationary stochastic physical covariate fig 10 showcases the renaics and rraws of the mev based model under the two formulations when adopting the physical covariate ann ave tmin for in sample fitting using the full sample for d3 unlike the formulation for deterministic covariates the alternative formulation treats the covariate as a nonstationary stochastic variable rather than a deterministic variable and thus would more realistically depict the ann ave tmin as shown in fig 10 the two formulations of the mev based model produced similar renaics thus these two formulations of the mev based model were considered equivalent for in sample fitting fig 11 showcases the evolution of the quantile estimates along with their 95 confidence intervals at the three selected ts over the observation period by the optimal model structures for the two formulations selected according to the renaic i e mev 1 1 0 and m e v 1 1 0 a shown in fig 10 a the irregular fluctuation of the quantile estimates over time of mev 1 1 0 is ascribed to the random component of the ann ave tmin it is worth recalling that similar to the vast majority of the ns hfa literature mev 1 1 0 addressed the physical covariate deterministically i e considering its observed value every year accordingly mev 1 1 0 along with all other benchmark models would require deterministic prediction of the covariate every year which is very difficult if not impossible in real world scenarios in contrast m e v 1 1 0 a treats the physical covariate here ann ave tmin as a nonstationary stochastic variable that is modeled through its own time varying distribution as a result m e v 1 1 0 a could depict the evolution of the physical covariate using the conditional time dependent expected value and consequently yield a smooth evolution of the quantiles over time by extrapolating the covariate s distribution evolution to the future horizon this is always desired in practice when performing both the in sample fitting and the out of sample prediction 5 3 research limitations and future research in both the simulation study and the application to observed data the proposed mev based model was demonstrated to be advantageous over or equivalent to the benchmark models in terms of performance for in sample fitting and out of sample prediction besides the mev based model is capable of handling nonstationary stochastic covariates and consequently producing realistic future projections yet there are still several opportunities for improvement and further research for instance this paper illustrated the benefits of explicitly incorporating nonstationary stochastic physical covariates in the ns hfa to implement it in practice systematic methods for nonstationarity attribution and subsequently covariate selection as well as a more comprehensive probabilistic characterization and exploitation of the nonstationary stochastic covariates e g using different latent distributions and or other measures beyond the expected value are required in addition although the developed model considered the use of only one covariate it can be extended to account for more than one covariate by adding the corresponding additional regression coefficients e g agilan and umamahesh 2017 li and tan 2015 ouarda et al 2019 however adding more covariates would lead to increased model complexity and consequently higher estimation uncertainty ouarda et al 2019 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 the proposed mev based model which can reduce the uncertainty compared to other models would thus be an attractive alternative to incorporating more covariates yet this paper focused on the use of a single covariate future research to assess the model performance when adopting multiple covariates is desired moreover the investigation was limited to the ns hfa models with parsimonious linear nonstationary structures while further investigations on the use of more complex nonstationary structures e g nonlinear and the linkage between nonstationary signatures in ordinary and extreme events which remains relatively unexplored so far are needed furthermore the real world application of the developed mev based model on a large or global scale is recommended for future research in this paper the proposed model was assessed using simulated and real datasets in four nonstationary scenarios however a greater diversity of nonstationary scenarios may be encountered in practice thus large scale investigations using real world datasets could improve the assessment of the mev based model in particular to generalize the comparison with respect to existing models i e mevbb gev based and smev based models under different nonstationary scenarios it is also worth highlighting that the real application of the mev based model in this paper assumed that daily rainfall observations are independent as in several previous studies amponsah et al 2022 marani and ignaccolo 2015 marra et al 2023 schellander et al 2019 when this assumption is considered inappropriate event separation methods can be employed to generate the series of independent ordinary events in practice several hydrometeorological variables including streamflow sea level and sub daily rainfall are often considered dependent caruso and marani 2022 formetta et al 2022 miniussi et al 2020 mushtaq et al 2022 it might be desired to validate the independence assumption prior to implementing the mev based model to increase confidence in the results lastly the identification of an adequate nonstationary structure is key for successfully applying the ns hfa especially for out of sample prediction in the future horizon this is particularly relevant for hydrological risk assessment and mitigation and or water related infrastructure evaluation planning and design in this paper the models parametrized over the observation period were used to depict the extreme event distribution evolution under the assumption that the calibrated nonstationary structure remains valid in the future yet the integration of additional sources of information for model specification such as future projections of rainfall and physical covariate s is also recommended for future research 6 conclusions this paper aimed to advance the metastatistical framework in the ns hfa which harnesses the ordinary events to assess the recurrence of extremes and considers the stochastic variability in the model parameters a novel ns hfa model i e the mev based model was developed by introducing a nonstationary structure into the mev distribution to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first explicit nonstationary application of the metastatistical approach the mev based model was assessed and compared with the benchmark models for in sample fitting and out of sample prediction from the perspectives of fitting efficiency accuracy and uncertainty in both a simulation study and real applications the benchmark models included the mevbb smev and gev based ns hfa models the results demonstrated that the proposed mev based model is advantageous over the mevbb model in a avoiding overfitting b enhancing the performance in terms of fitting efficiency accuracy and uncertainty and c enabling out of sample predictions furthermore the performance assessments of the proposed and the benchmark models also revealed that the mev based model is overall superior to the gev based model from all assessment perspectives whereas the mev and smev based models roughly yielded equivalent performance and one might be slightly superior to the other depending on both the underlying nonstationary pattern and the nonstationary structure adopted in the models moreover the mev based model could be particularly attractive as unlike the smev based model it explicitly depicts the nonstationarity while keeping the stochastic characterization of its parameters the use of the nonstationary stochastic physical covariates in the mev based model facilitated the out of sample predictions which was illustrated in a real study case overall the proposed mev based model extended the metastatistical approach for the ns hfa improving or without sacrificing the performance

26,the nonstationary hydrological frequency analysis ns hfa aids in assessing the recurrence of hydrological extremes under nonstationarity but its reliability is often questioned due to relatively limited record lengths the metastatistical extreme value mev distribution which harnesses the ordinary event records along with the extremes has proven advantageous under stationarity and in instances with limited records yet nonstationary applications of the mev distribution are lacking and only modified versions such as the simplified mev smev and block based mev mevbb distributions have been proposed this paper develops the nonstationary version of the mev distribution for ns hfa called the mev based model which incorporates an explicit nonstationary structure and preserves the stochastic interannual variability of ordinary events the developed model is assessed using several benchmark models in both simulation studies and real applications for both in sample fitting and out of sample prediction from the perspectives of uncertainty accuracy and fitting efficiency the benchmark models for comparison included the mevbb as well as the smev and generalized extreme value distribution gev based models the results demonstrated that the proposed mev based model outperformed the mevbb regarding overfitting and captured the underlying process more efficiently accurately and with less uncertainty in addition the mev based model was superior to the gev based model due to its higher accuracy equivalent or better fitting efficiency and lower uncertainty furthermore although the mev based model performed overall equivalently to the smev based the mev based model was shown advantageous for adopting nonstationary stochastic physical covariates and facilitating out of sample predictions overall these results demonstrated that the proposed mev based model has distinct advantages for the ns hfa and consequently promotes its implementation keywords nonstationarity uncertainty ordinary events extreme events metastatistical extreme value distribution data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in the field of hydrological engineering and water resources the recurrence of extreme precipitation and flood events is commonly assessed through the hydrological frequency analysis hfa the hfa is often conducted based on extreme event records such as annual maximum series and the generalized extreme value gev distribution has become a popular choice during the last decades katz et al 2002 nerantzaki and papalexiou 2021 stedinger et al 1993 zhang et al 2020 extreme value theory states that the independent and identically distributed block maxima converge to one of three distribution families namely types i gumbel ii fréchet and iii reversed weibull distributions which can be combined into the gev distribution coles 2001 katz et al 2002 the gev distribution relies on the assumption that the number of events per block tends to infinity i e the asymptotic assumption however this assumption may be inappropriate in hydrometeorological variables such as rainfall and streamflow as the number of events per block is generally far from infinity in addition only the small portion of measurements corresponding to extremes are analyzed and ignores the rest of the available information on ordinary events the information content of ordinary events could be critical to improving the hfa since its estimates are sensitive to even subtle differences in the sample of extremes liu et al 2022 and the estimation of the distribution tail is often difficult due to the scarcity of data as a result the validity of the asymptotic assumption and the sample size limitations are two major hurdles to producing reliable estimations using the gev distribution in the hfa during the last few years the metastatistical framework has emerged as an alternative to the gev distribution marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 the metastatistical approach relies on the theoretical framework of superstatistics or compound statistics de michele and avanzi 2018 porporato et al 2006 serinaldi et al 2020 which refers to the stochastic characterization of the parameters of a given probability distribution through additional distributions the metastatistical approach bypasses the asymptotic assumption of the gev distribution and employs records of independent ordinary events to estimate the recurrence of extremes the rationale behind this approach is that the distribution of maxima arises from the distribution of ordinary events and thus the extreme event distribution can be inferred from independent realizations from the ordinary event distribution the metastatistical extreme value mev distribution which is a compound distribution treating the parameters of the ordinary event distribution and the number of ordinary events per block as stochastic variables is the cornerstone of the metastatistical approach the mev distribution has shown advantages in reducing the uncertainty in the hfa especially for return periods larger than the sample size de michele and avanzi 2018 marra et al 2018 miniussi et al 2020 miniussi and marani 2020 zorzetto et al 2016 the mev distribution is particularly attractive due to its ability to exploit information embedded in ordinary event datasets the conventional stationarity assumption of hfa is generally and often call into question because of the well known changes in the hydrometeorological system occurring both at local and global scales blöschl et al 2019 milly et al 2008 papalexiou and montanari 2019 nonstationary hfa ns hfa approaches where the distribution changes through time according to defined nonstationary structures have recently emerged to deal with these scenarios françois et al 2019 ragno et al 2019 salas et al 2018 schlef et al 2023 slater et al 2021 the nonstationary structure is a deterministic function that governs the evolution of the distribution parameters moments based on the selected covariate s commonly used nonstationary structures in the literature include linear functions of time or physical covariate s depicting the evolution of the distribution s location and or scale parameters however a known limitation of the mev distribution is its inability to explicitly deal with nonstationarity while accounting for the stochastic interannual variability of ordinary events the applicability of the metastatistical approach in the ns hfa remains limited due to the absence of explicit nonstationary formulations i e incorporating a nonstationary structure into the distribution this gap has been evaded by modified versions of the mev distribution so far for instance the simplified mev smev distribution is a variation of the mev distribution as it introduces a nonstationary structure at the expense of neglecting the stochastic interannual variability of ordinary events marra et al 2019 hence the smev distribution loses the distinctive feature of the mev distribution of capturing the stochastic interannual variabilities in fact the smev reduces to the distribution of block maxima derived from the theory of order statistics under independence considering the average number of observations per block serinaldi et al 2020 vidrio sahagún and he 2022a demonstrated and assessed the use of the smev distribution in the ns hfa other studies did not tackle the absence of a nonstationary structure in the mev distribution either but indirectly investigated the nonstationarity using a set of stationary samples of the mev distribution parameterized independently in each block often each year amponsah et al 2022 dallan et al 2022 hosseini et al 2020 marra et al 2022 miniussi and marani 2020 vidrio sahagún and he 2022a this approach using stationary block based mev distributions called mevbb throughout this paper assumes that the inter block e g interannual changes primarily emerge from the nonstationarity rather than random natural variability thus the mevbb is in fact equivalent to using a set of stationary smev distributions and does not employ a nonstationary structure for instance miniussi and marani 2020 examined long term trends in quantiles estimated by block based parameterizations of the mev distribution similarly dallan et al 2022 parameterized smev distributions and estimated their quantiles on an annual basis and then tested the presence of significant trends in the distribution parameters and quantiles estimates a few other studies amponsah et al 2022 hosseini et al 2020 marra et al 2022 also adopted the mevbb approach to investigate nonstationary signatures in extreme rainfall and the occurrence probability of hurricanes despite the accomplishments of these studies the mevbb approach is prone to overfitting and cannot produce out of sample predictions based upon a covariate due to the absence of the nonstationary structure vidrio sahagún and he 2022a thus the application of the mev distribution for ns hfa is still constrained and the development of its nonstationary formulation is needed the incorporation of a nonstationary structure into the mev distribution is key to its further development as it would enable the deterministic depiction of the distribution evolution and conduct the ns hfa using the metastatistical approach the existence of a deterministic component behind the observed changes is indispensable to justify the ns hfa koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 serinaldi et al 2018 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 yet this requirement does not imply the need for its perfect characterization but can be inferred through deductive reasoning serinaldi et al 2018 for instance complex human induced changes such as changes in hydrometeorological variables resulting from climate change can be represented by their long term deterministic signal of change despite its envelope of stochastic variability due to chaotic nonlinear internal dynamics and unpredictable natural forcings milly et al 2015 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 hence the mev distribution can advance the ns hfa by expressing its parameters as a function of covariates to deterministically depict their nonstationary changes while also capturing their random variability due to complex interactions within the hydrometeorological system in the ns hfa using physical covariates e g temperature precipitation and climate oscillation indices is overall desirable and has been pursued previously prosdocimi et al 2015 šraj and bezak 2020 yet it involves several challenges for instance the dependence of the nonstationary patterns on the physical drivers or causative processes is often relatively weak to moderate archfield et al 2016 burn and whitfield 2017 ray and goel 2019 which makes the identification of physical covariates a challenge the use of physical covariates also commonly involves a covariate dependent characterization without considering the temporal evolution of the extreme events el adlouni et al 2007 ouarda et al 2018 2019 thiombiano et al 2017 such a characterization often leads to undesirable irregular fluctuations of frequency estimates over time hesarkazzazi et al 2021 o brien and burn 2018 vu and mishra 2019 this accordingly hampers the practical applications of the nonstationary frequency estimates that typically require a temporal description in addition when performing out of sample predictions it is required to predict the physical covariates since these covariates are treated as deterministic variables in the vast majority of the ns hfa literature agilan and umamahesh 2017 ouarda et al 2019 ragno et al 2019 ray and goel 2019 deterministic predictions would be needed which might be very difficult if not impossible instead these physical covariates are often seen as stochastic variables which need to also be nonstationary to justify the use of the ns hfa hesarkazzazi et al 2021 in the face of these challenges time is often adopted as the covariate in the ns hfa as a proxy for time dependent physical drivers behind the nonstationarity obeysekera and salas 2014 prosdocimi and kjeldsen 2021 serago and vogel 2018 therefore methodologies that facilitate the use of nonstationary stochastic physical covariates in the ns hfa for out of sample predictions become necessary this paper aims to advance the use of mev distribution by incorporating an explicit nonstationary structure for conducting the ns hfa the developed nonstationary mev distribution denoted here as the mev based model is compared with benchmark models that have been previously used in ns hfa which include the mevbb smev and gev based models the assessment of the proposed mev based model is performed using a simulation study and a real case study for both in sample fitting and out of sample prediction considering accuracy fitting efficiency and uncertainty in addition an alternative formulation that uses nonstationary stochastic physical covariates was formulated and applied to a real example 2 methodology this section provides a short review of the mev distribution before introducing the proposed mev based model for the ns hfa the benchmark models which are compared with the proposed model are also briefly presented followed by the introduction of methods used for parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification for all models note that throughout this section the random variables and their realizations are denoted by uppercase and lowercase letters respectively while the vectors are denoted by boldface letters 2 1 the mev distribution the compound mev distribution of block maxima relies on the number of ordinary events per block n and the parameter vector θ of the distribution f of ordinary events x marani and ignaccolo 2015 both n and θ are considered stochastic variables that follow certain distributions and consequently the notation of ψ mev x n θ is adopted in the metastatistical formulation here θ is a latent variable i e an unobservable variable that can only be indirectly estimated through a model and related observations and its distribution is known as latent distribution the unconditional ψ mev distribution is obtained through the law of total probability namely by integrating over θ and thus the mev cumulative distribution is defined as zorzetto et al 2016 1 ψ m e v x θ n ω n ω θ f x θ n g θ n d θ where ω n and ω θ are the discrete and continuous parameters spaces of n and θ respectively g θ n is the joint probability distribution of n and θ and f is the cumulative distribution of x the weibull distribution has been commonly adopted for f when analyzing rainfall and its use has been justified physically and supported by empirical evidence especially for the tail region of the distribution de michele and avanzi 2018 marra et al 2023 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 wilson and toumi 2005 since analytical solutions of compound distributions like eq 1 are rarely available they are commonly estimated by numerical approximations de michele 2019 for practical applications the mev distribution is approximated by its expectation using the sample average computed over the observational period by zorzetto et al 2016 2 ψ m e v x θ n e f x θ n 1 m j 1 m f x θ j n j 1 m j 1 m 1 exp x λ j β j n j where m is the number of blocks θ is composed of λ and b which are the scale and shape parameters of the weibull distribution respectively and θ j λ j β j and nj are the estimated values of θ λ b and n in the jth block respectively without loss of generality the blocks are herein defined as years the probability density of the mev distribution is hence given by 3 ψ m e v x θ n d ψ m e v x θ n d x 1 m j 1 m d f x θ j n j d x 1 m j 1 m n j f x θ j f x θ j n j 1 1 m j 1 m n j β j λ j x λ j β j 1 exp x λ j β j 1 exp x λ j β j n j 1 since eq 1 is numerically approximated rather than analytically solved in the metastatistical approach the calculations of the inverse distribution and therefore quantiles also require numerical approximation the extreme event quantile estimate ψ m e v 1 x n θ i e the extreme event magnitude associated with the return period t 1 p where p is the exceedance probability is numerically estimated by finding the xt that satisfies ψ mev xt n θ 1 p zorzetto et al 2016 2 2 the proposed nonstationary mev based model a new formulation of the metastatistical approach that explicitly incorporates a nonstationary structure into the mev distribution is proposed in this formulation the distribution of the ordinary events exhibits interannual random behavior due to the natural variability of its parameter set and also changes over time according to a deterministic function similarly the number of events per year also changes over time deterministically in addition to its stochastic natural variability hence the underlying process is considered a double stochastic and nonstationary process under independence such a process is modeled by a nonstationary mev distribution whose unconditional cumulative distribution is defined as 4 ψ m e v x θ t n t ω n ω θ f x θ t n t g θ t n t d θ t where nt and θ t denote the nonstationary stochastic versions of n and θ respectively it is worth highlighting that unlike the smev distribution see section 2 3 the proposed formulation does not neglect the stochastic interannual variability of the ordinary event distributions and the number of events per year following the usual convention the nonstationary mev distribution is approximated by its expectation from the available sample considering that g is the sample distribution derived from observations marani and ignaccolo 2015 serinaldi et al 2020 zorzetto et al 2016 thus 5 ψ m e v x θ t n t e f x θ t n t e 1 exp x λ t b t n t where n t h δ t where δ t v t t δ θ t k ζ t where ζ t v t t ζ where h and k denote the corresponding probability distributions of nt and θ t respectively δ t and ζ t are the time dependent deterministic hyperparameters of h and k respectively v t is the vector of deterministic covariates and δ and ζ are the vectors of regression coefficients for δ t and ζ t respectively for instance a linear temporal trend in the parameter λ t of the ordinary event weibull distribution would be given by λ t k λ t ζ λ t where ζ λ t 1 t ζ λ 0 ζ λ 1 t ζ λ 0 ζ λ 1 t to examine the performance of the mev based model four different linear nonstationary structures were adopted following the principle of parsimony using simple rather than complex model structures chebana and ouarda 2021 koutsoyiannis 2016 serago and vogel 2018 thus λ t and or b t and or nt are expressed as linear functions of the selected covariate vt the mev based model structures are given by 6 m e v k l m m e v λ t b t n t λ t n μ λ t σ λ t where μ λ t μ λ 0 π k μ λ 1 v t σ λ t constant b t n μ b t σ b t where μ b t μ b 0 π l μ b 1 v t σ b t constant n t n μ n t σ n t where μ n t μ n 0 π m μ n 1 v t σ n t constant where k l and m are model specific subindices used to denote the nonstationary structure and are set to 1 or 0 to indicate whether λ b and n are expressed as a function of vt or time invariant respectively i is the indicator function which takes the value of 1 if its argument is 1 and 0 otherwise n denotes the normal distribution and μ and σ are its hyperparameters and μ 0 and μ 1 are the linear regression coefficients of the corresponding hyperparameters following this notation the four mev based model structures considered in this paper are mev 1 0 0 mev 1 1 0 mev 1 0 1 and mev 1 1 1 for instance in mev 1 0 0 λ varies with vt as μ λ t μ λ 0 μ λ 1 v t while both μ b t and μ n t are constant whereas in mev 1 1 1 λ b and n all vary with vt as μ λ t μ λ 0 μ λ 1 v t μ b t μ b 0 μ b 1 v t and μ n t μ n 0 μ n 1 v t the use of the normal distribution as latent distribution for the weibull distribution parameters θ and n has been previously suggested by de michele and avanzi 2018 based on a global scale investigation of daily precipitation as illustrated above and as outlined in the ns hfa literature both time t and physical covariates are considered deterministic i e denoted by vt whereas the proposed mev based model can be extended to use nonstationary stochastic physical covariates vt such as air temperature precipitation and climate indices which can be seen as the superposition of stationary stochastic and deterministic time dependent components koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 milly et al 2015 serinaldi et al 2018 vidrio sahagún and he 2022b the alternative formulation of the mev based model in which the covariates are considered nonstationary stochastic rather than deterministic variables is also presented herein since the model parameters are nonstationary and stochastic in the mev based model their conditional nonstationary expected value can be conveniently characterized as 7 e n t e v t t δ e θ t e v t t ζ where δ and ζ are the regression coefficients for e nt and e θ t respectively here both the stochasticity and temporal dependence of nt and or θ t emerge from vt for instance let s consider the case of vt being first order nonstationary i e nonstationary in the first statistical moment only and a linear relationship between λ t and vt in this case eq 7 becomes 8 e λ t 1 e v t ζ λ 0 ζ λ 1 ζ λ 0 ζ λ 1 e v t where e vt is time dependent nonstationary unlike eq 5 in eq 8 the covariate contains the stochastic component that would follow a certain distribution indeed eq 8 could lead to a similar characterization of λ t when vt t in mev 1 0 0 except that the temporal description is directly inferred from vt to illustrate the use of vt in this alternative formulation the mev based model structures eq 6 were adapted considering that the stochasticity of λ t b t and or nt arise from vt as illustrated in eq 8 and that v t n μ v t σ v t with constant σ v t while μ v t exhibits a linear law of time hence these model structures herein denoted as m e v 1 0 0 a m e v 1 1 0 a m e v 1 0 1 a and m e v 1 1 1 a are equivalent to those of the previous formulation in terms of nonstationary structures but differ in the way that the covariate is handled i e as a nonstationary stochastic variable instead of a deterministic variable 2 3 benchmark ns hfa models the block based mevs smev based and gev based models the benchmark models include the block based mev distributions mevbb as well as the smev and gev based ns hfa models the mev distribution has been argued to be capable of implicitly capturing the potential underlying nonstationarity through the interannual variability of multiple block based parameterizations the mevbb was adopted by amponsah et al 2022 dallan et al 2022 marra et al 2022 miniussi and marani 2020 and vidrio sahagún and he 2022a the comparison with mevbb was used particularly to demonstrate the improvement of the proposed mev based model over the existing implementation of the metastatistical approach here the set of annual samples of the mev distribution is denoted as mevbb and given by 9 m e v b b m e v λ j β j n j 1 j m in the smev distribution the interannual stochastic variability of both θ and n is neglected as these variables are considered deterministic marra et al 2019 consequently these parameters are denoted as θ and n herein besides under nonstationarity the smev distribution varies over time by using time dependent distribution parameters the cumulative distribution and probability density of the smev distribution are given respectively by 10 ψ s m e v x θ t n t f x θ t n t 1 exp x λ t β t n t 11 ψ s m e v x θ t n t d ψ s m e v x θ t n t d x d f x θ t n t d x n t f x θ t f x θ t n t 1 n t β t λ t x λ t β t 1 exp x λ t β t 1 exp x λ t β t n t 1 similar to the mev based model the smev based model adopted parsimonious linear nonstationary structures in which λ t β t and or nt are expressed as linear functions of the selected covariate the smev based ns hfa model structures are given by 12 s m e v k l m s m e v λ t β t n t λ t λ 0 i k λ 1 v t β t β 0 i l β 1 v t n t n 0 i m n 1 v t where k l and m indicate whether λ β and n are expressed as a function of vt respectively and λ0 and λ1 β0 and β1 as well as n 0 and n 1 are the regression coefficients of λ β and n respectively following this notation the four smev based model structures considered in this paper are smev 1 0 0 smev 1 1 0 smev 1 0 1 and smev 1 1 1 for instance in smev 1 0 0 λ varies with vt as λ t λ0 λ1 vt while both β and n are constant whereas in smev 1 1 1 λ β and n all vary with vt as λ t λ0 λ1 vt β t β0 β1 vt and nt n 0 n 1 vt the cumulative gev function of the random variable y which corresponds to the annual maxima of n ordinary events x of each year i e yj max x j 1 x j n is defined as 13 f y θ f y ξ α κ exp 1 κ y ξ α 1 κ κ 0 exp exp y ξ α κ 0 where the parameter vector θ is composed of the shape κ scale α and location ξ parameters under nonstationarity ξ and α were employed to depict the nonstationary and expressed as a linear function of vt whereas κ was assumed constant considering its difficult estimation due to limited sample sizes and consequently its unrealistic time variant characterization coles 2001 salas et al 2018 the gev based ns hfa model structures are given by 14 g e v k l 0 g e v ξ t α t κ ξ t ξ 0 i k ξ 1 v t α t α 0 i l α 1 v t κ c o n s t a n t where k and l indicate whether ξ and α are expressed as a function of vt respectively and ξ0 and ξ1 and α0 and α1 are the regression coefficients of ξ and α respectively following this notation the two gev based model structures considered in this paper are gev 1 0 0 and gev 1 1 0 for instance in gev 1 1 0 ξ and α both vary with vt as ξ t ξ0 ξ1 vt and α t α0 α1 vt 2 4 parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification the parameter estimation of the mevbb and smev and gev based models was conducted using the maximum likelihood ml method which has the advantage of easily incorporating the nonstationary structure into the probability distribution in the smev based model the n was estimated as the sample average of nj when m 0 in eq 12 while n 0 and n 1 for nt when m 1 in eq 12 was estimated using the non parametric theil sen trend estimator in contrast the proposed mev based model cannot be parameterized directly by applying the conventional ml method as the model parameters follow a distribution whose hyperparameters need to be estimated from the estimates of the latent variables thus the parameter estimation and subsequent frequency estimates of the mev based model were conducted with the following steps 1 fit the ordinary event distribution independently in each block j similar to the mevbb using the ml method to derive a time series of parameter estimates θ j this procedure is necessary to derive block based realizations from the latent nonstationary stochastic process θ t 2 then the hyperparameters of the latent distributions n here which can be either stationary or nonstationary depending on the mev based model structure employed are estimated using the conventional ml method and the series of θ j and nj in this way both the nonstationary and stochastic nature of the ordinary event distribution parameters and or the number of events per block are properly accounted for 3 lastly the stationary or nonstationary expected values of the latent distributions are used to derive the point estimates of θ t and n t which are in turn used to produce the nonstationary frequency estimates effective return periods or quantiles at any given point in time furthermore in practice the low magnitude observations may negatively impact the estimation of the right tail of the ordinary event distribution in the metastatistical approach marra et al 2019 miniussi and marra 2021 observed datasets are often left censored to mitigate this impact marra et al 2019 2020 vidrio sahagún and he 2022a the left censored version of the ml method cohn 2005 helsel 2011 vidrio sahagún and he 2022a was employed herein for estimating the distribution parameters when dealing with observational datasets note that the threshold for censoring the data is case specific and has been commonly determined through various analysis methods such as optimizing some relevant metric formetta et al 2022 marra et al 2019 2020 miniussi and marra 2021 vidrio sahagún and he 2022a the threshold was thus determined by maximizing the fitting efficiency while ensuring that the left censored data still follow the weibull distribution herein in this paper the uncertainty was quantified using the data driven bootstrap resampling method which has been widely adopted to quantify the uncertainty in the ns hfa gilleland and katz 2016 ouarda et al 2019 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 this method is advantageous as it is independent of the parameter estimation method straightforward regardless of the model complexity and it can yield relatively asymmetric confidence intervals the parametric bootstrap which generates samples from a parametric model fitted to the data has been proven superior to the non parametric bootstrap kyselý 2008 2010 panagoulia et al 2014 thus the uncertainty of the benchmark models was quantified using the conventional parametric bootstrap method note that in the smev based and mevbb models the ns are deterministic rather than stochastic and thus their sample average and observed values respectively were employed to quantify the uncertainty in the mev based model the bootstrap method was modified due to its compounding nature here the confidence intervals at an α significance level around the estimated quantiles were derived as follows 1 a parametric estimate ψ of the population ψ is derived from the available observed sample of m blocks using the parameter estimation procedure based on the ml method 2 nsamp synthetic samples consisting of n i j observations per block and m blocks are generated from the parametric estimate ψ these synthetic samples are generated by randomly sampling the ordinary event distribution f with randomly sampled θ t values from the latent distributions the values of n i j are also randomly sampled from the corresponding distribution 3 the mev based model is now fitted to each synthetic sample and the model parameters θ i n i i 1 2 n s a m p and the quantiles x i ψ 1 p θ i n i are estimated for each synthetic sample using the aforementioned ml procedure 4 lastly the confidence intervals are obtained using the quantiles from the set of nsamp estimated x i s the lower bound of the confidence interval at a 1 α 100 significance level is the α 2 percentile while the upper bound is the 1 α 2 percentile of the resampled x i s 2 5 model evaluation and comparison the performance of all models was assessed from the perspectives of fitting efficiency accuracy and uncertainty the normalized akaike information criterion naic which captures the trade off between the goodness of fit and complexity of the model and takes the sample size into account was used to assess the fitting efficiency the relative root mean square error rrmse was employed to assess the accuracy of the model estimates these two metrics are given by 15 n a i c 2 l θ 2 d m 16 r r m s e 1 m t 1 m r t t p t t r t t 2 where d is the number of model parameters l θ is the calculated log likelihood of the model and r t t and p t t are the true and the estimated quantiles associated with t at time t respectively note that the rrmse was only calculated when the true quantiles are known beforehand i e in the simulation study section 3 the uncertainty was quantified using the relative average bandwidth raw and the relative coverage width index rcwi of the confidence intervals the rcwi combines the raw and the percentage of coverage poc of the confidence intervals which conflict with each other these metrics are given by 17 r a w 1 m t 1 m p t t u p t t l p t t 18 p o c 1 m t 1 m c t t where c t t 1 t s t p t t l r t t p t t u 0 elsewhere 19 r c w i r a w exp 1 α c w i p o c 100 2 where p t t u and p t t l are the upper and lower uncertainty bounds at t and t respectively and α cwi is the significance level 0 05 similar to the rrmse the calculation of the poc and rcwi requires knowing the true quantiles a priori and thus the rcwi was only computed in the simulation study 3 simulation study a simulation study was conducted to compare the proposed mev based model and the benchmark models using synthetic ordinary event datasets the datasets were generated from nonstationary compound distributions with a priori known statistical characteristics fig 1 specifically the ordinary event datasets were generated by randomly sampling n times per block from the weibull distribution under four different nonstationary scenarios which were denoted as s1 s2 s3 and s4 and given by 20 s 1 x t weibull λ t b where λ t n μ λ t σ λ 0 where μ λ t μ λ 0 μ λ 1 t σ λ 0 constant b n μ b 0 σ b 0 where μ b 0 constant σ b 0 constant n n μ n 0 σ n 0 where μ n 0 constant σ n 0 constant 21 s 2 x t weibull λ t b t where λ t n μ λ t σ λ 0 where μ λ t μ λ 0 μ λ 1 2 t σ λ 0 constant b t n μ b t σ b 0 where μ b t μ b 0 μ b 1 2 t σ b 0 constant n n μ n 0 σ n 0 where μ n 0 constant σ n 0 constant 22 s 3 x t weibull λ t b where λ t n μ λ t σ λ 0 where μ λ t μ λ 0 μ λ 1 t σ λ 0 constant b n μ b 0 σ b 0 where μ b 0 constant σ b 0 constant n t n μ n t σ n 0 where μ n t μ n 0 μ n 1 t σ n 0 constant 23 s 4 x t weibull λ t b t where λ t n μ λ t σ λ 0 where μ λ t μ λ 0 μ λ 1 2 t σ λ 0 constant b t n μ b t

2018 marani and ignaccolo 2015 marra et al 2018 2019 2020 miniussi and marani 2020 zorzetto and marani 2020 note that these hyperparameters are also close to those of the real rainfall datasets employed in this paper a record length of m 50 years was employed for the simulation study to reflect typical sample size limitations all synthetic datasets were verified to align with the defined nonstationary scenarios to guarantee a fair comparison of the proposed model with the benchmark models significant trends were detected in the annual maximum series ams extracted from the synthetic datasets using the mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 and thus exhibited nonstationary signatures the ordinary event distribution parameters estimated on an annual basis i e λ j β j nj also presented significant temporal trends consistent with nonstationary scenarios s1 s2 s3 and s4 moreover the amss were also properly fitted by the gev based model according to both the two sample kolmogorov smirnov ks massey jr 1951 and the modified anderson darling mad tests with critical values determined by monte carlo simulation ahmad et al 1988 anderson and darling 1952 shin et al 2012 the standard transformation was applied to the nonstationary amss using the corresponding reference model coles 2001 ragno et al 2019 to allow such verification all the statistical tests were conducted at the 0 05 significance level in this simulation study 1 000 datasets were generated for each nonstationary scenario and thus a total of 4 000 datasets were employed the model comparison was conducted in terms of both in sample fitting and out of sample prediction i e in the future using the temporal covariate i e vt t to assess the model performance for in sample fitting the rrmse as well as the raw and rcwi were calculated at t 10 50 and 100 years to evaluate the accuracy and uncertainty respectively the empirical and true naics were calculated using the sample ams and 100 true quantiles derived from the true nonstationary distribution of extremes with equally spaced exceedance probability at each time slice respectively these metrics reflect the models fitting efficiency in capturing the sample ams and the underlying nonstationary stochastic process of extremes respectively the true quantiles for calculating the performance metrics in each nonstationary scenario were derived by monte carlo simulation by a generating 1 107 blocks with nt ordinary events each sampled from the weibull distribution with θ t at a given time tk being nt and θ t randomly sampled from their corresponding distribution eqs 20 23 b extracting the annual maximum from each block at tk which is equivalent to having 1 107 realizations from the nonstationary extreme event stochastic process at tk and c obtaining the t year extreme event quantiles from this large sample of block maxima using the unbiased weibull plotting position formula these steps were repeated for every tk of interest and nonstationary scenario when examining the model performance for out of sample prediction the true naic rrmse and rcwi were used the horizon length in the future equal to m i e 50 years was adopted in the assessment 4 application on real study cases the proposed mev based model was further compared with the benchmark models using observational datasets to assess their practical feasibility the datasets used are daily rainfall measured at the hydrometeorological stations of león dge conagua 11095 los castillos conagua 11040 and abasolo conagua 11001 in mexico these datasets have lengths of 72 72 and 70 years and are referred to as d1 d2 and d3 respectively d1 and d2 have missing data only in two years 1950 and 1958 and one year 1950 respectively as illustrated in figs 2 a c the amss of the datasets d1 d2 and d3 exhibit significant temporal trends in the mean detected by the mann kendall test which are indicative of the presence of nonstationarity in extreme rainfall whereas no significant temporal trends were detected in the n of the datasets similar to the simulation study the ordinary event datasets and amss of the selected real datasets were verified to be properly fitted by the weibull distribution on the annual basis using the conventional ks test and the gev based model using the ks and mad tests respectively the time was adopted as the covariate for comparing the mev based model and benchmark models in real applications i e vt t in addition the two formulations of the mev based model which consider vt and vt respectively were compared using nonstationary stochastic physical covariates among the three datasets d3 was selected as an illustrative study case at the site of d3 year round daily air temperature records are available during 1962 2018 figs 2 d and e the candidate covariates considered herein included the maximum and minimum daily air temperatures tmax and tmin on the days when ams were recorded and the annual average maximum and minimum daily air temperatures ann ave tmax and tmin the ann ave tmin was found to be correlated with the rainfall amss as indicated by the significant spearman s rho correlation coefficient of ρ 0 38 in addition the ann ave tmin exhibited significant nonstationary signatures fig 2 d therefore the ann ave tmin was selected as the covariate in the mev based model note that the detailed attribution of the nonstationarity to physical covariate s is beyond the scope of this paper furthermore the suitability of the n as the distribution of vt in the alternative formulation of the mev based model was verified using the lilliefors test after removing the detected trend the comparison of mev based and benchmark models using the temporal covariate was conducted in two settings in one setting the observational datasets were split into two continuous periods for assessing the fitting performance using the first half of the observations and the out of sample prediction performance using the remaining half of the observations in the other setting only the fitting performance was assessed using the full sample to improve the model parameterization whereas the comparison between the two formulations of the mev based model using the physical covariate was conducted using the full sample the model performance was assessed using the empirical naic and raw in all the cases of this section because unlike the simulation study the true quantiles are unknown in practice 5 results and discussion 5 1 simulation study fig 3 illustratively compares the proposed mev 1 0 0 with the mevbb and smev 1 0 0 models for s1 as an example these models handle the model parameters distinctly namely as random realizations from a stochastic process in mevbb as deterministic variables in smev 1 0 0 and as stochastic variables captured by latent distributions in mev 1 0 0 as displayed in fig 3 a all models can directly or indirectly account for the nonstationarity in λ while figs 3 b and c reflect the time invariant behavior of β and n as shown in the estimated extreme event distributions in figs 3 d the mevbb model which lacks a nonstationary structure produces chaotic variations in the annual distributions of extremes and thus is unfeasible for out of sample prediction whereas the mev 1 0 0 and smev 1 0 0 models yield annual distributions of extremes following deterministic patterns can perform out of sample prediction and their prediction reliability would depend on whether the nonstationarity in the future can be acceptably modeled by their nonstationary structures identified in the fitting period yet differing from the smev based model the mev based one considers the natural stochastic interannual variability of the model parameters 5 1 1 model performance for in sample fitting fig 4 displays the empirical and true naics and rrmse of all the models as shown in fig 4 a among these models the mevbb model yielded the lowest empirical naics and thus fitted the sample amss most efficiently in all four nonstationary scenarios the mevbb model also produced slightly narrower interquartile and full ranges of empirical naic while all other models yielded equivalent empirical naics in the scenarios in general in contrast when assessing the models in terms of true naic fig 4 b the mevbb model was the least fitting efficient in all scenarios among all models in general as indicated by its higher true naics and its wider interquartile ranges nevertheless the gev based model consistently produced the highest maximum true naics in all four scenarios furthermore as shown in figs 4 c e displaying the rrmses of the estimated quantiles at the selected ts the mev and smev based models yielded lower rrmses and narrower interquartile and full ranges than the other two models the mevbb model produced the highest rrmses overall although the gev based model yielded the highest maximum rrmses in all cases these results revealed that the mev and the smev based models outperformed the mevbb and gev based models in terms of true naics but not in empirical naics this suggests that the mev and smev based models tended to capture the underlying nonstationary stochastic process better than the mevbb and gev based models although they were not superior to the mevbb model in fitting the sample amss according to the empirical naics the spuriously better performance of the mevbb model when fitting samples could be ascribed to its susceptibility to overfitting vidrio sahagún and he 2022a the overfitting of the mevbb model can be ascribed to the fact that this model neglects the presence of natural variability and unrealistically attributes all the interannual changes of the annual distributions to the nonstationarity hence the mevbb model which indirectly accounts for the nonstationarity may lead to questionable estimates therefore the mev and smev based models overall performed equivalently and both outperformed the mevbb and gev based models in terms of both fitting efficiency and accuracy across all scenarios in terms of uncertainty the mev and smev based models consistently yielded lower raws and rcwis than the mevbb and gev based models throughout all ts and nonstationary scenarios as shown in fig 5 interestingly the raws and rcwis of the mev based model appeared to be independent of the nonstationary structure as the values among all the model structures were approximately the same in particular mev 1 0 0 and mev 1 0 1 produced slightly higher raws and rcwis than the smev 1 0 0 and smev 1 0 1 but mev 1 1 0 and mev 1 1 1 which have more complex nonstationary structures yielded slightly lower raws and rcwis than smev 1 1 0 and smev 1 1 1 irrespective of the ts and the nonstationary scenarios in addition the interquartile ranges of raws and rcwis of the mev based model were roughly the same as those of the smev based model in general although the mev based model produced slightly higher maximum values in s1 and s2 these results revealed that the mev and smev based models performed roughly equivalent from the uncertainty perspective and both were notably superior to the mevbb and gev based models besides the mev and smev based models exhibited more robustness than their counterparts as demonstrated by their narrower ranges these results are not surprising the mevbb and gev based models are parameterized using the data of individual blocks separately and the ams respectively whereas the mev and smev based models estimate their parameters using more data i e both the ordinary events of all blocks and amss over the observation period and consequently yield more reliable estimates as shown in fig 5 there are no obvious differences in uncertainty among all mev based model structures while smev 1 0 0 and smev 1 0 1 always performed better than the other two smev based model structures moreover an interesting characteristic of the mev based model is that its uncertainty appeared to be relatively insensitive to the nonstationary structure compared to the benchmark models the mev based model incorporates latent distributions for describing the model parameters which in turn might depict the uncertainty in the parameter estimates to some degree this intermediate layer that partially accounts for uncertainty might stabilize the uncertainty of quantile estimates when using the expected values of the parameters all these results demonstrated that the mev based model improved over the mevbb model outperformed the gev based model and performed approximately equivalent to the smev based model regarding the fitting efficiency accuracy and uncertainty for fitting purposes 5 1 2 model performance for out of sample prediction fig 6 displays the true naics and rrmses of the models for out of sample prediction note that the mevbb model was not included due to its inability of making out of sample predictions based on the covariate similar to the fitting performance assessment the mev and smev based models generally yielded lower true naics narrower interquartile and full ranges and lower maximum values of true naics than those of the gev based model throughout all nonstationary scenarios fig 6 a both mev and smev based models performed roughly equivalent when adopting the true nonstationary structures throughout all scenarios furthermore compared to the in sample fitting assessment fig 4 the rrmses figs 6 b d of all models exhibited higher variability the mev 1 1 0 and mev 1 1 1 yielded slightly lower rrmses and narrower or approximately the same interquartile and full ranges of rrmses than the benchmark models in s2 and s4 whereas the smev 1 0 0 and smev 1 0 1 generally produced lower rrmses and narrower or roughly equivalent interquartile and full ranges of rrmses compared to the mev based model in s1 and s3 furthermore fig 7 shows the raws and rcwis of the models for out of sample prediction similarly mev 1 1 0 and mev 1 1 1 yielded lower and narrower interquartile ranges and full ranges of raws and rcwis than all other models in s2 and s4 whereas smev 1 0 0 and smev 1 0 1 yielded slightly lower and narrower interquartile and full ranges of raws and rcwis in s1 and s3 the variabilities in raws and rcwis among the mev based model structures were also lower compared to those among the smev based model structures throughout all scenarios these results supported that the mev based model was competitive or advantageous for out of sample prediction compared to all the examined benchmark models on one hand the mev based model which explicitly depicts the nonstationarity and considers the stochasticity in the model parameters might be beneficial for future prediction in terms of fitting efficiency and accuracy depending on the underlying nonstationary scenario and nonstationary structure adopted the results in general suggest that the selection of the nonstationary structure may be particularly more important when performing out of sample predictions compared to in sample fitting this is rational as the model structures that were inappropriately fitted in the fitting period would deviate more notoriously as the process keeps evolving in the future the mev and smev based models employ considerably larger samples compared to the gev based model for the parametrization the model parametrization includes the estimation of the nonstationary structure parameters e g μ λ 0 and μ λ 1 in mev 1 0 0 as well as λ0 and λ1 in smev 1 0 0 the mev and smev based models thus might approximate the actual nonstationary patterns of the extreme events more accurately due to their potential to yield more accurate parameters based on large samples this feature would be a key for successfully implementing the ns hfa especially for investigations over the future horizon on the other hand these results also advocated for the mev based model from the uncertainty point of view similar to in sample fitting the predictive uncertainty estimates of the mev based model were less sensitive to the nonstationary structure selection whereas the uncertainty was more sensitive to the model complexity in the smev and gev based models namely the simpler model structures i e smev 1 0 0 smev 1 0 1 and gev 1 0 0 consistently produced lower uncertainties than their corresponding more complex counterparts i e smev 1 1 0 smev 1 1 1 and gev 1 1 0 additionally the mev based model was less uncertain and preferable when dealing with more complex nonstationary patterns e g s2 and s4 therefore these results also demonstrate the advantages and competence of the mev based approach for conducting out of sample prediction from all performance perspectives 5 2 illustrative application on observational datasets the observational datasets required threshold setting for left censoring after analysis of the data the thresholds for left censoring the ordinary event datasets for the mevbb mev and smev based models were set at the 30 th 50 th and 50 th quantiles for d1 d2 and d3 respectively these thresholds maximized the empirical naic in the fitting periods at the two splitting percentages and ensured the suitability of the weibull distribution vidrio sahagún and he 2022a all the models were confirmed to be statistically appropriate for d1 d2 and d3 by the ks and or mad tests 5 2 1 applications using the temporal covariate fig 8 displays the ratios of the empirical naic and raw to the minimum values of each metric renaic and rraw of all model structures for fitting 50 and 100 of the samples respectively the solid black boxes highlight the best nonstationary structure for each model and dataset the mevbb model consistently yielded the lowest renaics throughout all datasets at the two splitting percentages while all other models produced similar renaics in general fig 8 a the renaics of the best mev based model structures only differed from 1 to 4 with respect to the renaics of the best smev and gev based model structures in contrast the mev and smev based models yielded evidently lower rraws than the mevbb and gev based models in all cases figs 8 b d the best mev based model structures always outperformed the best gev based ones in raw in ranges from 72 to 827 while the best smev based model structures outperformed the best mev based ones in the range from 4 to 15 the ranges of rraws among the mev and smev based models roughly overlapped yet those of the mev based model were generally narrower in particular the parsimonious smev 1 0 0 and smev 1 0 1 model structures always produced lower rraws than the smev 1 1 0 and smev 1 1 1 model structures whereas the mev 1 1 1 and mev 1 1 0 model structures produced lower rraws than the mev 1 0 1 and mev 1 0 0 model structures in all cases as discussed previously in the simulation study the mevbb model has a tendency of overfitting these results reaffirmed that the mev based model might avoid the overfitting issue and substantially decrease the uncertainty compared to the mevbb model in terms of fitting efficiency the mev smev and gev based models performed equivalently as the differences in the renaics among these models were essentially negligible whereas from the uncertainty perspective the mev based model clearly outperformed the gev based model and performed equivalently as the smev based model furthermore similar to the simulation study the uncertainty of the mev based model was more insensitive to the nonstationary structure selection than the smev based model therefore the mev based model was preferable than the mevbb and gev based models as it can reduce the uncertainty without degrading the fitting efficiency for in sample fitting while it was competitive to the smev based model but less subject to the impacts of the nonstationary structure fig 9 displays the renaics and rraws of the model structures for out of sample prediction at the splitting percentage of 50 the performance discrepancy in the renaic between the best mev based model structure and the best benchmark model structures was very small ranging from 1 to 2 besides differing from in sample fitting the mev based model always produced the lowest rraws among all models suggesting that it was optimal in terms of uncertainty interestingly these results showed that the same optimal mev based model structure would be selected based on both the fitting efficiency and uncertainty whereas different optimal smev based model structures would be selected according to different selection criteria e g the fitting efficiency and uncertainty a more comprehensive assessment is desired to verify the generality of such a feature of the mev based model overall these results also suggested that the mev based model is a suitable choice for making out of sample predictions in the ns hfa 5 2 2 application using the nonstationary stochastic physical covariate fig 10 showcases the renaics and rraws of the mev based model under the two formulations when adopting the physical covariate ann ave tmin for in sample fitting using the full sample for d3 unlike the formulation for deterministic covariates the alternative formulation treats the covariate as a nonstationary stochastic variable rather than a deterministic variable and thus would more realistically depict the ann ave tmin as shown in fig 10 the two formulations of the mev based model produced similar renaics thus these two formulations of the mev based model were considered equivalent for in sample fitting fig 11 showcases the evolution of the quantile estimates along with their 95 confidence intervals at the three selected ts over the observation period by the optimal model structures for the two formulations selected according to the renaic i e mev 1 1 0 and m e v 1 1 0 a shown in fig 10 a the irregular fluctuation of the quantile estimates over time of mev 1 1 0 is ascribed to the random component of the ann ave tmin it is worth recalling that similar to the vast majority of the ns hfa literature mev 1 1 0 addressed the physical covariate deterministically i e considering its observed value every year accordingly mev 1 1 0 along with all other benchmark models would require deterministic prediction of the covariate every year which is very difficult if not impossible in real world scenarios in contrast m e v 1 1 0 a treats the physical covariate here ann ave tmin as a nonstationary stochastic variable that is modeled through its own time varying distribution as a result m e v 1 1 0 a could depict the evolution of the physical covariate using the conditional time dependent expected value and consequently yield a smooth evolution of the quantiles over time by extrapolating the covariate s distribution evolution to the future horizon this is always desired in practice when performing both the in sample fitting and the out of sample prediction 5 3 research limitations and future research in both the simulation study and the application to observed data the proposed mev based model was demonstrated to be advantageous over or equivalent to the benchmark models in terms of performance for in sample fitting and out of sample prediction besides the mev based model is capable of handling nonstationary stochastic covariates and consequently producing realistic future projections yet there are still several opportunities for improvement and further research for instance this paper illustrated the benefits of explicitly incorporating nonstationary stochastic physical covariates in the ns hfa to implement it in practice systematic methods for nonstationarity attribution and subsequently covariate selection as well as a more comprehensive probabilistic characterization and exploitation of the nonstationary stochastic covariates e g using different latent distributions and or other measures beyond the expected value are required in addition although the developed model considered the use of only one covariate it can be extended to account for more than one covariate by adding the corresponding additional regression coefficients e g agilan and umamahesh 2017 li and tan 2015 ouarda et al 2019 however adding more covariates would lead to increased model complexity and consequently higher estimation uncertainty ouarda et al 2019 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 the proposed mev based model which can reduce the uncertainty compared to other models would thus be an attractive alternative to incorporating more covariates yet this paper focused on the use of a single covariate future research to assess the model performance when adopting multiple covariates is desired moreover the investigation was limited to the ns hfa models with parsimonious linear nonstationary structures while further investigations on the use of more complex nonstationary structures e g nonlinear and the linkage between nonstationary signatures in ordinary and extreme events which remains relatively unexplored so far are needed furthermore the real world application of the developed mev based model on a large or global scale is recommended for future research in this paper the proposed model was assessed using simulated and real datasets in four nonstationary scenarios however a greater diversity of nonstationary scenarios may be encountered in practice thus large scale investigations using real world datasets could improve the assessment of the mev based model in particular to generalize the comparison with respect to existing models i e mevbb gev based and smev based models under different nonstationary scenarios it is also worth highlighting that the real application of the mev based model in this paper assumed that daily rainfall observations are independent as in several previous studies amponsah et al 2022 marani and ignaccolo 2015 marra et al 2023 schellander et al 2019 when this assumption is considered inappropriate event separation methods can be employed to generate the series of independent ordinary events in practice several hydrometeorological variables including streamflow sea level and sub daily rainfall are often considered dependent caruso and marani 2022 formetta et al 2022 miniussi et al 2020 mushtaq et al 2022 it might be desired to validate the independence assumption prior to implementing the mev based model to increase confidence in the results lastly the identification of an adequate nonstationary structure is key for successfully applying the ns hfa especially for out of sample prediction in the future horizon this is particularly relevant for hydrological risk assessment and mitigation and or water related infrastructure evaluation planning and design in this paper the models parametrized over the observation period were used to depict the extreme event distribution evolution under the assumption that the calibrated nonstationary structure remains valid in the future yet the integration of additional sources of information for model specification such as future projections of rainfall and physical covariate s is also recommended for future research 6 conclusions this paper aimed to advance the metastatistical framework in the ns hfa which harnesses the ordinary events to assess the recurrence of extremes and considers the stochastic variability in the model parameters a novel ns hfa model i e the mev based model was developed by introducing a nonstationary structure into the mev distribution to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first explicit nonstationary application of the metastatistical approach the mev based model was assessed and compared with the benchmark models for in sample fitting and out of sample prediction from the perspectives of fitting efficiency accuracy and uncertainty in both a simulation study and real applications the benchmark models included the mevbb smev and gev based ns hfa models the results demonstrated that the proposed mev based model is advantageous over the mevbb model in a avoiding overfitting b enhancing the performance in terms of fitting efficiency accuracy and uncertainty and c enabling out of sample predictions furthermore the performance assessments of the proposed and the benchmark models also revealed that the mev based model is overall superior to the gev based model from all assessment perspectives whereas the mev and smev based models roughly yielded equivalent performance and one might be slightly superior to the other depending on both the underlying nonstationary pattern and the nonstationary structure adopted in the models moreover the mev based model could be particularly attractive as unlike the smev based model it explicitly depicts the nonstationarity while keeping the stochastic characterization of its parameters the use of the nonstationary stochastic physical covariates in the mev based model facilitated the out of sample

dynamics and control chongqing university 174 shazhengjie street shapingba district chongqing 400044 china the relative permeability of two phase fluid flow through rough fractures was investigated by conducting the triaxial two phase fluid flow experiment on sandstone fractures the relative permeability in rough rock fractures is greater than that predicted by the corey model and the viscous coupling model due to interphase resistance therefore the flow resistance between two phase fluids is lower than that of the corey model and viscous coupling model the resistance between two phase fluids increases with the increase of fracture roughness and confining pressure causing the decrease of relative permeability of two phase fluid flow it is also found that the influence of fracture roughness on relative permeability of water phase is more obvious than that of gas phase while the influence of confining pressure on relative permeability of gas phase is more obvious than that of water phase the relative role of fracture roughness and confining pressure in two phase fluid flow decreases while the relative permeability approaching the equal permeability point based on the influence of fracture roughness and confining pressure a relative permeability model for rough rock fractures under the effect of confining pressure is established this model describes the two phase fluid flow behavior in rough rock fracture under different confining pressure well further analysis on relative permeability in terms of fractional flow of water was conducted it shows that the confining pressure and fracture surface roughness play a hindering role in the two phase fluid flow this hindering effect is mainly on nitrogen at the low fractional flow of water and mainly on water at the high fractional flow of water keywords two phase flow rock fracture fracture roughness confining pressure data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction two phase fluid flow through rock fractures widely occurs in petroleum engineering valdez et al 2020 natural gas exploitation yi et al 2019 carbon dioxide co2 storage liu and grana 2020 and hydraulic engineering starnoni and pokrajac 2020 a single rock fracture is the basic element of rock fracture network zhang et al 2022 a proper understanding of two phase fluid flow behavior in a single rock fracture is fundamentally important for that of natural fractured rocks xing et al 2021 however the mechanism of two phase fluid flow in rock fracture is still poorly understood and the influence of fracture roughness and confining pressure on the relative permeability of two phase fluids is still unclear relative permeability is defined as the ratio of the effective permeability of the fluid to the absolute permeability of porous medium under certain conditions guo et al 2022 the relative permeability of gas and liquid is the key parameter to characterize the complex two phase fluid flow in rock fractures sheng et al 2019 the relative permeability is conventionally considered to be solely dependent on the water saturation yi et al 2019 however the diversity of natural rock fracture structures leads to the formation of complex fluid interactions with different phase interference characteristics making the development of a unified relative permeability model difficult in depth study of the effect of fracture roughness and confining pressure on relative permeability is important for proper understanding of two phase fluid flow in rock fractures in relative permeability description the x model romm 1966 the viscous coupling model fourar and lenormand 1998 and the brook corey model murphy and thomson 1993 are commonly used in porous and fractured media table 1 among them the expression of the brook corey model varies with the change of pore size distribution index λ chen 2005 λ depends on the degree of the uniform pore size distribution in porous media with uniform pore size media λ is close to infinity li et al 2014 based on a geometric similarity assumption between the individual rock fractures and pores in porous media λ 2 has been directly employed to predict the relative permeability in rough walled fractures corey 1954 the relative permeability models above are established as a function of water saturation liu et al 2013 however the water saturation in the rock fracture is difficult to measure in practical engineering additionally most of the relative permeability models in rock fractures are based on those from porous media wang et al 2019 however the validity of existing relative permeability models in rough walled fractures has not been validated in theory rigorously further investigation on the assumptions made for these relative permeability models in two phase fluid flow through rock fractures is required sheng et al 2019 ye et al 2021 specifically the x model assumes that there is no interference between the two phase fluids abu hamdeh and salilih 2021 however this makes the x model incompetent to describe the nonlinear regime of two phase fluid flow the viscous coupling model does not incorporate the irreducible phase ramstad et al 2010 in the brooks corey model the relative permeability in rock fractures is influenced not only by the water saturation but also by the residual saturation however the model neglects the dimensionality loss in rock fracture brooks and corey 1966 rock fractures are typically rough and fracture surface roughness has a significant influence on fluid flow process yi et al 2021 the slight difference in fracture geometry can lead to some deviation in the prediction between experiment and theoretical model chiapponi et al 2019 lenci and chiapponi 2020 with the increase of the standard deviation of the fracture surface roughness the phase interference in two phase fluid flow through rock fracture is significant gong et al 2021 in addition flow channel tortuosity is an important parameter to describe the two phase fluid flow structure nicholl and glass 1993 with the increase of fracture roughness flow channels become more tortuous and more obvious phase interference occurs between the two phase fluids chen and horne 2006 even though existing studies of two phase fluid flow behavior in rough fractures has greatly advanced the discipline knowledge the relationship between fracture roughness and relative permeability is seldom reported fracture aperture is another factor affecting the flow structure and phase interference of the two phase fluid flow xue et al 2022 ye et al 2021 due to the coupled hydromechanical nature of fractured rocks the fracture aperture is influenced by the confining pressure luo et al 2022 the confining pressure compacts the rock fracture to close normally resulting in a decrease of fracture aperture zhang and nemcik 2013 fracture aperture is an important parameter affecting the relative permeability of two phase fluid flow and has been widely investigated baghbanan and jing 2008 alturki et al 2013 found that the relative permeability increased with the increase of fracture aperture however gong et al 2021 argued that the relative permeability increased with the decrease of fracture aperture such a contrasting view indicates that the role of confining pressure in relative permeability is still poorly understood to date experimental and numerical modeling methods have been widely used to investigate the two phase fluid flow behavior in rock fracture fazelnia et al 2021 ye et al 2015 in laboratory there are two experimental categories the visual experiments liu et al 2018 wang et al 2021 and the coupled two phase fluid flow in triaxial cell ranjith et al 2006 wanniarachchi et al 2019 in laboratory implementation and data analysis the advantages and disadvantages of the experiment of two phase fluid flow through rock fracture in triaxial cell are opposite to that of visual experiment technique ranjith 2010 visual experiments are usually based on 3d printing and visual experimental technique enabling the visualization and digitalization of the flow structure and water saturation in the fracture however the flow channel in the artificial fracture is usually fabricated to be open with no contact between two rock fracture walls chen and fourar 2004 alternatively the triaxial cell is preferred for two phase fluid flow experiments when investigating the evolution of relative permeability of two phase fluid flow in the rock fracture influenced by fracture roughness and confining pressure to investigate the relative permeability evolution in rough rock fractures under different confining pressure a series of nitrogen water flow experiments through rough sandstone fractures are carried out then the experimental data are compared with the conventional relative permeability models and the relative permeability pattern evolution under different confining pressure and fracture roughness are investigated then the relative roles of fracture roughness and confining pressure in the two phase fluid flow are investigated subsequently the relative permeability model of two phase fluid flow considering the effect of fracture roughness and confining pressure is constructed finally the relative permeability evolution law in terms of the change of fractional flow of water is analyzed 2 theoretical background darcy s law has been used to describe the laminar flow through rock fracture at low flow rate or low reynolds number xia et al 2017 1 q k 0 a μ p where q l3t 1 is the volumetric flow rate k 0 l2 is the intrinsic permeability a l2 is the cross section area perpendicular to the flow direction μ ml 1t 1 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and p ml 1t 2 is

3 1 sample preparation the fine grain sandstone was taken from a quarry in chongqing china the natural average density of sandstone is approximately 1 88 g cm3 and the average porosity is 7 83 the two smooth and parallel ends of the cylindrical sandstone specimens were polished by the lapping machine then the geometrical dimensions of rock fracture specimens were measured with the electronic digital vernier calipers finally a self designed splitting tool under compression was used to prepare rough fracture surfaces to obtain a variety of surface roughness splitting wedges with different fracture roughness profiles were fabricated luo et al 2022 the mean fracture surface remains along the longitudinal direction and perpendicular to the two parallel cylindrical ends therefore the normal stress of the rock fracture is nearly the lateral constraint of the triaxial cell 3 2 fracture roughness characterization the three dimensional fracture surface topography was digitized with a three dimensional optical topography scanner cronos dual open technologies inc italy with an accuracy of 0 1 mm in the horizontal direction and 0 02 mm in the elevation direction multiple scanning of the fracture surface from different angles was performed to eliminate blind data spots during the scanning process fig 1 shows the digitized fracture surface topography of rough rock fracture surfaces the fracture surface profiles along the fluid flow direction were evenly extracted with 5 mm spacing along the direction perpendicular to the flow direction the fracture surface morphology parameters were statistically analyzed to quantitatively characterize the fracture roughness the first derivative root means square z2 and joint roughness coefficient jrc of fracture profiles are calculated using eqs 10 and 11 tse and cruden 1979 10 z 2 1 l i 1 n 1 z i 1 z i 2 x i 1 x i 11 jrc 32 2 32 47 log z 2 where x i and x i 1 represent the coordinates of the profile line in the length direction z i and z i 1 are the coordinate of the profile line in the height direction and n is the data point number on the profile line table 2 lists the fracture roughness parameters in jrc determination a specimen interval of 0 5 mm was selected tatone and grasselli 2010 3 3 test setup and procedure a two phase high pressure triaxial apparatus was used for experimental tests wang et al 2022 fig 2 it mainly consists of a triaxial cell loading unit stress and strain detection unit two phase fluid supply unit and data acquisition and control unit the pressurized water and nitrogen entered the rock fracture from the bottom of the triaxial cell then went through the fracture specimen and finally flowed out of the triaxial cell through the top cap of the fractured rock specimen the sources of experimental errors mainly include both instrument errors and human errors the absolute uncertainty of the pressure head was 0 02 mpa after the two phase fluid flow stabilized the mass of water was recorded over a fixed time interval using a sensitive electrical balance scale with a precision of 0 01 g and the flow rate of nitrogen was recorded by using a soap film air flowmeter with a precision of 0 1 ml min the uncertainty of human error time is about 0 2 s in the experimental preparation the rock fracture specimen was enclosed with a sleeve shaped polyurethane membrane firstly and placed on the bottom seat of the triaxial cell subsequently two o ring rubber with 49 5 mm in diameter were used to fix the membrane and the hose clamp was further used to fix the o ring rubber for leakage prevention after assembling the triaxial cell the hydraulic oil was injected into the triaxial cell via the control system initially a low level of axial stress of 1 mpa was applied to hold the fractured sandstone specimen in the triaxial cell to reduce the damage caused by the change in confining pressure on the fracture surface during the experiment a special pressure loading path was used prior to the two phase fluid flow tests no fluid is injected and the confining pressure is applied to the maximum confining pressure required for the experiment and then reduced to the minimum for 5 cycles during fluid flow experiment the two phase fluid was controlled by pressure the inlet pressure and confining pressure were continuously recorded by the pressure transducer the head pressure difference is equal to the inlet pressure minus the outlet pressure note that the two phase fluid pressure should be lower than the confining pressure during the test to prevent the collapse of the fractured rock specimen in the triaxial cell 4 results and discussion the permeability of sandstone matrix is very low 10 16 10 17 m3 and much smaller than the permeability of the fracture therefore the permeability of the sandstone matrix was negligible during the data analysis the two phase fluid flow tests are performed at a room temperature of approximately 20 and the dissolution of nitrogen can be ignored baranenko et al 1990 table 3 lists the physical properties of nitrogen and water 4 1 the evolution of the relative permeability fig 3 shows the relationship between the single phase fluid pressure head and volumetric flow rate of different sandstone fracture specimens the flow rate increased generally with the pressure head also there is a transition from linear to nonlinear flow with the increase of hydraulic pressure head for clear illustration the linear and nonlinear regions are shown in gray and yellow respectively it is worth noting that the flow rate of water and nitrogen is in the linear region under all experimental conditions when the pressure head is below 0 7 mpa this indicates that it is reasonable to analyze the relative permeability by two phase darcy s law alternatively the reynolds number is also a measure to determining if the two phase darcy s law applies wanniarachchi et al 2019 the volumetric flow rate of nitrogen and water decreases with the increase of fracture roughness the maximum reynolds number for nitrogen and water occurred in rock fracture specimen no 1 at the confining pressure of 2 mpa which are 0 54 and 0 19 respectively therefore the two phase darcy s law is valid in experimental data analysis the evolution of the relative permeability of two phase fluids is calculated based on the two phase darcy s law when hydraulic pressure head less than 0 7 mpa fig 4 shows the relationship between the relative permeability of water and relative permeability of nitrogen comparing the experimental data with the conventional two phase fluid relative permeability model it is found that there is a significant difference between the two phase fluid flow in rock fractures and the relative permeability models the measured relative permeability is less than that of the x model this indicates that there is an interphase resistance between the water and nitrogen however the measured relative permeability is greater than the corey model and the viscous coupling model this indicates that the flow resistance between the two phase fluids in the rock fracture is significantly lower than the flow resistance described by the viscous coupling model and corey model in addition the experimental results are closer to the viscous coupling model with the increase of fracture roughness and confining pressure this finding indicates that the two phase fluid flow in rock fracture has a tendency approaching that in pipe when the fracture roughness or confining pressure is high enough to cause complete closure of the rock fracture fig 4 also shows the experimental flow data of chen and horne 2006 and wanniarachchi et al 2019 our experimental flow data are very close to the experimental data of two phase fluid flow in granite fracture of wanniarachchi et al 2019 but deviate greatly from the experimental data in artificial fractures of chen and horne 2006 that the possible reason is that the phase interference in rock fractures is greatly different from that in artificial fractures 4 2 effect of fracture roughness on two phase fluid flow fig 5 shows the curves of relative permeability versus normalized pressure head ratio of p w p n 2 in different rough rock fractures at confining pressure of 2 mpa the relative permeability of both nitrogen and water decreases with the increase of fracture roughness therefore the rock fracture roughness plays a significant role in blocking the two phase fluid flow through rock fractures however conventional definition method of relative permeability of two phase fluid is based on the saturation of water in the rock fracture sheng et al 2019 therefore an improved two phase fluid flow model of relative permeability is required by considering the rock fracture roughness during two phase fluid flow the flow resistance between the two phase fluids in rock fracture is maximum when the relative permeability of nitrogen and water equals that is equal permeability point fig 5 also shows the pressure head ratio and equal permeability point in different rock fractures when the pressure head of water is 0 5 mpa the relative permeability of the three sandstone fracture specimens at the equal permeability point are 0 42 0 40 and 0 39 the pressure head ratio required to reach the equal permeability point in the rock fracture increases with the increase of fracture roughness and the equal permeability point of relative permeability is lower the reason is that water phase is distributed closer to the fracture surfaces during the two phase fluid flow fig 5 also shows that a greater resistance to flow is formed between the two phase fluids with the increase of fracture roughness the equal permeability point shifts rightward with the increase of fracture roughness when the influence of fracture roughness on water is stronger than that on nitrogen 4 3 effect of confining pressure on two phase fluid flow fig 6 shows the relative permeability for two phase fluid flow in rock fracture no 1 under different confining pressure each phase nitrogen and water relative permeability decreases with the increase of confining pressure this indicates that the resistance of two phase fluid flow increases with the increase of confining pressure therefore the influence of the confining pressure on the two phase fluid flow in the two phase fluid flow model should be considered the relative permeability of two phase fluid flow decreases with the increase of confining pressure when the relative permeability of the two phase is equal the relative permeability of fracture specimens at this point are 0 42 0 40 and 0 37 when the pressure head of water is 0 5 mpa different from the influence of fracture roughness on relative permeability fig 5 the pressure head of water required to intersect the relative permeability curve decreases with the increase of confining pressure this is owing to the influence of confining pressure on nitrogen is stronger than that on water eventually the equal permeability point shift leftward in fig 6 4 4 the relative roles of fracture roughness and confining pressure in two phase fluid flow the influence of fracture roughness and confining pressure on the two phase fluid flow has been summarized in the sections above however the role of fracture roughness in fluid flow changes with the increase of fracture aperture zhang and nemcik 2013 the interference of the fluid caused by fracture surface roughness decreases with the increase of fracture aperture the main factors affecting the resistance of two phase fluids generally include fracture roughness and fracture aperture chen 2005 ye et al 2015 fig 7 shows the sum of the relative permeability of two phase fluid flow under different confining pressure at the water pressure head of 0 5 mpa the sum of relative permeability is closer to 1 illustrating the lower flow resistance between two phase fluids also the sum of the relative permeability of two phase fluid flow decreases with the increase of confining pressure fig 7 also shows that the two phase fluid flow resistance increases with the increase of fracture roughness the effect of a single factor confining pressure or fracture roughness on the two phase fluid flow resistance are investigated in the sections above however the relative roles of fracture roughness and confining pressure in two phase fluid flow is still unclear in fig 7 a c d e the decrease percentage in the sum of the relative permeability increases with the increase of fracture roughness and confining pressure significantly it can be seen that the decrease percentage in the sum of relative permeability due to the increase of fracture roughness is much higher under high confining pressure than that under low confining pressure however the decreasing trend of the sum of the relative permeability when the pressure head ratio is 0 05 mpa is significantly different from the finding above fig 8 b in other words the two phase fluid flow resistance caused by fracture roughness is unaffected by the increase in confining pressure when the pressure head of nitrogen is 0 55 mpa this is probably due to the special stage of the two phase fluid flow in rock fracture when the pressure head of nitrogen is 0 55 mpa in this stage the two phase fluid flow resistance is much higher than those under other pressure head ratio conditions in fig 7 the relative permeability of the two phase fluids approximately equals when the pressure head of nitrogen is 0 55 mpa this means that there is no dominant fluid in the rock fracture however the relative permeability of the water phase increases rapidly and water dominates the two phase fluid flow when the pressure head of nitrogen is above 0 55 mpa on the contrary the relative permeability of the nitrogen phase increases rapidly and nitrogen dominates the two phase fluid flow when the pressure head of nitrogen is under 0 55 mpa therefore the two phase fluid flow tends some certain characteristics of single phase fluid flow the interference of the two phase fluids caused by fracture surface roughness decreases with the increase of fracture aperture to describe the relative roles of fracture roughness and confining pressure in two phase fluid flow the parameter σr c defined as the variance of the ratio of relative permeability decrease caused by the increase of confining pressure in different rock fractures is introduced fig 8 shows the variation trend of the parameter σr c with the change of pressure head ratio clearly the correlation between fracture roughness and confining pressure shows a first decrease and then increase trend with the increase of normalized pressure head ratio p w p n 2 the maximum of σr c is 12 32 when pressure head of nitrogen is 0 6 mpa however the minimum of σr c is 0 77 when pressure head of nitrogen is 0 55 mpa the maximum value of the parameter σr c is approximately 16 times the minimum value this further reflects that the correlation between fracture roughness and confining pressure is significantly weakened when the relative permeability of the two phase fluids approximately equals furthermore the parameter σr c is higher when the relative permeability of nitrogen is higher than that of water the possible reason is that the viscosity of nitrogen is much lower than that of water the relative permeability decreases more significantly with the increase of confining pressure and fracture roughness 4 5 quantitative analysis of relative permeability the traditional relative permeability model is incompetent in explaining relative permeability of two phase fluid flow decreases with the increase of confining pressure and fracture roughness quantitative analysis of the relative permeability under the effect of confining pressure and fracture roughness is crucial to upgrade the two phase fluid flow relative permeability model due to the accurate reflection of the change of two phase fluid flow channel under the effect of confining pressure and fracture roughness the equivalent hydraulic aperture e plays an essential role in the quantitative analysis of the relative permeability of two phase fluid flow table 4 lists the equivalent hydraulic aperture at different confining pressure based on the single phase fluid flow experimental data the equivalent hydraulic aperture decreases with the increase of confining pressure and fracture roughness due to the fact that the relative permeability of two phase fluids is not only influenced by the fracture roughness and confining pressure but also the pressure head ratio of the two phase fluids the relative permeability of two phase fluid can be expressed as a function of the pressure difference and the equivalent hydraulic aperture fig 9 shows the evolution of the relative permeability under the influence of equivalent hydraulic aperture the relative permeability increased linearly with the increase of equivalent hydraulic aperture from 47 02 μm to 60 67 μm the correlation coefficient r 2 as summarized in table 5 shows the linear relationship between the relative permeability and equivalent hydraulic aperture is competent it is worth mentioning that the correlation coefficient of nitrogen in case 2 and case 3 are relatively low this is because the relative permeability of the two phase fluid is close and the flow structure in the fracture is extraordinarily complex at this point it is difficult to estimate the relative permeability of nitrogen more accurately at this point by equivalent hydraulic aperture the relative permeability of the two phase fluid flow in rock fracture as a function of the equivalent hydraulic aperture can be expressed as 12 k r w a 1 e b 1 13 k r g a 2 e b 2 where a 1 a 2 b 1 and b 2 are the fitting coefficient fig 10 shows the evolution of the relative permeability under the influence of pressure head ratio with the increase in pressure head ratio from 0 77 to 1 25 relative permeability of water increases following a power function while relative permeability of nitrogen decreases in a power function trend table 6 lists correlation coefficient r 2 of best fitting which are all greater than 0 9 the power function describes the physical relationship between the relative permeability and pressure head ratio well the relative permeability of the two phase fluid flow in rock fracture as a function of the pressure head ratio can be expressed as 14 k r w a 3 p w p g b 3 c 3 15 k r g a 4 p w p g b 4 c 4 where a 3 a 4 b 3 and b 4 are the fitting coefficient eqs 12 15 indicate that the relative permeability of two phase fluid flow satisfies a power function in terms of the equivalent hydraulic aperture and pressure head ratio the relative permeability of nitrogen and water can be expressed by eqs 16 and 17 16 k r w a 1 e b 1 p w p g c 1 d 1 17 k r g a 2 e b 2 p w p g c 2 d 2 where a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 c 1 c 2 d 1 and d 2 are the best fitting coefficients based on all experimental results the best fit equations are 18 k r w 0 03 e 0 14 p w p g 0 82 0 48 19 k r g 1 93 e 2 04 p w p g 2 17 19 28 all correlation coefficients r 2 are all greater than 0 90 krg 0 94 krw 0 93 showing that eqs 18 and 19 can describe the experimental data well the water saturation and fracture roughness in rock fractures is difficult to measure while the measurement of equivalent hydraulic aperture and pressure head ratio is relatively simple and convenient therefore the proposed method above can be helpful in evaluating relative permeability of two phase fluid flow in geological environment 4 6 the relative permeability evolution in terms of fractional flow of water different from visual experiments in artificial fractures it is difficult to measure the water saturation of two phase fluid flow in the triaxial cell therefore it is necessary to introduce a parameter to estimate the water saturation in the fracture fractional flow of water is usually a nonlinear function of water and provides a more accurate estimate of the water saturation in rough rock fracture the fractional flow f w for the water phase is defined as 20 f w q w q w q n 2 where q w is the volumetric flow rate of water and q n 2 is the volumetric flow rate of nitrogen the determination of relative permeability in rock fracture in terms of fractional flow of water is important for understanding the evolution of two phase fluid flow through rock fracture fig 11 shows the relationship between the relative permeability and fractional flow of water the relative permeability of water increases with the increase of fractional flow of water while the relative permeability of nitrogen decreases the relative permeability of two phase fluid flow varies with the same fractional flow of water due to different confining pressure and fracture roughness this indicates that the water saturation in rock fracture is not the unique factor determining the two phase flow characteristics in rock fracture the confining pressure and fracture surface roughness play a hindering role in the two phase fluid flow this hindering effect is mainly on nitrogen at low fractional flow of water and mainly on water at high fractional flow of water it is because the two phase fluid flow behaves similarly to that of single phase fluid flow when there is a phase of fluid in rock fracture with a much higher relative permeability than the other phase 5 conclusion the evolution of the relative permeability of rough rock fractures under different confining pressure and fracture roughness was investigated by conducting nitrogen water two phase fluid flow through rough sandstone fractures the relative roles of fracture roughness and confining pressure in two phase fluid flow were discussed and a new quantitative characterization method of relative permeability is proposed it is found that the relative permeability curve of rough rock fracture under the action of confining pressure is closer to the viscous coupling model but slightly higher than it this suggest that resistance between two phase fluids is lower than that of viscous coupling model the results of this work also show that the relative permeability of two phase fluid flow decreases with the increase of fracture roughness and confining pressure by comparison the wetting phase is influenced more significantly by the fracture roughness than that of the non wetting phase while the wetting phase is influenced more significantly by the confining pressure than that of the non wetting phase this indicates that the fracture roughness and confining pressure provide extra flow resistance between two phase fluids moreover the fracture roughness mainly influences the wetting phase while the confining pressure mainly influences the non wetting phase the relative roles of fracture roughness and confining pressure in two phase fluid flow through rock fracture change with the pressure head ratio when the pressure head ratio is higher or lower the increase in the confining pressure enhances the interference effect of the fracture roughness on the two phase fluid flow when the two phase fluid pressure heads are close the relative roles of fracture roughness and confining pressure is reduced a model for the evolution of the relative permeability of two phase fluids considering the equivalent hydraulic aperture and pressure head ratio was developed the model reflects the evolution of relative permeability of two phase fluid under the effect of confining pressure and fracture roughness well the proposed model has a broad engineering application prospect for the easy going parameter measurement furthermore the confining pressure and fracture surface roughness play a hindering role in the two phase fluid flow this hindering effect is mainly on nitrogen at low fractional flow of water and mainly on water at high fractional flow of water thus the modeling of relative permeability of two phase fluids requires consideration of the effects of fracture roughness and confining

dynamics and control chongqing university 174 shazhengjie street shapingba district chongqing 400044 china the relative permeability of two phase fluid flow through rough fractures was investigated by conducting the triaxial two phase fluid flow experiment on sandstone fractures the relative permeability in rough rock fractures is greater than that predicted by the corey model and the viscous coupling model due to interphase resistance therefore the flow resistance between two phase fluids is lower than that of the corey model and viscous coupling model the resistance between two phase fluids increases with the increase of fracture roughness and confining pressure causing the decrease of relative permeability of two phase fluid flow it is also found that the influence of fracture roughness on relative permeability of water phase is more obvious than that of gas phase while the influence of confining pressure on relative permeability of gas phase is more obvious than that of water phase the relative role of fracture roughness and confining pressure in two phase fluid flow decreases while the relative permeability approaching the equal permeability point based on the influence of fracture roughness and confining pressure a relative permeability model for rough rock fractures under the effect of confining pressure is established this model describes the two phase fluid flow behavior in rough rock fracture under different confining pressure well further analysis on relative permeability in terms of fractional flow of water was conducted it shows that the confining pressure and fracture surface roughness play a hindering role in the two phase fluid flow this hindering effect is mainly on nitrogen at the low fractional flow of water and mainly on water at the high fractional flow of water keywords two phase flow rock fracture fracture roughness confining pressure data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction two phase fluid flow through rock fractures widely occurs in petroleum engineering valdez et al 2020 natural gas exploitation yi et al 2019 carbon dioxide co2 storage liu and grana 2020 and hydraulic engineering starnoni and pokrajac 2020 a single rock fracture is the basic element of rock fracture network zhang et al 2022 a proper understanding of two phase fluid flow behavior in a single rock fracture is fundamentally important for that of natural fractured rocks xing et al 2021 however the mechanism of two phase fluid flow in rock fracture is still poorly understood and the influence of fracture roughness and confining pressure on the relative permeability of two phase fluids is still unclear relative permeability is defined as the ratio of the effective permeability of the fluid to the absolute permeability of porous medium under certain conditions guo et al 2022 the relative permeability of gas and liquid is the key parameter to characterize the complex two phase fluid flow in rock fractures sheng et al 2019 the relative permeability is conventionally considered to be solely dependent on the water saturation yi et al 2019 however the diversity of natural rock fracture structures leads to the formation of complex fluid interactions with different phase interference characteristics making the development of a unified relative permeability model difficult in depth study of the effect of fracture roughness and confining pressure on relative permeability is important for proper understanding of two phase fluid flow in rock fractures in relative permeability description the x model romm 1966 the viscous coupling model fourar and lenormand 1998 and the brook corey model murphy and thomson 1993 are commonly used in porous and fractured media table 1 among them the expression of the brook corey model varies with the change of pore size distribution index λ chen 2005 λ depends on the degree of the uniform pore size distribution in porous media with uniform pore size media λ is close to infinity li et al 2014 based on a geometric similarity assumption between the individual rock fractures and pores in porous media λ 2 has been directly employed to predict the relative permeability in rough walled fractures corey 1954 the relative permeability models above are established as a function of water saturation liu et al 2013 however the water saturation in the rock fracture is difficult to measure in practical engineering additionally most of the relative permeability models in rock fractures are based on those from porous media wang et al 2019 however the validity of existing relative permeability models in rough walled fractures has not been validated in theory rigorously further investigation on the assumptions made for these relative permeability models in two phase fluid flow through rock fractures is required sheng et al 2019 ye et al 2021 specifically the x model assumes that there is no interference between the two phase fluids abu hamdeh and salilih 2021 however this makes the x model incompetent to describe the nonlinear regime of two phase fluid flow the viscous coupling model does not incorporate the irreducible phase ramstad et al 2010 in the brooks corey model the relative permeability in rock fractures is influenced not only by the water saturation but also by the residual saturation however the model neglects the dimensionality loss in rock fracture brooks and corey 1966 rock fractures are typically rough and fracture surface roughness has a significant influence on fluid flow process yi et al 2021 the slight difference in fracture geometry can lead to some deviation in the prediction between experiment and theoretical model chiapponi et al 2019 lenci and chiapponi 2020 with the increase of the standard deviation of the fracture surface roughness the phase interference in two phase fluid flow through rock fracture is significant gong et al 2021 in addition flow channel tortuosity is an important parameter to describe the two phase fluid flow structure nicholl and glass 1993 with the increase of fracture roughness flow channels become more tortuous and more obvious phase interference occurs between the two phase fluids chen and horne 2006 even though existing studies of two phase fluid flow behavior in rough fractures has greatly advanced the discipline knowledge the relationship between fracture roughness and relative permeability is seldom reported fracture aperture is another factor affecting the flow structure and phase interference of the two phase fluid flow xue et al 2022 ye et al 2021 due to the coupled hydromechanical nature of fractured rocks the fracture aperture is influenced by the confining pressure luo et al 2022 the confining pressure compacts the rock fracture to close normally resulting in a decrease of fracture aperture zhang and nemcik 2013 fracture aperture is an important parameter affecting the relative permeability of two phase fluid flow and has been widely investigated baghbanan and jing 2008 alturki et al 2013 found that the relative permeability increased with the increase of fracture aperture however gong et al 2021 argued that the relative permeability increased with the decrease of fracture aperture such a contrasting view indicates that the role of confining pressure in relative permeability is still poorly understood to date experimental and numerical modeling methods have been widely used to investigate the two phase fluid flow behavior in rock fracture fazelnia et al 2021 ye et al 2015 in laboratory there are two experimental categories the visual experiments liu et al 2018 wang et al 2021 and the coupled two phase fluid flow in triaxial cell ranjith et al 2006 wanniarachchi et al 2019 in laboratory implementation and data analysis the advantages and disadvantages of the experiment of two phase fluid flow through rock fracture in triaxial cell are opposite to that of visual experiment technique ranjith 2010 visual experiments are usually based on 3d printing and visual experimental technique enabling the visualization and digitalization of the flow structure and water saturation in the fracture however the flow channel in the artificial fracture is usually fabricated to be open with no contact between two rock fracture walls chen and fourar 2004 alternatively the triaxial cell is preferred for two phase fluid flow experiments when investigating the evolution of relative permeability of two phase fluid flow in the rock fracture influenced by fracture roughness and confining pressure to investigate the relative permeability evolution in rough rock fractures under different confining pressure a series of nitrogen water flow experiments through rough sandstone fractures are carried out then the experimental data are compared with the conventional relative permeability models and the relative permeability pattern evolution under different confining pressure and fracture roughness are investigated then the relative roles of fracture roughness and confining pressure in the two phase fluid flow are investigated subsequently the relative permeability model of two phase fluid flow considering the effect of fracture roughness and confining pressure is constructed finally the relative permeability evolution law in terms of the change of fractional flow of water is analyzed 2 theoretical background darcy s law has been used to describe the laminar flow through rock fracture at low flow rate or low reynolds number xia et al 2017 1 q k 0 a μ p where q l3t

3 1 sample preparation the fine grain sandstone was taken from a quarry in chongqing china the natural average density of sandstone is approximately 1 88 g cm3 and the average porosity is 7 83 the two smooth and parallel ends of the cylindrical sandstone specimens were polished by the lapping machine then the geometrical dimensions of rock fracture specimens were measured with the electronic digital vernier calipers finally a self designed splitting tool under compression was used to prepare rough fracture surfaces to obtain a variety of surface roughness splitting wedges with different fracture roughness profiles were fabricated luo et al 2022 the mean fracture surface remains along the longitudinal direction and perpendicular to the two parallel cylindrical ends therefore the normal stress of the rock fracture is nearly the lateral constraint of the triaxial cell 3 2 fracture roughness characterization the three dimensional fracture surface topography was digitized with a three dimensional optical topography scanner cronos dual open technologies inc italy with an accuracy of 0 1 mm in the horizontal direction and 0 02 mm in the elevation direction multiple scanning of the fracture surface from different angles was performed to eliminate blind data spots during the scanning process fig 1 shows the digitized fracture surface topography of rough rock fracture surfaces the fracture surface profiles along the fluid flow direction were evenly extracted with 5 mm spacing along the direction perpendicular to the flow direction the fracture surface morphology parameters were statistically analyzed to quantitatively characterize the fracture roughness the first derivative root means square z2 and joint roughness coefficient jrc of fracture profiles are calculated using eqs 10 and 11 tse and cruden 1979 10 z 2 1 l i 1 n 1 z i 1 z i 2 x i 1 x i 11 jrc 32 2 32 47 log z 2 where x i and x i 1 represent the coordinates of the profile line in the length direction z i and z i 1 are the coordinate of the profile line in the height direction and n is the data point number on the profile line table 2 lists the fracture roughness parameters in jrc determination a specimen interval of 0 5 mm was selected tatone and grasselli 2010 3 3 test setup and procedure a two phase high pressure triaxial apparatus was used for experimental tests wang et al 2022 fig 2 it mainly consists of a triaxial cell loading unit stress and strain detection unit two phase fluid supply unit and data acquisition and control unit the pressurized water and nitrogen entered the rock fracture from the bottom of the triaxial cell then went through the fracture specimen and finally flowed out of the triaxial cell through the top cap of the fractured rock specimen the sources of experimental errors mainly include both instrument errors and human errors the absolute uncertainty of the pressure head was 0 02 mpa after the two phase fluid flow stabilized the mass of water was recorded over a fixed time interval using a sensitive electrical balance scale with a precision of 0 01 g and the flow rate of nitrogen was recorded by using a soap film air flowmeter with a precision of 0 1 ml min the uncertainty of human error time is about 0 2 s in the experimental preparation the rock fracture specimen was enclosed with a sleeve shaped polyurethane membrane firstly and placed on the bottom seat of the triaxial cell subsequently two o ring rubber with 49 5 mm in diameter were used to fix the membrane and the hose clamp was further used to fix the o ring rubber for leakage prevention after assembling the triaxial cell the hydraulic oil was injected into the triaxial cell via the control system initially a low level of axial stress of 1 mpa was applied to hold the fractured sandstone specimen in the triaxial cell to reduce the damage caused by the change in confining pressure on the fracture surface during the experiment a special pressure loading path was used prior to the two phase fluid flow tests no fluid is injected and the confining pressure is applied to the maximum confining pressure required for the experiment and then reduced to the minimum for 5 cycles during fluid flow experiment the two phase fluid was controlled by pressure the inlet pressure and confining pressure were continuously recorded by the pressure transducer the head pressure difference is equal to the inlet pressure minus the outlet pressure note that the two phase fluid pressure should be lower than the confining pressure during the test to prevent the collapse of the fractured rock specimen in the triaxial cell 4 results and discussion the permeability of sandstone matrix is very low 10 16 10 17 m3 and much smaller than the permeability of the fracture therefore the permeability of the sandstone matrix was negligible during the data analysis the two phase fluid flow tests are performed at a room temperature of approximately 20 and the dissolution of nitrogen can be ignored baranenko et al 1990 table 3 lists the physical properties of nitrogen and water 4 1 the evolution of the relative permeability fig 3 shows the relationship between the single phase fluid pressure head and volumetric flow rate of different sandstone fracture specimens the flow rate increased generally with the pressure head also there is a transition from linear to nonlinear flow with the increase of hydraulic pressure head for clear illustration the linear and nonlinear regions are shown in gray and yellow respectively it is worth noting that the flow rate of water and nitrogen is in the linear region under all experimental conditions when the pressure head is below 0 7 mpa this indicates that it is reasonable to analyze the relative permeability by two phase darcy s law alternatively the reynolds number is also a measure to determining if the two phase darcy s law applies wanniarachchi et al 2019 the volumetric flow rate of nitrogen and water decreases with the increase of fracture roughness the maximum reynolds number for nitrogen and water occurred in rock fracture specimen no 1 at the confining pressure of 2 mpa which are 0 54 and 0 19 respectively therefore the two phase darcy s law is valid in experimental data analysis the evolution of the relative permeability of two phase fluids is calculated based on the two phase darcy s law when hydraulic pressure head less than 0 7 mpa fig 4 shows the relationship between the relative permeability of water and relative permeability of nitrogen comparing the experimental data with the conventional two phase fluid relative permeability model it is found that there is a significant difference between the two phase fluid flow in rock fractures and the relative permeability models the measured relative permeability is less than that of the x model this indicates that there is an interphase resistance between the water and nitrogen however the measured relative permeability is greater than the corey model and the viscous coupling model this indicates that the flow resistance between the two phase fluids in the rock fracture is significantly lower than the flow resistance described by the viscous coupling model and corey model in addition the experimental results are closer to the viscous coupling model with the increase of fracture roughness and confining pressure this finding indicates that the two phase fluid flow in rock fracture has a tendency approaching that in pipe when the fracture roughness or confining pressure is high enough to cause complete closure of the rock fracture fig 4 also shows the experimental flow data of chen and horne 2006 and wanniarachchi et al 2019 our experimental flow data are very close to the experimental data of two phase fluid flow in granite fracture of wanniarachchi et al 2019 but deviate greatly from the experimental data in artificial fractures of chen and horne 2006 that the possible reason is that the phase interference in rock fractures is greatly different from that in artificial fractures 4 2 effect of fracture roughness on two phase fluid flow fig 5 shows the curves of relative permeability versus normalized pressure head ratio of p w p n 2 in different rough rock fractures at confining pressure of 2 mpa the relative permeability of both nitrogen and water decreases with the increase of fracture roughness therefore the rock fracture roughness plays a significant role in blocking the two phase fluid flow through rock fractures however conventional definition method of relative permeability of two phase fluid is based on the saturation of water in the rock fracture sheng et al 2019 therefore an improved two phase fluid flow model of relative permeability is required by considering the rock fracture roughness during two phase fluid flow the flow resistance between the two phase fluids in rock fracture is maximum when the relative permeability of nitrogen and water equals that is equal permeability point fig 5 also shows the pressure head ratio and equal permeability point in different rock fractures when the pressure head of water is 0 5 mpa the relative permeability of the three sandstone fracture specimens at the equal permeability point are 0 42 0 40 and 0 39 the pressure head ratio required to reach the equal permeability point in the rock fracture increases with the increase of fracture roughness and the equal permeability point of relative permeability is lower the reason is that water phase is distributed closer to the fracture surfaces during the two phase fluid flow fig 5 also shows that a greater resistance to flow is formed between the two phase fluids with the increase of fracture roughness the equal permeability point shifts rightward with the increase of fracture roughness when the influence of fracture roughness on water is stronger than that on nitrogen 4 3 effect of confining pressure on two phase fluid flow fig 6 shows the relative permeability for two phase fluid flow in rock fracture no 1 under different confining pressure each phase nitrogen and water relative permeability decreases with the increase of confining pressure this indicates that the resistance of two phase fluid flow increases with the increase of confining pressure therefore the influence of the confining pressure on the two phase fluid flow in the two phase fluid flow model should be considered the relative permeability of two phase fluid flow decreases with the increase of confining pressure when the relative permeability of the two phase is equal the relative permeability of fracture specimens at this point are 0 42 0 40 and 0 37 when the pressure head of water is 0 5 mpa different from the influence of fracture roughness on relative permeability fig 5 the pressure head of water required to intersect the relative permeability curve decreases with the increase of confining pressure this is owing to the influence of confining pressure on nitrogen is stronger than that on water eventually the equal permeability point shift leftward in fig 6 4 4 the relative roles of fracture roughness and confining pressure in two phase fluid flow the influence of fracture roughness and confining pressure on the two phase fluid flow has been summarized in the sections above however the role of fracture roughness in fluid flow changes with the increase of fracture aperture zhang and nemcik 2013 the interference of the fluid caused by fracture surface roughness decreases with the increase of fracture aperture the main factors affecting the resistance of two phase fluids generally include fracture roughness and fracture aperture chen 2005 ye et al 2015 fig 7 shows the sum of the relative permeability of two phase fluid flow under different confining pressure at the water pressure head of 0 5 mpa the sum of relative permeability is closer to 1 illustrating the lower flow resistance between two phase fluids also the sum of the relative permeability of two phase fluid flow decreases with the increase of confining pressure fig 7 also shows that the two phase fluid flow resistance increases with the increase of fracture roughness the effect of a single factor confining pressure or fracture roughness on the two phase fluid flow resistance are investigated in the sections above however the relative roles of fracture roughness and confining pressure in two phase fluid flow is still unclear in fig 7 a c d e the decrease percentage in the sum of the relative permeability increases with the increase of fracture roughness and confining pressure significantly it can be seen that the decrease percentage in the sum of relative permeability due to the increase of fracture roughness is much higher under high confining pressure than that under low confining pressure however the decreasing trend of the sum of the relative permeability when the pressure head ratio is 0 05 mpa is significantly different from the finding above fig 8 b in other words the two phase fluid flow resistance caused by fracture roughness is unaffected by the increase in confining pressure when the pressure head of nitrogen is 0 55 mpa this is probably due to the special stage of the two phase fluid flow in rock fracture when the pressure head of nitrogen is 0 55 mpa in this stage the two phase fluid flow resistance is much higher than those under other pressure head ratio conditions in fig 7 the relative permeability of the two phase fluids approximately equals when the pressure head of nitrogen is 0 55 mpa this means that there is no dominant fluid in the rock fracture however the relative permeability of the water phase increases rapidly and water dominates the two phase fluid flow when the pressure head of nitrogen is above 0 55 mpa on the contrary the relative permeability of the nitrogen phase increases rapidly and nitrogen dominates the two phase fluid flow when the pressure head of nitrogen is under 0 55 mpa therefore the two phase fluid flow tends some certain characteristics of single phase fluid flow the interference of the two phase fluids caused by fracture surface roughness decreases with the increase of fracture aperture to describe the relative roles of fracture roughness and confining pressure in two phase fluid flow the parameter σr c defined as the variance of the ratio of relative permeability decrease caused by the increase of confining pressure in different rock fractures is introduced fig 8 shows the variation trend of the parameter σr c with the change of pressure head ratio clearly the correlation between fracture roughness and confining pressure shows a first decrease and then increase trend with the increase of normalized pressure head ratio p w p n 2 the maximum of σr c is 12 32 when pressure head of nitrogen is 0 6 mpa however the minimum of σr c is 0 77 when pressure head of nitrogen is 0 55 mpa the maximum value of the parameter σr c is approximately 16 times the minimum value this further reflects that the correlation between fracture roughness and confining pressure is significantly weakened when the relative permeability of the two phase fluids approximately equals furthermore the parameter σr c is higher when the relative permeability of nitrogen is higher than that of water the possible reason is that the viscosity of nitrogen is much lower than that of water the relative permeability decreases more significantly with the increase of confining pressure and fracture roughness 4 5 quantitative analysis of relative permeability the traditional relative permeability model is incompetent in explaining relative permeability of two phase fluid flow decreases with the increase of confining pressure and fracture roughness quantitative analysis of the relative permeability under the effect of confining pressure and fracture roughness is crucial to upgrade the two phase fluid flow relative permeability model due to the accurate reflection of the change of two phase fluid flow channel under the effect of confining pressure and fracture roughness the equivalent hydraulic aperture e plays an essential role in the quantitative analysis of the relative permeability of two phase fluid flow table 4 lists the equivalent hydraulic aperture at different confining pressure based on the single phase fluid flow experimental data the equivalent hydraulic aperture decreases with the increase of confining pressure and fracture roughness due to the fact that the relative permeability of two phase fluids is not only influenced by the fracture roughness and confining pressure but also the pressure head ratio of the two phase fluids the relative permeability of two phase fluid can be expressed as a function of the pressure difference and the equivalent hydraulic aperture fig 9 shows the evolution of the relative permeability under the influence of equivalent hydraulic aperture the relative permeability increased linearly with the increase of equivalent hydraulic aperture from 47 02 μm to 60 67 μm the correlation coefficient r 2 as summarized in table 5 shows the linear relationship between the relative permeability and equivalent hydraulic aperture is competent it is worth mentioning that the correlation coefficient of nitrogen in case 2 and case 3 are relatively low this is because the relative permeability of the two phase fluid is close and the flow structure in the fracture is extraordinarily complex at this point it is difficult to estimate the relative permeability of nitrogen more accurately at this point by equivalent hydraulic aperture the relative permeability of the two phase fluid flow in rock fracture as a function of the equivalent hydraulic aperture can be expressed as 12 k r w a 1 e b 1 13 k r g a 2 e b 2 where a 1 a 2 b 1 and b 2 are the fitting coefficient fig 10 shows the evolution of the relative permeability under the influence of pressure head ratio with the increase in pressure head ratio from 0 77 to 1 25 relative permeability of water increases following a power function while relative permeability of nitrogen decreases in a power function trend table 6 lists correlation coefficient r 2 of best fitting which are all greater than 0 9 the power function describes the physical relationship between the relative permeability and pressure head ratio well the relative permeability of the two phase fluid flow in rock fracture as a function of the pressure head ratio can be expressed as 14 k r w a 3 p w p g b 3 c 3 15 k r g a 4 p w p g b 4 c 4 where a 3 a 4 b 3 and b 4 are the fitting coefficient eqs 12 15 indicate that the relative permeability of two phase fluid flow satisfies a power function in terms of the equivalent hydraulic aperture and pressure head ratio the relative permeability of nitrogen and water can be expressed by eqs 16 and 17 16 k r w a 1 e b 1 p w p g c 1 d 1 17 k r g a 2 e b 2 p w p g c 2 d 2 where a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 c 1 c 2 d 1 and d 2 are the best fitting coefficients based on all experimental results the best fit equations are 18 k r w 0 03 e 0 14 p w p g 0 82 0 48 19 k r g 1 93 e 2 04 p w p g 2 17 19 28 all correlation coefficients r 2 are all greater than 0 90 krg 0 94 krw 0 93 showing that eqs 18 and 19 can describe the experimental data well the water saturation and fracture roughness in rock fractures is difficult to measure while the measurement of equivalent hydraulic aperture and pressure head ratio is relatively simple and convenient therefore the proposed method above can be helpful in evaluating relative permeability of two phase fluid flow in geological environment 4 6 the relative permeability evolution in terms of fractional flow of water different from visual experiments in artificial fractures it is difficult to measure the water saturation of two phase fluid flow in the triaxial cell therefore it is necessary to introduce a parameter to estimate the water saturation in the fracture fractional flow of water is usually a nonlinear function of water and provides a more accurate estimate of the water saturation in rough rock fracture the fractional flow f w for the water phase is defined as 20 f w q w q w q n 2 where q w is the volumetric flow rate of water and q n 2 is the volumetric flow rate of nitrogen the determination of relative permeability in rock fracture in terms of fractional flow of water is important for understanding the evolution of two phase fluid flow through rock fracture fig 11 shows the relationship between the relative permeability and fractional flow of water the relative permeability of water increases with the increase of fractional flow of water while the relative permeability of nitrogen decreases the relative permeability of two phase fluid flow varies with the same fractional flow of water due to different confining pressure and fracture roughness this indicates that the water saturation in rock fracture is not the unique factor determining the two phase flow characteristics in rock fracture the confining pressure and fracture surface roughness play a hindering role in the two phase fluid flow this hindering effect is mainly on nitrogen at low fractional flow of water and mainly on water at high fractional flow of water it is because the two phase fluid flow behaves similarly to that of single phase fluid flow when there is a phase of fluid in rock fracture with a much higher relative permeability than the other phase 5 conclusion the evolution of the relative permeability of rough rock fractures under different confining pressure and fracture roughness was investigated by conducting nitrogen water two phase fluid flow through rough sandstone fractures the relative roles of fracture roughness and confining pressure in two phase fluid flow were discussed and a new quantitative characterization method of relative permeability is proposed it is found that the relative permeability curve of rough rock fracture under the action of confining pressure is closer to the viscous coupling model but slightly higher than it this suggest that resistance between two phase fluids is lower than that of viscous coupling model the results of this work also show that the relative permeability of two phase fluid flow decreases with the increase of fracture roughness and confining pressure by comparison the wetting phase is influenced more significantly by the fracture roughness than that of the non wetting phase while the wetting phase is influenced more significantly by the confining pressure than that of the non wetting phase this indicates that the fracture roughness and confining pressure provide extra flow resistance between two phase fluids moreover the fracture roughness mainly influences the wetting phase while the confining pressure mainly influences the non wetting phase the relative roles of fracture roughness and confining pressure in two phase fluid flow through rock fracture change with the pressure head ratio when the pressure head ratio is higher or lower the increase in the confining pressure enhances the interference effect of the fracture roughness on the two phase fluid flow when the two phase fluid pressure heads are close the relative roles of fracture roughness and confining pressure is reduced a model for the evolution of the relative permeability of two phase fluids considering the equivalent hydraulic aperture and pressure head ratio was developed the model reflects the evolution of relative permeability of two phase fluid under the effect of confining pressure and fracture roughness well the proposed model has a broad engineering application prospect for the easy going parameter measurement furthermore the confining pressure and fracture surface roughness play a hindering role in the two phase fluid flow this hindering effect is mainly on nitrogen at low fractional flow of water and mainly on water at high fractional flow of water thus the modeling of relative permeability of two phase fluids requires consideration of the effects of fracture roughness and confining

28,discharge unsteadiness plays a key role in the dynamics of alternate bars however how migrating alternate bars determine their shape under unsteady discharge conditions especially in the long term is still unclear in this study we numerically investigate long term behaviors of migrating alternate bars subject to repeated hydrographs for this the same discharge variation but different hydrograph cycles were tested the results show that even under unsteady flow conditions specific combinations of hydrograph cycles and discharge variations result in an equilibrium state of migrating alternate bars i e non time dependent wavelength and migration period this may be a unique feature of the alternate bar morphodynamics since dynamic equilibrium state arising from steady discharge counterparts is time dependent feature meanwhile it is observed that when the discharge changes abruptly the response of alternate bar morphodynamics changes along the time within a limited period the response of alternate bars is not strong enough to destroy the original wavelength suggesting that the hydrograph cycle that achieves this equilibrium state must be moderately long such that the timescale of the hydrograph is similar but slightly smaller than the bar growth keywords alternate bars unsteady discharge morphodynamic equilibrium data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction understanding river morphology and its dynamics is an important topic in many research fields and the alternate bar morphology is a specific field of interest owing to their spontaneous alternating transformation and migration alternate bars could be the main contributing factor for channel engineering or watershed topography problems such as river bank protection navigation agriculture or river construction amoako johnson and hutton 2014 crosato et al 2022 duró et al 2016 jaballah et al 2015 in the last few decades extensive studies have investigated the fundamental physical mechanisms of the alternate bars colombini et al 1987 fujita and muromoto 1985 lisle et al 1991 to understand river morphodynamics the concept of formative or dominant effective steady discharge which determines the overall characteristics of river morphology is adopted river bars and related morphodynamics e g meandering have been thoroughly investigated using steady discharge conditions based on formative or effective discharge concepts generally this simplification does not affect the fundamental physics of the formation and development of river bars and provides some important insights such as alternate bar wavelength and height growth rate and migration defina 2003 ikeda 1984 whiting and dietrich 1993 crosato et al performed experiments and numerical simulations of alternate bar morphodynamics under long term steady discharge conditions demonstrating cyclic behavior of the alternate bar morphodynamics and the possibility of non migrating alternate bars crosato et al 2012 however these studies consider long term dynamics of alternate bars to be in a relatively stable discharge condition the discharge unsteadiness is essential in river system and plays a critical role in the sand bar formation and dynamics that has not been achieved under steady discharge condition tubino performed a linear stability analysis of free river bars under unsteady discharge conditions to understand unsteady behaviors of alternate bar dynamics regarding weavelength and waveheight shown in the experimental flume tubino 1991 this first theoretical attempt indicated the importance of flow unsteadiness to bar dynamics and further motivated the understanding of alternate bar dynamics under unsteady discharge conditions hall 2004 izumi et al 2021 watanabe et al 2001 visconti et al conducted movable bed and bank experiments under unsteady discharge conditions showing that a specific combination of hydrograph features and migration characteristics of bars enhance or suppress the development of pseudo meandering channels visconti et al 2010 iwasaki et al performed a numerical simulation of the bar and bank erosion in the vegetated floodplain during a large flood in a natural river otofuke river japan suggesting similar importance of the discharge unsteadiness to the amplification of meandering channels iwasaki et al 2016 the aforementioned studies emphasize the significance of discharge unsteadiness on the morphodynamics of river bars such studies focus on short term morphodynamics as only a single or a few repeated hydrographs are considered instead more longer term behaviors of alternate bar dynamics need to be investigated in detail in other words exactly how the river bars were formed and continue to develop in the long term under the complex sequence of hydrographs remains unclear this is mainly owing to a lack of field observations pertaining to long term interaction between hydrological events and spatiotemporal river bars as well as the difficulty in performing long term flume experiments even under simplified conditions notably in this regard carlin et al proposed a novel framework for obtaining the long term equilibrium characteristics of river bars i e wavelength and wave height using a linear and nonlinear stability analysis with the flow duration curve which is a simplified treatment of complex sequence of discharge variation in long term carlin et al 2021 their analyses agreed with field observations of the river bar geometry this is a robust framework to understand the equilibrium state of bars under discharge variation however bar dynamics must be discussed in detail as discharge variations are simplified into a flow duration curve church and rice investigated a century scale dynamics of point bars developed in a gravel bed reach of lower fraser river british columbia canada showing response of bar dimension namely thickness length and width to the age of bars church and rice 2009 nelson and morgan conducted flume experiments of gravel bedform development under repeated simple triangle hydrographs and a constant sediment feed rate nelson and morgan 2018 this is to our knowledge only the flume experiment to pursue long term equilibrium of bedforms under unsteady discharge conditions their results showed that flow unsteadiness has a negligible effect on channel scale morphologies however the bedform resembling the alternate bars in their experiment might be a combination of dunes and alternate bars i e three dimensional bedforms colombini and stocchino 2012 as the observed geometry does not satisfy the river bar categories derived from linear stability analysis that adopts the shallow flow approximation colombini et al 1987 furbish 1998 in this case the bedform can adjust its shape to the discharge variations although there is a hysteresis effect shimizu et al 2009 however the large scale bars have a longer morphodynamic timescale so the effect of the hydrograph might be more complex in summary the discharge variation or discharge unsteadiness has been considered only recently in morphodynamic modeling but it remains unclear how large scale bedform alternate bars reach a state of equilibrium especially in the long term this study focuses on the long term behaviors of alternate bars under the influence of repeated hydrographs the questions we pursue in this study are 1 do alternate bars attain the equilibrium state under unsteady flow discharge conditions 2 what are the equilibrium characteristics of alternate bars under this condition 3 what controls the long term behaviors of alternate bars to understand these points we perform several numerical simulations of alternate bar formations under repeated hydrographs and corresponding steady discharge conditions using a two dimensional morphodynamic model iric nays2dh the simulated alternate bar morphodynamics i e the wavelength bar height and migration period are investigated to understand the effect of hydrographs on long term alternate bar characteristics and the relation between hydrograph and morphodynamic timescales 2 method 2 1 numerical model we used the nays2dh model shimizu et al 2014 a two dimensional morphodynamic model embedded in the iric software nelson et al 2016 this model was applied to various sediment transport related simulation studies kang et al 2020 rahman and ali 2021 tamminga et al 2015 and is suitable for simulating alternate bar morphodynamics focused on in this study dai et al 2021 mackenzie and eaton 2017 in addition to such previous results in the appendix a we show that the model reasonably captures the formation and migration of alternate bars under repeated simple hydrographs observed in a laboratory experiment also the characteristics of alternate bars simulated in the present study are generally consistent with the observed one in the otofuke river which is a modeled river in this study see below and appendix a these model validations suggest that the nays2dh model may be an acceptable tool to pursue the long term morphodynamics of alternate bars under repeated hydrographs focused on in this study meanwhile the flow model used is an unsteady two dimensional shallow water flow model as we focus on the morphodynamics of alternate bars in gravel bed rivers we only consider bedload transport as a mode of sediment transport the meyer peter and müller formula was used here and the sediment was assumed to have a uniform grain size the details of the nays2dh model and its applicability for simulating alternate bar dynamics are introduced in the appendix a 2 2 computational conditions to understand the morphodynamics of alternate bars under repeated hydrographs we used the condition of the otofuke river as an example this river is a typical gravel bed river and the alternate bars are one of the dominant river morphologies iwasaki et al 2016 kyuka et al 2020 the modeled channel has a 21 km length and 70 m constant channel width with a uniform slope of 0 005 which is a simplified configuration of the upper otofuke river kyuka et al 2020 a manning roughness coefficient of 0 028 s m1 3 and a uniform particle size of 40 mm were used the mesh size used in this study is 70 m 10 m which means 7 grid sizes in width and 3000 sizes in length the time step used in this study is 0 2 s the initial bed is uniformly flat for transverse direction without any perturbation but random perturbation is added to the transverse profile of upstream discharge to obtain a trigger for alternate bar formation and development in entire calculation time we derived the hydrograph shape based on the large flood event observed in 2011 such that the migrating alternate bars could form and develop iwasaki et al 2016 nagata et al 2014 this is a relatively large flood event of which the flood recurrence year is around 20 years and caused significant bar migration and subsequent amplification of the channel the details can be found in previous works e g iwasaki et al 2016 nagata et al 2014 fig 1 a and b show the observed hydrograph and simplified repeated hydrographs used in the calculation the observed hydrograph was modeled as a simple triangle shaped hydrograph the water discharge linearly increased from 100 to 600 m3 s within 20 h and subsequently decreased from 600 to 100 m3 s linearly in 20 h forming a 40 h cycle the six hydrographs are shown here as an example in the calculation 50 hydrographs were obtained the aforementioned computational condition is the same as our previous studies that focus on the effect of sediment supply on the alternate bar formation dai et al 2021 in the previous study we have showed that imbalance of sediment supply from the upstream end under such hydrograph hardly affect the downstream alternate bars formation under this computational condition at least for timescale of single flood event in this study the sediment feed rate used was calculated from the upstream end flow parameters just as same as one of the sediment conditions in our previous study mackenzie and eaton 2017 this feed rate is the sediment transport capacity of this modeled river and the supply rate depends on the hydrograph as shown in fig 1 b as the feed rate is equivalent to the transport capacity the bed elevation at the upstream end does not change over time under this condition meanwhile to test the influence of different discharges on the alternate bars the following discharge processes are used with either fixed maximum discharge or fixed minimum discharge for each case different hydrograph cycles of 10 20 40 and 80 h are also tested for sensitivity analysis the lowest discharge of 400 m3 s resulted in a fully transported condition of alternate bars while the bars remained submerged and actively moved downstream the highest discharge of 1000 m3 s can be determined by the upper transition limit between alternate bar formation and a no bar condition based on the linear stability analysis kuroki and kishi 1984 for the fixed maximum discharge cases the purpose is to test the behavior of alternate bars when the discharge variation is around the critical value of 400 m3 s for these cases although the minimum discharges are below the fully transport condition of alternate bars they exceed the threshold discharge 90 m3 s that corresponds to the incipient conditionfor sediment under uniform flow condition for the fixed minimum discharge cases the purpose is intended to make the migration of alternate bars active throughout the computation to observe the morphodynamic response of alternate bars more clearly we performed a numerical simulation of alternate bars with an abrupt discharge change of 400 1000 m3 s as shown in fig 2 the purpose of this case is to study the response time of alternate bars when the discharge rate changes low or high steady discharge first develops migrating alternate bars in a dynamic equilibrium state and the abrupt change of discharge reshapes the bars to form another dynamic equilibrium state according to the high or low steady discharge in addition to the unsteady discharge case we also performed calculation of steady water discharges at 400 500 600 700 800 900 and 1000 m3 s these discharges were set to be in the range of unsteady cases 2 3 wavelet analysis of migration periods of alternate bars wavelet analysis was introduced by grossman and morlet for the treatment of geophysical seismic signals grossmann and morlet 1984 this analysis is considered as a milestone in fourier analysis development because it can achieve higher accuracy in unstable signal analysis by localizing the process currently wavelet analysis is an efficient mathematical solution in many fields and makes up for a few drawbacks of the fourier analysis however few applications have been made with respect to river morphology yovanni used wavelet analysis on the migrating ripple sand dunes observed in an experiment on a meandering channel in this study bed elevation and distance were considered as amplitude and process respectively and the processed data helped identify the location and geometric dimensions of erosional and depositional regions in meandering channels cataño lopera et al 2009 mahdade introduced new wavelet analysis tools in the field of geomorphic analysis to identify the pseudo periodicity of alternating morphological units from a general point of view for six small french rivers mahdade et al 2020 our study data deals with the elevation variation at one position with respect to time as the time for each alternate bar to pass through varies the fast fourier transform fft method cannot determine the temporal change of bar dynamics wavelet analysis is a better solution to process the elevation variation with respect to time fig 3 a shows one of example of our simulated result regarding the elevation variation that is the elevation change from the initial bed at one position on the right bank of the modelled river and the distance between two local lowest points represents a single alternate bar has passed this position on the bank this distance as a length of time represents the time to a certain extent and we name it as migration period in general the migration period of alternate bars is irregular as shown in fig 3 a the parts marked with different color lines clearly indicate different alternate bars have passed this position with different migration period since it is complicated to track the migration period of all the alternate bars the wavelet analysis employed here can easily calculate the migration periods of all the alternate bars and track its variation along time as it is shown in fig 3 b by the colored circle in this study the signal curve f η like elevation variation can be recovered as eq 1 1 f η c ψ 1 w ψ f a b ψ a b η d a d b where ψ is wavelet daughters cψ is its admissibility condition wψ is its continuous wavelet transform a is translation offset b is scale factor wavelet daughters is 2 ψ a b η 1 a ψ η b a morlet wavelet is used as the mother wavelet to create the wavelet daughters 3 ψ η π 0 25 e i β η e η 2 2 with a central frequency β of 2 was used as the parent wavelet 3 results 3 1 features of morphodynamic equilibrium state of alternate bars under repeated hydrographs fig 4 shows the elevation variation at the right bank of the computational river with respect to time in this figure the migration of alternate bars can be inferred from the pattern of elevation variation that is erosional and depositional patterns of this figure move from bottom left to top right this pattern shows that the morphology i e alternate bars keeps migrating downstream and the slope of this pattern shows the migration velocity of bars as this figure represents the bed elevation contour of the time space domain it can be shown that although the migration velocity varies owing to the unsteady water discharge the average migration velocity of the alternate bars which is akin to long term behavior appears constant additionally the spacing between each depositional or erosional point which corresponds to the wavelength of alternate bars is consistent with respect to space and time fig 5 shows the temporal change of alternate bars during the last hydrograph of this computation here five typical time points in one hydrograph cycle are selected to present the characteristics of the alternate bars during a hydrograph the points are 0 beginning of the hydrograph cycle 1 4t one quarter of the hydrograph cycle 1 2t 3 4t and t end of the hydrograph cycle where t denotes the hydrograph cycle as shown by the red arrow line the migration velocity changes with respect to discharge while the wavelength remains constant at 580 m with respect to time moreover when t 0 and t t the positions and shapes of alternate bars are identical thus the elevation of the river bed returns to its original value after one hydrograph cycle because alternate bars migrate exactly one wavelength downstream within one hydrograph to investigate the migration characteristics in greater detail as shown in fig 4 we selected a point at the distance axis and demonstrated the elevation variation with the time as shown in fig 6 a the space between two adjacent minimum values represents the time taken by an alternate bar needs to pass through this point to simplify this description we define this time as the migration period similarly if we select a point on the time axis we can obtain elevation variation at the right bank for this time point in fig 6 b the space between two adjacent minimum values represents the wavelength of an alternate bar fig 6 shows a simple introduction of the elevation variation with respect to time and space fig 6 a shows the migration period of alternate bars which is equal to the hydrograph cycle of 40 h fig 6 b reflects the wavelength of alternate bars which is a constant 580 m however elevation variation at a single position or a single point in time as shown in fig 6 is not sufficient in obtaining the overall characteristics of simulated alternate bar dynamics for this we performed fast fourier transform fft on the bed elevation data along the right bank to obtain the temporal change of the dominant wavelength in addition we applied wavelet analysis for the temporal change of the bed elevation at a certain fixed point to detect the migration period of the alternate bars fig 7 shows the result of fft and wavelet analysis the results show that during the entire calculation time the wavelength and migration period of alternate bars remain at 580 m and 40 h respectively suggesting consistent migration and shape characteristics of alternate bars in time and space in addition the migration period was equal to the hydrograph cycle this result shows that even under an unsteady water discharge condition the bar shape and migration pattern reach an equilibrium state in the context of long term morphological change 3 2 the conditions and criteria for the formation of morphodynamic equilibrium state we imposed a repeated identical simple triangle shape hydrograph for this alternate bar calculation such that properties of the hydrograph i e cycle and discharge range might control this morphodynamic equilibrium state alternate bars showed unconventional characteristics such as constant wavelength and migration periods after reaching morphodynamic equilibrium to confirm whether this phenomenon widely occurs in various unsteady flow conditions or is unique under this condition we compare simulation results of other unsteady flow conditions by changing the minimum and maximum discharges as well as the hydrograph cycle as shown in table 1 as an example of this sensitivity analysis figs 8 and 9 show the fft and wavelet analyses of the discharge varying between 400 and 1000 m3 s with different hydrograph cycles these figures show that hydrograph cycles of 10 and 20 h resulted in a constant wavelength and migration period with respect to time suggesting that in both cases alternate bars reached morphodynamic equilibrium the constant wavelengths for the 10 and 20 h cases were 480 m and 680 m respectively meanwhile the alternate bars with hydrograph cycles of between 40 and 80 h did not reach morphodynamics equilibrium implying that the dominant wavelength and migration period vary with time note that a sensitivity analysis regarding grid resolution to this morphodynamic equilibrium has been presented in appendix b we use a smaller mesh size to ensure that the current mesh size has no decisive impact on the calculation results i e morphodynamic equilibrium explained above the occurrence of this kind of morphodynamic equilibrium caused by different unsteady discharge condition is summarized in table 2 where the existence of the morphodynamics equilibrium is marked with a circle and the corresponding constant wavelength in each case wherein the equilibrium state is achieved the alternate bars have a unique constant wavelength and their migration periods are equal to the hydrograph cycle however almost all the unsteady flow cases with a hydrograph cycle of 20 h can reach morphodynamic equilibrium furthermore certain hydrograph cycles can also facilitate the alternate bars in reaching an equilibrium state the results of the sensitivity analysis led to the following observations first under fixed discharge variation e g 400 1000m3 s case morphodynamics equilibrium can be reached in differenthydrograph cycle i e 10 and 20 h for this case second hydrograph cycles determine the characteristics of alternate bars of this state meaning that longer hydrograph cycle provides longer alternate bars we compared the results of unsteady versus steady discharge conditions as the latter is generally used to understand the equilibrium state of alternate bars the results of wavelength and migration periods of steady flow cases derived from fft and wavelet analysis are shown in table 3 the steady discharge case of 700 m3 s was selected as a typical example to demonstrate fft and wavelet analyses as shown in fig 10 this figure suggests that the dominant wavelength and migration period vary slightly with time and thus exhibit a dynamic equilibrium behavior but they do not achieve a single equilibrium value all the runs demonstrated comparable results that is similar alternate bars developed and migrated downstream in the entire calculation reach but their morphodynamics showed slight time dependent features this result is consistent with previous numerical and experimental studies the migrating alternate bars can elongate in their development state even under steady water and sediment supply conditions fujita and muromoto 1985 nelson and smith 1989 and the alternate bars show cyclic development in the context of long term morphodynamic behavior crosato et al 2012 the present results for a unique morphodynamic equilibrium show that the specific combination of hydrographs and other physical conditions can cause a different equilibrium state in terms of temporal change of wavelength and migration periods as compared to cases of steady discharge conditions the morphodynamic equilibrium state explained above that is the unchanged wavelength and migration periods under repeated hydrographs appears as a unique feature of the migrating alternate bars under unsteady discharge conditions this is because the steady discharge counterpart cannot achieve such an equilibrium state to understand this equilibrium state in more detail we investigate 1 the role of the hydrograph cycle in determining alternate bar characteristics and 2 the possible range and criteria of the hydrograph cycle to produce morphodynamic equilibrium in certain discharge variations as the hydrograph cycles of 10 and 20 h provide the equilibrium state for a discharge variation of 400 1000 m3 s cycle around 10 and 20 h was selected that is 6 8 12 14 16 18 25 and 30 h hydrograph cycles were used fig 11 shows the results of fft analysis of these cases showing that the hydrograph cycle that is in the range between 10 and 20 h provides an equilibrium state under this equilibrium state the dominant wavelength caused by the 10 12 14 16 18 and 20 h hydrograph cycles are 457 500 539 584 637 and 678 m respectively and the migration periods of these cases are identical to their hydrograph cycles these results suggest that the hydrograph cycle is a dominant factor in determining the morphology of migrating alternate bars that is increasing the hydrograph cycle causes a longer wavelength and migration period conversely the other cases show time dependent morphodynamic features i e dominant wavelength and migration period are highly variable with time fig 12 shows the temporal change of dominant wavelengths of the steady flow cases of 400 and 1000 m3 s and unsteady flow cases of 400 1000 m3 s with hydrograph cycles of 10 12 14 16 and 18 h obtained from the fft analysis here we forcus on a period around 750 h after the alternate bars are fully developed in all cases and morphodynamics equilibrium is reached in the unsteady flow cases notably the dominant wavelength of the hydrograph cycle of 10 h which is the shortest cycle that could provide an equilibrium state is close to the dominant wavelength of the steady discharge condition of 1000 m3 s 450 500 m similarly by increasing the hydrograph cycle from 10 to 18 h and as long as the equilibrium state is satisfied the dominant wavelength approaches that of the steady state discharge condition of 400 m3 s i e 550 700 m these wavelengths of alternate bars caused by the highest and lowest discharge under steady flow conditions appear to be the lower and upper limits of the dominant wavelength of the alternate bars in equilibrium under unsteady conditions respectively furthermore the equilibrium state under the repeated hydrographs is bound by the alternate bar morphodynamics under the steady discharges of the lowest and highest discharge of hydrographs the same is true for the migration period that is the migration period of 1000 m3 s steady case might be an upper limit for unsteady cases with a period of 400 m3 s as the lower limit for example in the case of the 400 1000 m3 s hydrograph we define the migration period of steady flows of 400 m3 s and 1000 m3 s as p400 and p1000 respectively and the migration period of unsteady flow 400 1000 m3 s case as pu fig 13 shows the dominant migration periods of steady flow cases of 400 and 1000 m3 s as well as unsteady flow cases between 400 and 1000 m3 s with hydrograph cycles of 10 20 40 and 80 h the numerical results for the migration period caused by the different hydrograph cycles suggest that the migration period of unsteady flow pu is bounded by p1000 and p400 that is p1000 pu p400 the value range of p400 and p1000 are 25 40 and 7 9 h respectively and the ranges of unsteady flow cases are approximately 10 25 h which roughly satisfies the condition p1000 pu p400 however the temporal change of the dominant migration period is highly dependent on the hydrograph cycle namely the 10 and 20 h hydrograph results in a single equilibrium value conversely the migration periods of the hydrograph cycle for 40 and 80 h varies within the range between p400 and p1000 as pu in the case of a hydrograph cycle of 10 and 20 h appears close to p1000 and p400 this condition might be a boundary that causes the equilibrium state of the alternate bars under unsteady flow conditions because the migration period of alternate bars pu is identical to the hydrograph cycle t in this equilibrium state the condition p 1000 t p 400 might be necessary to achieve this equilibrium state of alternate bars under repeated hydrographs suppose that the discharge change is from a to b and the migration period of steady discharge a and b are defined as p a and p b the equilibrium condition above might be expressed as p b t p a this is a likely criterion of the hydrograph cycle that could lead to the morphodynamic state the physical meaning of this state should be further explored however since p a and p b are related to a representative morphodynamic timescale of sand bar migration this criterion may suggest a relationship between hydrodynamic i e hydrograph cycle and morphodynamic migrating bars timescales particularly the temporal changes of alternate bar characteristics under varying discharge conditions might be key to studying the relationship between morphological change and the hydrograph cycle 3 3 morphodynamics response of alternate bars under abrupt discharge change according to the equations in appendix a the adjustment of bar shape is directly affected by the sediment transport rate qb which is further decided by the shield number τ among the cases of 400 1000 m3 s the difference of shield number τ is decided by the flow velocity v and water depth h since all the conditions except hydrograph cycles are the same under a regular unsteady flow condition v and h are able to change regularly and further form the cyclic change of shield number τ and sediment transport rate qb however the change of sediment discharge will also cause topographic changes and in turn affect local water depth and velocity certainly the formation of this reaction requires a certain time to accumulate and will not take effect immediately which might be the reason why morphodynamics equilibrium state have time limits to explore further we performed a numerical simulation of alternate bars with an abrupt discharge change as it is introduced in the method section the adjustment timescale of bar shape due to the discharge change might be an important factor in understanding the relation between hydrodynamic and morphodynamic timescales fig 14 shows the time space change of elevation variation at the right bank as we showed in fig 4 io addition fig 15 demonstrates the temporal change of the elevation variation at the right bank within a certain time when the discharge is abruptly decreased from 1000 to 400 m3 s and increased from 400 m3 s to 1000 m3 s respectively in the decreasing discharge process the discharge drops at 800 h elevation variation between 797 820 h is shown in fig 15 a in the increasing discharge process the discharge abruptly increase at 840 h elevation variation from 837 860 h is shown in fig 15 b fig 14 shows that the migration speed of alternate bars changes rapidly as the discharge abruptly changes the same phenomenon can be observed in fig 15 which has been marked with a red dotted arrow the migration speed of the alternate bar tops changed rapidly within 3 4 h after the discharge changed fig 15 a shows a discharge reduction from 1000 to 400 m3 s and a subsequent decrease in the bottom of the alternate bars indicated by the green dotted arrow which represents an increasing bar height however unlike the rapid change in the migration speed the change in bar height is a longer process in fig 15 a the decrease in the elevation of the bottom point lasts for 20 h and still maintains a decreasing trend fig 15 b shows a discharge increase from 400 to 1000 m3 s and a subsequent increase in the bottom of the alternate bars indicated by the green dotted arrow which represents a decreasing bar height similarly the migration speed changes rapidly and the change in bar height is a long term process however in fig 15 b the bar height appears to reach an equilibrium state after 6 8 h the elevation variation due to discharge increase is much faster than that when the discharge decreases from 1000 to 400 m3 s the short response time of migration speed indicates simultaneous change of migration speed and discharge in our study the discharge variation is linear and smooth so that the migration speed changes without any lag contributing to the migration pattern shown in fig 4 the migration speed of all alternate bars changes with discharge and eventually maintains an approximate constant of the average velocity contrastingly the longer response time of the bar height suggests that for different discharge changes different time periods are required for the alternate bars to reach the corresponding bar height and wavelength for lower discharge rates a much longer time is required for alternate bars to reach equilibrium state because of low sediment transport capacity the height of alternate bars reaches an equilibrium state quicker for higher discharge rates because the sediment transport capacity is high fig 16 shows the response conditions of bar height and wavelength to a discharge change from 1000 400 m3 s to 400 1000 m3 s the green arrow line represents a 570 m length and is used to measure the wavelength of the alternate bars fig 14 a shows that the wavelength of bars does not change during the discharge dropping process on the contrary in the discharge increasing process shown in fig 16 b different wavelengths appear at 879 h while the wavelengths at 840 and 844 h remain at 570 m furthermore the shape of alternate bars may also change as depicted inside the green dotted circle the results show that the wavelength of alternate remains stable in the discharge dropping process as opposed to the increasing process the wavelength remains the same in both processes until the bar height reaches equilibrium state after the that for the discharge increasing process the wavelength changes as shown at 844 and 879 h this is because after the alternate bars reach a steady discharge pattern it is much easier for the bar to change its wavelength however for the discharge dropping process the response time is much longer the alternate bars cannot reach a steady discharge pattern and the wavelength remains constant for a longer period this difference in response time is caused by the sediment transport rate in lower and higher discharges implying that the higher sediment transport rate makes the adjustment time for the discharge change faster according to the result there are three response stages of the alternate bars to discharge change first is the quick response of the migration speed while bar height changes until the dynamics of alternate bars reach the equilibrium state under given steady discharge level the required time for the alternate bars to reach a steady flow state is dependent on the discharge ranging from 5 h during 400 1000 m3 s to more than 20 h during 1000 400 m3 s after the alternate bars reach the steady flow state their wavelengths might change according to the alternate bar properties the hydrograph cycle that provides the morphodynamics equilibrium state might lie between the two threshold response times that distinguish three response stages explained above the hydrograph cycle should be long enough for the alternate bars to respond to discharge variation but not too long to allow the alternate bars to reach the equilibrium bar height and begin to deform their wavelength as they do in steady flow conditions if the hydrograph cycle is too short the alternate bars can be unstable as the discharge variation of 400 1000 m3 s with 6 h cycle case shows if the hydrograph cycle is too long the alternate bars have enough time to deform in this case the alternate bars have a chance to develop and become unstable or show cyclic behaviors like under steady discharge condition crosato et al 2012 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with field observation and theoretical work our results showed some unique morphodynamics of alternate bars under unsteady discharge conditions alternate bar wavelength and migration dynamics become constant in the long term perspective and this morphodynamic equilibrium leads to a phenomenon that the migration period of alternate bars becomes equal to the hydrograph cycle these findings are based on purely numerical simulation so some of the assumptions and results should be carefully validated using the experimental or field dataset of alternate bar dynamics under similar flow and geographic conditions however the iric nays2dh enables to capture the fundamental physics of alternate bar dynamics under unsteady discharge conditions as shown in appendix a in addition some of the morphodynamic features of alternate bars simulated in this study can be seen in the field studies for example the difference in response time in bar height and wavelength is seen in the long term field observation of church and rice 2009 by using a century scale long term monitoring of point bar dynamics in a gravel bed river church and rice showed that the bar height reaches an equilibrium state much faster than the length and width of bars this is because the vertical movement of sediment is much more limited than the horizontal motion so less constrained horizontal sediment motion causes the further development of planimetric bar shape our focus is migrating alternate bars but the fact above might suggest that simulated dynamics of alternate bars include the nature of alternate bars not purely numerical artifacts it is therefore worth discussing herein the meaning and implication of the present results by comparing some important previous studies of alternate bars below in this study we performed numerical simulations of alternate bar morphodynamics under unsteady discharge conditions focusing on the influence of hydrograph cycles some hydrograph cycles bring the alternate bars to an equilibrium state that gives a constant long term wavelength and migration period in addition the migration period of this state becomes identical to the hydrograph cycle the results suggest that the hydrograph cycle could also be a key factor in river morphodynamics studies on alternate bar morphodynamics under unsteady discharge condition shows that hydrographs with the same discharge variation but differing cycles give rise to different morphodynamic features tubino performed flume experiments on sand bar dynamics under unsteady discharge conditions that is the same discharge with differing hydrograph cycle conditions were evaluated in addition tubino proposed a theoretical framework to predict the bar height and migration speed under different hydrograph cycles the results show that short hydrograph cycles yield lower bar heights compared to that of steady discharge perspective and long hydrograph cycles yield bar heights that are in equilibrium state tubino 1991 watanabe et al also investigated unsteady flow and alternate bar formations with a flume experiment and linear stability analysis and the results also showed that the hydrograph cycle influences the alternate bar morphodynamics such as wavelength and bar height watanabe et al 2002 the findings of the aforementioned two studies might correspond to the timescales of bar dynamics we introduced a short hydrograph cycle might not provide sufficient time for the alternate bars to develop thus resulting in lower bar heights or shorter wavelengths contrastingly a long hydrograph cycle might provide the alternate bars too much time to deform and alternate bars will change their chape significantly fujita and muromoto 1985 nelson and smith 1989 for example the experiments of watanabe et al adopted a long hydrograph compared to the time scale of bar formation such that the morphodynamics of alternate bars is strongly changed within a single hydrograph our result however suggests a constant wavelength or migration periods under unsteady flow conditions i e repeated hydrographs this morphodynamic equilibrium might be achieved under the specific condition that the timescale of hydrodynamics i e hydrograph cycle is similar to the morphodynamic timescale to understand this point we calculate the following unsteadiness parameter u proposed by tubino 1991 4 u σ ϵ α 1 r σ σ b u 0 β β c β c β b d 0 where b half of channel width u 0 d 0 uniform flow velocity and depth of reference base state β β c width depth ratio of reference base state and critical condition σ 1 t in which t hydrograph cycle and α1r linear growth rate of perturbation this unsteadiness parameter is the ratio of the timescale between basic unsteadiness of flow and bar growth it means that u 1 corresponds to much slower bar development than the discharge change so that the alternate bars cannot change their shape corresponding to the discharge change u 1 provides a much faster growth of bars than the hydrograph cycle resulting in the equilibrium state of bars given by the steady discharge condition we calculate this unsteadiness parameter for some hydrograph cycles of 400 1000 m3 s case namely 6 10 20 and 40 h according to the method of tubino the water discharge which corresponds to the reference base state under bed slope channel width and grain size we use can be given approximately as 600 m3 s with the help of figs 3 and 5 of tubino β c and α1r can be read as approximately 9 and 0 001 these parameters convert the hydrograph cycles 6 10 20 and 40 h as u 0 47 0 28 0 14 and 0 07 respectively the longer hydrograph cycle i e 40 h yields small unsteadiness parameters and in this case the bar behavior is like a steady discharge case figs 8 10 the hydrograph cycles which lead non time dependent wavelength and migration periods of alternate bars leads to u o 0 1 it suggests that the timescale of morphodynamics is of a smaller order than the hydrodynamic scales but it is not too small this threshold might be also related to the response of bar height under unsteady flow condition as tubino showed that is u o 0 1 is a transition of bar height response between steady behavior i e u 1 and no response because of extremely short hydrograph i e u 1 see the fig 13 of tubino this result supports our results on the response time of alternate bars although this criterion and its meaning should be revised based on some physical basis this consideration might suggest that a moderately long hydrograph compared to the bar growth scale will be a key factor in achieving this morphodynamic equilibrium under repeated hydrographs 4 2 implication of morphodynamic equilibrium to bank erosion the equilibrium state of migrating alternate bars between steady and unsteady discharge conditions may seem similar in terms of bar dynamics i e constant wavelength and the continuously migrating feature however it might play different roles in the development of other morphodynamic features such as bank erosion and channel meandering to show this we selected the unsteady case of 100 600 m3 s with a hydrograph cycle of 40 h and the steady flow case of 400 m3 s two points a and b on the right bank where a downstream distance is 10 200 m and 10 500 m respectively were selected to evaluate their elevation variation from 700 900 h in both cases the chosen period was sufficiently long to allow for equilibrium bar development and the distance between two points was determined by the half wavelength of alternate bars observed in the unsteady case fig 17 a and b show the elevation variation in unsteady and steady flow cases respectively the elevation variation at the selected two points at the maximum and minimum discharges are marked with dotted lines we found that when discharge reaches the maximum value of 600 m3 s the elevation variation of point a is always positive whereas that of point b is always negative and is almost close to the minimum value this is because the bars migrate downstream exactly one wavelength within one hydrograph under the equilibrium state in this case the morphodynamic changes of fixed points are completely different and are highly dependent on the discharge variations conversely in the steady discharge case the elevation variation at a and b show quite similar pattern the variation appearing in the upstream point a appears in the downstream point b in a similar form as denoted by curvilinear arrows demonstrating that the alternate bars which reached equilibrium shape are migrating downstream the results of the elevation variation shown above indicate completely different migration patterns and riverbed deformations between the steady flow condition and the unsteady flow condition which has reached morphodynamics equilibrium this might cause different morphodynamic features in the context of bank erosion and meandering as follows 1 steady discharge leads to continuous downstream migration of the same alternate bars throughout the channel implying that the riverbed and riverbank experience the same erosion and deposition processes caused by alternate bar migration 2 under an unsteady discharge condition that has reached morphodynamics equilibrium the erosion and deposition at each bank point differ they exhibit their own varying pattern associated with the hydrograph implying that some points might suffer more erosion than others for example the variation of point b in fig 17 a always reaches the minimum value when discharge is at a maximum implying that the point b will always be in an eroded state during the flood period on the contrary the point a may experience the deposition at high discharge and erosion at low discharge implying weaker erosional effect on the river bank than the point b the hydrograph cycle is a key factor controlling this morphodynamic equilibrium making it a vital role in the bank erosion and meandering development visconti et al experimentally showed comparable results above a specific combination of hydrograph shape and migration celerity of bars causes bank erosion at the same point contributing to the maintenance of the pseudo meandering channel visconti et al 2010 however if the specific combination is not met bank erosion occurs evenly in both riverbanks similar to the steady discharge case above resulting in the formation of a braiding channel additionally in the real scale otofuke river which was selected to determine our numerical conditions nagata et al 2014 pointed out the importance of hydrograph shape in amplifying meandering channels caused by significant bank erosion although our numerical setup is quite simple i e identical triangle shape hydrographs are repeated in a straight channel the results have important implications for the morphodynamics of bar and meandering channel development in alluvial rivers 4 3 limitations our computational condition and associated results are limited to continuously migrating alternate bars in a straight channel so that we neglect the interaction between flat bed no bar and multi bar or braided morphodynamics the present results will be applicable for gravel bed rivers with high bed slope in upper river reaches where the bar dynamics is highly active e g adami et al 2016 on the contrary we need to investigate this phenomenon in detail for sand bed rivers as in such cases other factors e g suspended sediment load affect the dynamics of alternate bars the unsteadiness parameter is generally large in sand bed rivers causing slower bar growth than the hydrodynamics bertagni and camporeale 2018 eekhout et al 2013 in addition the reasoning behind this kind of equilibrium state of migrating alternate bars remains unclear under repeated hydrograph conditions these issues need to be investigated for further understanding of the morphodynamics of alternate bars under unsteady discharge conditions the morphodynamic equilibrium under unsteady discharge might be affected by some other factors for example the timescale is related to the sediment transport rate since the migration is strongly controlled by the transport and deposition of sediment it means that some bedload transport formula we use and some parameters used in the bedload transport formula might have some effect on this timescale for example wong and parker 2006 pointed out the overestimation of original meyer peter and muller bedload transport formula that is used in this study it causes higher migration speed of alternate bars so that eventually gives slightly different criteria for equilibrium state of alternate bar dynamics under unsteady discharge conditions since the process of bedload and estimation of bedload transport rate includes high uncertainties especially for graded sediment bed recking 2010 it will be worth to investigate how such uncertainties affect the presented results the sequence of hydrograph in the present computation is a repetition of simple triangle shape hydrograph however the real hydrologic regime gives complex combination of different peak discharge flood duration and hydrograph shape all these factors control the alternate bar dynamics in real system for this issue carlin et al 2021 combine a flow duration curve that expresses the long term discharge variations as a probabilistic way and the alternate bar properties obtained by linear and nonlinear stability analysis to understand long term equilibrium state of alternate bars in their study the stability analysis is performed under steady discharge condition and the effect of individual flood event is neglected our result however shows that the hydrograph cycle has a strong effect on the alternate properties and dynamics so that the discharge unsteadiness and individual flood event might need to be taken into account to understand full understanding of long term behaviors of alternate bars this issue should be further investigated in future in addition to the hydrograph characteristics upstream sediment supply condition will be an important factor controlling the alternate bar dynamics and morphodynamic equilibrium shown in this study generally in the gravel bed rivers strong diffusive effect on the morphodynamics process in bedload dominated condition causes the limited effect of upstream bedload supply on the downstream reaches and such effect is only seen in upstream limited reach so called hydrograph boundary layer hbl blom et al 2017 wong and parker 2006 we showed that the concept of hbl is applicable to dynamics of two dimensional river morphology like alternate bars in uniform sediment bed dai et al 2021 so that the sediment supply condition will have small effect on the morphodynamics of alternate bars presented in this study on the other hand in the graded sediment bed an et al an et al 2017 pointed out a breakdown of hbl and migration of low amplitude bedload sheet beyond hbl showing possible effect of upstream sediment supply condition on the downstream morphology since the alternate bar dynamics in graded sediment bed is unstable than the uniform case takebayashi and egashira 2008 the sediment supply might have important role in our findings it will be important future challenges to understand the effect of graded sediment and upstream sediment supply on the morphodynamic equilibrium of alternate bars under unsteady discharge condition 5 conclusions in this study we numerically investigated the morphodynamics of alternate bars under unsteady flow conditions particularly the morphodynamics of migrating alternate bars subjected to repeated simple triangle hydrographs was simulated using a two dimensional morphodynamic model iric nays2dh to understand long term behaviors of alternate bars under unsteady discharge conditions we found that the morphodynamics of alternate bars under a specific combination of discharge variation and hydrograph cycle reached an equilibrium state that is the wavelength and migration period of alternate bars remained constant and the migration period was the same as the hydrograph cycle this might be a unique morphodynamic feature of alternate bars under unsteady conditions because the steady discharge counterparts demonstrated a dynamic equilibrium state with slightly time dependent features of the wavelength and migration period but did not exhibit non time dependent features when morphodynamic equilibrium was reached the hydrograph cycle was the dominant factor for alternate bar characteristics if this morphodynamic state was achieved the wavelength of alternate bars increased with the hydrograph cycle and the migration period was always identical to the hydrograph cycle the hydrograph cycle that corresponds to this equilibrium state can be determined from the relation between hydrodynamic and bar growth timescales under a short hydrograph the bar growth occurred much slower than the discharge changes so that the bars cannot respond to the discharge variation meanwhile the long hydrograph provided sufficient time for the deformation and development of alternate bars causing a significant change in bar characteristics e g wavelength within one hydrograph such as steady discharge condition the hydrograph cycle that achieves this equilibrium state must be moderately long so that the timescale of the hydrograph is similar but slightly smaller than the bar growth timescale but not too small to allow equilibrium bar behaviors caused by steady discharge conditions as the morphodynamic equilibrium of alternate bars under repeated unsteady discharge hydrographdiffers from a dynamic equilibrium state provided by the steady discharge analysis the findings of this study will shed some light on the alternate bar dynamics and related channel scale morphodynamics such as a river meandering under long term unsteady discharge however the discussion in this paper is still limited because for example physical mechanisms of this equilibrium state and applicability of other river and hydraulic conditions remain unsolved further research is of immense importance in contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the long term processes involved in migrating alternate bars under unsteady discharge conditions

coefficient eq a 1 is the continuity equation eqs a 2 and a 3 are the momentum equations in y and x direction respectively these equations are two dimensional unsteady shallow water flow equation and we use manning s roughness formula for evaluating the bed shear stress eq a 4 is the continuity equation of sediment eqs a 5 and a 6 are the local streamwise and transverse bed load transport equations this assumes that mode of sediment transport is a bedload of uniform sediment and bedload transport is evaluated as an equilibrium value which corresponds to the local flow parameters the governing equations above namely a combination of shallow flow model and equilibrium bedload transport model with the secondary flow and local slope effect has been well known morphodynamic model for simulating alternate bar dynamics the linear and nonlinear stability analysis have shown that the model above is capable of simulating formation development and equilibrium state of alternate bars colombini et al 1987 some key physics is described for example by redolfi 2021 the shallow flow hydrodynamics destabilizes the initial flat bed for generating free bars and the transverse local slope second term of the right hand side of eq a 6 has stabilizing effect on the morphodynamics achieving the finite wavelength of the free bars the effect of secondary flow on the bedload transport direction i e first term of the right hand side of eq a 6 more generally the effect of three dimensional hydrodynamics is not necessary to be included for formation of alternate bars tubino et al 1999 but has some important roles in the bar dynamics in non linear level e g bar height iwasaki et al 2016 it suggests in general that iric nays2dh model has a reasonable ability to capture the formation and development of alternate bars more specifically for current study the model performance for simulating sand bars has been valid for example alternate and multiple row bar formation with erodible bank under steady condition has been reproduced by jang and shimizu also kobayashi et al 2006 applied this type of model to flume experiments regarding sand bar behavior under unsteady discharge condition performed by watanabe and kawamura 2005 the numerical result shows general agreement with the experimental result i e the temporal change of bar wavelength and bar height due to discharge change in addition to these efforts we herein apply the iric nays2dh to the laboratory experiments of alternate bar formation under repeated hydrograph which is similar to our present numerical experiments the experiment is performed in 42 m long and 0 9 m wide straight channel at civil engineering research institute for cold regions hokkaido japan a well sorted sand of which the mean diameter is 0 76 mm is used for material of bed and supplied sediment the sand supply rate from the upstream end is equilibrium transport rate which does not cause bed aggradation and degradation at

discharges are 8 and 4 l s and hydrograph cycle is set to 2 h the duration of rising and falling stages of discharge is identical i e 1 hour for each stage and the discharge is linearly changed in time between highest and lowest discharges this simple hydrograph is obtained 6 times in total but firstly 3 hydrographs are given to the initial bed for formation of sand bars after a time interval for a few days to measure the bed surface in dry condition using a 3d laser scanner later 3 hydrographs are obtained to bar developed bed in entire experiment the sand bar behavior at the reach between 17 and 35 m from the upstream end is recorded by three digital cameras from the top of the channel with the time interval of 2 min using the photographs taken from the top of channel we identify the location of migrating alternate bars to capture the migration pattern of the bars also the bathymetric data taken after 3 and 6 hydrographs is available to understand spatial orientation of the alternate bar geometry the computational conditions are set based on the experimental condition the manning s roughness coefficient is set to 0 0145 which is equivalent to the grain size roughness determined by manning strickler type model to reproduce the uniform water depth at the initial state the sediment is treated as a uniform sediment of the diameter of 0 76 mm the grid sizes for streamwise and transverse directions are 0 1 and 0 045 m respectively for the transverse bedload formula i e eq a 6 the static and dynamic friction coefficient of sediment μs and μk are given as 0 7 that corresponds to 35 degree of angle of repose and engelund type secondary flow model engelund 1974 is applied main difference between the experimental and computational conditions is channel length and number of hydrographs we obtain in general time necessary for bar development in the numerical simulation is longer than the experiments maybe because of the difference in degree of the perturbation in same way it takes longer distance to ensure the formation and development of sand bars more specifically in the experiment the bars start developing within first hydrograph at a few meters downstream from the upstream end on the other hand in the numerical simulation the bars start emerges almost at the end of 2nd hydrographs at the 20 m downstream from the upstream end by considering these spin up time and distance for the system nelson and smith 1989 we use 80 m length channel and give 8 hydrographs for the computation it also means that the computational result during first 2 hydrographs and in 21 m upstream reach in the computation are not used for the comparison fig a1 shows the geometry of sand bars in the experiment and numerical simulation after three and six hydrographs as the experimental result shows the multiple row bars form at the upstream reach and its change their characteristics to alternate bars downstream reach because of the multiple hydrographs we obtained the wavelength of alternate bars slightly increases in time this figure clearly demonstrates that the numerical model is able to capture such morphodynamic trend observed in the experiments fig a2 compares the migration pattern of the alternate bars in the experiment and numerical simulations in the experiment we identify the location of bar front near the right wall of the channel from the photographs taken on the other hand numerical results show the pattern of erosion and deposition of bed at the right bank as we show in the main part of the paper as well this result suggests that the model slightly underpredicts the observed migration velocity of alternate bars but generally this result shows good agreement with the experimental data in addition to this fig a3 shows the model performance in terms of temporal change of average wavelength and waveheight of alternate bars we identify the wavelength as the same way in the fig a2 and waveheight is defined as the difference between maximum and minimum bed elevation within a single bar unit there are only two data point for observed waveheight since detailed measurement of bathymetry is available at t 360 and 720 min this figure also suggests that the model slightly overpredict the wavelength but overall the numerical result shows a good agreement with the experimental results field scale validation of the model performance for this study is difficult issue since there might not be sufficient field dataset available for alternate bar morphodynamics under repeated hydrographs in a straight channel instead the iric nays2dh generally captures the sand bar development and associated meandering development caused by large flood event in a field scale river the otofuke river japan which is also used as a modelled river in this study iwasaki et al 2016 kyuka et al 2020 in addition to such previous works the general features of alternate bars simulated in this study agree with the bed and channel characteristics in the field fig a4 demonstrates the morphodynamic changes of the upper otofuke river japan showing that the dominant river morphology is alternate bars and associated meandering development two large floods took place at 7th sep 2011 and the end of aug 2016 causing great changes of sand bars and channel pattern at fig a4 b c and a4 c d respectively the resultant characteristics i e wavelength of the alternate bars and meandering in this figure can be in the range from 500 to 800 m which is consistent with the characteristics of alternate bars formed under even simplified discharge condition in this study it should be noted that since the bars are highly vegetated in this river reach causing slowdown of migration speed of bars or even non migrating bars e g serlet et al 2018 the migration pattern cannot be directly compared with non vegetated bars in our study in addition the significant bank erosion widens channel greatly on the other hand in this study we assume that the channel is a constant width with non erosible side banks in spite of these limitations the numerical model generally captures the morphodynamics of alternate bars of the target river reach the results above might suggest that the iric nays2dh model is a potential tool to pursue the alternate bar dynamics under unsteady discharge condition as we perform in this study it is worth noting that although the present experiment will be relevant for the validation data of this study the model needs to be carefully validated further especially from long term perspectives it means that experimental studies focusing on the morphodynamic behaviors of alternate bars under many repeated hydrographs will be of great interest in addition to this the field scale observation of alternate bar behaviors in detail will be surely necessary to understand the effect of unsteady discharge on the alternate bar dynamics for long term and further validation of the morphodynamic model appendix b sensitivity test to numerical mesh size the mesh size is an important parameter for hydraulics numerical simulations a hydrograph condition may lead to different results according to the mesh size horritt et al 2006 performed a same flow simulation under different size of mesh showing different errors especially modelling a large magnitude event in this study an unsteady flow condition is given though the morphodynamic equilibrium state is observed there is still possibility that mesh size will influence the results the mesh size used in this study is 70 m 10 m and we decrease the length and width to only half of them to 35 m 5 m to test the sensitivity meanwhile unsteady flow cases of 400 1000 m3 s with the hydrograph cycles of 10 20 and 40 h were tested here to confirm whether the grid resolution could change the morphodynamic features of the alternate bars we simulated because more grids will consume a lot of extra computing time for the 10 h case we reduce the process to 1000 h fig b1 shows the fft analysis of the results compared fig b1 to fig 8 and fig b2 to fig 9 it is clearly shown that in every flow condition under 35 m 5 m mesh size alternate bars will still show the same morphodynamics properties morphodynamic equilibrium 10 h morphodynamic equilibrium under critical state 20 h and alternate bars under general state 40 h fig b1 a b and fig b2 a b show the dominant wavelengths and constant migration periods though fig b1 c show a similar dominant wavelength it is worth to noticed that migration period in fig b1 c is not 40 h and that does not satisfy our definition for morphodynamics equilibrium state however it is noticed that the dominant wavelengths in fig b1 decrease about 20 m in each case which is 3 5 of the wavelength indicating that mesh size will slightly influence the alternate bars properties but still it can be confirmed that the mesh size doesn t influence the morphodynamics equilibrium states which is the main finding of this study 
28,discharge unsteadiness plays a key role in the dynamics of alternate bars however how migrating alternate bars determine their shape under unsteady discharge conditions especially in the long term is still unclear in this study we numerically investigate long term behaviors of migrating alternate bars subject to repeated hydrographs for this the same discharge variation but different hydrograph cycles were tested the results show that even under unsteady flow conditions specific combinations of hydrograph cycles and discharge variations result in an equilibrium state of migrating alternate bars i e non time dependent wavelength and migration period this may be a unique feature of the alternate bar morphodynamics since dynamic equilibrium state arising from steady discharge counterparts is time dependent feature meanwhile it is observed that when the discharge changes abruptly the response of alternate bar morphodynamics changes along the time within a limited period the response of alternate bars is not strong enough to destroy the original wavelength suggesting that the hydrograph cycle that achieves this equilibrium state must be moderately long such that the timescale of the hydrograph is similar but slightly smaller than the bar growth keywords alternate bars unsteady discharge morphodynamic equilibrium data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction understanding river morphology and its dynamics is an important topic in many research fields and the alternate bar morphology is a specific field of interest owing to their spontaneous alternating transformation and migration alternate bars could be the main contributing factor for channel engineering or watershed topography problems such as river bank protection navigation agriculture or river construction amoako johnson and hutton 2014 crosato et al 2022 duró et al 2016 jaballah et al 2015 in the last few decades extensive studies have investigated the fundamental physical mechanisms of the alternate bars colombini et al 1987 fujita and muromoto 1985 lisle et al 1991 to understand river morphodynamics the concept of formative or dominant effective steady discharge which determines the overall characteristics of river morphology is adopted river bars and related morphodynamics e g meandering have been thoroughly investigated using steady discharge conditions based on formative or effective discharge concepts generally this simplification does not affect the fundamental physics of the formation and development of river bars and provides some important insights such as alternate bar wavelength and height growth rate and migration defina 2003 ikeda 1984 whiting and dietrich 1993 crosato et al performed experiments and numerical simulations of alternate bar morphodynamics under long term steady discharge conditions demonstrating cyclic behavior of the alternate bar morphodynamics and the possibility of non migrating alternate bars crosato et al 2012 however these studies consider long term dynamics of alternate bars to be in a relatively stable discharge condition the discharge unsteadiness is essential in river system and plays a critical role in the sand bar formation and dynamics that has not been achieved under steady discharge condition tubino performed a linear stability analysis of free river bars under unsteady discharge conditions to understand unsteady behaviors of alternate bar dynamics regarding weavelength and waveheight shown in the experimental flume tubino 1991 this first theoretical attempt indicated the importance of flow unsteadiness to bar dynamics and further motivated the understanding of alternate bar dynamics under unsteady discharge conditions hall 2004 izumi et al 2021 watanabe et al 2001 visconti et al conducted movable bed and bank experiments under unsteady discharge conditions showing that a specific combination of hydrograph features and migration characteristics of bars enhance or suppress the development of pseudo meandering channels visconti et al 2010 iwasaki et al performed a numerical simulation of the bar and bank erosion in the vegetated floodplain during a large flood in a natural river otofuke river japan suggesting similar importance of the discharge unsteadiness to the amplification of meandering channels iwasaki et al 2016 the aforementioned studies emphasize the significance of discharge unsteadiness on the morphodynamics of river bars such studies focus on short term morphodynamics as only a single or a few repeated hydrographs are considered instead more longer term behaviors of alternate bar dynamics need to be investigated in detail in other words exactly how the river bars were formed and continue to develop in the long term under the complex sequence of hydrographs remains unclear this is mainly owing to a lack of field observations pertaining to long term interaction between hydrological events and spatiotemporal river bars as well as the difficulty in performing long term flume experiments even under simplified conditions notably in this regard carlin et al proposed a novel framework for obtaining the long term equilibrium characteristics of river bars i e wavelength and wave height using a linear and nonlinear stability analysis with the flow duration curve which is a simplified treatment of complex sequence of discharge variation in long term carlin et al 2021 their analyses agreed with field observations of the river bar geometry this is a robust framework to understand the equilibrium state of bars under discharge variation however bar dynamics must be discussed in detail as discharge variations are simplified into a flow duration curve church and rice investigated a century scale dynamics of point bars developed in a gravel bed reach of lower fraser river british columbia canada showing response of bar dimension namely thickness length and width to the age of bars church and rice 2009 nelson and morgan conducted flume experiments of gravel bedform development under repeated simple triangle hydrographs and a constant sediment feed rate nelson and morgan 2018 this is to our knowledge only the flume experiment to pursue long term equilibrium of bedforms under unsteady discharge conditions their results showed that flow unsteadiness has a negligible effect on channel scale morphologies however the bedform resembling the alternate bars in their experiment might be a combination of dunes and alternate bars i e three dimensional bedforms colombini and stocchino 2012 as the observed geometry does not satisfy the river bar categories derived from linear stability analysis that adopts the shallow flow approximation colombini et al 1987 furbish 1998 in this case the bedform can adjust its shape to the discharge variations although there is a hysteresis effect shimizu et al 2009 however the large scale bars have a longer morphodynamic timescale so the effect of the hydrograph might be more complex in summary the discharge variation or discharge unsteadiness has been considered only recently in morphodynamic modeling but it remains unclear how large scale bedform alternate bars reach a state of equilibrium especially in the long term this study focuses on the long term behaviors of alternate bars under the influence of repeated hydrographs the questions we pursue in this study are 1 do alternate bars attain the equilibrium state under unsteady flow discharge conditions 2 what are the equilibrium characteristics of alternate bars under this condition 3 what controls the long term behaviors of alternate bars to understand these points we perform several numerical simulations of alternate bar formations under repeated hydrographs and corresponding steady discharge conditions using a two dimensional morphodynamic model iric nays2dh the simulated alternate bar morphodynamics i e the wavelength bar height and migration period are investigated to understand the effect of hydrographs on long term alternate bar characteristics and the relation between hydrograph and morphodynamic timescales 2 method 2 1 numerical model we used the nays2dh model shimizu et al 2014 a two dimensional morphodynamic model embedded in the iric software nelson et al 2016 this model was applied to various sediment transport related simulation studies kang et al 2020 rahman and ali 2021 tamminga et al 2015 and is suitable for simulating alternate bar morphodynamics focused on in this study dai et al 2021 mackenzie and eaton 2017 in addition to such previous results in the appendix a we show that the model reasonably captures the formation and migration of alternate bars under repeated simple hydrographs observed in a laboratory experiment also the characteristics of alternate bars simulated in the present study are generally consistent with the observed one in the otofuke river which is a modeled river in this study see below and appendix a these model validations suggest that the nays2dh model may be an acceptable tool to pursue the long term morphodynamics of alternate bars under repeated hydrographs focused on in this study meanwhile the flow model used is an unsteady two dimensional shallow water flow model as we focus on the morphodynamics of alternate bars in gravel bed rivers we only consider bedload transport as a mode of sediment transport the meyer peter and müller formula was used here and the sediment was assumed to have a uniform grain size the details of the nays2dh model and its applicability for simulating alternate bar dynamics are introduced in the appendix a 2 2 computational conditions to understand the morphodynamics of alternate bars under repeated hydrographs we used the condition of the otofuke river as an example this river is a typical gravel bed river and the alternate bars are one of the dominant river morphologies iwasaki et al 2016 kyuka et al 2020 the modeled channel has a 21 km length and 70 m constant channel width with a uniform slope of 0 005 which is a simplified configuration of the upper otofuke river kyuka et al 2020 a manning roughness coefficient of 0 028 s m1 3 and a uniform particle size of 40 mm were used the mesh size used in this study is 70 m 10 m which means 7 grid sizes in width and 3000 sizes in length the time step used in this study is 0 2 s the initial bed is uniformly flat for transverse direction without any perturbation but random perturbation is added to the transverse profile of upstream discharge to obtain a trigger for alternate bar formation and development in entire calculation time we derived the hydrograph shape based on the large flood event observed in 2011 such that the migrating alternate bars could form and develop iwasaki et al 2016 nagata et al 2014 this is a relatively large flood event of which the flood recurrence year is around 20 years and caused significant bar migration and subsequent amplification of the channel the details can be found in previous works e g iwasaki et al 2016 nagata et al 2014 fig 1 a and b show the observed hydrograph and simplified repeated hydrographs used in the calculation the observed hydrograph was modeled as a simple triangle shaped hydrograph the water discharge linearly increased from 100 to 600 m3 s within 20 h and subsequently decreased from 600 to 100 m3 s linearly in 20 h forming a 40 h cycle the six hydrographs are shown here as an example in the calculation 50 hydrographs were obtained the aforementioned computational condition is the same as our previous studies that focus on the effect of sediment supply on the alternate bar formation dai et al 2021 in the previous study we have showed that imbalance of sediment supply from the upstream end under such hydrograph hardly affect the downstream alternate bars formation under this computational condition at least for timescale of single flood event in this study the sediment feed rate used was calculated from the upstream end flow parameters just as same as one of the sediment conditions in our previous study mackenzie and eaton 2017 this feed rate is the sediment transport capacity of this modeled river and the supply rate depends on the hydrograph as shown in fig 1 b as the feed rate is equivalent to the transport capacity the bed elevation at the upstream end does not change over time under this condition meanwhile to test the influence of different discharges on the alternate bars the following discharge processes are used with either fixed maximum discharge or fixed minimum discharge for each case different hydrograph cycles of 10 20 40 and 80 h are also tested for sensitivity analysis the lowest discharge of 400 m3 s resulted in a fully transported condition of alternate bars while the bars remained submerged and actively moved downstream the highest discharge of 1000 m3 s can be determined by the upper transition limit between alternate bar formation and a no bar condition based on the linear stability analysis kuroki and kishi 1984 for the fixed maximum discharge cases the purpose is to test the behavior of alternate bars when the discharge variation is around the critical value of 400 m3 s for these cases although the minimum discharges are below the fully transport condition of alternate bars they exceed the threshold discharge 90 m3 s that corresponds to the incipient conditionfor sediment under uniform flow condition for the fixed minimum discharge cases the purpose is intended to make the migration of alternate bars active throughout the computation to observe the morphodynamic response of alternate bars more clearly we performed a numerical simulation of alternate bars with an abrupt discharge change of 400 1000 m3 s as shown in fig 2 the purpose of this case is to study the response time of alternate bars when the discharge rate changes low or high steady discharge first develops migrating alternate bars in a dynamic equilibrium state and the abrupt change of discharge reshapes the bars to form another dynamic equilibrium state according to the high or low steady discharge in addition to the unsteady discharge case we also performed calculation of steady water discharges at 400 500 600 700 800 900 and 1000 m3 s these discharges were set to be in the range of unsteady cases 2 3 wavelet analysis of migration periods of alternate bars wavelet analysis was introduced by grossman and morlet for the treatment of geophysical seismic signals grossmann and morlet 1984 this analysis is considered as a milestone in fourier analysis development because it can achieve higher accuracy in unstable signal analysis by localizing the process currently wavelet analysis is an efficient mathematical solution in many fields and makes up for a few drawbacks of the fourier analysis however few applications have been made with respect to river morphology yovanni used wavelet analysis on the migrating ripple sand dunes observed in an experiment on a meandering channel in this study bed elevation and distance were considered as amplitude and process respectively and the processed data helped identify the location and geometric dimensions of erosional and depositional regions in meandering channels cataño lopera et al 2009 mahdade introduced new wavelet analysis tools in the field of geomorphic analysis to identify the pseudo periodicity of alternating morphological units from a general point of view for six small french rivers mahdade et al 2020 our study data deals with the elevation variation at one position with respect to time as the time for each alternate bar to pass through varies the fast fourier transform fft method cannot determine the temporal change of bar dynamics wavelet analysis is a better solution to process the elevation variation with respect to time fig 3 a shows one of example of our simulated result regarding the elevation variation that is the elevation change from the initial bed at one position on the right bank of the modelled river and the distance between two local lowest points represents a single alternate bar has passed this position on the bank this distance as a length of time represents the time to a certain extent and we name it as migration period in general the migration period of alternate bars is irregular as shown in fig 3 a the parts marked with different color lines clearly indicate different alternate bars have passed this position with different migration period since it is complicated to track the migration period of all the alternate bars the wavelet analysis employed here can easily calculate the migration periods of all the alternate bars and track its variation along time as it is shown in fig 3 b by the colored circle in this study the signal curve f η like elevation variation can be recovered as eq 1 1 f η c ψ 1 w ψ f a b ψ a b η d a d b where ψ is wavelet daughters cψ is its admissibility condition wψ is its continuous wavelet transform a is translation offset b is scale factor wavelet daughters is 2 ψ a b η 1 a ψ η b a morlet wavelet is used as the mother wavelet to create the wavelet daughters 3 ψ η π 0 25 e i β η e η 2 2 with a central frequency β of 2 was used as the parent wavelet 3 results 3 1 features of morphodynamic equilibrium state of alternate bars under repeated hydrographs fig 4 shows the elevation variation at the right bank of the computational river with respect to time in this figure the migration of alternate bars can be inferred from the pattern of elevation variation that is erosional and depositional patterns of this figure move from bottom left to top right this pattern shows that the morphology i e alternate bars keeps migrating downstream and the slope of this pattern shows the migration velocity of bars as this figure represents the bed elevation contour of the time space domain it can be shown that although the migration velocity varies owing to the unsteady water discharge the average migration velocity of the alternate bars which is akin to long term behavior appears constant additionally the spacing between each depositional or erosional point which corresponds to the wavelength of alternate bars is consistent with respect to space and time fig 5 shows the temporal change of alternate bars during the last hydrograph of this computation here five typical time points in one hydrograph cycle are selected to present the characteristics of the alternate bars during a hydrograph the points are 0 beginning of the hydrograph cycle 1 4t one quarter of the hydrograph cycle 1 2t 3 4t and t end of the hydrograph cycle where t denotes the hydrograph cycle as shown by the red arrow line the migration velocity changes with respect to discharge while the wavelength remains constant at 580 m with respect to time moreover when t 0 and t t the positions and shapes of alternate bars are identical thus the elevation of the river bed returns to its original value after one hydrograph cycle because alternate bars migrate exactly one wavelength downstream within one hydrograph to investigate the migration characteristics in greater detail as shown in fig 4 we selected a point at the distance axis and demonstrated the elevation variation with the time as shown in fig 6 a the space between two adjacent minimum values represents the time taken by an alternate bar needs to pass through this point to simplify this description we define this time as the migration period similarly if we select a point on the time axis we can obtain elevation variation at the right bank for this time point in fig 6 b the space between two adjacent minimum values represents the wavelength of an alternate bar fig 6 shows a simple introduction of the elevation variation with respect to time and space fig 6 a shows the migration period of alternate bars which is equal to the hydrograph cycle of 40 h fig 6 b reflects the wavelength of alternate bars which is a constant 580 m however elevation variation at a single position or a single point in time as shown in fig 6 is not sufficient in obtaining the overall characteristics of simulated alternate bar dynamics for this we performed fast fourier transform fft on the bed elevation data along the right bank to obtain the temporal change of the dominant wavelength in addition we applied wavelet analysis for the temporal change of the bed elevation at a certain fixed point to detect the migration period of the alternate bars fig 7 shows the result of fft and wavelet analysis the results show that during the entire calculation time the wavelength and migration period of alternate bars remain at 580 m and 40 h respectively suggesting consistent migration and shape characteristics of alternate bars in time and space in addition the migration period was equal to the hydrograph cycle this result shows that even under an unsteady water discharge condition the bar shape and migration pattern reach an equilibrium state in the context of long term morphological change 3 2 the conditions and criteria for the formation of morphodynamic equilibrium state we imposed a repeated identical simple triangle shape hydrograph for this alternate bar calculation such that properties of the hydrograph i e cycle and discharge range might control this morphodynamic equilibrium state alternate bars showed unconventional characteristics such as constant wavelength and migration periods after reaching morphodynamic equilibrium to confirm whether this phenomenon widely occurs in various unsteady flow conditions or is unique under this condition we compare simulation results of other unsteady flow conditions by changing the minimum and maximum discharges as well as the hydrograph cycle as shown in table 1 as an example of this sensitivity analysis figs 8 and 9 show the fft and wavelet analyses of the discharge varying between 400 and 1000 m3 s with different hydrograph cycles these figures show that hydrograph cycles of 10 and 20 h resulted in a constant wavelength and migration period with respect to time suggesting that in both cases alternate bars reached morphodynamic equilibrium the constant wavelengths for the 10 and 20 h cases were 480 m and 680 m respectively meanwhile the alternate bars with hydrograph cycles of between 40 and 80 h did not reach morphodynamics equilibrium implying that the dominant wavelength and migration period vary with time note that a sensitivity analysis regarding grid resolution to this morphodynamic equilibrium has been presented in appendix b we use a smaller mesh size to ensure that the current mesh size has no decisive impact on the calculation results i e morphodynamic equilibrium explained above the occurrence of this kind of morphodynamic equilibrium caused by different unsteady discharge condition is summarized in table 2 where the existence of the morphodynamics equilibrium is marked with a circle and the corresponding constant wavelength in each case wherein the equilibrium state is achieved the alternate bars have a unique constant wavelength and their migration periods are equal to the hydrograph cycle however almost all the unsteady flow cases with a hydrograph cycle of 20 h can reach morphodynamic equilibrium furthermore certain hydrograph cycles can also facilitate the alternate bars in reaching an equilibrium state the results of the sensitivity analysis led to the following observations first under fixed discharge variation e g 400 1000m3 s case morphodynamics equilibrium can be reached in differenthydrograph cycle i e 10 and 20 h for this case second hydrograph cycles determine the characteristics of alternate bars of this state meaning that longer hydrograph cycle provides longer alternate bars we compared the results of unsteady versus steady discharge conditions as the latter is generally used to understand the equilibrium state of alternate bars the results of wavelength and migration periods of steady flow cases derived from fft and wavelet analysis are shown in table 3 the steady discharge case of 700 m3 s was selected as a typical example to demonstrate fft and wavelet analyses as shown in fig 10 this figure suggests that the dominant wavelength and migration period vary slightly with time and thus exhibit a dynamic equilibrium behavior but they do not achieve a single equilibrium value all the runs demonstrated comparable results that is similar alternate bars developed and migrated downstream in the entire calculation reach but their morphodynamics showed slight time dependent features this result is consistent with previous numerical and experimental studies the migrating alternate bars can elongate in their development state even under steady water and sediment supply conditions fujita and muromoto 1985 nelson and smith 1989 and the alternate bars show cyclic development in the context of long term morphodynamic behavior crosato et al 2012 the present results for a unique morphodynamic equilibrium show that the specific combination of hydrographs and other physical conditions can cause a different equilibrium state in terms of temporal change of wavelength and migration periods as compared to cases of steady discharge conditions the morphodynamic equilibrium state explained above that is the unchanged wavelength and migration periods under repeated hydrographs appears as a unique feature of the migrating alternate bars under unsteady discharge conditions this is because the steady discharge counterpart cannot achieve such an equilibrium state to understand this equilibrium state in more detail we investigate 1 the role of the hydrograph cycle in determining alternate bar characteristics and 2 the possible range and criteria of the hydrograph cycle to produce morphodynamic equilibrium in certain discharge variations as the hydrograph cycles of 10 and 20 h provide the equilibrium state for a discharge variation of 400 1000 m3 s cycle around 10 and 20 h was selected that is 6 8 12 14 16 18 25 and 30 h hydrograph cycles were used fig 11 shows the results of fft analysis of these cases showing that the hydrograph cycle that is in the range between 10 and 20 h provides an equilibrium state under this equilibrium state the dominant wavelength caused by the 10 12 14 16 18 and 20 h hydrograph cycles are 457 500 539 584 637 and 678 m respectively and the migration periods of these cases are identical to their hydrograph cycles these results suggest that the hydrograph cycle is a dominant factor in determining the morphology of migrating alternate bars that is increasing the hydrograph cycle causes a longer wavelength and migration period conversely the other cases show time dependent morphodynamic features i e dominant wavelength and migration period are highly variable with time fig 12 shows the temporal change of dominant wavelengths of the steady flow cases of 400 and 1000 m3 s and unsteady flow cases of 400 1000 m3 s with hydrograph cycles of 10 12 14 16 and 18 h obtained from the fft analysis here we forcus on a period around 750 h after the alternate bars are fully developed in all cases and morphodynamics equilibrium is reached in the unsteady flow cases notably the dominant wavelength of the hydrograph cycle of 10 h which is the shortest cycle that could provide an equilibrium state is close to the dominant wavelength of the steady discharge condition of 1000 m3 s 450 500 m similarly by increasing the hydrograph cycle from 10 to 18 h and as long as the equilibrium state is satisfied the dominant wavelength approaches that of the steady state discharge condition of 400 m3 s i e 550 700 m these wavelengths of alternate bars caused by the highest and lowest discharge under steady flow conditions appear to be the lower and upper limits of the dominant wavelength of the alternate bars in equilibrium under unsteady conditions respectively furthermore the equilibrium state under the repeated hydrographs is bound by the alternate bar morphodynamics under the steady discharges of the lowest and highest discharge of hydrographs the same is true for the migration period that is the migration period of 1000 m3 s steady case might be an upper limit for unsteady cases with a period of 400 m3 s as the lower limit for example in the case of the 400 1000 m3 s hydrograph we define the migration period of steady flows of 400 m3 s and 1000 m3 s as p400 and p1000 respectively and the migration period of unsteady flow 400 1000 m3 s case as pu fig 13 shows the dominant migration periods of steady flow cases of 400 and 1000 m3 s as well as unsteady flow cases between 400 and 1000 m3 s with hydrograph cycles of 10 20 40 and 80 h the numerical results for the migration period caused by the different hydrograph cycles suggest that the migration period of unsteady flow pu is bounded by p1000 and p400 that is p1000 pu p400 the value range of p400 and p1000 are 25 40 and 7 9 h respectively and the ranges of unsteady flow cases are approximately 10 25 h which roughly satisfies the condition p1000 pu p400 however the temporal change of the dominant migration period is highly dependent on the hydrograph cycle namely the 10 and 20 h hydrograph results in a single equilibrium value conversely the migration periods of the hydrograph cycle for 40 and 80 h varies within the range between p400 and p1000 as pu in the case of a hydrograph cycle of 10 and 20 h appears close to p1000 and p400 this condition might be a boundary that causes the equilibrium state of the alternate bars under unsteady flow conditions because the migration period of alternate bars pu is identical to the hydrograph cycle t in this equilibrium state the condition p 1000 t p 400 might be necessary to achieve this equilibrium state of alternate bars under repeated hydrographs suppose that the discharge change is from a to b and the migration period of steady discharge a and b are defined as p a and p b the equilibrium condition above might be expressed as p b t p a this is a likely criterion of the hydrograph cycle that could lead to the morphodynamic state the physical meaning of this state should be further explored however since p a and p b are related to a representative morphodynamic timescale of sand bar migration this criterion may suggest a relationship between hydrodynamic i e hydrograph cycle and morphodynamic migrating bars timescales particularly the temporal changes of alternate bar characteristics under varying discharge conditions might be key to studying the relationship between morphological change and the hydrograph cycle 3 3 morphodynamics response of alternate bars under abrupt discharge change according to the equations in appendix a the adjustment of bar shape is directly affected by the sediment transport rate qb which is further decided by the shield number τ among the cases of 400 1000 m3 s the difference of shield number τ is decided by the flow velocity v and water depth h since all the conditions except hydrograph cycles are the same under a regular unsteady flow condition v and h are able to change regularly and further form the cyclic change of shield number τ and sediment transport rate qb however the change of sediment discharge will also cause topographic changes and in turn affect local water depth and velocity certainly the formation of this reaction requires a certain time to accumulate and will not take effect immediately which might be the reason why morphodynamics equilibrium state have time limits to explore further we performed a numerical simulation of alternate bars with an abrupt discharge change as it is introduced in the method section the adjustment timescale of bar shape due to the discharge change might be an important factor in understanding the relation between hydrodynamic and morphodynamic timescales fig 14 shows the time space change of elevation variation at the right bank as we showed in fig 4 io addition fig 15 demonstrates the temporal change of the elevation variation at the right bank within a certain time when the discharge is abruptly decreased from 1000 to 400 m3 s and increased from 400 m3 s to 1000 m3 s respectively in the decreasing discharge process the discharge drops at 800 h elevation variation between 797 820 h is shown in fig 15 a in the increasing discharge process the discharge abruptly increase at 840 h elevation variation from 837 860 h is shown in fig 15 b fig 14 shows that the migration speed of alternate bars changes rapidly as the discharge abruptly changes the same phenomenon can be observed in fig 15 which has been marked with a red dotted arrow the migration speed of the alternate bar tops changed rapidly within 3 4 h after the discharge changed fig 15 a shows a discharge reduction from 1000 to 400 m3 s and a subsequent decrease in the bottom of the alternate bars indicated by the green dotted arrow which represents an increasing bar height however unlike the rapid change in the migration speed the change in bar height is a longer process in fig 15 a the decrease in the elevation of the bottom point lasts for 20 h and still maintains a decreasing trend fig 15 b shows a discharge increase from 400 to 1000 m3 s and a subsequent increase in the bottom of the alternate bars indicated by the green dotted arrow which represents a decreasing bar height similarly the migration speed changes rapidly and the change in bar height is a long term process however in fig 15 b the bar height appears to reach an equilibrium state after 6 8 h the elevation variation due to discharge increase is much faster than that when the discharge decreases from 1000 to 400 m3 s the short response time of migration speed indicates simultaneous change of migration speed and discharge in our study the discharge variation is linear and smooth so that the migration speed changes without any lag contributing to the migration pattern shown in fig 4 the migration speed of all alternate bars changes with discharge and eventually maintains an approximate constant of the average velocity contrastingly the longer response time of the bar height suggests that for different discharge changes different time periods are required for the alternate bars to reach the corresponding bar height and wavelength for lower discharge rates a much longer time is required for alternate bars to reach equilibrium state because of low sediment transport capacity the height of alternate bars reaches an equilibrium state quicker for higher discharge rates because the sediment transport capacity is high fig 16 shows the response conditions of bar height and wavelength to a discharge change from 1000 400 m3 s to 400 1000 m3 s the green arrow line represents a 570 m length and is used to measure the wavelength of the alternate bars fig 14 a shows that the wavelength of bars does not change during the discharge dropping process on the contrary in the discharge increasing process shown in fig 16 b different wavelengths appear at 879 h while the wavelengths at 840 and 844 h remain at 570 m furthermore the shape of alternate bars may also change as depicted inside the green dotted circle the results show that the wavelength of alternate remains stable in the discharge dropping process as opposed to the increasing process the wavelength remains the same in both processes until the bar height reaches equilibrium state after the that for the discharge increasing process the wavelength changes as shown at 844 and 879 h this is because after the alternate bars reach a steady discharge pattern it is much easier for the bar to change its wavelength however for the discharge dropping process the response time is much longer the alternate bars cannot reach a steady discharge pattern and the wavelength remains constant for a longer period this difference in response time is caused by the sediment transport rate in lower and higher discharges implying that the higher sediment transport rate makes the adjustment time for the discharge change faster according to the result there are three response stages of the alternate bars to discharge change first is the quick response of the migration speed while bar height changes until the dynamics of alternate bars reach the equilibrium state under given steady discharge level the required time for the alternate bars to reach a steady flow state is dependent on the discharge ranging from 5 h during 400 1000 m3 s to more than 20 h during 1000 400 m3 s after the alternate bars reach the steady flow state their wavelengths might change according to the alternate bar properties the hydrograph cycle that provides the morphodynamics equilibrium state might lie between the two threshold response times that distinguish three response stages explained above the hydrograph cycle should be long enough for the alternate bars to respond to discharge variation but not too long to allow the alternate bars to reach the equilibrium bar height and begin to deform their wavelength as they do in steady flow conditions if the hydrograph cycle is too short the alternate bars can be unstable as the discharge variation of 400 1000 m3 s with 6 h cycle case shows if the hydrograph cycle is too long the alternate bars have enough time to deform in this case the alternate bars have a chance to develop and become unstable or show cyclic behaviors like under steady discharge condition crosato et al 2012 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with field observation and theoretical work our results showed some unique morphodynamics of alternate bars under unsteady discharge conditions alternate bar wavelength and migration dynamics become constant in the long term perspective and this morphodynamic equilibrium leads to a phenomenon that the migration period of alternate bars becomes equal to the hydrograph cycle these findings are based on purely numerical simulation so some of the assumptions and results should be carefully validated using the experimental or field dataset of alternate bar dynamics under similar flow and geographic conditions however the iric nays2dh enables to capture the fundamental physics of alternate bar dynamics under unsteady discharge conditions as shown in appendix a in addition some of the morphodynamic features of alternate bars simulated in this study can be seen in the field studies for example the difference in response time in bar height and wavelength is seen in the long term field observation of church and rice 2009 by using a century scale long term monitoring of point bar dynamics in a gravel bed river church and rice showed that the bar height reaches an equilibrium state much faster than the length and width of bars this is because the vertical movement of sediment is much more limited than the horizontal motion so less constrained horizontal sediment motion causes the further development of planimetric bar shape our focus is migrating alternate bars but the fact above might suggest that simulated dynamics of alternate bars include the nature of alternate bars not purely numerical artifacts it is therefore worth discussing herein the meaning and implication of the present results by comparing some important previous studies of alternate bars below in this study we performed numerical simulations of alternate bar morphodynamics under unsteady discharge conditions focusing on the influence of hydrograph cycles some hydrograph cycles bring the alternate bars to an equilibrium state that gives a constant long term wavelength and migration period in addition the migration period of this state becomes identical to the hydrograph cycle the results suggest that the hydrograph cycle could also be a key factor in river morphodynamics studies on alternate bar morphodynamics under unsteady discharge condition shows that hydrographs with the same discharge variation but differing cycles give rise to different morphodynamic features tubino performed flume experiments on sand bar dynamics under unsteady discharge conditions that is the same discharge with differing hydrograph cycle conditions were evaluated in addition tubino proposed a theoretical framework to predict the bar height and migration speed under different hydrograph cycles the results show that short hydrograph cycles yield lower bar heights compared to that of steady discharge perspective and long hydrograph cycles yield bar heights that are in equilibrium state tubino 1991 watanabe et al also investigated unsteady flow and alternate bar formations with a flume experiment and linear stability analysis and the results also showed that the hydrograph cycle influences the alternate bar morphodynamics such as wavelength and bar height watanabe et al 2002 the findings of the aforementioned two studies might correspond to the timescales of bar dynamics we introduced a short hydrograph cycle might not provide sufficient time for the alternate bars to develop thus resulting in lower bar heights or shorter wavelengths contrastingly a long hydrograph cycle might provide the alternate bars too much time to deform and alternate bars will change their chape significantly fujita and muromoto 1985 nelson and smith 1989 for example the experiments of watanabe et al adopted a long hydrograph compared to the time scale of bar formation such that the morphodynamics of alternate bars is strongly changed within a single hydrograph our result however suggests a constant wavelength or migration periods under unsteady flow conditions i e repeated hydrographs this morphodynamic equilibrium might be achieved under the specific condition that the timescale of hydrodynamics i e hydrograph cycle is similar to the morphodynamic timescale to understand this point we calculate the following unsteadiness parameter u proposed by tubino 1991 4 u σ ϵ α 1 r σ σ b u 0 β β c β c β b d 0 where b half of channel width u 0 d 0 uniform flow velocity and depth of reference base state β β c width depth ratio of reference base state and critical condition σ 1 t in which t hydrograph cycle and α1r linear growth rate of perturbation this unsteadiness parameter is the ratio of the timescale between basic unsteadiness of flow and bar growth it means that u 1 corresponds to much slower bar development than the discharge change so that the alternate bars cannot change their shape corresponding to the discharge change u 1 provides a much faster growth of bars than the hydrograph cycle resulting in the equilibrium state of bars given by the steady discharge condition we calculate this unsteadiness parameter for some hydrograph cycles of 400 1000 m3 s case namely 6 10 20 and 40 h according to the method of tubino the water discharge which corresponds to the reference base state under bed slope channel width and grain size we use can be given approximately as 600 m3 s with the help of figs 3 and 5 of tubino β c and α1r can be read as approximately 9 and 0 001 these parameters convert the hydrograph cycles 6 10 20 and 40 h as u 0 47 0 28 0 14 and 0 07 respectively the longer hydrograph cycle i e 40 h yields small unsteadiness parameters and in this case the bar behavior is like a steady discharge case figs 8 10 the hydrograph cycles which lead non time dependent wavelength and migration periods of alternate bars leads to u o 0 1 it suggests that the timescale of morphodynamics is of a smaller order than the hydrodynamic scales but it is not too small this threshold might be also related to the response of bar height under unsteady flow condition as tubino showed that is u o 0 1 is a transition of bar height response between steady behavior i e u 1 and no response because of extremely short hydrograph i e u 1 see the fig 13 of tubino this result supports our results on the response time of alternate bars although this criterion and its meaning should be revised based on some physical basis this consideration might suggest that a moderately long hydrograph compared to the bar growth scale will be a key factor in achieving this morphodynamic equilibrium under repeated hydrographs 4 2 implication of morphodynamic equilibrium to bank erosion the equilibrium state of migrating alternate bars between steady and unsteady discharge conditions may seem similar in terms of bar dynamics i e constant wavelength and the continuously migrating feature however it might play different roles in the development of other morphodynamic features such as bank erosion and channel meandering to show this we selected the unsteady case of 100 600 m3 s with a hydrograph cycle of 40 h and the steady flow case of 400 m3 s two points a and b on the right bank where a downstream distance is 10 200 m and 10 500 m respectively were selected to evaluate their elevation variation from 700 900 h in both cases the chosen period was sufficiently long to allow for equilibrium bar development and the distance between two points was determined by the half wavelength of alternate bars observed in the unsteady case fig 17 a and b show the elevation variation in unsteady and steady flow cases respectively the elevation variation at the selected two points at the maximum and minimum discharges are marked with dotted lines we found that when discharge reaches the maximum value of 600 m3 s the elevation variation of point a is always positive whereas that of point b is always negative and is almost close to the minimum value this is because the bars migrate downstream exactly one wavelength within one hydrograph under the equilibrium state in this case the morphodynamic changes of fixed points are completely different and are highly dependent on the discharge variations conversely in the steady discharge case the elevation variation at a and b show quite similar pattern the variation appearing in the upstream point a appears in the downstream point b in a similar form as denoted by curvilinear arrows demonstrating that the alternate bars which reached equilibrium shape are migrating downstream the results of the elevation variation shown above indicate completely different migration patterns and riverbed deformations between the steady flow condition and the unsteady flow condition which has reached morphodynamics equilibrium this might cause different morphodynamic features in the context of bank erosion and meandering as follows 1 steady discharge leads to continuous downstream migration of the same alternate bars throughout the channel implying that the riverbed and riverbank experience the same erosion and deposition processes caused by alternate bar migration 2 under an unsteady discharge condition that has reached morphodynamics equilibrium the erosion and deposition at each bank point differ they exhibit their own varying pattern associated with the hydrograph implying that some points might suffer more erosion than others for example the variation of point b in fig 17 a always reaches the minimum value when discharge is at a maximum implying that the point b will always be in an eroded state during the flood period on the contrary the point a may experience the deposition at high discharge and erosion at low discharge implying weaker erosional effect on the river bank than the point b the hydrograph cycle is a key factor controlling this morphodynamic equilibrium making it a vital role in the bank erosion and meandering development visconti et al experimentally showed comparable results above a specific combination of hydrograph shape and migration celerity of bars causes bank erosion at the same point contributing to the maintenance of the pseudo meandering channel visconti et al 2010 however if the specific combination is not met bank erosion occurs evenly in both riverbanks similar to the steady discharge case above resulting in the formation of a braiding channel additionally in the real scale otofuke river which was selected to determine our numerical conditions nagata et al 2014 pointed out the importance of hydrograph shape in amplifying meandering channels caused by significant bank erosion although our numerical setup is quite simple i e identical triangle shape hydrographs are repeated in a straight channel the results have important implications for the morphodynamics of bar and meandering channel development in alluvial rivers 4 3 limitations our computational condition and associated results are limited to continuously migrating alternate bars in a straight channel so that we neglect the interaction between flat bed no bar and multi bar or braided morphodynamics the present results will be applicable for gravel bed rivers with high bed slope in upper river reaches where the bar dynamics is highly active e g adami et al 2016 on the contrary we need to investigate this phenomenon in detail for sand bed rivers as in such cases other factors e g suspended sediment load affect the dynamics of alternate bars the unsteadiness parameter is generally large in sand bed rivers causing slower bar growth than the hydrodynamics bertagni and camporeale 2018 eekhout et al 2013 in addition the reasoning behind this kind of equilibrium state of migrating alternate bars remains unclear under repeated hydrograph conditions these issues need to be investigated for further understanding of the morphodynamics of alternate bars under unsteady discharge conditions the morphodynamic equilibrium under unsteady discharge might be affected by some other factors for example the timescale is related to the sediment transport rate since the migration is strongly controlled by the transport and deposition of sediment it means that some bedload transport formula we use and some parameters used in the bedload transport formula might have some effect on this timescale for example wong and parker 2006 pointed out the overestimation of original meyer peter and muller bedload transport formula that is used in this study it causes higher migration speed of alternate bars so that eventually gives slightly different criteria for equilibrium state of alternate bar dynamics under unsteady discharge conditions since the process of bedload and estimation of bedload transport rate includes high uncertainties especially for graded sediment bed recking 2010 it will be worth to investigate how such uncertainties affect the presented results the sequence of hydrograph in the present computation is a repetition of simple triangle shape hydrograph however the real hydrologic regime gives complex combination of different peak discharge flood duration and hydrograph shape all these factors control the alternate bar dynamics in real system for this issue carlin et al 2021 combine a flow duration curve that expresses the long term discharge variations as a probabilistic way and the alternate bar properties obtained by linear and nonlinear stability analysis to understand long term equilibrium state of alternate bars in their study the stability analysis is performed under steady discharge condition and the effect of individual flood event is neglected our result however shows that the hydrograph cycle has a strong effect on the alternate properties and dynamics so that the discharge unsteadiness and individual flood event might need to be taken into account to understand full understanding of long term behaviors of alternate bars this issue should be further investigated in future in addition to the hydrograph characteristics upstream sediment supply condition will be an important factor controlling the alternate bar dynamics and morphodynamic equilibrium shown in this study generally in the gravel bed rivers strong diffusive effect on the morphodynamics process in bedload dominated condition causes the limited effect of upstream bedload supply on the downstream reaches and such effect is only seen in upstream limited reach so called hydrograph boundary layer hbl blom et al 2017 wong and parker 2006 we showed that the concept of hbl is applicable to dynamics of two dimensional river morphology like alternate bars in uniform sediment bed dai et al 2021 so that the sediment supply condition will have small effect on the morphodynamics of alternate bars presented in this study on the other hand in the graded sediment bed an et al an et al 2017 pointed out a breakdown of hbl and migration of low amplitude bedload sheet beyond hbl showing possible effect of upstream sediment supply condition on the downstream morphology since the alternate bar dynamics in graded sediment bed is unstable than the uniform case takebayashi and egashira 2008 the sediment supply might have important role in our findings it will be important future challenges to understand the effect of graded sediment and upstream sediment supply on the morphodynamic equilibrium of alternate bars under unsteady discharge condition 5 conclusions in this study we numerically investigated the morphodynamics of alternate bars under unsteady flow conditions particularly the morphodynamics of migrating alternate bars subjected to repeated simple triangle hydrographs was simulated using a two dimensional morphodynamic model iric nays2dh to understand long term behaviors of alternate bars under unsteady discharge conditions we found that the morphodynamics of alternate bars under a specific combination of discharge variation and hydrograph cycle reached an equilibrium state that is the wavelength and migration period of alternate bars remained constant and the migration period was the same as the hydrograph cycle this might be a unique morphodynamic feature of alternate bars under unsteady conditions because the steady discharge counterparts demonstrated a dynamic equilibrium state with slightly time dependent features of the wavelength and migration period but did not exhibit non time dependent features when morphodynamic equilibrium was reached the hydrograph cycle was the dominant factor for alternate bar characteristics if this morphodynamic state was achieved the wavelength of alternate bars increased with the hydrograph cycle and the migration period was always identical to the hydrograph cycle the hydrograph cycle that corresponds to this equilibrium state can be determined from the relation between hydrodynamic and bar growth timescales under a short hydrograph the bar growth occurred much slower than the discharge changes so that the bars cannot respond to the discharge variation meanwhile the long hydrograph provided sufficient time for the deformation and development of alternate bars causing a significant change in bar characteristics e g wavelength within one hydrograph such as steady discharge condition the hydrograph cycle that achieves this equilibrium state must be moderately long so that the timescale of the hydrograph is similar but slightly smaller than the bar growth timescale but not too small to allow equilibrium bar behaviors caused by steady discharge conditions as the morphodynamic equilibrium of alternate bars under repeated unsteady discharge hydrographdiffers from a dynamic equilibrium state provided by the steady discharge analysis the findings of this study will shed some light on the alternate bar dynamics and related channel scale morphodynamics such as a river meandering under long term unsteady discharge however the discussion in this paper is still limited because for example physical mechanisms of this equilibrium state and applicability of other river and hydraulic conditions remain unsolved further research is of immense importance in contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the long term processes involved in migrating alternate bars under unsteady discharge conditions

many types of morphodynamic phenomena shimizu et al 2020 although the details of the model concept and formulation have been described in previous studies e g iwasaki et al 2016 we briefly introduce

coefficient eq a 1 is the continuity equation eqs a 2 and a 3 are the momentum equations in y and x direction respectively these equations are two dimensional unsteady shallow water flow equation and we use manning s roughness formula for evaluating the bed shear stress eq a 4 is the continuity equation of sediment eqs a 5 and a 6 are the local streamwise and transverse bed load transport equations this assumes that mode of sediment transport is a bedload of uniform sediment and bedload transport is evaluated as an equilibrium value which corresponds to the local flow parameters the governing equations above namely a combination of shallow flow model and equilibrium bedload transport model with the secondary flow and local slope effect has been well known morphodynamic model for simulating alternate bar dynamics the linear and nonlinear stability analysis have shown that the model above is capable of simulating formation development and equilibrium state of alternate bars colombini et al 1987 some key physics is described for example by redolfi 2021 the shallow flow hydrodynamics destabilizes the initial flat bed for generating free bars and the transverse local slope second term of the right hand side of eq a 6 has stabilizing effect on the morphodynamics achieving the finite wavelength of the free bars the effect of secondary flow on the bedload transport direction i e first term of the right hand side of eq a 6 more generally the effect of three dimensional hydrodynamics is not necessary to be included for formation of alternate bars tubino et al 1999 but has some important roles in the bar dynamics in non linear level e g bar height iwasaki et al 2016 it suggests in general that iric nays2dh model has a reasonable ability to capture the formation and development of alternate bars more specifically for current study the model performance for simulating sand bars has been valid for example alternate and multiple row bar formation with erodible bank under steady condition has been reproduced by jang and shimizu also kobayashi et al 2006 applied this type of model to flume experiments regarding sand bar behavior under unsteady discharge condition performed by watanabe and kawamura 2005 the numerical result shows general agreement with the experimental result i e the temporal change of bar wavelength and bar height due to discharge change in addition to these efforts we herein apply the iric nays2dh to the laboratory experiments of alternate bar formation under repeated hydrograph which is similar to our present numerical experiments the experiment is performed in 42 m long and 0 9 m wide straight channel at civil engineering research institute for cold regions hokkaido japan a well sorted sand of which the mean diameter is 0 76 mm is used for material of bed and supplied sediment the sand supply rate from the upstream end is equilibrium transport rate which does not cause bed aggradation and degradation at the upstream end the longitudinal slope of initial bed is 0 005 and the bed surface is set to be flat the simple triangle shape hydrograph such as we used in this paper is adopted highest and lowest discharges are 8 and 4 l s and hydrograph cycle is set to 2 h the duration of rising and falling stages of discharge is identical i e 1 hour for each stage and the discharge is linearly changed in time between highest and lowest discharges this simple hydrograph is obtained 6 times in total but firstly 3 hydrographs are given to the initial bed for formation of sand bars after a time interval for a few days to measure the bed surface in dry condition using a 3d laser scanner later 3 hydrographs are obtained to bar developed bed in entire experiment the sand bar behavior at the reach between 17 and 35 m from the upstream end is recorded by three digital cameras from the top of the channel with the time interval of 2 min using the photographs taken from the top of channel we identify the location of migrating alternate bars to capture the migration pattern of the bars also the bathymetric data taken after 3 and 6 hydrographs is available to understand spatial orientation of the alternate bar geometry the computational conditions are set based on the experimental condition the manning s roughness coefficient is set to 0 0145 which is equivalent to the grain size roughness determined by manning strickler type model to reproduce the uniform water depth at the initial state the sediment is treated as a uniform sediment of the diameter of 0 76 mm the grid sizes for streamwise and transverse directions are 0 1 and 0 045 m respectively for the transverse bedload formula i e eq a 6 the static and dynamic friction coefficient of sediment μs and μk are given as 0 7 that corresponds to 35 degree of angle of repose and engelund type secondary flow model engelund 1974 is applied main difference between the experimental and computational conditions is channel length and number of hydrographs we obtain in general time necessary for bar development in the numerical simulation is longer than the experiments maybe because of the difference in degree of the perturbation in same way it takes longer distance to ensure the formation and development of sand bars more specifically in the experiment the bars start developing within first hydrograph at a few meters downstream from the upstream end on the other hand in the numerical simulation the bars start emerges almost at the end of 2nd hydrographs at the 20 m downstream from the upstream end by considering these spin up time and distance for the system nelson and smith 1989 we use 80 m length channel and give 8 hydrographs for the computation it also means that the computational result during first 2 hydrographs and in 21 m upstream reach in the computation are not used for the comparison fig a1 shows the geometry of sand bars in the experiment and numerical simulation after three and six hydrographs as the experimental result shows the multiple row bars form at the upstream reach and its change their characteristics to alternate bars downstream reach because of the multiple hydrographs we obtained the wavelength of alternate bars slightly increases in time this figure clearly demonstrates that the numerical model is able to capture such morphodynamic trend observed in the experiments fig a2 compares the migration pattern of the alternate bars in the experiment and numerical simulations in the experiment we identify the location of bar front near the right wall of the channel from the photographs taken on the other hand numerical results show the pattern of erosion and deposition of bed at the right bank as we show in the main part of the paper as well this result suggests that the model slightly underpredicts the observed migration velocity of alternate bars but generally this result shows good agreement with the experimental data in addition to this fig a3 shows the model performance in terms of temporal change of average wavelength and waveheight of alternate bars we identify the wavelength as the same way in the fig a2 and waveheight is defined as the difference between maximum and minimum bed elevation within a single bar unit there are only two data point for observed waveheight since detailed measurement of bathymetry is available at t 360 and 720 min this figure also suggests that the model slightly overpredict the wavelength but overall the numerical result shows a good agreement with the experimental results field scale validation of the model performance for this study is difficult issue since there might not be sufficient field dataset available for alternate bar morphodynamics under repeated hydrographs in a straight channel instead the iric nays2dh generally captures the sand bar development and associated meandering development caused by large flood event in a field scale river the otofuke river japan which is also used as a modelled river in this study iwasaki et al 2016 kyuka et al 2020 in addition to such previous works the general features of alternate bars simulated in this study agree with the bed and channel characteristics in the field fig a4 demonstrates the morphodynamic changes of the upper otofuke river japan showing that the dominant river morphology is alternate bars and associated meandering development two large floods took place at 7th sep 2011 and the end of aug 2016 causing great changes of sand bars and channel pattern at fig a4 b c and a4 c d respectively the resultant characteristics i e wavelength of the alternate bars and meandering in this figure can be in the range from 500 to 800 m which is consistent with the characteristics of alternate bars formed under even simplified discharge condition in this study it should be noted that since the bars are highly vegetated in this river reach causing slowdown of migration speed of bars or even non migrating bars e g serlet et al 2018 the migration pattern cannot be directly compared with non vegetated bars in our study in addition the significant bank erosion widens channel greatly on the other hand in this study we assume that the channel is a constant width with non erosible side banks in spite of these limitations the numerical model generally captures the morphodynamics of alternate bars of the target river reach the results above might suggest that the iric nays2dh model is a potential tool to pursue the alternate bar dynamics under unsteady discharge condition as we perform in this study it is worth noting that although the present experiment will be relevant for the validation data of this study the model needs to be carefully validated further especially from long term perspectives it means that experimental studies focusing on the morphodynamic behaviors of alternate bars under many repeated hydrographs will be of great interest in addition to this the field scale observation of alternate bar behaviors in detail will be surely necessary to understand the effect of unsteady discharge on the alternate bar dynamics for long term and further validation of the morphodynamic model appendix b sensitivity test to numerical mesh size the mesh size is an important parameter for hydraulics numerical simulations a hydrograph condition may lead to different results according to the mesh size horritt et al 2006 performed a same flow simulation under different size of mesh showing different errors especially modelling a large magnitude event in this study an unsteady flow condition is given though the morphodynamic equilibrium state is observed there is still possibility that mesh size will influence the results the mesh size used in this study is 70 m 10 m and we decrease the length and width to only half of them to 35 m 5 m to test the sensitivity meanwhile unsteady flow cases of 400 1000 m3 s with the hydrograph cycles of 10 20 and 40 h were tested here to confirm whether the grid resolution could change the morphodynamic features of the alternate bars we simulated because more grids will consume a lot of extra computing time for the 10 h case we reduce the process to 1000 h fig b1 shows the fft analysis of the results compared fig b1 to fig 8 and fig b2 to fig 9 it is clearly shown that in every flow condition under 35 m 5 m mesh size alternate bars will still show the same morphodynamics properties morphodynamic equilibrium 10 h morphodynamic equilibrium under critical state 20 h and alternate bars under general state 40 h fig b1 a b and fig b2 a b show the dominant wavelengths and constant migration periods though fig b1 c show a similar dominant wavelength it is worth to noticed that migration period in fig b1 c is not 40 h and that does not satisfy our definition for morphodynamics equilibrium state however it is noticed that the dominant wavelengths in fig b1 decrease about 20 m in each case which is 3 5 of the wavelength indicating that mesh size will slightly influence the alternate bars properties but still it can be confirmed that the mesh size doesn t influence the morphodynamics equilibrium states which is the main finding of this study 
29,for multi phase flow through multi scale heterogeneous porous media such as the pore space of rocks the interaction between multiple immiscible fluids and an intricate network of pores creates a wide range of dynamic flow phenomena at larger scales i e scales relevant for practical applications such as carbon sequestration this interplay of dynamic phenomena is often referred to as complexity

configurations and displacement mechanisms from this practical models can be used to upscale these pore scale dynamics to the relevant for applications of interest darcy scale muskat 1938 bear 1988 for example lenormand identified 4 distinct elementary displacement mechanisms in micromodel experiments lenormand et al 1983 these mechanisms are still used in quasi static pore network modelling to upscale flow joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 blunt 2017 blunt et al 2002 however there are many dynamic phenomena which are not captured by these 4 mechanisms such as the impact of inertial forces ferrari and lunati 2014 and the existence of ganglion dynamics and intermittently connecting flow pathways during capillary dominated flow avraam and payatakes 1995 rücker et al 2015 schlüter et al 2016 reynolds et al 2017 spurin et al 2019a with a wide range of flow phenomena observed and observed to also co exist rücker et al 2015 spurin et al 2019b the prediction of large scale multi phase flow is difficult to derive from pore scale observations as a result there has been a lot of interest regarding the up scaling of pore scale observations sharmin et al 2020 steefel et al 2013 jackson and krevor 2022 one avenue uses statistical physics and thermodynamics to address the behaviour of these complex systems where the pore scale configurations are regarded as many internal degrees of freedom hansen et al 2022 hassanizadeh and gray 1993a gray and miller 2014 this requires 1 the macroscopic state variables of the system to be identified and 2 the dynamics of the system to be quantified it has been shown that for multi phase flow in porous media the capillary state function can be represented by the 4 minkowski functionals which are 1 volume 2 interfacial area 3 mean curvature and 4 the gaussian curvature mcclure et al 2018 hadwiger 1957 herring et al 2013 the 4 minkowski functionals represent a complete set of macroscopic state variables however progress is needed to link these state variables to the dynamics of the system this is because the link between fluid phase pressure difference and mean curvature the 3 rd minkowski functional is only valid for static or quasi static fluid fluid interfaces which is not the case during flow mcclure et al 2020 and a fundamental link between transport and topology is currently lacking furthermore flow dynamics consists of fluid flow within individual phases and the displacement of one fluid by the other fluid fluid displacements are often non linear involve inertial forces in addition to viscous and capillary forces ferrari and lunati 2014 and change the fluid topology i e the state of the system schlüter et al 2016 these changes occur over a range of length scales from the scale of individual pores to fluid clusters over 4 orders of magnitude larger blunt 2017 fluid fluid displacements such as ganglion dynamics or intermittently connecting flow pathways avraam and payatakes 1995 rücker et al 2015 spurin et al 2019a rücker et al 2021 gao et al 2017 2019 menke et al 2022 create highly complex spatio temporal dynamics with an associated range of relaxation times from seconds armstrong et al 2014 to hours schlüter et al 2017 unless we are able to predict the topological changes caused by these flow regimes and its associated macroscopic averages it is difficult to advance the description level from the state function to transport equations and to make a connection between pore scale and darcy scale dynamic phenomena the current formulation of darcy scale multi phase transport is a phenomenological extension of darcy s law darcy 1856 there are a number of extensions that capture some of the state variables such as interfacial area hassanizadeh and gray 1993b and also extensions that honour the connection between relative permeability and fluid topology liu et al 2017 khorsandi et al 2017 however a rigorous derivation of the geometric state function for dynamic phenomena is currently lacking in this work we expand on the idea presented in rücker et al 2021 that fluctuations in pressure and saturation are instability modes where the unstable mode provides at the same pressure drop a higher total flux the remaining challenge is to understand the origin and structure of the fluctuations and predict the fluctuation spectrum we explore this using dynamic mode decomposition dmd we show that dmd can successfully decompose the signal from pore scale experiments and provide deeper insights into the cause and impact of fluctuations for multi phase flow in porous media 2 dynamic mode decomposition dmd dmd has been largely developed in the domain of fluid mechanics schmid 2010 and applied for instance to problems such as turbulence sharma et al 2016 however so far no application to flow in porous media has been reported therefore in the following a detailed introduction to dmd is given addressing in particular the porous media community 2 1 an introduction to dmd dmd is a data driven i e equation free approach for the analysis of experimental or numerical data kutz et al 2016a arabi and mezić 2017 dmd can be considered as a model reduction algorithm but it is actually a way of decomposing dynamic data into individual modes while making no assumption about the underlying system kutz et al 2016a while dmd was originally introduced for data analysis and interpretation in fluid dynamics schmid 2010 it has since been applied in many other areas including video processing bi et al 2018 epidemiology bistrian et al 2019 and financial trading mann and kutz 2016 thus it is a very general method for the analysis of dynamic systems schmid 2022 kutz et al 2016b in the original application of fluid dynamics dmd was designed to extract information from flow fields either calculated by computer simulation or experimentally measured schmid 2010 mezić 2013 in fig 1 a high level overview of the functioning and purpose of dmd for a fluid dynamics application is shown the data is organized into matrices x and x with the latter being x shifted one time step into the future a is the linear fit operator that fits x to x thus x is the inverse of the matrix x in this case the moore penrose pseudo inverse kutz et al 2016b the aim of dmd is to represent the system dynamics with a series of extracted modes that have significantly fewer degrees of freedom this allows a more intuitive description of the underlying physical mechanisms contained in the data sequence an important aspect is the description of the dynamics within a spatial framework with an assessment of which dynamics influence flow properties the most the decomposition of the data into modes and their respective dynamics can then be used to make predictions about future states kutz et al 2016a this is because the dmd eigenvalues the end result of the dmd as shown in fig 1 characterize the relaxation dynamics and rate of energy dissipation this provides insight into how susceptible a system is to future perturbations wolf et al 1985 cessac et al 2001 goldhirsch et al 1987 there is the potential for the energy dissipation to be linked to relative permeability in future research of particular interest for the relative permeability is to identify the timescale for which the system dynamics are stationary mcclure et al 2022a in this paper we will demonstrate that dmd is able to distinguish stationary modes from those that are relaxing and also to determine their relative importance based on the inferred dominance structure furthermore because dmd assimilates both spatial and temporal information it provides a quantitative mechanism to understand the links between spatial heterogeneity and transient responses further details on the principals of dmd applied in the code accompanying this manuscript are provided in the supplementary material 2 2 connection between dmd and discrete fourier transform the discrete fourier transform dft is a useful tool for analysing time dependent data such as dynamic multi phase flow a dft transforms time dependent data such as in matrix x in fig 1 into the frequency domain 1 x ˆ k n 0 n 1 x n e i 2 π n k n in comparison dmd eigenvalues are of the form 2 λ n r n e i 2 π f n characterized by a frequency f n and a magnitude r n which form a complex frequency krake et al 2021b dft are broadly useful for analysing time series data whereas dmd can be applied to time and space data for eigenvalues that are located on the unit cycle the dmd modes take the form of travelling wave solutions sharma et al 2016 for general eigenvalues the dmd eigenvalues contain more features of the dynamics such as periodicity damping or growth dmd thereby provides a mechanism to analyse image based time series data that includes both spatial and temporal information the challenge is to identify the relevant dmd components this is more complicated than in a dft because in dmd the interplay of eigenvalues modes and amplitudes need to be taken into account krake et al 2021b respective strategies to visualize the dominance structure are discussed in krake et al 2021b 2 3 dmd eigenmodes and the koopman operator for multi scale non linear systems such as flow in porous media the evolution of the system can be described using a linear transformation called the koopman operator koopman 1931a koopman and van neumann 1932 arabi and mezić 2017 dmd can under certain conditions approximate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the infinite dimensional koopman operator with finite dimensions leading to non linear dynamics being described by a finite linear transform kutz et al 2016a arabi and mezić 2017 sharma et al 2016 the koopman operator represents the evolution via a set of discrete eigenvalues that correspond to stable and unstable modes and their rate of growth or decay the advantage is that the state space the space in which the system exists is now represented in the observable space the space in which variables can be measured for example for a particle moving in a 2d system the state space is the x and y location of the particle and its velocity the observable space may only be the x location if this is the only quantity that can be measured in traditional fluid dynamic studies following the system dynamics via its trajectories in state space an infinite number of dimensions exist a visual description of the koopman operator is shown in fig 2 with a complete mathematical description provided in the supplementary material essentially if we have a dynamic system with state x that is defined by a function f x we can compute the state x at a later time t giving us f t x in fig 2 the koopman operator assigns a new function g to the function f such that g x describes the evolution of the function f over time this gives us the linear koopman operator u t x the koopman operator has several advantages over classical spectral analysis for example it is discrete and allows the construction of non parametric predictors state estimators and non linear controllers using linear systems strategies arabi and mezić 2017 the koopman operator can be approximated with finite dimensions using dmd kutz et al 2016a arabi and mezić 2017 sharma et al 2016 mezić 2013 it thus allows the description of non linear dynamics by a finite dimensional dmd and with an associated physical meaning as it is a data driven approach williams et al 2015 2 4 dmd applied to analysing experimental data of multi phase flow through porous media the connection between dmd eigenmodes and topological properties suggests dmd could be utilized to extract topology and characteristic time from complex signals küster and weich 2020 complex signal are typical for multi phase flow through porous media due to the interaction of multiple fluids with a highly heterogeneous pore space leading to a range of fluid flow phenomena such as ganglion dynamics fluid front instabilities and intermittent flow pathways rücker et al 2015 spurin et al 2019a b 2020 2021 reynolds et al 2017 gao et al 2020 rücker et al 2021 dmd is also an equation free method applicable to stochastic statistical dynamical systems kutz et al 2016a chekroun et al 2020 this further emphasizes its use in analysing data sets such as fluctuations observed during two phase flow in porous media to understand how well dmd can reproduce the data and the extent it improves our understanding of complex two phase flow dynamics we take two data sets both data sets display complex spatio temporal dynamics that become constant when averaged in space and time note that at the darcy scale these flow regimes are historically referred to as steady state johnson et al 1959 anderson 1987 berg et al 2016 alhosani et al 2021 rücker et al 2021 however the term stationary might be more appropriate for these experiments where there are changes in space and time because for stationary processes a linear response in the constitutive relationship between phase flux and pressure drop is observed mcclure et al 2022a in this work we will continue using standard terminology i e describing the experiments as steady state the first data set referred to as case 1 has a fluid front instability rücker et al 2021 when looking at the saturation data in space and time there are clear waves as the front advances shown in fig 3a and c this is useful for understanding how well dmd reconstructs data as it is a clear indicator to the quality of the reconstruction we can then pick the modes associated with the largest magnitude eigenvalues and assess how many modes are required to reconstruct the data the other data set referred to as case 2 investigates intermittent flow pathways spurin et al 2021 as the capillary number increases the amount of intermittent flow pathways increases leading to complex dynamics caused by multiple connection and disconnection events occurring at the same time however in this data set at the lowest capillary number there is a unique configuration where one pore controls connection across the pore space in the middle of the core this singular pore periodically disconnects and reconnects heavily influencing the pressure and saturation data to observe this in the dmd would be further evidence on how well dmd can represent the data but to then decompose the data from the higher capillary number experiments will allow us to ascertain if dmd can pick up dynamics that cannot be observed easily in the saturation or pressure data alone 3 results and discussion 3 1 the reproduction of dynamic flow features using dmd the first data set comprises of steady state two phase flow experiments where oil and brine were injected simultaneously into a cylindrical sandstone sample with a diameter of 2 54 cm and a length of 4 45 cm at different fractional flows the full experimental procedure is discussed in rücker et al 2021 x ray imaging was used to obtain the saturation profile across the core at steady state steady state was determined by the pressure drop measured across the sample at steady state there are still fluctuations in the pressure and saturation data as shown in fig 3b and d but when averaged in time the pressure and saturation both remain constant the water saturation in these experiments had a peak that moved across the rock sample at a constant velocity this formed a travelling wave shown by the red streaks indicating a higher saturation in fig 3a and c the nature of the travelling wave front changed depending on the fractional flow i e the slope of the streak changes between fig 3a and c this distinctive feature allows us to qualitatively assess the reconstruction power of dmd the dmd of saturation data gives 24 eigenvalues with the 8 largest eigenvalues highlighted in fig 4 eigenvalues outside the unit circle are growing those on the unit circle are stable and those inside the unit circle are decaying the eigenvalues are plotted in space and time as the respective modes and dynamics of the flow some are purely real e g 0 and 1 these relate to static or non oscillatory distributions whose associated modes do not evolve in time krake et al 2021b some are reflected in the x axis e g 2 is a reflection about the x axis of 3 these have the same mode and dynamic and overlay each other entirely in fig 4b and c overall there is a wealth of dynamics in the dmd that should correspond to flow dynamics the superposition of all the modes and dynamics should in principle recreate the data set input into the dmd as long as the dmd has a long enough time series as an input taking all modes and dynamics the dmd is capable of reconstructing the initial data shown in fig 5b when the modes are reconstructed separately they represent different parts of the flow regime highlighted in fig 6 the question is how many modes and their corresponding dynamics are required to reconstruct the data sufficiently and represent the larger scale flow properties we take the first 4 modes and 4 dynamics shown in fig 4 and reconstruct the data set shown in fig 5c this is sufficient to recreate the travelling wave front in fig 5a overall dmd is capable of preserving the flow signal so that it can be reconstructed not all modes and dynamics are needed to preserve the large scale flow features the number of modes and dynamics required to reconstruct the data could reflect the complexity of the dynamics and the extent of the interaction between fluids however a measure to how well a signal has been reconstructed is easier to deduce when there are clear periodic instabilities such is the case in this example 3 2 identifying the control of localized heterogeneity on flow dynamics using dmd recently a wealth of dynamics has been observed in steady state fluid flow due to the interaction of multiple fluids through the heterogeneous network of pores in rocks rücker et al 2021 reynolds et al 2017 spurin et al 2020 2021 gao et al 2017 the dynamics are difficult to unravel due to the heterogeneity of the porous medium and the non local nature of the dynamics spurin et al 2021 we want to observe if dmd can provide a deeper insight into these dynamics to explore this we examine a series of two phase steady state experiments where nitrogen and brine were simultaneously injected into a cylindrical carbonate sample with a diameter of 21 mm and a length of 5 mm at a fractional flow of 0 85 with the total flow rate increased from 0 1 ml min to 0 7 ml min the images were acquired over a period of 1s with the full experimental procedure discussed in spurin et al 2021 this example is useful for this analysis because at the lowest flow rate capillary number the flow is channelled through a single pore that intermittently connects and disconnects this created a strong periodic pressure signal something that is translated although not simply into the saturation across the sample as shown in fig 7 both the pressure and the saturation fluctuated about a mean value with this mean remaining constant during steady state as the flow rate increased the gas distribution became more evenly distributed across the sample there are more intermittent dynamics at these higher flow rates and this combined with the non local nature of the signal creates a more complicated pressure signal fig 7e and f it is then harder to correlate specific events in the pore space to pressure fluctuations across the core the dmd of the lowest capillary number shows modes with a node at the middle of the sample which is where the one pore constriction occurs this region is highlighted for the higher flow rate experiments in fig 8 for the middle flow rate there is still a divide in the modes downstream of the constriction compared to upstream for the highest flow rate multiple modes peak in the location of the highly heterogeneous zone this middle section of the core is highly heterogeneous which causes the channelling of the flow during the lowest flow rate observation this section still has a large influence on dynamics even when energy dissipation from intermittent pathway flow becomes more dispersed as shown by the dmd overall dmd provides a way to assess fluctuations in data sets that are not periodic and therefore difficult to spot with the naked eye furthermore it allows 4d dynamics to be explored in a series of 2d images which are easier to produce and are easier to quantify than 3d videos 4d dynamics 3 3 sampling intervals and their impact on dmd temporal resolution is typically a restraining factor when conducting multi phase flow experiments gao et al 2021 spurin et al 2020 the experiments used in this work were conducted at synchrotron facilities where high energy x rays are generated these cannot be achieved in traditional laboratory based experiments to assess the universality of dmd on the experimental data currently in the domain we must ascertain and the sampling interval required for the dmd to accurately represent the flow properties we vary the sampling interval for the case 2 lowest capillary number experiment from 2 s to 64 s in fig 9 the node in the modes is visible for every sampling up to 32 s fig 9e recording the dynamics every 64 s does not provide enough data to capture the node in the dynamics in the middle of the sample this suggests that rapid imaging is required to observe the relevant flow dynamics and typical laboratory based x ray scanners which take on the order of tens of minutes are an order of magnitude too slow to capture the relevant dynamics 3 4 can dmd saturation results be linked to red noise observed in the pressure data as shown in fig 9 the number of modes decreases as the sampling time increases this means that there are modes with shorter timescales and modes with longer timescales in recent work exploring fluctuations in pressure data red noise was observed spurin et al 2022 standnes et al 2022 this observation implies a cascade of timescales with the longer timescales correlating to larger events we explore how the nature of the eigenvalues changes as the sampling interval increases for the lowest capillary number experiment in case 2 fig 7a the eigenvalues for this experiment are plotted in fig 10 the black circle denotes the unit circle i e a magnitude of 1 all eigenvalues are stable so lie within the unit circle eigenvectors with magnitudes of 95 of the unit circle are classified as periodic eigenvalues with magnitudes outside this that are not on the unit circle are associated with non periodic eigenvectors and their modes are either decaying or growing no eigenvalues lie outside the unit circle therefore no modes are growing the number of periodic eigenvalues decreases as the sampling interval increases the number of eigenvalues decreases disproportionately affecting the periodic eigenvalues but eigenvalues that would have previously been considered periodic become non periodic with a longer sampling interval this is clearest between fig 10e and f where non periodic solutions appear where there was no periodic solution before a summary of all the eigenvalues relationship with the sampling time for all capillary numbers is shown in fig 11 for all cases the periodic eigenvalues decay quicker than the non periodic eigenvalues shown in the top panel the total number of eigenvalues decays along with their magnitude in the middle and bottom panels respectively the slope for the lines of best fit varies slightly between capillary numbers but with no obvious trend as some eigenvalues change from being periodic to non periodic it is difficult to track a specific mode in time and observe what it does this is something that could be of interest in future work 4 conclusions in this work we show that dynamic mode decomposition dmd is a useful tool for analysing the flow dynamics for multi phase flow in porous media it provides the information of a 4d signal as a series of 2d panels which are easier to interpret quantitatively and easier to produce than 3d videos of the dynamics the fluctuations shown in saturation data can be extracted from the dmd eigenvalues we show that the associated modes and dynamics from the output can be used to reconstruct the input data more so not all modes and dynamics are required to successfully reconstruct the large scale features thus dmd could be used as a tool for understanding which dynamics are important for larger scale flow properties and could be useful in upscaling attempts we observed that dmd can successfully highlight regions controlling flow and provide insight into the flow dynamics when the number of fluctuations amount of dynamics makes it difficult to qualitatively describe flow future work will explore if saturation dmd could be linked with fluctuations in pressure data there is the potential to link the dmd analysis with a fourier analysis or power spectra analysis dmd could potentially be used to process large amounts of 4d data which is typical for synchrotron imaging of flow in porous media the dmd analysis could be expanded to have the raw projections as the input from this the dominant modes and their timescales could be extracted and this could be used to find the correct reconstruction parameters this could also be paired with machine learning to provide an efficient and robust way to process 4d data credit authorship contribution statement catherine spurin conceptualization investigation

appendix supplementary material a 1 the mathematical principles of dmd dmd computes from a time series of data the underlying modes and their respective dynamics such as oscillatory behaviour growth or decay from the eigenvalues of the composition or koopman operator sharma et al 2016 arabi and mezić 2017 the data is generally available in form of a time sequence of snapshots 3 v 1 n v 1 v 2 v n where v i r m is the i th snapshot in the time sequence and v i n r m x n is the data in matrix representation where the columns contain the individual snapshots each containing m spatial points and n is the number of snapshots the dynamics are assumed to be linear which implies that consecutive snapshots v i are related to each other via a linear relationship 4 v i 1 a v i the assumption of a

composition computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a for the practical calculation of the eigenvalues of a several different methods are available where singular value decomposition of a is a central element there are several different dmd approaches which have specific advantages and disadvantages kutz et al 2016a the singular value decomposition svd approach has the advantage that noise in the data can be removed by truncating the svd of v 1 n 1 furthermore there are many different types of dmd and such as optimized dmd optimal mode decomposition exact dmd multi resolution dmd dmd with control etc which have specific strengths such as multi resolution dmd for data sets that contain spatial structure at multiple length scales in this work dmd is performed with pydmd demo et al 2018 which has several methods here we use regular dmd for the space time saturation data the code for the analysis is provided with this paper the code can be run on a standard laptop or desktop computer and takes on the order of a few minutes to run a 2 the mathematical basis for the koopman operator the koopman operator was developed in 1931 to provide an alternative way to represent the behaviour of dynamical systems that obey hamiltonian mechanics koopman 1931b the original work is famous for casting classical mechanics into a form that very much resembles schrödinger s equation from quantum mechanics 6 i f t g ˆ f in this equation f is a probability distribution that evolves according to the liouville equation and g ˆ is a hermitian operator physical observables such as the density and momentum are conserved invariants that can be determined directly from f and eq 6 provides a way to determine their evolution while relevant classes of system are broad it has historically been more convenient to focus on particular representations e g the navier stokes equations when pursuing research into particular applications e g fluid flow however in the context of more recent data driven computational paradigms the koopman representation is advantageous due to its generality based on the notion that it may be possible to learn the form of an otherwise unknown operator from data brunton et al 2021 here we consider a typical situation arising in fluid mechanics the flow field u is physical observable that can be derived from the system state as represented by the probability distribution f if we define g as a complex function on the flow field u then g u produces a complex number for each value of u which becomes then an observable that is entirely determined from the evolution of the probability distribution f due to eq 6 it can be shown that the koopman operator describes the time evolution of this observable viscardy 2006 the koopman operator u at time τ denoted u τ maps the function g u x t to a new time t τ via 7 g u x t τ u τ g u x t g τ u x t the koopman operator is linear and therefore its spectrum and eigenfunctions provide an intuitive description of the system dynamics the eigenfunctions of the koopman operator ϕ j with eigenvalues λ j follow 8 ϕ τ u u τ ϕ j u e λ j τ ϕ j u for periodic oscillatory phenomena the eigenvalues are 9 λ j i ω j ω j r which establishes a connection between the koopman eigenvalues and the frequency spectrum observables can now be expressed through linear combinations of the eigenfunctions 10 g u j 1 g j ϕ j u where the scalar coefficients g j are defined by the projection of the observable g on the koopman eigenfunction ϕ j using eq 7 the time evolution of the observable g can be expressed in terms of the koopman eigenfunctions 11 g τ u u τ g u j 1 g j ϕ j u e i ω j τ the same principle holds also for vector observables g 12 g τ u u τ g u j 1 g j ϕ j u e i ω j τ where g j denotes the components of the observable g obtained by projection on the koopman eigenfunction ϕ j arabi and mezić 2017 the respective decomposition of observables into koopman eigenfunctions is termed koopman mode decomposition kmd arabi and mezić 2017 the koopman modes g j are each associated with an eigenvalue λ j for in this case λ j i ω j i e with koopman frequency ω j effectively the time evolution of g is a linear combination of koopman modes with oscillating coefficients note that since the expansion in eq 12 is infinite dimensional it can also describe non linear time evolution arabi and mezić 2017 many systems that exhibit complex non linear behaviours can be considered within this context our effort focuses on multiphase flow through porous media 
29,for multi phase flow through multi scale heterogeneous porous media such as the pore space of rocks the interaction between multiple immiscible fluids and an intricate network of pores creates a wide range of dynamic flow phenomena at larger scales i e scales relevant for practical applications such as carbon sequestration this interplay of dynamic phenomena is often referred to as complexity however it is important to describe the persistent features of the flow in an adequate manner to represent the complexity of the system dynamic mode decomposition dmd is a dimensionality reduction algorithm that computes a set of modes associated with fixed oscillatory behaviours in this work saturation data extracted from dynamic two phase flow experiments are analysed with dmd we show that dmd can reproduce the data furthermore not all dynamic modes are required to reproduce key dynamic features this highlights the important spatial and temporal scales for flow we show that dmd was able to identify localized regions important to flow overall dmd is proven as a useful diagnostic tool for complex 4d flow dynamics for multi phase flow keywords flow in porous media dynamic flow imaging dynamic mode decomposition carbon storage multiphase flow data availability the code to perform a dynamic mode decomposition on saturation profiles with time is available on github https github com cspurin dmd the code used in this paper can be run on a standard laptop or desktop computer and runs on the order of a few minutes 1 introduction studying the flow of multiple immiscible fluid phases through a heterogeneous porous rock is relevant to many geoscience and engineering applications such as groundwater remediation and co 2 storage however a complex sequence of displacements arise during multi phase flow through heterogeneous porous media governed by the interplay of capillary viscous inertial and gravity forces making the prediction of contaminant removal or co 2 plume migration difficult krembs et al 2010 boot handford et al 2014 blunt 2017 historically attempts have been made to decompose the pore scale flow dynamics into a limited set of elementary fluid configurations and displacement mechanisms from this practical models can be used to upscale these pore scale dynamics to the relevant for applications of interest darcy scale muskat 1938 bear 1988 for example lenormand identified 4 distinct elementary displacement mechanisms in micromodel experiments lenormand et al 1983 these mechanisms are still used in quasi static pore network modelling to upscale flow joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 blunt 2017 blunt et al 2002 however there are many dynamic phenomena which are not captured by these 4 mechanisms such as the impact of inertial forces ferrari and lunati 2014 and the existence of ganglion dynamics and intermittently connecting flow pathways during capillary dominated flow avraam and payatakes 1995 rücker et al 2015 schlüter et al 2016 reynolds et al 2017 spurin et al 2019a with a wide range of flow phenomena observed and observed to also co exist rücker et al 2015 spurin et al 2019b the prediction of large scale multi phase flow is difficult to derive from pore scale observations as a result there has been a lot of interest regarding the up scaling of pore scale observations sharmin et al 2020 steefel et al 2013 jackson and krevor 2022 one avenue uses statistical physics and thermodynamics to address the behaviour of these complex systems where the pore scale configurations are regarded as many internal degrees of freedom hansen et al 2022 hassanizadeh and gray 1993a gray and miller 2014 this requires 1 the macroscopic state variables of the system to be identified and 2 the dynamics of the system to be quantified it has been shown that for multi phase flow in porous media the capillary state function can be represented by the 4 minkowski functionals which are 1 volume 2 interfacial area 3 mean curvature and 4 the gaussian curvature mcclure et al 2018 hadwiger 1957 herring et al 2013 the 4 minkowski functionals represent a complete set of macroscopic state variables however progress is needed to link these state variables to the dynamics of the system this is because the link between fluid phase pressure difference and mean curvature the 3 rd minkowski functional is only valid for static or quasi static fluid fluid interfaces which is not the case during flow mcclure et al 2020 and a fundamental link between transport and topology is currently lacking furthermore flow dynamics consists of fluid flow within individual phases and the displacement of one fluid by the other fluid fluid displacements are often non linear involve inertial forces in addition to viscous and capillary forces ferrari and lunati 2014 and change the fluid topology i e the state of the system schlüter et al 2016 these changes occur over a range of length scales from the scale of individual pores to fluid clusters over 4 orders of magnitude larger blunt 2017 fluid fluid displacements such as ganglion dynamics or intermittently connecting flow pathways avraam and payatakes 1995 rücker et al 2015 spurin et al 2019a rücker et al 2021 gao et al 2017 2019 menke et al 2022 create highly complex spatio temporal dynamics with an associated range of relaxation times from seconds armstrong et al 2014 to hours schlüter et al 2017 unless we are able to predict the topological changes caused by these flow regimes and its associated macroscopic averages it is difficult to advance the description level from the state function to transport equations and to make a connection between pore scale and darcy scale dynamic phenomena the current formulation of darcy scale multi phase transport is a phenomenological extension of darcy s law darcy 1856 there are a number of extensions that capture some of the state variables such as interfacial area hassanizadeh and gray 1993b and also extensions that honour the connection between relative permeability and fluid topology liu et al 2017 khorsandi et al 2017 however a rigorous derivation of the geometric state function for dynamic phenomena is currently lacking in this work we expand on the idea presented in rücker et al 2021 that fluctuations in pressure and saturation are instability modes where the unstable mode provides at the same pressure drop a higher total flux the remaining challenge is to understand the origin and structure of the fluctuations and predict the fluctuation spectrum we explore this using dynamic mode decomposition dmd we show that dmd can successfully decompose the signal from pore scale experiments and provide deeper insights into the cause and impact of fluctuations for multi phase flow in porous media 2 dynamic mode decomposition dmd dmd has been largely developed in the domain of fluid mechanics schmid 2010 and applied for instance to problems such as turbulence sharma et al 2016 however so far no application to flow in porous media has been reported therefore in the following a detailed introduction to dmd is given addressing in particular the porous media community 2 1 an introduction to dmd dmd is a data driven i e equation free approach for the analysis of experimental or numerical data kutz et al 2016a arabi and mezić 2017 dmd can be considered as a model reduction algorithm but it is actually a way of decomposing dynamic data into individual modes while making no assumption about the underlying system kutz et al 2016a while dmd was originally introduced for data analysis and interpretation in fluid dynamics schmid 2010 it has since been applied in many other areas including video processing bi et al 2018 epidemiology bistrian et al 2019 and financial trading mann and kutz 2016 thus it is a very general method for the analysis of dynamic systems schmid 2022 kutz et al 2016b in the original application of fluid dynamics dmd was designed to extract information from flow fields either calculated by computer simulation or experimentally measured schmid 2010 mezić 2013 in fig 1 a high level overview of the functioning and purpose of dmd for a fluid dynamics application is shown the data is organized into matrices x and x with the latter being x shifted one time step into the future a is the linear fit operator that fits x to x thus x is the inverse of the matrix x in this case the moore penrose pseudo inverse kutz et al 2016b the aim of dmd is to represent the system dynamics with a series of extracted modes that have significantly fewer degrees of freedom this allows a more intuitive description of the underlying physical mechanisms contained in the data sequence an important aspect is the description of the dynamics within a spatial framework with an assessment of which dynamics influence flow properties the most the decomposition of the data into modes and their respective dynamics can then be used to make predictions about future states kutz et al 2016a this is because the dmd eigenvalues the end result of the dmd as shown in fig 1 characterize the relaxation dynamics and rate of energy dissipation this provides insight into how susceptible a system is to future perturbations wolf et al 1985 cessac et al 2001 goldhirsch et al 1987 there is the potential for the energy dissipation to be linked to relative permeability in future research of particular interest for the relative permeability is to identify the timescale for which the system dynamics are stationary mcclure et al 2022a in this paper we will demonstrate that dmd is able to distinguish stationary modes from those that are relaxing and also to determine their relative importance based on the inferred dominance structure furthermore because dmd assimilates both spatial and temporal information it provides a quantitative mechanism to understand the links between spatial heterogeneity and transient responses further details on the principals of dmd applied in the code accompanying this manuscript are provided in the supplementary material 2 2 connection between dmd and discrete fourier transform the discrete fourier transform dft is a useful tool for analysing time dependent data such as dynamic multi phase flow a dft transforms time dependent data such as in matrix x in fig 1 into the frequency domain 1 x ˆ k n 0 n 1 x n e i 2 π n k n in comparison dmd eigenvalues are of the form 2 λ n r n e i 2 π f n characterized by a frequency f n and a magnitude r n which form a complex frequency krake et al 2021b dft are broadly useful for analysing time series data whereas dmd can be applied to time and space data for eigenvalues that are located on the unit cycle the dmd modes take the form of travelling wave solutions sharma et al 2016 for general eigenvalues the dmd eigenvalues contain more features of the dynamics such as periodicity damping or growth dmd thereby provides a mechanism to analyse image based time series data that includes both spatial and temporal information the challenge is to identify the relevant dmd components this is more complicated than in a dft because in dmd the interplay of eigenvalues modes and amplitudes need to be taken into account krake et al 2021b respective strategies to visualize the dominance structure are discussed in krake et al 2021b 2 3 dmd eigenmodes and the koopman operator for multi scale non linear systems such as flow in porous media the evolution of the system can be described using a linear transformation called the koopman operator koopman 1931a koopman and van neumann 1932 arabi and mezić 2017 dmd can under certain conditions approximate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the infinite dimensional koopman operator with finite dimensions leading to non linear dynamics being described by a finite linear transform kutz et al 2016a arabi and mezić 2017 sharma et al 2016 the koopman operator represents the evolution via a set of discrete eigenvalues that correspond to stable and unstable modes and their rate of growth or decay the advantage is that the state space the space in which the system exists is now represented in the observable space the space in which variables can be measured for example for a particle moving in a 2d system the state space is the x and y location of the particle and its velocity the observable space may only be the x location if this is the only quantity that can be measured in traditional fluid dynamic studies following the system dynamics via its trajectories in state space an infinite number of dimensions exist a visual description of the koopman operator is shown in fig 2 with a complete mathematical description provided in the supplementary material essentially if we have a dynamic system with state x that is defined by a function f x we can compute the state x at a later time t giving us f t x in fig 2 the koopman operator assigns a new function g to the function f such that g x describes the evolution of the function f over time this gives us the linear koopman operator u t x the koopman operator has several advantages over classical spectral analysis for example it is discrete and allows the construction of non parametric predictors state estimators and non linear controllers using linear systems strategies arabi and mezić 2017 the koopman operator can be approximated with finite dimensions using dmd kutz et al 2016a arabi and mezić 2017 sharma et al 2016 mezić 2013 it thus allows the description of non linear dynamics by a finite dimensional dmd and with an associated physical meaning as it is a data driven approach williams et al 2015 2 4 dmd applied to analysing experimental data of multi phase flow through porous media the connection between dmd eigenmodes and topological properties suggests dmd could be utilized to extract topology and characteristic time from complex signals küster and weich 2020 complex signal are typical for multi phase flow through porous media due to the interaction of multiple fluids with a highly heterogeneous pore space leading to a range of fluid flow phenomena such as ganglion dynamics fluid front instabilities and intermittent flow pathways rücker et al 2015 spurin et al 2019a b 2020 2021 reynolds et al 2017 gao et al 2020 rücker et al 2021 dmd is also an equation free method applicable to stochastic statistical dynamical systems kutz et al 2016a chekroun et al 2020 this further emphasizes its use in analysing data sets such as fluctuations observed during two phase flow in porous media to understand how well dmd can reproduce the data and the extent it improves our understanding of complex two phase flow dynamics we take two data sets both data sets display complex spatio temporal dynamics that become constant when averaged in space and time note that at the darcy scale these flow regimes are historically referred to as steady state johnson et al 1959 anderson 1987 berg et al 2016 alhosani et al 2021 rücker et al 2021 however the term stationary might be more appropriate for these experiments where there are changes in space and time because for stationary processes a linear response in the constitutive relationship between phase flux and pressure drop is observed mcclure et al 2022a in this work we will continue using standard terminology i e describing the experiments as steady state the first data set referred to as case 1 has a fluid front instability rücker et al 2021 when looking at the saturation data in space and time there are clear waves as the front advances shown in fig 3a and c this is useful for understanding how well dmd reconstructs data as it is a clear indicator to the quality of the reconstruction we can then pick the modes associated with the largest magnitude eigenvalues and assess how many modes are required to reconstruct the data the other data set referred to as case 2 investigates intermittent flow pathways spurin et al 2021 as the capillary number increases the amount of intermittent flow pathways increases leading to complex dynamics caused by multiple connection and disconnection events occurring at the same time however in this data set at the lowest capillary number there is a unique configuration where one pore controls connection across the pore space in the middle of the core this singular pore periodically disconnects and reconnects heavily influencing the pressure and saturation data to observe this in the dmd would be further evidence on how well dmd can represent the data but to then decompose the data from the higher capillary number experiments will allow us to ascertain if dmd can pick up dynamics that cannot be observed easily in the saturation or pressure data alone 3 results and discussion 3 1 the reproduction of dynamic flow features using dmd the first data set comprises of steady state two phase flow experiments where oil and brine were injected simultaneously into a cylindrical sandstone sample with a diameter of 2 54 cm and a length of 4 45 cm at different fractional flows the full experimental procedure is discussed in rücker et al 2021 x ray imaging was used to obtain the saturation profile across the core at steady state steady state was determined by the pressure drop measured across the sample at steady state there are still fluctuations in the pressure and saturation data as shown in fig 3b and d but when averaged in time the pressure and saturation both remain constant the water saturation in these experiments had a peak that moved across the rock sample at a constant velocity this formed a travelling wave shown by the red streaks indicating a higher saturation in fig 3a and c the nature of the travelling wave front changed depending on the fractional flow i e the slope of the streak changes between fig 3a and c this distinctive feature allows us to qualitatively assess the reconstruction power of dmd the dmd of saturation data gives 24 eigenvalues with the 8 largest eigenvalues highlighted in fig 4 eigenvalues outside the unit circle are growing those on the unit circle are stable and those inside the unit circle are decaying the eigenvalues are plotted in space and time as the respective modes and dynamics of the flow some are purely real e g 0 and 1 these relate to static or non oscillatory distributions whose associated modes do not evolve in time krake et al 2021b some are reflected in the x axis e g 2 is a reflection about the x axis of 3 these have the same mode and dynamic and overlay each other entirely in fig 4b and c overall there is a wealth of dynamics in the dmd that should correspond to flow dynamics the superposition of all the modes and dynamics should in principle recreate the data set input into the dmd as long as the dmd has a long enough time series as an input taking all modes and dynamics the dmd is capable of reconstructing the initial data shown in fig 5b when the modes are reconstructed separately they represent different parts of the flow regime highlighted in fig 6 the question is how many modes and their corresponding dynamics are required to reconstruct the data sufficiently and represent the larger scale flow properties we take the first 4 modes and 4 dynamics shown in fig 4 and reconstruct the data set shown in fig 5c this is sufficient to recreate the travelling wave front in fig 5a overall dmd is capable of preserving the flow signal so that it can be reconstructed not all modes and dynamics are needed to preserve the large scale flow features the number of modes and dynamics required to reconstruct the data could reflect the complexity of the dynamics and the extent of the interaction between fluids however a measure to how well a signal has been reconstructed is easier to deduce when there are clear periodic instabilities such is the case in this example 3 2 identifying the control of localized heterogeneity on flow dynamics using dmd recently a wealth of dynamics has been observed in steady state fluid flow due to the interaction of multiple fluids through the heterogeneous network of pores in rocks rücker et al 2021 reynolds et al 2017 spurin et al 2020 2021 gao et al 2017 the dynamics are difficult to unravel due to the heterogeneity of the porous medium and the non local nature of the dynamics spurin et al 2021 we want to observe if dmd can provide a deeper insight into these dynamics to explore this we examine a series of two phase steady state experiments where nitrogen and brine were simultaneously injected into a cylindrical carbonate sample with a diameter of 21 mm and a length of 5 mm at a fractional flow of 0 85 with the total flow rate increased from 0 1 ml min to 0 7 ml min the images were acquired over a period of 1s with the full experimental procedure discussed in spurin et al 2021 this example is useful for this analysis because at the lowest flow rate capillary number the flow is channelled through a single pore that intermittently connects and disconnects this created a strong periodic pressure signal something that is translated although not simply into the saturation across the sample as shown in fig 7 both the pressure and the saturation fluctuated about a mean value with this mean remaining constant during steady state as the flow rate increased the gas distribution became more evenly distributed across the sample there are more intermittent dynamics at these higher flow rates and this combined with the non local nature of the signal creates a more complicated pressure signal fig 7e and f it is then harder to correlate specific events in the pore space to pressure fluctuations across the core the dmd of the lowest capillary number shows modes with a node at the middle of the sample which is where the one pore constriction occurs this region is highlighted for the higher flow rate experiments in fig 8 for the middle flow rate there is still a divide in the modes downstream of the constriction compared to upstream for the highest flow rate multiple modes peak in the location of the highly heterogeneous zone this middle section of the core is highly heterogeneous which causes the channelling of the flow during the lowest flow rate observation this section still has a large influence on dynamics even when energy dissipation from intermittent pathway flow becomes more dispersed as shown by the dmd overall dmd provides a way to assess fluctuations in data sets that are not periodic and therefore difficult to spot with the naked eye furthermore it allows 4d dynamics to be explored in a series of 2d images which are easier to produce and are easier to quantify than 3d videos 4d dynamics 3 3 sampling intervals and their impact on dmd temporal resolution is typically a restraining factor when conducting multi phase flow experiments gao et al 2021 spurin et al 2020 the experiments used in this work were conducted at synchrotron facilities where high energy x rays are generated these cannot be achieved in traditional laboratory based experiments to assess the universality of dmd on the experimental data currently in the domain we must ascertain and the sampling interval required for the dmd to accurately represent the flow properties we vary the sampling interval for the case 2 lowest capillary number experiment from 2 s to 64 s in fig 9 the node in the modes is visible for every sampling up to 32 s fig 9e recording the dynamics every 64 s does not provide enough data to capture the node in the dynamics in the middle of the sample this suggests that rapid imaging is required to observe the relevant flow dynamics and typical laboratory based x ray scanners which take on the order of tens of minutes are an order of magnitude too slow to capture the relevant dynamics 3 4 can dmd saturation results be linked to red noise observed in the pressure data as shown in fig 9 the number of modes decreases as the sampling time increases this means that there are modes with shorter timescales and modes with longer timescales in recent work exploring fluctuations in pressure data red noise was observed spurin et al 2022 standnes et al 2022 this observation implies a cascade of timescales with the longer timescales correlating to larger events we explore how the nature of the eigenvalues changes as the sampling interval increases for the lowest capillary number experiment in case 2 fig 7a the eigenvalues for this experiment are plotted in fig 10 the black circle denotes the unit circle i e a magnitude of 1 all eigenvalues are stable so lie within the unit circle eigenvectors with magnitudes of 95 of the unit circle are classified as periodic eigenvalues with magnitudes outside this that are not on the unit circle are associated with non periodic eigenvectors and their modes are either decaying or growing no eigenvalues lie outside the unit circle therefore no modes are growing the number of periodic eigenvalues decreases as the sampling interval increases the number of eigenvalues decreases disproportionately affecting the periodic eigenvalues but eigenvalues that would have previously been considered periodic become non periodic with a longer sampling interval this is clearest between fig 10e and f where non periodic solutions appear where there was no periodic solution before a summary of all the eigenvalues relationship with the sampling time for all capillary numbers is shown in fig 11 for all cases the periodic eigenvalues decay quicker than the non periodic eigenvalues shown in the top panel the total number of eigenvalues decays along with their magnitude in the middle and bottom panels respectively the slope for the lines of best fit varies slightly between capillary numbers but with no obvious trend as some eigenvalues change from being periodic to non periodic it is difficult to track a specific mode in time and observe what it does this is something that could be of interest in future work 4 conclusions in this work we show that dynamic mode decomposition dmd is a useful tool for analysing the flow dynamics for multi phase flow in porous media it provides the information of a 4d signal as a series of 2d panels which are easier to interpret quantitatively and easier to produce than 3d videos of the dynamics the fluctuations shown in saturation data can be extracted from the dmd eigenvalues we show that the associated modes and dynamics from the output can be used to reconstruct the input data more so not all modes and dynamics are required to successfully reconstruct the large scale features thus dmd could be used as a tool for understanding which dynamics are important for larger scale flow properties and could be useful in upscaling attempts we observed that dmd can successfully highlight regions controlling flow and provide insight into the flow dynamics when the number of fluctuations amount of dynamics makes it difficult to qualitatively describe flow future work will explore if saturation dmd could be linked with fluctuations in pressure data there is the potential to link the dmd analysis with a fourier analysis or power spectra analysis dmd could potentially be used to process large amounts of 4d data which is typical for synchrotron imaging of flow in porous media the dmd analysis could be expanded to have the raw projections as the input from this the dominant modes and their timescales could be extracted and this could be used to find the correct reconstruction parameters this could also be paired with machine learning to provide an efficient and robust way to process 4d data credit authorship contribution statement catherine spurin conceptualization investigation

appendix supplementary material a 1 the mathematical principles of dmd dmd computes from a time series of data the underlying modes and their respective dynamics such as oscillatory behaviour growth or decay from the eigenvalues of the composition or koopman operator sharma et al 2016 arabi and mezić 2017 the data is generally available in form of a time sequence of snapshots 3 v 1 n v 1 v 2 v n where v i r m is the i th snapshot in the time sequence and v i n r m x n is the data in matrix representation where the columns contain the individual snapshots each containing m spatial points and n is the number of snapshots the dynamics are assumed to be linear which implies that consecutive snapshots v i are related to each other via a linear relationship 4 v i 1 a v i the assumption of a linear dynamical system furthermore assumes that this linear relationship a remains approximately constant during the time period of interest one can re write eq 4 into a matrix form 5 v 2 n a v 1 n 1

composition computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a for the practical calculation of the eigenvalues of a several different methods are available where singular value decomposition of a is a central element there are several different dmd approaches which have specific advantages and disadvantages kutz et al 2016a the singular value decomposition svd approach has the advantage that noise in the data can be removed by truncating the svd of v 1 n 1 furthermore there are many different types of dmd and such as optimized dmd optimal mode decomposition exact dmd multi resolution dmd dmd with control etc which have specific strengths such as multi resolution dmd for data sets that contain spatial structure at multiple length scales in this work dmd is performed with pydmd demo et al 2018 which has several methods here we use regular dmd for the space time saturation data the code for the analysis is provided with this paper the code can be run on a standard laptop or desktop computer and takes on the order of a few minutes to run a 2 the mathematical basis for the koopman operator the koopman operator was developed in 1931 to provide an alternative way to represent the behaviour of dynamical systems that obey hamiltonian mechanics koopman 1931b the original work is famous for casting classical mechanics into a form that very much resembles schrödinger s equation from quantum mechanics 6 i f t g ˆ f in this equation f is a probability distribution that evolves according to the liouville equation and g ˆ is a hermitian operator physical observables such as the density and momentum are conserved invariants that can be determined directly from f and eq 6 provides a way to determine their evolution while relevant classes of system are broad it has historically been more convenient to focus on particular representations e g the navier stokes equations when pursuing research into particular applications e g fluid flow however in the context of more recent data driven computational paradigms the koopman representation is advantageous due to its generality based on the notion that it may be possible to learn the form of an otherwise unknown operator from data brunton et al 2021 here we consider a typical situation arising in fluid mechanics the flow field u is physical observable that can be derived from the system state as represented by the probability distribution f if we define g as a complex function on the flow field u then g u produces a complex number for each value of u which becomes then an observable that is entirely determined from the evolution of the probability distribution f due to eq 6 it can be shown that the koopman operator describes the time evolution of this observable viscardy 2006 the koopman operator u at time τ denoted u τ maps the function g u x t to a new time t τ via 7 g u x t τ u τ g u x t g τ u x t the koopman operator is linear and therefore its spectrum and eigenfunctions provide an intuitive description of the system dynamics the eigenfunctions of the koopman operator ϕ j with eigenvalues λ j follow 8 ϕ τ u u τ ϕ j u e λ j τ ϕ j u for periodic oscillatory phenomena the eigenvalues are 9 λ j i ω j ω j r which establishes a connection between the koopman eigenvalues and the frequency spectrum observables can now be expressed through linear combinations of the eigenfunctions 10 g u j 1 g j ϕ j u where the scalar coefficients g j are defined by the projection of the observable g on the koopman eigenfunction ϕ j using eq 7 the time evolution of the observable g can be expressed in terms of the koopman eigenfunctions 11 g τ u u τ g u j 1 g j ϕ j u e i ω j τ the same principle holds also for vector observables g 12 g τ u u τ g u j 1 g j ϕ j u e i ω j τ where g j denotes the components of the observable g obtained by projection on the koopman eigenfunction ϕ j arabi and mezić 2017 the respective decomposition of observables into koopman eigenfunctions is termed koopman mode decomposition kmd arabi and mezić 2017 the koopman modes g j are each associated with an eigenvalue λ j for in this case λ j i ω j i e with koopman frequency ω j effectively the time evolution of g is a linear combination of koopman modes with oscillating coefficients note that since the expansion in eq 12 is infinite dimensional it can also describe non linear time evolution arabi and mezić 2017 many systems that exhibit complex non linear behaviours can be considered within this context our effort focuses on multiphase flow through porous media
