375,anthropogenic climate change has led to nonstationarity in hydrological data and their statistical characteristics to consider nonstationarity in regional frequency analysis several nonstationary index flood ns if methods comprising a time dependent site specific scaling factor or nonstationary regional growth curves have been suggested however these methods have limitations related to underestimation from using sample statistics as a site specific scaling factor or considering nonstationarity only in regional parameters to overcome these drawbacks this study developed a nonstationary population index flood ns pif method that considers nonstationarity in the statistical characteristics at each site in a region based on nonstationary generalized extreme value distributions monte carlo simulations were conducted for synthetic regions under various nonstationary conditions to compare the performance of the ns pif method with those of existing ns if methods then the applicability of the ns pif method to real world data was assessed via monte carlo simulations of regions with annual maximum rainfall data in south korea the results indicated that the ns pif method can solve the underestimation problem inherent in existing ns if methods moreover the ns pif method yielded the best performance and provided more reliable and reasonable quantile estimates considering site specific trends in addition the heterogeneity measure based on l skewness and l kurtosis was identified as a suitable test of homogeneity for application of the proposed method keywords population index flood method nonstationary gev distribution heterogeneity measure monte carlo simulation regional frequency analysis design quantile estimates 1 introduction regional frequency analysis rfa has been widely used for estimating design quantiles for extreme hydrological events such as floods and heavy rainfalls the procedure generally consists of two major steps 1 regionalization of sites based on various hydro meteorological geographical and statistical characteristics and 2 estimation of design quantiles by fitting the probability distribution to the regional data because rfa uses more observations from a hydrologically homogeneous region than at site frequency analysis afa the estimated quantiles based on rfa are more reliable especially for sites with a short record length or sites lacking observations alila 1999 de michele and rosso 2001 hosking and wallis 1997 lettenmaier et al 1987 nam et al 2015 the index flood if method proposed by dalrymple 1960 is one of the most common regional models used for estimating quantiles in rfa the fundamental assumption of the if method is that observation data from different sites in a homogeneous region have the same probability distribution termed the regional growth curve except for the site specific scaling factor i e if or index function therefore the regional growth curve is estimated using regional data normalized by the site specific scaling factor in accordance with previously outlined guidelines for design quantile estimation e g hosking and wallis 1997 natural environment research council 1975 the use of at site sample statistics as the site specific scaling factor has become popular fowler and kilsby 2003 nam et al 2015 smithers and schulze 2001 xu et al 2012 yin et al 2016 however this can lead to underestimation of quantile estimates and of the skewness and kurtosis of regional growth curves basu and srinivas 2013 2016 stedinger 1983 sveinsson et al 2001 stedinger 1983 explained that regional growth curves calculated from dimensionless data scaled by the at site sample mean can have smaller coefficients of skewness and kurtosis than those calculated from the original data moreover sveinsson et al 2001 emphasized that using the at site sample mean as the if can lead to distortion and underestimation of quantiles as an alternative they suggested the population index flood pif method which considers the unknown at site population statistics as the site specific scaling factor in order to compensate for problems related to the use of at site sample statistics the authors then conducted simulation experiments based on the generalized extreme value gev distribution to compare the performance of the pif method and if method proposed by hosking and wallis 1997 the pif method with the maximum likelihood estimation mle yielded the best performance for 0 95 and 0 99 quantiles eldardiry et al 2015 employed the pif method for estimating radar based rainfall quantiles they identified that the pif method results in the reduction in uncertainty of quantile estimates basu and srinivas 2016 evaluated the performance of several if and pif methods for estimating quantiles at ungauged sites using monte carlo simulations and a case study the pif method which utilizes regional information on the first two l moments revealed the best quantile estimation performance at ungauged sites these previous studies comparing the performance of if and pif methods were based on the stationary assumption of hydrological data however under the influence of climate change and urbanization nonstationarity has been observed in hydrological data e g trend and long term variability and is an important issue in hydrological systems jain and lall 2000 2001 mallakpour and villarini 2015 milly et al 2008 olsen et al 1999 prosdocimi et al 2015 salas et al 2018 few studies have proposed the nonstationary if ns if method for rfa which employs a time dependent site specific scaling factor and or nonstationary regional growth curves cunderlik and burn 2003 cunderlik and ouarda 2006 hanel et al 2009 markiewicz et al 2006a o brien and burn 2014 roth et al 2012 sung et al 2018 hanel et al 2009 and o brien and burn 2014 applied the nonstationary gev ns gev distributions to regional growth curves the trend components of gev parameters were assumed to be identical for all sites in a region therefore sites exhibiting nonstationarity with the same trend sign were clustered into one region however this can be a limitation when considering hydro meteorological or geographical characteristics for regionalization the ns if method based on detrending is a more flexible concept of nonstationary rfa ns rfa which considers the nonstationarity of statistical characteristics at each site individually cunderlik and burn 2003 cunderlik and ouarda 2006 markiewicz et al 2006a sung et al 2018 cunderlik and burn 2003 proposed the ns rfa procedure using a second order nonstationary approach that assumes nonstationarity in the first two moments of the data by using the trend components in the mean and variance of the original at site data as site specific scaling factors the data were transformed to a second order stationary time series the regional growth curves were estimated using several probability distributions subsequently markiewicz et al 2006a proposed the ns if method which employs the index function consisting of the time dependent at site sample mean and mean deviation as the site specific scaling factors the trend of the original at site data was removed by the index function and the time independent regional growth curve was estimated from the detrended data sung et al 2018 also removed the trend at each site using the time dependent index function before estimating stationary regional growth curves in the ns if methods used in the abovementioned studies at site trend components were estimated and removed from the original at site data that is the trend components of the at site sample were used as site specific scaling factors therefore these ns if methods could still cause distortion and underestimation of quantiles to solve this problem this study aims to 1 develop a nonstationary population index flood ns pif method that considers the nonstationarity of statistical characteristics at each site based on ns gev distributions 2 compare the performance of the ns pif method and existing methods and 3 identify the feasibility of ns pif method application to actual extreme rainfall data the ns pif and other existing methods are evaluated by conducting simulation experiments in a similar manner to that reported in hosking and wallis 1997 to investigate the performance of the employed methods according to the various nonstationary characteristics of a region synthetic regions are designed based on ns gev distributions the homogeneity of these synthetic regions is tested using heterogeneity measures the accuracy of the quantile estimates for the tested methods is then evaluated using the regional average relative root mean square error rrmser and relative bias rbiasr in addition a case study is employed to explore the performance and applicability of the ns pif method using annual maximum daily rainfall data of representative rainfall gauges evenly distributed throughout south korea the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the ns pif method based on several types of ns gev distributions and explain the existing ns if methods employed for performance comparisons with the proposed method in addition we describe the heterogeneity measures widely used as a test of regional homogeneity in rfa the design and results of the simulation experiment are presented in section 3 section 4 describes the results of the case study for south korea the assessment results and feasibility of the ns pif method are discussed in section 5 finally section 6 presents the conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 nonstationary gev probability distributions gev distribution is one of the most widely used distributions for conventional frequency analysis of extreme events such as floods extreme rainfall and maximum wind speeds el adlouni et al 2007 jenkinson 1955 integrated the gumbel fréchet and weibull families into the gev distribution with a cumulative distribution function f x as shown in eq 1 1 f x exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ where μ σ 0 and ξ are the location scale and shape parameters respectively for ξ 0 fréchet it is valid for μ σ ξ x whereas for ξ 0 weibull it is valid for x μ σ ξ when ξ 0 gumbel x the mean ε standard deviation s and quantile function qt of the gev distribution can be expressed as a function of these parameters as follows 2 ε μ σ ξ γ 1 ξ 1 3 s σ ξ 2 γ 1 2 ξ γ 2 1 ξ 4 q t μ σ ξ 1 l n 1 1 t ξ where γ is the gamma function and t is the return period the most common approach for taking nonstationarity into account in frequency analysis is to express one or more distribution parameters as a function of time varying covariates representing the effect of temporal trend seasonality or climate variability on the frequency or magnitude of extreme events e g ouarda and charron 2019 sun et al 2015 tramblay et al 2013 villarini et al 2009 2010 when time t is used as the covariate the gev parameters can be defined as a pth degree polynomial function of t a logarithmic link function is used to ensure a positive value of the scale parameter regardless of t coles 2001 although high degree polynomial functions can be used to define nonstationary parameters they can lead to an overfitting problem beguería et al 2011 a linear function is generally used to model the parameters of the distribution as such function can account for the trend in the hydrological data and also meets the principle of parameter parsimony cheng and aghakouchak 2014 el adlouni et al 2007 garcía et al 2007 kharin and zwiers 2005 kim et al 2017 mailhot et al 2010 sarhadi and soulis 2017 in this study the location and scale parameters of the ns gev distribution are respectively defined as linear and log linear functions of t the shape parameter is assumed to be constant over t because it is difficult to estimate it reliably even in stationary models coles 2001 salas et al 2018 table 1 presents the stationary gev st gev distribution and ns gev distributions used in this study the 0 s and 1 s in the notation of gev distributions indicate the polynomial degree p i e st gev 0 0 0 assumes that all parameters are constant ns gev 1 0 0 assumes that the location parameter is allowed to vary linearly with respect to t and ns gev 1 1 0 assumes that the location and scale parameters vary linearly and log linearly with respect to t the time dependent mean ε t standard deviation s t and quantile function qt t of ns gev distribution are given by eqs 5 7 5 ε t μ t σ t ξ γ 1 ξ 1 6 s t σ t ξ 2 γ 1 2 ξ γ 2 1 ξ 7 q t t μ t σ t ξ 1 l n 1 1 t ξ 2 2 nonstationary population index flood method the pif method proposed by sveinsson et al 2001 utilizes the statistical properties of the assumed population distribution at each site e g population mean and population standard deviation as a site specific scaling factor the regional model based on this concept was first introduced by boes et al 1989 let q t i and θ i i 1 2 n respectively denote the t year quantile and site specific scaling factors of the assumed population distribution at site i in a homogeneous region with n sites q t i can be normalized by an index function g θ i consisting of the population parameters at site i the concept behind the pif method assumes that the normalized t year quantile g q t i θ i is identical for all sites in a homogeneous region to this end two types of index functions include either the population mean ε i or the population mean ε i and the population standard deviation si at site i as follows sveinsson et al 2001 8 g 1 q t i ε i s i q t i ε i s i i 1 2 n 9 g 2 q t i ε i q t i ε i i 1 2 n where n is the number of sites in a homogeneous region to apply nonstationarity to the pif method the index function can be redefined in terms of time dependent site specific scaling factors i e ε i t and si t of the assumed nonstationary population distribution as follows 10 g 1 q t i t ε i t s i t q t i t ε i t s i t i 1 2 n 11 g 2 q t i t ε i t q t i t ε i t i 1 2 n when ns gev 1 1 0 is assumed to be a population distribution eqs 5 7 can be substituted into eqs 10 and 11 then g 1 implies that the shape parameter ξ i is identical at all sites thus the number of parameters in a region is reduced from 5n to 4n 1 likewise g 2 implies that ξ i and μ i t σ i t are identical at all sites thus the number of parameters in a region is reduced from 5n to 3n 2 this study considers the ns pif method based on the index function g 1 referred to as ns pif because it is a more flexible method which considers nonstationarity differently in the mean and variance at each site in a region based on the ns gev distribution listed in table 1 the sample at site i is denoted as x 1 i x 2 i x n i i where ni is the sample size at site i then the log likelihood function ln l of ns pif based on ns gev 1 1 0 is given by 12 ln l i 1 n t 1 n i σ 0 i σ 1 i t 1 ξ r 1 i 1 n t 1 n i ln 1 ξ r x t i μ 0 i μ 1 i t e x p σ 0 i σ 1 i t i 1 n t 1 n i 1 ξ r x t i μ 0 i μ 1 i t e x p σ 0 i σ 1 i t 1 ξ r if ns gev 1 0 0 is assumed to be a population distribution at site i the trend component of the scale parameters at site i σ1 i is set to zero in the case of st gev 0 0 0 the trend components of both location and scale parameters μ1 i and σ1 i are set to zero the partial derivatives of the log likelihood function of ns pif are presented in appendix a 2 3 nonstationary index flood method based on detrending the if method introduced by dalrymple 1960 has been widely used in rfa and has the following basic assumptions 1 observation data at each site are independent and identically distributed 2 there is no dependence between data observed at different sites and 3 the frequency distribution of the observation data in a homogeneous region is identical excluding the site specific scaling factor i e if or index function the t year quantile at site i q t i in a homogeneous region with n sites is given by eq 13 13 q t i ω i q t i 1 2 n where ω i is the site specific scaling factor at site i and qt is the regional growth curve with respect to the return period t which is a dimensionless quantile function for every site in a region the sample mean of the observation data at site i is generally used as ω i dimensionless data which are normalized by dividing the observation data by ω i are used to obtain the regional growth curve qt in the case that nonstationarity of the statistical characteristics at each site is considered the time dependent site specific scaling factor can be applied to the if method in other words after the trend observed in the original at site data is removed by the time dependent site specific scaling factor qt is estimated using the detrended data when the first two statistical moments of at site data are assumed to be nonstationary e g cunderlik and burn 2003 markiewicz et al 2006a the time dependent mean ε i t and standardized deviation si t at site i can be defined as a linear function as follows 14 ε i t ε 0 i ε 1 i t 15 s i t s 0 i s 1 i t the parameters of ε i t and si t are conveniently derived from least squares regression as 16 min ε i t t 1 n i x t i ε i t 2 17 min s i t t 1 n i e i 2 t s i 2 t 2 where ei t x t i ε i t then the detrended data y t i are obtained by standardization 18 y t i t x t i ε i t s i t for a region with n sites the regional growth curve qt for y t i i 1 2 n is estimated by the l moments approach then the quantile at site i is given by 19 q t i t ε i t s i t q t ns if1 the mean deviation about the mean which is one of the dispersion measure statistics of random variable can be considered as an alternative to the standard deviation markiewicz et al 2006b when the time dependent mean deviation δ i t δ0 δ1 t is used as the site specific scaling factor for the second statistical moment eqs 17 19 are substituted by eqs 20 22 respectively 20 min δ i t t 1 n i e i t δ i t 2 21 y t i t x t i ε i t δ i t 22 q t i t ε i t δ i t q t ns if2 2 4 heterogeneity measure the heterogeneity measure h proposed by hosking and wallis 1993 is commonly adopted in rfa to test the regional homogeneity this statistic is obtained from dispersion measures that can be defined as the sum of errors between the at site sample l moment ratios and regional average l moment ratios the weighted standard deviation v 1 considering only the l coefficient of variation l cv is given by 23 v 1 i 1 n n i t i t r 2 i 1 n n i 1 2 where n i and ti are the sample size and the sample l cv at site i respectively and tr is the regional average l cv the heterogeneity measure h 1 can be calculated by comparing the variability of l cv in the region with that expected for simulated regions as follows 24 h 1 v 1 μ v 1 s v 1 where μ v 1 and s v 1 are the mean and standard deviation of v 1 estimated from the simulated regions generated from the kappa distribution fitted to the regional average l moment ratios the heterogeneity measure can be extended by replacing l cv with other measures such as l skewness and l kurtosis depending on which l moments are used for the weighted standard deviation v 2 and v 3 can be defined as follows 25 v 2 i 1 n n i t i t r 2 t 3 i t 3 r 2 1 2 i 1 n n i 26 v 3 i 1 n n i t 3 i t 3 r 2 t 4 i t 4 r 2 1 2 i 1 n n i where t 3 i and t 4 i are the sample l skewness and l kurtosis at site i and t 3 r and t 4 r are the regional average l skewness and l kurtosis respectively then h 2 and h 3 are given by 27 h 2 v 2 μ v 2 s v 2 28 h 3 v 3 μ v 3 s v 3 a region is defined as acceptably homogeneous region when h 1 possibly heterogeneous when 1 h 2 and definitely heterogeneous when 2 h hosking and wallis 1993 3 simulation experiment 3 1 design of the synthetic region in the rfa procedure regionalization can be conducted by various clustering methods e g geographical convenience subjective partitioning objective partitioning and cluster analysis the homogeneity of the formed region is generally tested by the heterogeneity measures however even if sites have data and or their statistical characteristics with a trend the region may still be considered as a homogeneous region in this study monte carlo simulations are conducted to investigate the heterogeneity measures and to evaluate the methods performance according to the nonstationary rate of a region rns 30 50 70 and 100 which indicates the proportion of sites with a trend in a region according to the type of ns gev distribution used to generate nonstationary at site samples three cases of synthetic regions ns gev 1 0 0 ns gev 1 1 0 and ns gev mix cases are considered in the ns gev 1 0 0 case nonstationary at site samples in a region are generated by the ns gev 1 0 0 distribution with a trend in the mean value in the ns gev 1 1 0 case nonstationary at site data in a region are generated by the ns gev 1 1 0 distribution with a trend in both the mean and variance in the ns gev mix case both ns gev 1 0 0 and ns gev 1 1 0 distributions are included in a region a synthetic region of each case is designed based on the number of sites n 10 the sample size at the site i ni 50 and the regional averages of gev parameters μ0 r μ1 r σ0 r σ1 r ξ r the heterogeneity of a region is considered through the slope of the location and scale parameters μ1 i and σ1 i the first and last nonstationary sites in a region have μ1 i μ1 r μ1 r 2 σ1 i σ1 r σ1 r 2 and μ1 i μ1 r μ1 r 2 σ1 i σ1 r σ1 r 2 respectively the μ1 i and σ1 i values of the other nonstationary sites vary linearly other gev parameters are the same for all sites in a region i e μ0 i μ0 r σ0 i σ0 r ξ i ξ r the regional average values of gev parameters are determined based on previous simulation experiments cannon 2010 el adlouni et al 2007 as follows μ0 r 0 μ1 r 0 1 σ0 r 1 σ1 r 0 02 and ξ r 0 1 the specifications of all synthetic regions are presented in tables 2 4 the monte carlo simulations are repeated 1 000 times for each iteration step the heterogeneity measures h 1 h 2 and h 3 are obtained and quantiles are estimated using the ns pif and other existing ns if methods ns if1 and ns if2 as well as nonstationary at site frequency analysis ns afa table 5 summarizes the quantile estimation procedures of the employed methods using the synthetic region rns 50 of the ns gev mix case as an example 3 2 evaluation criteria to compare the performance of the employed methods without the influence of the data scale the regional rrmse rrmser and regional rbias rbiasr are used as evaluation criteria in the simulation experiment the rrmser measures the accuracy of the estimated quantiles by considering the overall deviation between the estimated and true quantiles rbiasr measures the magnitude of over or underestimation for the estimated quantiles by averaging the differences between the estimated and true quantiles the rrmser and rbiasr at time t are calculated using eqs 29 and 30 respectively 29 r r m s e r t 1 n i 1 n q t i t q t i t q t i t 2 100 30 r b i a s r t 1 n i 1 n q t i t q t i t q t i t 100 here q t i t is the time dependent quantile estimate for return period t at site i and q t i t is the true quantile for return period t at site i the rrmser and rbiasr are calculated for the present time t ni 3 3 simulation results 3 3 1 heterogeneity measure the heterogeneity measures are obtained for each iteration of the simulation experiment fig 1 presents the box plots of h 1 h 2 and h 3 for simulated regions according to the rns in the ns gev 1 0 0 case the region with rns 30 can be considered as the homogeneous region because the majority of all heterogeneity measures are less than 2 as γ ns increases from 30 to 70 h 1 and h 2 also increase for the region with rns 100 however the median values of h 1 and h 2 decrease substantially to approximately 2 on the contrary the majority of h 3 values are less than 1 and exhibit minimal variation with rns in the ns gev 1 1 0 case although all heterogeneity measures decrease compared to those of the ns gev 1 0 0 case h 1 and h 2 still increase as rns increases from 30 to 70 note that the majority of h 3 values are less than 1 regardless of rns the results of the ns gev mix case are similar to those of the ns gev 1 0 0 case except that the heterogeneity measures for the region with rns 100 are larger in summary for regions including sites with nonstationarity in the mean and variance h 3 exhibits minimal dependence on rns whereas h 1 and h 2 are sensitive to rns 3 3 2 performance assessment for each iteration step of the simulation experiment the rrmser and rbiasr values of the quantile estimates are calculated for each method ns afa ns pif ns if1 and ns if2 for four return periods t 20 50 100 200 years and illustrated in the form of box plots fig 2 shows the box plots of rrmser of quantile estimates for 1000 simulations of the synthetic regions in the three ns gev cases in ns gev 1 0 0 case fig 2 a for values of median upper lower quartiles and whiskers ns pif red box has the lowest rrmser for all t and rns whereas ns if blue box shows the second lowest rrmser the interquartile and interwhisker ranges of ns pif are also the smallest for all t and rns note that the results of ns if1 and ns if2 are the same because the variance trend is not considered in the ns gev 1 0 0 case in contrast ns afa gray box has the highest rrmser for all t and rns in addition its median value interquartile range and interwhisker ranges increase rapidly as t increases in the ns gev 1 1 0 case fig 2 b the rrmser s of all tested methods increase slightly as rns increases ns pif has the lowest rrmser for all t whereas ns if2 purple box and ns if1 blue box show the second and third lowest rrmser respectively the results of the ns gev mix case fig 2 c are similar to those of the ns gev 1 1 0 case fig 3 shows the box plots of rbiasr of quantile estimates for 1000 simulations of the synthetic regions in the three ns gev cases in the ns gev 1 0 0 case fig 3 a the median interquartile range and interwhisker range of rbiasr for all tested methods are almost the same for t 20 years however as t increases the ns afa and ns if methods tend to over and underestimate the quantiles respectively in contrast ns pif yields better performance for all t in the ns gev 1 1 0 and ns gev mix cases figs 3 b and 3 c ns if1 and ns if2 result in substantially greater underestimation of quantiles compared to the ns gev 1 0 0 case note that the performance of ns if methods is more affected by rns compared to that of ns pif ns if methods underestimate the quantiles more as rns increases whereas ns pif yields a better performance regardless of rns 4 case study ns pif performance was investigated using simulation experiments with synthetic regional data and compared with the performance of other existing methods in section 3 for the simulation experiments however all sites within a region have the same record length and time independent gev parameter values therefore to assess the real world applicability of ns pif monte carlo simulations are performed with actual data and their performances were evaluated through comparisons with other tested methods in addition to investigate the practicality of quantiles considering the site specific trend the quantile estimation results of ns pif are compared to those of the stationary if method st if eq 13 4 1 regional data annual maximum am daily rainfall data observed at 10 rainfall gauging sites evenly distributed throughout south korea are used for the case study first the mann kendall test is used to investigate the presence of trends in the am daily rainfall data at each site sites with no trend are assumed to have st gev 0 0 0 for sites where a trend is detected the akaike information criterion aic is employed to select the appropriate distribution between ns gev 1 0 0 and ns gev 1 1 0 kim et al 2017 fig 4 presents the location of the sites included in the representative region of this study rns 50 and table 6 shows the basic information including the sample size n selected gev distribution results of the mann kendall test at a significance level of 0 1 and signs of slope parameters μ1 and σ1 for each site prior to the simulation experiments the homogeneity and spatial dependence of the representative region are tested using the heterogeneity measures h 1 h 2 and h 3 and average inter site correlation γ the values of h 1 h 2 and h 3 are 2 08 1 03 and 0 70 respectively although the h 1 value indicates that the region is heterogeneous the region is considered as homogeneous based on h 2 and h 3 values the value of γ is calculated as 0 16 therefore the representative region is assumed to be a spatially independent and homogeneous region for assessing the performance of ns pif 4 2 performance assessment simulation experiments are conducted to compare the performance of ns pif and other tested methods for the representative region the region is simulated with the same number of sites sample size and selected gev distribution at each site as presented in table 6 to consider the homogeneity of the region the regional average values of at site shape parameters are employed to generate the data quantiles are estimated following the quantile estimation procedures described in table 5 for sites with no trend all trend parameters in the tested methods i e μ1 i σ1 i ε1 i s 1 i and δ1 i are set to zero for sites with a trend and in which ns gev 1 0 0 is selected trend parameters related to the variance i e σ1 i s 1 i and δ1 i are set to zero for sites with a trend and in which ns gev 1 1 0 is selected all trend parameters are estimated the simulation experiments are iterated 1000 times and the performance of the applied methods is assessed based on the rrmser and rbiasr values of the quantile estimates the simulation procedure for the representative region is demonstrated in fig 5 fig 6 presents the box plots of rrmser and rbiasr values of the quantile estimates for 1000 simulations of the representative region as shown in the simulation results for synthetic regions with rns 50 in the ns gev mix case see figs 2 c and 3 c ns pif has the lowest median interquartile range and interwhisker range of rrmser for all t ns afa shows a better performance for t 20 years as t increases however the rrmser values of ns afa increase more rapidly than in other regional methods the medians of rbiasr values for ns pif are stable regardless of t whereas ns afa and ns if methods tend to over and underestimate the quantiles respectively as t increases consequently simulation studies for the representative region and for various synthetic regions confirmed that ns pif is a more appropriate method for considering site specific trends 4 3 quantile estimation results table 7 presents the quantile estimation results of ns pif and st if for the representative region for sites where a trend is detected and ns gev distributions are selected as appropriate distributions with an increasing trend sites 112 143 168 211 and 221 the quantile estimates of ns pif are 4 7 22 7 greater than those of the st if method specifically for sites 112 143 and 168 where nonstationarity is considered in both the mean and variance the quantile estimates increase by approximately 20 for all values of t for sites where st gev 0 0 0 is selected as an appropriate distribution the quantile estimates of ns pif decrease slightly by 2 2 5 4 except for site 105 where the rate of change in quantile estimates is less than 1 5 summary and discussion in this study an ns pif regional method is proposed by using the ns gev distribution the proposed ns pif method can consider site specific trends by assuming various st and ns gev distributions as population distributions at each site within a region to investigate the heterogeneity measures and to evaluate the methods performance according to the rns value of a region monte carlo simulations were conducted for both synthetic and real world regions under various nonstationary conditions of ns gev distributions the simulation results of heterogeneity measures showed that h 1 and h 2 are highly sensitive to the rns value of the region including sites with nonstationarity in the mean and variance see fig 1 h 1 and h 2 are obtained from the dispersion measures calculated by considering l cv which is analogous to the coefficient of variation in addition these dispersion measures do not consider the nonstationarity therefore if sites with nonstationary location and or scale parameters are included in a region h 1 and h 2 can easily be affected by the magnitude of nonstationarity i e slope of trend and proportion of sites exhibiting a trend in the region on the contrary h 3 is calculated using the l skewness and l kurtosis whose formulas are composed of shape parameters alone therefore h 3 is minimally affected by nonstationary location and or scale parameters at each site for all synthetic regions where the shape parameter is assumed to be constant and identical for all sites h 3 classifies these regions as homogeneous regardless of rns in addition a representative region that included five sites with a trend rns 50 was considered as homogeneous according to h 3 h 3 0 70 whereas h 1 and h 2 classified this region as a definitely and possibly heterogeneous region respectively h 1 2 08 and h 2 1 03 for both synthetic and representative regions the ns pif method which considers only the shape parameter as a regional parameter and nonstationary location and scale parameters as at site parameters outperformed ns afa and all other ns if methods therefore although h 3 does not consider the nonstationary characteristics of a region this measure can be employed as a test of homogeneity for ns pif application the simulation results for both synthetic and representative regions showed that ns pif outperformed the other methods according to both the rrmser and rbiasr values of the quantile estimates the median of rbiasr for ns pif was the closest to 0 regardless of t whereas ns if1 and ns if2 which standardize the observation data using at site sample statistics such as the time dependent mean standard deviation and mean deviation led to underestimation of the quantiles this implies that quantile underestimation caused by the use of at site sample statistic as the site specific scaling factor basu and srinivas 2013 2016 stedinger 1983 sveinsson et al 2001 remains a problem in ns if1 and ns if2 methods ns afa yielded good performance for a low return period t 20 years however as t increases ns afa tended to overestimate the quantiles and had the highest rrmser to analyze the performance of all employed methods in more detail we investigated the accuracy i e the closeness of between the estimates and the true value and precision i e the degree of variability in the estimates of the at site parameter estimates of all studied methods fig 7 illustrates box plots of the at site gev parameter estimates of the employed methods for the representative region of the case study the red cross marked in the box plots indicates the true parameters at the present time t n for the location and scale parameters fig 7 a and 7 b the performances of ns afa ns if2 and ns pif are better than those of ns if1 in terms of both accuracy and precision ns if1 shows the worst accuracy and precision particularly at sites that exhibit a trend sites 112 143 168 211 and 221 moreover ns afa shows large variations in shape parameter estimates compared to other regional methods fig 7 c which is a significant problem for the quantile estimation of ns afa faulkner et al 2020 both ns if1 and ns if2 underestimate the shape parameters this underestimation of the shape parameter is consistent with the problem caused by using sample statistics as the site specific scaling factor in the if methods described by stedinger 1983 ns pif outperforms the other methods in both accuracy and precision these results indicate that the ns pif method has the advantages of both at site and regional methods in addition compared to the quantile estimation results of st if the quantiles estimated by ns pif are higher for sites where an increasing trend is detected but are very similar or slightly lower for sites with no trend see table 7 these results confirm that ns pif provides reasonable rainfall quantiles considering the site specific trends note that quantile estimates for sites with ns gev 1 1 0 increase by 18 6 22 7 whereas those for sites with ns gev 1 0 0 increase by 4 7 11 7 this indicates that the design quantile estimates could be much larger when the increasing trends in both the mean and variance are considered therefore we recommend carefully selecting the ns gev 1 1 0 to estimate reasonable quantiles under nonstationary conditions 6 conclusions in reality when applying various clustering methods in rfa a region may include sites where the observation data and or their statistical characteristics have a trend e g nam et al 2015 sun et al 2015 sung et al 2018 yin et al 2016 therefore it is reasonable to apply nonstationarity to each site individually when conducting ns rfa for such a region the ns pif method is a more flexible method that considers the nonstationarity of statistical characteristics differently at each site within a region through monte carlo simulations based on synthetic and representative regions under various nonstationary conditions we confirmed that the ns pif method can provide more accurate and precise quantile estimates than other existing ns if methods in particular the ns pif method exhibited the smallest bias of quantile estimates among all tested methods this result indicates that the ns pif method can solve the underestimation problem of existing ns if methods which arises from using sample statistics time dependent mean standard deviation and mean deviation as the site specific scaling factor in addition ns pif estimated reasonable rainfall quantiles by considering the site specific trends in the representative region the results of the simulation experiments and quantile estimates in sections 3 and 4 highlight the future potential of the ns pif method finally we recommend the ns pif method as the best candidate method for conducting ns rfa in this study two major limitations are identified that could be addressed in future studies first we evaluated the methods performance focusing on the rrmser t and rbiasr t of quantile estimates at the present time t n for an infrastructure design however the t year quantile is likely to be required for a specific future year in the planned lifetime of a hydraulic structure this may require extrapolation of trends and involve greater uncertainty in the quantile estimation results future studies should take into account the errors and uncertainty of quantile estimates during the future design life period in performance assessment second the heterogeneity measures h were considered to measure the regional homogeneity to the best of our knowledge there is still no homogeneity test that considers nonstationary characteristics in rfa among the widely used heterogeneity measures the h 3 was selected as a suitable measure for applying the ns pif method however it should be noted that the heterogeneity measure is obtained from the l moment based analysis which requires an ordered sample of data whereas parameters of the ns gev distribution are generally estimated by the mle this discrepancy in the estimation method may lead to a potential bias in quantile estimates in ns rfa in this regard the homogeneity test

375,anthropogenic climate change has led to nonstationarity in hydrological data and their statistical characteristics to consider nonstationarity in regional frequency analysis several nonstationary index flood ns if methods comprising a time dependent site specific scaling factor or nonstationary regional growth curves have been suggested however these methods have limitations related to underestimation from using sample statistics as a site specific scaling factor or considering nonstationarity only in regional parameters to overcome these drawbacks this study developed a nonstationary population index flood ns pif method that considers nonstationarity in the statistical characteristics at each site in a region based on nonstationary generalized extreme value distributions monte carlo simulations were conducted for synthetic regions under various nonstationary conditions to compare the performance of the ns pif method with those of existing ns if methods then the applicability of the ns pif method to real world data was assessed via monte carlo simulations of regions with annual maximum rainfall data in south korea the results indicated that the ns pif method can solve the underestimation problem inherent in existing ns if methods moreover the ns pif method yielded the best performance and provided more reliable and reasonable quantile estimates considering site specific trends in addition the heterogeneity measure based on l skewness and l kurtosis was identified as a suitable test of homogeneity for application of the proposed method keywords population index flood method nonstationary gev distribution heterogeneity measure monte carlo simulation regional frequency analysis design quantile estimates 1 introduction regional frequency analysis rfa has been widely used for estimating design quantiles for extreme hydrological events such as floods and heavy rainfalls the procedure generally consists of two major steps 1 regionalization of sites based on various hydro meteorological geographical and statistical characteristics and 2 estimation of design quantiles by fitting the probability distribution to the regional data because rfa uses more observations from a hydrologically homogeneous region than at site frequency analysis afa the estimated quantiles based on rfa are more reliable especially for sites with a short record length or sites lacking observations alila 1999 de michele and rosso 2001 hosking and wallis 1997 lettenmaier et al 1987 nam et al 2015 the index flood if method proposed by dalrymple 1960 is one of the most common regional models used for estimating quantiles in rfa the fundamental assumption of the if method is that observation data from different sites in a homogeneous region have the same probability distribution termed the regional growth curve except for the site specific scaling factor i e if or index function therefore the regional growth curve is estimated using regional data normalized by the site specific scaling factor in accordance with previously outlined guidelines for design quantile estimation e g hosking and wallis 1997 natural environment research council 1975 the use of at site sample statistics as the site specific scaling factor has become popular fowler and kilsby 2003 nam et al 2015 smithers and schulze 2001 xu et al 2012 yin et al 2016 however this can lead to underestimation of quantile estimates and of the skewness and kurtosis of regional growth curves basu and srinivas 2013 2016 stedinger 1983 sveinsson et al 2001 stedinger 1983 explained that regional growth curves calculated from dimensionless data scaled by the at site sample mean can have smaller coefficients of skewness and kurtosis than those calculated from the original data moreover sveinsson et al 2001 emphasized that using the at site sample mean as the if can lead to distortion and underestimation of quantiles as an alternative they suggested the population index flood pif method which considers the unknown at site population statistics as the site specific scaling factor in order to compensate for problems related to the use of at site sample statistics the authors then conducted simulation experiments based on the generalized extreme value gev distribution to compare the performance of the pif method and if method proposed by hosking and wallis 1997 the pif method with the maximum likelihood estimation mle yielded the best performance for 0 95 and 0 99 quantiles eldardiry et al 2015 employed the pif method for estimating radar based rainfall quantiles they identified that the pif method results in the reduction in uncertainty of quantile estimates basu and srinivas 2016 evaluated the performance of several if and pif methods for estimating quantiles at ungauged sites using monte carlo simulations and a case study the pif method which utilizes regional information on the first two l moments revealed the best quantile estimation performance at ungauged sites these previous studies comparing the performance of if and pif methods were based on the stationary assumption of hydrological data however under the influence of climate change and urbanization nonstationarity has been observed in hydrological data e g trend and long term variability and is an important issue in hydrological systems jain and lall 2000 2001 mallakpour and villarini 2015 milly et al 2008 olsen et al 1999 prosdocimi et al 2015 salas et al 2018 few studies have proposed the nonstationary if ns if method for rfa which employs a time dependent site specific scaling factor and or nonstationary regional growth curves cunderlik and burn 2003 cunderlik and ouarda 2006 hanel et al 2009 markiewicz et al 2006a o brien and burn 2014 roth et al 2012 sung et al 2018 hanel et al 2009 and o brien and burn 2014 applied the nonstationary gev ns gev distributions to regional growth curves the trend components of gev parameters were assumed to be identical for all sites in a region therefore sites exhibiting nonstationarity with the same trend sign were clustered into one region however this can be a limitation when considering hydro meteorological or geographical characteristics for regionalization the ns if method based on detrending is a more flexible concept of nonstationary rfa ns rfa which considers the nonstationarity of statistical characteristics at each site individually cunderlik and burn 2003 cunderlik and ouarda 2006 markiewicz et al 2006a sung et al 2018 cunderlik and burn 2003 proposed the ns rfa procedure using a second order nonstationary approach that assumes nonstationarity in the first two moments of the data by using the trend components in the mean and variance of the original at site data as site specific scaling factors the data were transformed to a second order stationary time series the regional growth curves were estimated using several probability distributions subsequently markiewicz et al 2006a proposed the ns if method which employs the index function consisting of the time dependent at site sample mean and mean deviation as the site specific scaling factors the trend of the original at site data was removed by the index function and the time independent regional growth curve was estimated from the detrended data sung et al 2018 also removed the trend at each site using the time dependent index function before estimating stationary regional growth curves in the ns if methods used in the abovementioned studies at site trend components were estimated and removed from the original at site data that is the trend components of the at site sample were used as site specific scaling factors therefore these ns if methods could still cause distortion and underestimation of quantiles to solve this problem this study aims to 1 develop a nonstationary population index flood ns pif method that considers the nonstationarity of statistical characteristics at each site based on ns gev distributions 2 compare the performance of the ns pif method and existing methods and 3 identify the feasibility of ns pif method application to actual extreme rainfall data the ns pif and other existing methods are evaluated by conducting simulation experiments in a similar manner to that reported in hosking and wallis 1997 to investigate the performance of the employed methods according to the various nonstationary characteristics of a region synthetic regions are designed based on ns gev distributions the homogeneity of these synthetic regions is tested using heterogeneity measures the accuracy of the quantile estimates for the tested methods is then evaluated using the regional average relative root mean square error rrmser and relative bias rbiasr in addition a case study is employed to explore the performance and applicability of the ns pif method using annual maximum daily rainfall data of representative rainfall gauges evenly distributed throughout south korea the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the ns pif method based on several types of ns gev distributions and explain the existing ns if methods employed for performance comparisons with the proposed method in addition we describe the heterogeneity measures widely used as a test of regional homogeneity in rfa the design and results of the simulation experiment are presented in section 3 section 4 describes the results of the case study for south korea the assessment results and feasibility of the ns pif method are discussed in section 5 finally section 6 presents the conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 nonstationary gev probability distributions gev distribution is one of the most widely used distributions for conventional frequency analysis of extreme events such as floods extreme rainfall and maximum wind speeds el adlouni et al 2007 jenkinson 1955 integrated the gumbel fréchet and weibull families into the gev distribution with a cumulative distribution function f x as shown in eq 1 1 f x exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ where μ σ 0 and ξ are the location scale and shape parameters respectively for ξ 0 fréchet it is valid for μ σ ξ x whereas for ξ 0 weibull it is valid for x μ σ ξ when ξ 0 gumbel x the mean ε standard deviation s and quantile function qt of the gev distribution can be expressed as a function of these parameters as follows 2 ε μ σ ξ γ 1 ξ 1 3 s σ ξ 2 γ 1 2 ξ γ 2 1 ξ 4 q t μ σ ξ 1 l n 1 1 t ξ where γ is the gamma function and t is the return period the most common approach for taking nonstationarity into account in frequency analysis is to express one or more distribution parameters as a function of time varying covariates representing the effect of temporal trend seasonality or climate variability on the frequency or magnitude of extreme events e g ouarda and charron 2019 sun et al 2015 tramblay et al 2013 villarini et al 2009 2010 when time t is used as the covariate the gev parameters can be defined as a pth degree polynomial function of t a logarithmic link function is used to ensure a positive value of the scale parameter regardless of t coles 2001 although high degree polynomial functions can be used to define nonstationary parameters they can lead to an overfitting problem beguería et al 2011 a linear function is generally used to model the parameters of the distribution as such function can account for the trend in the hydrological data and also meets the principle of parameter parsimony cheng and aghakouchak 2014 el adlouni et al 2007 garcía et al 2007 kharin and zwiers 2005 kim et al 2017 mailhot et al 2010 sarhadi and soulis 2017 in this study the location and scale parameters of the ns gev distribution are respectively defined as linear and log linear functions of t the shape parameter is assumed to be constant over t because it is difficult to estimate it reliably even in stationary models coles 2001 salas et al 2018 table 1 presents the stationary gev st gev distribution and ns gev distributions used in this study the 0 s and 1 s in the notation of gev distributions indicate the polynomial degree p i e st gev 0 0 0 assumes that all parameters are constant ns gev 1 0 0 assumes that the location parameter is allowed to vary linearly with respect to t and ns gev 1 1 0 assumes that the location and scale parameters vary linearly and log linearly with respect to t the time dependent mean ε t standard deviation s t and quantile function qt t of ns gev distribution are given by eqs 5 7 5 ε t μ t σ t ξ γ 1 ξ 1 6 s t σ t ξ 2 γ 1 2 ξ γ 2 1 ξ 7 q t t μ t σ t ξ 1 l n 1 1 t ξ 2 2 nonstationary population index flood method the pif method proposed by sveinsson et al 2001 utilizes the statistical properties of the assumed population distribution at each site e g population mean and population standard deviation as a site specific scaling factor the regional model based on this concept was first introduced by boes et al 1989 let q t i and θ i i 1 2 n respectively denote the t year quantile and site specific scaling factors of the assumed population distribution at site i in a homogeneous region with n sites q t i can be normalized by an index function g θ i consisting of the population parameters at site i the concept behind the pif method assumes that the normalized t year quantile g q t i θ i is identical for all sites in a homogeneous region to this end two types of index functions include either the population mean ε i or the population mean ε i and the population standard deviation si at site i as follows sveinsson et al 2001 8 g 1 q t i ε i s i q t i ε i s i i 1 2 n 9 g 2 q t i ε i q t i ε i i 1 2 n where n is the number of sites in a homogeneous region to apply nonstationarity to the pif method the index function can be redefined in terms of time dependent site specific scaling factors i e ε i t and si t of the assumed nonstationary population distribution as follows 10 g 1 q t i t ε i t s i t q t i t ε i t s i t i 1 2 n 11 g 2 q t i t ε i t q t i t ε i t i 1 2 n when ns gev 1 1 0 is assumed to be a population distribution eqs 5 7 can be substituted into eqs 10 and 11 then g 1 implies that the shape parameter ξ i is identical at all sites thus the number of parameters in a region is reduced from 5n to 4n 1 likewise g 2 implies that ξ i and μ i t σ i t are identical at all sites thus the number of parameters in a region is reduced from 5n to 3n 2 this study considers the ns pif method based on the index function g 1 referred to as ns pif because it is a more flexible method which considers nonstationarity differently in the mean and variance at each site in a region based on the ns gev distribution listed in table 1 the sample at site i is denoted as x 1 i x 2 i x n i i where ni is the sample size at site i then the log likelihood function ln l of ns pif based on ns gev 1 1 0 is given by 12 ln l i 1 n t 1 n i σ 0 i σ 1 i t 1 ξ r 1 i 1 n t 1 n i ln 1 ξ r x t i μ 0 i μ 1 i t e x p σ 0 i σ 1 i t i 1 n t 1 n i 1 ξ r x t i μ 0 i μ 1 i t e x p σ 0 i σ 1 i t 1 ξ r if ns gev 1 0 0 is assumed to be a population distribution at site i the trend component of the scale parameters at site i σ1 i is set to zero in the case of st gev 0 0 0 the trend components of both location and scale parameters μ1 i and σ1 i are set to zero the partial derivatives of the log likelihood function of ns pif are presented in appendix a 2 3 nonstationary index flood method based on detrending the if method introduced by dalrymple 1960 has been widely used in rfa and has the following basic assumptions 1 observation data at each site are independent and identically distributed 2 there is no dependence between data observed at different sites and 3 the frequency distribution of the observation data in a homogeneous region is identical excluding the site specific scaling factor i e if or index function the t year quantile at site i q t i in a homogeneous region with n sites is given by eq 13 13 q t i ω i q t i 1 2 n where ω i is the site specific scaling factor at site i and qt is the regional growth curve with respect to the return period t which is a dimensionless quantile function for every site in a region the sample mean of the observation data at site i is generally used as ω i dimensionless data which are normalized by dividing the observation data by ω i are used to obtain the regional growth curve qt in the case that nonstationarity of the statistical characteristics at each site is considered the time dependent site specific scaling factor can be applied to the if method in other words after the trend observed in the original at site data is removed by the time dependent site specific scaling factor qt is estimated using the detrended data when the first two statistical moments of at site data are assumed to be nonstationary e g cunderlik and burn 2003 markiewicz et al 2006a the time dependent mean ε i t and standardized deviation si t at site i can be defined as a linear function as follows 14 ε i t ε 0 i ε 1 i t 15 s i t s 0 i s 1 i t the parameters of ε i t and si t are conveniently derived from least squares regression as 16 min ε i t t 1 n i x t i ε i t 2 17 min s i t t 1 n i e i 2 t s i 2 t 2 where ei t x t i ε i t then the detrended data y t i are obtained by standardization 18 y t i t x t i ε i t s i t for a region with n sites the regional growth curve qt for y t i i 1 2 n is estimated by the l moments approach then the quantile at site i is given by 19 q t i t ε i t s i t q t ns if1 the mean deviation about the mean which is one of the dispersion measure statistics of random variable can be considered as an alternative to the standard deviation markiewicz et al 2006b when the time dependent mean deviation δ i t δ0 δ1 t is used as the site specific scaling factor for the second statistical moment eqs 17 19 are substituted by eqs 20 22 respectively 20 min δ i t t 1 n i e i t δ i t 2 21 y t i t x t i ε i t δ i t 22 q t i t ε i t δ i t q t ns if2 2 4 heterogeneity measure the heterogeneity measure h proposed by hosking and wallis 1993 is commonly adopted in rfa to test the regional homogeneity this statistic is obtained from dispersion measures that can be defined as the sum of errors between the at site sample l moment ratios and regional average l moment ratios the weighted standard deviation v 1 considering only the l coefficient of variation l cv is given by 23 v 1 i 1 n n i t i t r 2 i 1 n n i 1 2 where n i and ti are the sample size and the sample l cv at site i respectively and tr is the regional average l cv the heterogeneity measure h 1 can be calculated by comparing the variability of l cv in the region with that expected for simulated regions as follows 24 h 1 v 1 μ v 1 s v 1 where μ v 1 and s v 1 are the mean and standard deviation of v 1 estimated from the simulated regions generated from the kappa distribution fitted to the regional average l moment ratios the heterogeneity measure can be extended by replacing l cv with other measures such as l skewness and l kurtosis depending on which l moments are used for the weighted standard deviation v 2 and v 3 can be defined as follows 25 v 2 i 1 n n i t i t r 2 t 3 i t 3 r 2 1 2 i 1 n n i 26 v 3 i 1 n n i t 3 i t 3 r 2 t 4 i t 4 r 2 1 2 i 1 n n i where t 3 i and t 4 i are the sample l skewness and l kurtosis at site i and t 3 r and t 4 r are the regional average l skewness and l kurtosis respectively then h 2 and h 3 are given by 27 h 2 v 2 μ v 2 s v 2 28 h 3 v 3 μ v 3 s v 3 a region is defined as acceptably homogeneous region when h 1 possibly heterogeneous when 1 h 2 and definitely heterogeneous when 2 h hosking and wallis 1993 3 simulation experiment 3 1 design of the synthetic region in the rfa procedure regionalization can be conducted by various clustering methods e g geographical convenience subjective partitioning objective partitioning and cluster analysis the homogeneity of the formed region is generally tested by the heterogeneity measures however even if sites have data and or their statistical characteristics with a trend the region may still be considered as a homogeneous region in this study monte carlo simulations are conducted to investigate the heterogeneity measures and to evaluate the methods performance according to the nonstationary rate of a region rns 30 50 70 and 100 which indicates the proportion of sites with a trend in a region according to the type of ns gev distribution used to generate nonstationary at site samples three cases of synthetic regions ns gev 1 0 0 ns gev 1 1 0 and ns gev mix cases are considered in the ns gev 1 0 0 case nonstationary at site samples in a region are generated by the ns gev 1 0 0 distribution with a trend in the mean value in the ns gev 1 1 0 case nonstationary at site data in a region are generated by the ns gev 1 1 0 distribution with a trend in both the mean and variance in the ns gev mix case both ns gev 1 0 0 and ns gev 1 1 0 distributions are included in a region a synthetic region of each case is designed based on the number of sites n 10 the sample size at the site i ni 50 and the regional averages of gev parameters μ0 r μ1 r σ0 r σ1 r ξ r the heterogeneity of a region is considered through the slope of the location and scale parameters μ1 i and σ1 i the first and last nonstationary sites in a region have μ1 i μ1 r μ1 r 2 σ1 i σ1 r σ1 r 2 and μ1 i μ1 r μ1 r 2 σ1 i σ1 r σ1 r 2 respectively the μ1 i and σ1 i values of the other nonstationary sites vary linearly other gev parameters are the same for all sites in a region i e μ0 i μ0 r σ0 i σ0 r ξ i ξ r the regional average values of gev parameters are determined based on previous simulation experiments cannon 2010 el adlouni et al 2007 as follows μ0 r 0 μ1 r 0 1 σ0 r 1 σ1 r 0 02 and ξ r 0 1 the specifications of all synthetic regions are presented in tables 2 4 the monte carlo simulations are repeated 1 000 times for each iteration step the heterogeneity measures h 1 h 2 and h 3 are obtained and quantiles are estimated using the ns pif and other existing ns if methods ns if1 and ns if2 as well as nonstationary at site frequency analysis ns afa table 5 summarizes the quantile estimation procedures of the employed methods using the synthetic region rns 50 of the ns gev mix case as an example 3 2 evaluation criteria to compare the performance of the employed methods without the influence of the data scale the regional rrmse rrmser and regional rbias rbiasr are used as evaluation criteria in the simulation experiment the rrmser measures the accuracy of the estimated quantiles by considering the overall deviation between the estimated and true quantiles rbiasr measures the magnitude of over or underestimation for the estimated quantiles by averaging the differences between the estimated and true quantiles the rrmser and rbiasr at time t are calculated using eqs 29 and 30 respectively 29 r r m s e r t 1 n i 1 n q t i t q t i t q t i t 2 100 30 r b i a s r t 1 n i 1 n q t i t q t i t q t i t 100 here q t i t is the time dependent quantile estimate for return period t at site i and q t i t is the true quantile for return period t at site i the rrmser and rbiasr are calculated for the present time t ni 3 3 simulation results 3 3 1 heterogeneity measure the heterogeneity measures are obtained for each iteration of the simulation experiment fig 1 presents the box plots of h 1 h 2 and h 3 for simulated regions according to the rns in the ns gev 1 0 0 case the region with rns 30 can be considered as the homogeneous region because the majority of all heterogeneity measures are less than 2 as γ ns increases from 30 to 70 h 1 and h 2 also increase for the region with rns 100 however the median values of h 1 and h 2 decrease substantially to approximately 2 on the contrary the majority of h 3 values are less than 1 and exhibit minimal variation with rns in the ns gev 1 1 0 case although all heterogeneity measures decrease compared to those of the ns gev 1 0 0 case h 1 and h 2 still increase as rns increases from 30 to 70 note that the majority of h 3 values are less than 1 regardless of rns the results of the ns gev mix case are similar to those of the ns gev 1 0 0 case except that the heterogeneity measures for the region with rns 100 are larger in summary for regions including sites with nonstationarity in the mean and variance h 3 exhibits minimal dependence on rns whereas h 1 and h 2 are sensitive to rns 3 3 2 performance assessment for each iteration step of the simulation experiment the rrmser and rbiasr values of the quantile estimates are calculated for each method ns afa ns pif ns if1 and ns if2 for four return periods t 20 50

interwhisker ranges of ns pif are also the smallest for all t and rns note that the results of ns if1 and ns if2 are the same because the variance trend is not considered in the ns gev 1 0 0 case in contrast ns afa gray box has the highest rrmser for all t and rns in addition its median value interquartile range and interwhisker ranges increase rapidly as t increases in the ns gev 1 1 0 case fig 2 b the rrmser s of all tested methods increase slightly as rns increases ns pif has the lowest rrmser for all t whereas ns if2 purple box and ns if1 blue box show the second and third lowest rrmser respectively the results of the ns gev mix case fig 2 c are similar to those of the ns gev 1 1 0 case fig 3 shows the box plots of rbiasr of quantile estimates for 1000 simulations of the synthetic regions in the three ns gev cases in the ns gev 1 0 0 case fig 3 a the median interquartile range and interwhisker range of rbiasr for all tested methods are almost the same for t 20 years however as t increases the ns afa and ns if methods tend to over and underestimate the quantiles respectively in contrast ns pif yields better performance for all t in the ns gev 1 1 0 and ns gev mix cases figs 3 b and 3 c ns if1 and ns if2 result in substantially greater underestimation of quantiles compared to the ns gev 1 0 0 case note that the performance of ns if methods is more affected by rns compared to that of ns pif ns if methods underestimate the quantiles more as rns increases whereas ns pif yields a better performance regardless of rns 4 case study ns pif performance was investigated using simulation experiments with synthetic regional data and compared with the performance of other existing methods in section 3 for the simulation experiments however all sites within a region have the same record length and time independent gev parameter values therefore to assess the real world applicability of ns pif monte carlo simulations are performed with actual data and their performances were evaluated through comparisons with other tested methods in addition to investigate the practicality of quantiles considering the site specific trend the quantile estimation results of ns pif are compared to those of the stationary if method st if eq 13 4 1 regional data annual maximum am daily rainfall data observed at 10 rainfall gauging sites evenly distributed throughout south korea are used for the case study first the mann kendall test is used to investigate the presence of trends in the am daily rainfall data at each site sites with no trend are assumed to have st gev 0 0 0 for sites where a trend is detected the akaike information criterion aic is employed to select the appropriate distribution between ns gev 1 0 0 and ns gev 1 1 0 kim et al 2017 fig 4 presents the location of the sites included in the representative region of this study rns 50 and table 6 shows the basic information including the sample size n selected gev distribution results of the mann kendall test at a significance level of 0 1 and signs of slope parameters μ1 and σ1 for each site prior to the simulation experiments the homogeneity and spatial dependence of the representative region are tested using the heterogeneity measures h 1 h 2 and h 3 and average inter site correlation γ the values of h 1 h 2 and h 3 are 2 08 1 03 and 0 70 respectively although the h 1 value indicates that the region is heterogeneous the region is considered as homogeneous based on h 2 and h 3 values the value of γ is calculated as 0 16 therefore the representative region is assumed to be a spatially independent and homogeneous region for assessing the performance of ns pif 4 2 performance assessment simulation experiments are conducted to compare the performance of ns pif and other tested methods for the representative region the region is simulated with the same number of sites sample size and selected gev distribution at each site as presented in table 6 to consider the homogeneity of the region the regional average values of at site shape parameters are employed to generate the data quantiles are estimated following the quantile estimation procedures described in table 5 for sites with no trend all trend parameters in the tested methods i e μ1 i σ1 i ε1 i s 1 i and δ1 i are set to zero for sites with a trend and in which ns gev 1 0 0 is selected trend parameters related to the variance i e σ1 i s 1 i and δ1 i are set to zero for sites with a trend and in which ns gev 1 1 0 is selected all trend parameters are estimated the simulation experiments are iterated 1000 times and the performance of the applied methods is assessed based on the rrmser and rbiasr values of the quantile estimates the simulation procedure for the representative region is demonstrated in fig 5 fig 6 presents the box plots of rrmser and rbiasr values of the quantile estimates for 1000 simulations of the representative region as shown in the simulation results for synthetic regions with rns 50 in the ns gev mix case see figs 2 c and 3 c ns pif has the lowest median interquartile range and interwhisker range of rrmser for all t ns afa shows a better performance for t 20 years as t increases however the rrmser values of ns afa increase more rapidly than in other regional methods the medians of rbiasr values for ns pif are stable regardless of t whereas ns afa and ns if methods tend to over and underestimate the quantiles respectively as t increases consequently simulation studies for the representative region and for various synthetic regions confirmed that ns pif is a more appropriate method for considering site specific trends 4 3 quantile estimation results table 7 presents the quantile estimation results of ns pif and st if for the representative region for sites where a trend is detected and ns gev distributions are selected as appropriate distributions with an increasing trend sites 112 143 168 211 and 221 the quantile estimates of ns pif are 4 7 22 7 greater than those of the st if method specifically for sites 112 143 and 168 where nonstationarity is considered in both the mean and variance the quantile estimates increase by approximately 20 for all values of t for sites where st gev 0 0 0 is selected as an appropriate distribution the quantile estimates of ns pif decrease slightly by 2 2 5 4 except for site 105 where the rate of change in quantile estimates is less than 1 5 summary and discussion in this study an ns pif regional method is proposed by using the ns gev distribution the proposed ns pif method can consider site specific trends by assuming various st and ns gev distributions as population distributions at each site within a region to investigate the heterogeneity measures and to evaluate the methods performance according to the rns value of a region monte carlo simulations were conducted for both synthetic and real world regions under various nonstationary conditions of ns gev distributions the simulation results of heterogeneity measures showed that h 1 and h 2 are highly sensitive to the rns value of the region including sites with nonstationarity in the mean and variance see fig 1 h 1 and h 2 are obtained from the dispersion measures calculated by considering l cv which is analogous to the coefficient of variation in addition these dispersion measures do not consider the nonstationarity therefore if sites with nonstationary location and or scale parameters are included in a region h 1 and h 2 can easily be affected by the magnitude of nonstationarity i e slope of trend and proportion of sites exhibiting a trend in the region on the contrary h 3 is calculated using the l skewness and l kurtosis whose formulas are composed of shape parameters alone therefore h 3 is minimally affected by nonstationary location and or scale parameters at each site for all synthetic regions where the shape parameter is assumed to be constant and identical for all sites h 3 classifies these regions as homogeneous regardless of rns in addition a representative region that included five sites with a trend rns 50 was considered as homogeneous according to h 3 h 3 0 70 whereas h 1 and h 2 classified this region as a definitely and possibly heterogeneous region respectively h 1 2 08 and h 2 1 03 for both synthetic and representative regions the ns pif method which considers only the shape parameter as a regional parameter and nonstationary location and scale parameters as at site parameters outperformed ns afa and all other ns if methods therefore although h 3 does not consider the nonstationary characteristics of a region this measure can be employed as a test of homogeneity for ns pif application the simulation results for both synthetic and representative regions showed that ns pif outperformed the other methods according to both the rrmser and rbiasr values of the quantile estimates the median of rbiasr for ns pif was the closest to 0 regardless of t whereas ns if1 and ns if2 which standardize the observation data using at site sample statistics such as the time dependent mean standard deviation and mean deviation led to underestimation of the quantiles this implies that quantile underestimation caused by the use of at site sample statistic as the site specific scaling factor basu and srinivas 2013 2016 stedinger 1983 sveinsson et al 2001 remains a problem in ns if1 and ns if2 methods ns afa yielded good performance for a low return period t 20 years however as t increases ns afa tended to overestimate the quantiles and had the highest rrmser to analyze the performance of all employed methods in more detail we investigated the accuracy i e the closeness of between the estimates and the true value and precision i e the degree of variability in the estimates of the at site parameter estimates of all studied methods fig 7 illustrates box plots of the at site gev parameter estimates of the employed methods for the representative region of the case study the red cross marked in the box plots indicates the true parameters at the present time t n for the location and scale parameters fig 7 a and 7 b the performances of ns afa ns if2 and ns pif are better than those of ns if1 in terms of both accuracy and precision ns if1 shows the worst accuracy and precision particularly at sites that exhibit a trend sites 112 143 168 211 and 221 moreover ns afa shows large variations in shape parameter estimates compared to other regional methods fig 7 c which is a significant problem for the quantile estimation of ns afa faulkner et al 2020 both ns if1 and ns if2 underestimate the shape parameters this underestimation of the shape parameter is consistent with the problem caused by using sample statistics as the site specific scaling factor in the if methods described by stedinger 1983 ns pif outperforms the other methods in both accuracy and precision these results indicate that the ns pif method has the advantages of both at site and regional methods in addition compared to the quantile estimation results of st if the quantiles estimated by ns pif are higher for sites where an increasing trend is detected but are very similar or slightly lower for sites with no trend see table 7 these results confirm that ns pif provides reasonable rainfall quantiles considering the site specific trends note that quantile estimates for sites with ns gev 1 1 0 increase by 18 6 22 7 whereas those for sites with ns gev 1 0 0 increase by 4 7 11 7 this indicates that the design quantile estimates could be much larger when the increasing trends in both the mean and variance are considered therefore we recommend carefully selecting the ns gev 1 1 0 to estimate reasonable quantiles under nonstationary conditions 6 conclusions in reality when applying various clustering methods in rfa a region may include sites where the observation data and or their statistical characteristics have a trend e g nam et al 2015 sun et al 2015 sung et al 2018 yin et al 2016 therefore it is reasonable to apply nonstationarity to each site individually when conducting ns rfa for such a region the ns pif method is a more flexible method that considers the nonstationarity of statistical characteristics differently at each site within a region through monte carlo simulations based on synthetic and representative regions under various nonstationary conditions we confirmed that the ns pif method can provide more accurate and precise quantile estimates than other existing ns if methods in particular the ns pif method exhibited the smallest bias of quantile estimates among all tested methods this result indicates that the ns pif method can solve the underestimation problem of existing ns if methods which arises from using sample statistics time dependent mean standard deviation and mean deviation as the site specific scaling factor in addition ns pif estimated reasonable rainfall quantiles by considering the site specific trends in the representative region the results of the simulation experiments and quantile estimates in sections 3 and 4 highlight the future potential of the ns pif method finally we recommend the ns pif method as the best candidate method for conducting ns rfa in this study two major limitations are identified that could be addressed in future studies first we evaluated the methods performance focusing on the rrmser t and rbiasr t of quantile estimates at the present time t n for an infrastructure design however the t year quantile is likely to be required for a specific future year in the planned lifetime of a hydraulic structure this may require extrapolation of trends and involve greater uncertainty in the quantile estimation results future studies should take into account the errors and uncertainty of quantile estimates during the future design life period in performance assessment second the heterogeneity measures h were considered to measure the regional homogeneity to the best of our knowledge there is still no homogeneity test that considers nonstationary characteristics in rfa among the widely used heterogeneity measures the h 3 was selected as a suitable measure for applying the ns pif method however it should be noted that the heterogeneity measure is obtained from the l moment based analysis which requires an ordered sample of data whereas parameters of the ns gev distribution are generally estimated by the mle this discrepancy in the estimation method may lead to a potential bias in quantile estimates in ns rfa in this regard the homogeneity test

376,this study presents the development refinement and application of a 3 d multiphase flow model for the simulation of tsunami propagation on land and its hydrodynamic force on a coastal building the model is based on the volume surface integrated average based multi moment method vsiam3 with improved accuracy by adopting the temporary moment tm method to update the non normal flow variables a third order gradient approximation is chosen for the reconstruction of an interpolation profile in the cip cls3 advection solver to further reduce numerical diffusion and suppress numerical oscillation the moving interface between air water is captured by using the volume of fluid vof method the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc scheme is used to reproduce a sharp and smear less air water interface the model performance improved by as much as 16 in the estimation of impact force on the downstream wall in the dam break flow benchmarking problem by refining the original vsiam3 model the robustness of the model is further demonstrated by the accurate reproduction of tsunami wave propagation speed and its hydrodynamic pressures on a single box shaped obstacle the wave induced pressures on the front face of the obstacle are accurately reproduced with a maximum of 10 difference compared with the hydraulic experimental results thus the study shows that the overall robustness and hydrodynamic performance of the model can be improved by refining the original model keywords vsiam3 temporary moments dam break flow tsunami waves hydrodynamic pressure 1 introduction tsunami is one of the deadliest natural disasters in the last two decades tsunami disaster has claimed more than 250 000 lives and billions of dollars in economic losses 2004 indian ocean tsunami 2011 tohoku tsunami and 2018 sulawesi island tsunami combined video recordings from these events have demonstrated the destructive force of tsunami waves on coastal structures besides coastal structures inland structures also succumbed to damage due to the inland propagation of tsunami waves although tsunami warning could reduce casualties the damage brought by tsunami wave on coastal and inland structures could paralyze the coastal city for months and even years in some cases over the past decades researchers have conducted numerous experimental studies to improve the design guidelines for coastal structures asakura et al 2002 yeh 2007 arikawa 2009 triatmadja and nurhasanah 2012 shafiei et al 2016 wüthrich et al 2018 moon et al 2019b however numerical simulation of tsunami has become one of the cost effective means for tsunami defense work and coastal structure design with the advent of computers douglas and nistor 2015 sarjamee et al 2017 wei et al 2018 qin et al 2018 kihara and kaida 2019 depth integrated numerical models are normally based on the nonlinear shallow water equation journeau et al 2019 shiach et al 2004 or the boussinesq type equation kirby et al 1998 filippini et al 2016 kazolea et al 2014 liu et al 1995 these models have been widely used and performed well in reproducing wave dynamics in offshore and nearshore regions journeau et al 2019 and utilized for large scale simulation wijetunge et al 2008 however the nonlinearity of flow at the surf zone poses tremendous challenges to depth integrated models due to the complicated surface deformation involving overturning of waves jet plunging splash up breaking coalescing of water droplets and other 3 d flow structures pringle et al 2016 fujima et al 2002 simulating accurate surface configuration of wave onshore is especially critical in wave structure interaction because the surface configuration is related to the resultant hydrodynamic force shuto 1991 accurate bore propagation can only be achieved if the breaking wave dynamics are properly reproduced brocchini and dodd 2008 to overcome the deficiencies of the depth integrated model the navier stokes equation is used to simulate the wave hydrodynamics nearshore and wave structure interaction the lagrangian based smooth particle hydrodynamic sph method has been used to solve the navier stokes equation in the simulation of plunging breaking and spilling of waves shao 2006 shao and ji 2006 in the development of design guidelines for a coastal structure st germain et al 2013 carried out sph modeling of the wave impact on a column such a study obtained agreement with the experimental results in terms of the reproduction of water surface profile and horizontal force successful simulation of wave breaking based on the eulerian approach can be seen in the work of lin and liu 1998 watanabe et al 2005 lubin et al 2011 and xie 2013 the volume of fluid vof method is adopted for free surface representation the vof method has been employed to solve the advection of water surface in marine applications roenby et al 2017 the reliability and robustness of the vof model in reproducing breaking waves have garnered popularity in the simulation of hydrodynamic forces on coastal structures cho et al 2017 hsiao and lin 2010 xiao and huang 2008 evaluated the wave forces and overturning moment on a beach house by using a 2 d model solving reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with the vof method a complex wave dynamics such as the development of vortex filament during the early stage of wave plunging was successfully modeled with the vof techniques by lubin and glockner 2015 free surface representation with the geometric vof method involves interface reconstruction and advection the widely used geometrical reconstruction technique is piecewise linear interface calculation plic scheme which can be complicated to apply in 3 d problems xiao et al 2011 kawano 2016 to avoid the geometric reconstruction of the interface algebraic techniques such as compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes cicsam and tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc are available christensen 2006 and xie 2013 demonstrated successful applications of cicsam in simulating wave breaking in the surf zone the application of the thinc scheme in the simulation of tsunami wave run up can be seen in the work of xie and xiao 2014b and cheng et al 2017 the algebraic vof method with the thinc scheme was comparable with the conventional plic method in reproducing a sharp and smear less interface xiao et al 2011 tsunami waves break and undergo complex deformation with abrupt temporal and spatial changes in pressure during the impingement on coastal structures numerical simulation of such an impulsive motion demands a robust and efficient momentum solver xiao et al 2005b proposed the volume surface integrated average based multi moment method vsiam3 as a numerical framework to solve the incompressible and compressible flows the vsiam3 framework inherits the conservative property of the finite volume method fvm because the governing equations are cast in the conservative form xiao et al 2005b two types of integrated moments are used namely the volume integrated average via and surface integrated average sia of the flow variables the advection term in the momentum equation is solved using a conservative advection transport solver known as the constrained interpolation profile conservative semi lagrangian cip csl scheme by utilizing the via and sia moments yabe et al 2001 the performance of the vsiam3 framework has been proven in several applications simulation of air water multiphase flow interaction in the design of ceramic sanitary ware ikebata et al 2012 non newtonian flows such as cement paste slump flow zheng et al 2015 and offshore wave flows with submerged obstacles xie and xiao 2014a however this framework still has room for improvement al mosallam and yokoi 2017 yokoi et al 2017 a different type of dimensional splitting formulation the so called temporary moment tm algorithm was proposed by yokoi et al 2017 to reduce the numerical viscosity of the original vsiam3 framework results have shown that the vsiam3 with tm algorithm could resolve the issues on numerical viscosity by simulating the lid driven cavity flows up to reynolds number re 7500 with improved accuracy fig 1 the performance of the proposed tm algorithm was well verified against several benchmark problems zalesak problem inviscid horizontal shear layer problem and 2 d incompressible lid driven cavity flow problem yokoi et al 2017 however the performance of the tm algorithm in the simulation of tsunami hydrodynamics is yet to be investigated given the above concerns a 3 d multiphase model is developed on the basis of the vsiam3 framework with the implementation of tm algorithm referred to as the vsiam3 tm model moon et al 2019a this study is conducted to highlight the applicability and potential of the model in simulating the hydrodynamics of the tsunami wave and its interaction with a simple coastal structure a scenario of an idealized tsunami wave propagating on an immobile coastal bed is reproduced in the laboratory and numerical model although such a condition may contribute to a higher tsunami momentum than the actual scenario the flow characteristics wave height and flow velocity have been validated against the 2004 indian ocean tsunami hitting the coastal areas of peninsular malaysia moon et al 2020b this paper is organized as follows the governing equations are first presented followed by the description of the numerical algorithms in section 2 section 3 presents the numerical model verification and comparison between vsiam3 tm and the original vsiam3 models section 4 presents the hydraulic experiment and numerical model setup this section also provides a discussion on the numerical and experimental results in section 5 conclusions are drawn from the study and some considerations for future work are discussed 2 numerical procedure 2 1 governing equations the momentum and continuity equations for the incompressible flow are cast in conservative form as follows 1 t ω u dv γ u u n ds 1 ρ γ p n τ n ds ω g dv 2 γ u n d s 0 where u and g denote the velocity and gravitational acceleration respectively n is the normal vector on surface γ of a control volume ω p and ρ denote the pressure and fluid density respectively and τ is the stress tensor which includes the viscosity and turbulence stress terms in this study the large eddy simulation les turbulence model schumann 1993 is adopted and the subgrid scale stress tensor τ i j s g s is defined as follows nicoud and ducros 1999 3 τ i j s g s 2 ν t s i j where s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i the eddy viscosity ν t in the subgrid scale model is modeled by using the wall adapting local eddy viscosity model which is a dynamic variant of smagorinsky model nicoud and ducros 1999 given that the les turbulence model is used u and p in eqs 1 and 2 represent the filtered quantity of velocity and pressure after the les filtering process rodi et al 2013 respectively 2 2 vsiam3 framework for 3 d model 2 2 1 integrated moments the numerical model adopts the vsiam3 framework introduced by xiao et al 2005b vsiam3 utilizes the fvm to discretize the governing equations eqs 1 and 2 and employs the m grid system xiao et al 2006 fig 2 in the m grid system the pressure is defined at the cell center whereas the velocities are defined at the cell center and on the cell boundaries thus the via and sia of a quantity q in cell i j k are defined by considering a computation cell i j k 4 q i j k via 1 δ x δ y δ z

respectively the x surface y surface and z surface are surfaces of the control volume with their surface normal vector parallel to the x y and z directions respectively 2 2 2 solution algorithm in the vsiam3 method time integration of eq 1 is performed by fractional step method kim and moin 1985 the calculation of the equation is divided into the advection and non advection phases as follows step 1

interpolation profile conservative semi lagrangian advection solver known as the cip csl3 scheme the initially known velocity field u n is upgraded to an intermediate value u after solving the advection term the diffusion terms are solved in step 2 where the shear stress τ which contains the viscous stress and turbulence stress is evaluated using u and the velocity field is updated to u in step 3 the projection method by chorin 1968 is used to form the poisson equation eq 11 by taking the divergence of eq 10 on both sides with the criteria of zero divergence of velocity after the poisson equation is solved the new velocity field is updated as in eq 12 in each time iteration appropriate boundary conditions are imposed additional information on the vsiam3 algorithm can be obtained in the work of xiao et al 2005b 2 2 3 cip csl3 scheme as mentioned in section 2 2 2 the advection phase in eq 8 is solved using the cip csl3 scheme xiao and ikebata 2003 the cip csl3 scheme is a 1 d scheme which solves the advection equation in the form shown in eq 13 where q is a scalar quantity and u is the advection velocity only the advection of q in x direction is explained here for brevity because the advection of q in the y and z directions are solved in a similar fashion 13 q t u q x 0 the conservative advection transport of scalar quantity q shown in eq 14 can be manipulated

i 1 2 u i 1 2 δ t for u i 1 2 0 φ i x i 1 2 u i 1 2 δ t for u i 1 2 0 this operation is repeated for all sias on the x surface in the calculation domain subsequently the via of q i j k is updated in the finite volume approach by considering its flux f which enters and exits the control volume through x surface at x i 1 2 and x i 1 2 as follows 26 q i j k v i a q i j k n v i a δ t δ x f i 1 2 j k f i 1 2 j k the flux f passing through x surface at location x i 1 2 is evaluated as follows 27 f i 1 2 j k x i 1 2 x i 1 2 u i 1 2 δ t φ i 1 j k x d x for u i 1 2 0 x i 1 2 x i 1 2 u i 1 2 δ t φ i j k x d x for u i 1 2 0 the value of via in the cell is updated q i j k n v i a q i j k v i a upon the completion of the operation in eq 26 and repeated for all cells in the domain the advection of sia in eq 25 and updating of its corresponding via in eq 26 are represented by the following notation 28 cip csl 3 cw q i 1 2 j k n s i a q i 1 2 j k s i a u i 1 2 j k n q i j k n v i a q i j k v i a we refer q i 1 2 j k s i a as the normal sia because the normal vector on the x surface where the sia advection is performed in parallel with the direction of advection in this case the advection is in the x direction however in the 3 d case the remaining sia on the y surface and z surface q i j 1 2 k s i a and q i j k 1 2 s i a respectively are not updated after completing the operation in eq 28 these sias are referred to as the non normal sias because their surface s normal vectors are not parallel with the direction of advection these non normal sias are updated by using the tm algorithm which is described in the subsequent section 2 2 4 tm algorithm in the original vsiam3 framework the non normal sias are updated by using interpolation with via values which is referred to as the time evolution converting tec algorithm xiao et al 2005b for example after the operation in eq 28 is completed the non normal sias q i j 1 2 k n s i a and q i j k 1 2 n s i a are updated by using tec algorithm as follows 29 q i j 1 2 k s i a q i j 1 2 k n s i a 1 2 q i j k v i a q i j k n v i a q i j 1 k v i a q i j 1 k n v i a 30 q i j k 1 2 s i a q i j k 1 2 n s i a 1 2 q i j k v i a q i j k n v i a q i j k 1 v i a q i j k 1 n v i a however the tec algorithm tends to introduce implicit artificial viscosity for some high reynolds number cases yokoi et al 2017 to reduce the numerical diffusion the tm algorithm proposed by yokoi et al 2017 is adopted in this study to update the non normal sias in the tm algorithm tms are created to perform as line integrated averages lias fig 4 the sia and lia form a set of variables that can be updated by using the cip cls3 cw scheme where the sia is analogous to the via and the lia is similar to the sia in the cip csl3 cw operation in eq 28 the non normal sias namely q i j 1 2 k n s i a and q i j k 1 2 n s i a are updated with the auxiliary tm variables lias as follows 31 cip csl 3 cw q i 1 2 j 1 2 k n lia q i 1 2 j 1 2 k lia u i 1 2 j 1 2 k n q i j 1 2 k n sia q i j 1 2 k sia 32 cip csl 3 cw q i 1 2 j k 1 2 n lia q i 1 2 j k 1 2 lia u i 1 2 j k 1 2 n q i j k 1 2 n sia q i j k 1 2 sia the tm or lia quantities are evaluated by averaging the neighboring sias as follows 33 q i 1 2 j 1 2 k n l i a 1 2 q i j 1 2 k n s i a q i 1 j 1 2 k n s i a 34 q i 1 2 j k 1 2 n l i a 1 2 q i j k 1 2 n s i a q i 1 j k 1 2 n s i a given that the tm quantities act as auxiliary variables to update the non normal sias they are discarded after every cip csl3 cw operation to reduce memory usage in the calculation the velocities used to update the non normal sias in eqs 31 and 32 are situated at the location of the tm variables where they are not initially defined these velocities are evaluated by taking the average of the neighboring velocity values as follows 35 u i 1 2 j 1 2 k n 1 2 u i j 1 2 k n u i 1 j 1 2 k n 36 u i 1 2 j k 1 2 n 1 2 u i j k 1 2 n u i 1 j k 1 2 n the advection of normal sia in the y direction q i j 1 2 k s i a and normal sia in the z direction q i j k 1 2 s i a will involve updating their values with the cip csl3 cw operation followed by updating their non normal sias by using the tm algorithm 2 3 interface capturing after eqs 8 to 12 are solved a divergence free velocity field is obtained subsequently the vof function f is advected according to eq 37 with the new velocity field to update the fluid configuration 37 t ω f dv γ u f n ds ω f u dv 0 the vof function f has a value between 0 and 1 0 f 1 computation cells that are fully occupied with water have value f 1 the empty cells containing only air phase have value f 0 the cells with value 0 f 1 are assumed to contain the air water interface in the immiscible two phase flow a sharp interface exists which is represented by a sharp jump in the f value across the interface a diffusion less thinc scheme by xiao et al 2005a is used to solve the transport advection equation of f given in eq 37 to ensure that this sharp boundary is maintained under advection instead of using the heaviside step function originally proposed by hirt and nichols 1981 the thinc scheme employs a hyperbolic tangent function as in eq 38 to represent the abrupt change in the value of f across the air water interface only advection of f the x direction is explained here and the j and k indices are neglected for brevity e g x i 1 2 instead of x i 1 2 j k 38 f i x α 2 1 γ tanh β x x i 1 2 δ x i x i parameter x i in eq 38 is the middle point of the transition jump in the hyperbolic tangent function which can be computed from eq 39 f i n is the cell averaged value of f defined at the cell center x xi 39 f i n 1 δ x i x i 1 2 x i 1 2 f i x d x parameters α β and γ are determined as follows 40 α f i 1 n v i a if f i 1 n v i a f i 1 n v i a f i 1 n v i a otherwise β 3 5 γ 1 if f i 1 n v i a f i 1 n v i a 1 otherwise parameter β represents the steepness of the jump in the interpolation cell and the value of 3 5 is chosen to obtain a good balance between numerical dissipation and unphysical interface wrinkle xiao et al 2005a a high β value reduces the numerical dissipation but it introduces interface wrinkles that nearly align in the velocity direction parameter γ represents the slope orientation of the jump and α is introduced to ensure that the fi x value is bounded between f i 1 n and f i 1 n the flux across the cell boundary at x x i 1

stability of the vsiam3 tm model was first verified with a benchmarking test i e dam break flow in a tank with a finite extent in the dam break flow problem several flow development stages can be observed advancing downstream wave followed by wave impact on the downstream wall wave run up overturning and breaking of the free surface accordingly dam break flow problem has been widely used to verify the numerical simulations involving free surface flows zhao 2011 ye et al 2016 moon et al 2018 the dam break flow problem has been also used as an analogy of tsunami wave propagation on land chanson 2006 nouri et al 2010 3 1 front wave propagation and attenuation of depth at origin in the numerical experiment the dam break flow was initiated from a water column placed at one end of the wall in the tank inset figure in fig 5 the initial height and length of the water column are ho 0 30 m and lo 0 15 m respectively four grids sizes 2 5 5 10 and 20 mm were used in the numerical experiment for the mesh convergence test the numerical model was first verified by comparing the temporal variation of the front wave length l against the experimental results by martin and moyce 1952 koshizuka and oka 1996 hu and sueyoshi 2010 and lobovský et al 2014 fig 5 the temporal variation of depth at the origin h was compared with that of martin and moyce 1952 experiment the rest of the experiments did not measure h in fig 6 in both plots l h and t are nondimensionalized to allow comparison of the temporal variation of l and h between experiments with different reservoir water column sizes discrepancies can be observed in the propagation of l between the experiments fig 5 ye et al 2016 pointed out that discrepancies are due to the different techniques used in the dam gate removal in the experiments the contrast results of the numerical and experimental data for the propagation of l indicated that the discrepancies between them were small except for the comparison with lobosky s case fig 5 the numerical model similarly performed at the initial stage for all grid sizes however the speed of the front wave at the later stage began to differ under different grid sizes although the propagation of l under a coarse grid 10 mm was closest to most experiments its performance for the attenuation of h was not as good as the case with grid sizes of 5 and 2 5 mm fig 6 figs 5 and 6 demonstrate that the numerical solution of the model converged with reducing grid size thus the 5 mm grid size was selected and used in the subsequent numerical simulation by considering the computational cost and overall performance propagation of l and attenuation of h 3 2 free surface evolution the free surface evolution in the dam break flow problem was used to evaluate the performance of the numerical model in reproducing an accurate free surface the dam break flow experiment by lobovský et al 2014 was chosen for comparison because the flow evolution was well captured in image form the wave induced pressures at the downstream wall were recorded in their experiment in the vsiam3 tm model a tank with 1 61 m long 0 15 m wide 0 60 m deep with an open top was modeled fig 7 a continuative boundary condition zero velocity and pressure gradient across the boundary was applied at the ceiling by contrast nonslip and zero normal velocity conditions were set at the floor and at the upstream and downstream walls the initial dam size of ho 0 3 m and lo 0 6 m and 5 mm grid size were used in the model the vsiam3 tm model showed good performance in reproducing the free surface evolution in the dam break flow problem fig 7 the main flow features such as the advancing free surface profile at the initial stage climbing wave at the downstream wall and subsequent flow overturning and breaking of waves were all numerically well produced after the initiation of dam break the flow advanced downstream coupled with the receding upstream water depth t 0 91 the flow front subsequently hit the downstream wall at approximately t 2 57 the flow climbed up the downstream wall as a substantial amount of fluid reached the downstream side thereby forming a thin film on the wall such a phenomenon can be observed in the numerical and experimental results at approximately t 3 27 from t 4 93 onwards the climbing wave started to collapse this situation leads to a formation of a plunging breaker which flowed back towards the upstream wall as propagating bore a layer of laminar flow was also observed at the bottom part which was flowing in the counter direction such wave overturning and free surface breaking features are shown at t 6 67 and 9 29 in fig 7 the overall good performance of the free surface reproduction of the vsiam3 tm model is partly owed to the adoption of a sharp and smear less thinc scheme in solving the transport equation of the vof function 3 3 impact pressure on downstream wall the hydrodynamic performance of the vsiam3 tm model was evaluated by comparing the numerical reproduction of impact pressure on the downstream wall against the experimental measurement by lobovský et al 2014 in addition to the comparison of the free surface profile pressures at four locations along the centerline of the downstream wall were recorded these four locations namely p1 p2 p3 and p4 are positioned at 3 15 30 and 80 mm from the floor respectively inset in fig 8 the recorded pressure p is nondimensionalized with regard to hydrostatic pressure ρgho and plotted against nondimensionalized time t fig 8 the results from the original vsiam3 with the tec algorithm vsiam3 tec model are also presented for comparison purpose in the same plot in the experiment the bottommost gauge p1 recorded the highest pressure reading upon the arrival of the leading wave at the downstream wall with approximately three times the hydrostatic pressure fig 8 a the remaining gauges p2 p3 and p4 that are located at the higher positions recorded pressure readings at a slightly later time when the water started to climb the downstream wall fig 8 b c and d the vsiam3 tm and original vsiam3 tec models performed well in terms of reproducing the impact pressures at the downstream wall pressure time history in fig 8 although a slight time lag was observed for pressure at p1 and p2 the overall pressure profile matched well with the experimental observation especially the bore pressure and sustainable pressure phase distribution the vsiam3 tm model performed better than the vsiam3 tec model in terms of the reproduction of peak pressure the induced peak pressure predicted by the original vsiam3 tec model was much lower than that in the experiment fig 8 a b and c the estimation of the maximum pressure improved as much as 16 by using the vsiam3 tm model as inferred by the difference in the line gradient of both models in fig 9 a second mild peak in pressure was recorded in the experimental and numerical results at approximately t 6 besides the peak pressure this phenomenon is caused by the collapse of flow run up at the downstream wall the second mild peak reproduced by the vsiam3 tm was closer to the experimental results compared with that by the original vsiam3 tec model except for the pressure at p3 this observation was most apparent at gauge p4 fig 8 d the newly fine tuned vsiam3 tec has shown an overall improved performance in the production of hydrodynamic pressures 4 model validation to reproduce the tsunami wave interaction with a simple coastal structure a hydraulic experiment was set up to simulate tsunami like waves travelling onshore before impacting a single building model the hydraulic experimental results were used to validate the numerical model in terms of the flow free surface evolution and the hydrodynamic pressures at the front and back faces of the building model induced by the tsunami wave impingement 4 1 experimental setup for tsunami wave a 1 50 scaled hydraulic experiment was conducted in a 40 m long 1 m wide and 1 m deep wave flume at the tsunami laboratory of universiti sains malaysia the laboratory setup is illustrated in fig 10 where a water storage tank was linked to the wave flume which was comprised of offshore and onshore profiles the offshore region was represented by a 470 mm deep water filled section the quiescent water level reached just to the top of the 1 200 slope the offshore and onshore beds were made of rigid material and their profiles were based on the typical gentle coast profile in malaysia further details on the experimental setup can be obtained in moon et al 2020a in the hydraulic experiment tsunami like waves were generated by releasing a water impoundment behind a gate that can be fully opened within 1 s waves with different nominal wave conditions were generated by varying the impoundment depth the advancing wave was first regulated by a wave baffle that was made of interlocking plastic modules the flow velocity decreased as the wave shoaled at the 1 4 sloping bed and the wave front became almost vertical the wave front eventually broke as a plunging type breaker and transformed into bores the broken wave subsequently streamed across the flume before ending in a sump at the downstream of the flume the tsunami runup and impact on a single story building were simulated in the experiment the model of a typical building with 8 m w 12 m l 3 6 m h in geometry was represented by a rectangular block made from acrylic plates in the experiment the scaled down model was installed on the horizontal dry bed section at a horizontal distance of 3225 mm and a vertical height of 25 mm from the shoreline fig 10 the building model was then subjected to two nominal wave conditions defined as the maximum water surface elevation at the vicinity of building h 40 mm non overtopping case and h 100 mm wave overtopping case as shown in the time histories in fig 11 the wave induced loading on the building model was measured by using the diaphragm type pressure gauge with a diameter of 10 mm and a thickness of 3 mm pressure gauges were placed at the front face and back face centerlines of the building model and they equally spaced from the bottom to the top at 21 mm distance fig 12 4 2 numerical setup simulation of a partial flume length was conducted in this study to reduce the computational cost the numerical simulation domain is shown in fig 13 the time histories of wave height h2 and flow velocity v2 obtained from the experiment fig 14 were used as input boundary conditions at x 0 in the numerical model nonslip boundary conditions were set for the sidewalls meanwhile a continuative boundary condition was set at the outlet boundary the 1 125 sloping bed and the building model were treated as rigid obstacles by using the fractional area volume obstacle representation favor technique due to its ease of implementation hirt and sicilian 1985 buccino et al 2019 considering the computational cost and accuracy a variable grid system was used with 484 90 and 65 grids in the x y and z directions respectively fig 15 illustrates the region with local fine gridding by using the continuous grid method a finer grid size of 5 mm was set around the building model in the x and z directions whereas a coarser 10 mm grid size was assigned elsewhere in the domain given that no discontinuous point is located on the grid line fig 15 a finite difference operator can be applied to deal with the transition zone between the different grid sizes fan et al 2015 the time step in the simulations was set at 1 0 10 4 s for all cases thus the average courant number was kept below 0 1 in the numerical simulation the pressure iteration loop was parallelized using the open multi processing openmp thereby leading to a reduction of approximately 50 in the computational time 4 3 sequence of wave attack on a building model the sequences of wave attack on the building model marked in dotted lines for the 40 and 100 mm nominal wave conditions are shown in figs 16 and 17 respectively for the experimental and numerical results upon the initial impact from the leading edge a sharp water jet was formed at the front face of the building model t 0 1 s for the case of the 40 mm nominal wave condition shown in fig 16 a at approximately t 0 4 s the splashed up wave collapsed at the front of the building model and the incoming wave subsequently split and spread to the side of the building the height of the building model 72 mm is greater than the nominal wave height 40 mm accordingly only a small amount of water was found landing on the top of the building model after the piled up wave collapsed at t 1 0 s when the wave attained its nominal height the building model was slightly overtopped by the wave at approximately t 2 0 s to 4 0 s the initial sharp water jet splitting and sideway spreading of flow collapse of the splashed up wave and slight overtopping features were satisfactorily reproduced by the vsiam3 tm model fig 16 b the results for the 100 mm nominal wave condition showed a high splashed up wave upon the initial wave impingement on the building model at approximately t 0 1 s fig 17 a in comparison with the 40 mm nominal wave condition a different scenario was observed the splashed up wave collapsed after t 0 4 s and the incident wave subsequently overtopped the building model before achieving its nominal height t 1 0 s the building model completely submerged underwater from t 2 0 s to 4 0 s as the incoming wave impinged the building the numerical results fig 17 b qualitatively agreed with the experimental observation in both simulation cases the robustness and good performance of the vsiam3 tm model in reproducing complicated free surface flow splitting breaking and coalescing processes during impulsive fluid structure interaction were adequately demonstrated 4 4 hydrodynamic pressure on building model the pressure time histories recorded at the bottommost portion of the building s front face p1 and back face p5 were compared with the experimental observation to further assess the hydrodynamic performance of the vsiam3 tm model the pressure time histories at p1 for the 40 and 100 mm nominal wave conditions are shown in fig 18 a the impingement of the leading edge on the building model gave a sharp rise in the pressure this sudden rise of pressure is referred to as the impulsive pressure maximum impulsive pressures of 10 and 35 cm were recorded for the 40 and 100 mm nominal wave conditions respectively in the experiment these maximum impulsive pressures were well reproduced by the vsiam3 tm model fig 18 a for both nominal wave conditions subsequently the pressures started to violently drop and fluctuate as the wave began to split and interfere with the incoming waves figs 16 and 17 from approximately t 0 4 s onwards this phenomenon was followed by a gradual increase in pressure when the wave started to pick up its nominal height this gradual rise was less obvious for the case of the 100 mm nominal wave condition due to a more violent pressure fluctuation at the later flow stage the front face pressure entered a sustained phase as the wave became quasi steady good agreement between the experimental and the numerical results can be seen in the reproduction of the sustained pressure phase with regard to the back face pressure p5 the vsiam3 tm model showed promising performance in terms of the wave arrival and pressure prediction fig 18 b in the non overtopping case h 40 mm the measured and simulated back face pressures slightly picked up later this situation occurred because the flow started to build up at the back of the building after t 2 0 s fig 16 the back face pressure increased towards the maximum value at the sustained pressure phase when the flow reached a quasi steady state in the case of the 100 mm nominal wave condition the peak pressure was recorded earlier in the experiment as the flow depth at the back of the building rose quickly due to the wave overtopping effect which occurred at approximately t 1 0 s this phenomenon led to a large wave impact at the back face fig 17 such a phenomenon was also observed in the numerical simulation although a slight underestimation of the initial impact pressure was observed in the nominal waves with and without overtopping the maximum back face pressure occurred when the wave was in the quasi steady flow the numerical results showed good agreement with the hydraulic experiment in terms of the overall impact pressures at the back face of the building thus further confirming the validity of the numerical model 4 5 variation in maximum pressure the spatial distributions of the maximum pressure acting on the building s front and back faces are presented in fig 19 a and b respectively for the experimental and numerical results fig 19 a demonstrates that the 100 mm nominal wave with a steep flow front induced a large pressure on the building s front face the vsiam3 tm model predicted well the maximum wave induced pressure on the building model s front face especially for the 40 mm nominal wave condition however a slight underestimation of the maximum front face pressure occurred for the overtopping case h 100 mm in the maximum back face pressure fig 19 b the vsiam3 tm model underestimated the maximum pressure especially at the mid section of the building model 0 1 z h 0 5 in the case of the 40 mm nominal wave condition in the 100 mm nominal wave condition a slight overestimation of the maximum back face pressure was observed the measured and simulated maximum pressures were almost equal to the hydrostatic pressures this situation is because of the back face area that was initially filled by overtopped waves and subsequently loaded from the sideway flow such a phenomenon is clearly reproduced by the numerical model fig 17 the accuracy of the vsiam3 tm model in reproducing the maximum pressure distribution at the building s front and back faces was assessed by plotting the numerical results against the experimental data fig 20 a and b these results demonstrated that the vsiam3 tm model could reproduce the maximum wave induced pressures on the building model with good accuracy especially for the front face pressure with a slight underestimation of approximately 10 fig 20a in the reproduction of the maximum back face pressure the vsiam3 tm model underestimated the measured one by approximately 20 for the case of 40 mm nominal wave condition fig 20 b this phenomenon might be caused by the inadequate mesh resolution to simulate accurate flow splitting and filling of the space behind the building model which is critical in the non overtopping case where the leading flow front is thin in the case of the 100 mm nominal wave condition the vsiam3 tm model slightly overestimated the maximum back face pressure by approximately 10 fig 20 b overall the vsiam3 tm model showed promising performance in reproducing wave induced hydrodynamic loading on the building model especially at the front face of the building model 5 conclusions in this study the robustness and accuracy of a modified 3 d multiphase model based on the vsiam3 framework were demonstrated the original momentum solver in the vsiam3 framework was modified by adopting the tm which reduces the numerical diffusion and oscillation the sharp and smear less thinc method was adopted for interface capturing which also contributed to the overall vsiam3 tm model performance the model was first verified by simulating the dam break flow benchmarking problem the estimation of the maximum pressures at the downstream wall improved as much as 16 compared with the tec algorithm used in the original vsiam3 framework through the adoption of the tm method the hydrodynamic performance of the finely tuned vsiam3 tm model was confirmed with the simulation of tsunami bore propagation and its interaction with a simple building model the vsiam3 tm model excellently performed in reproducing the violent and complicated free surface evolutions during the wave structure interactions the good performance of the model was further demonstrated in the reproduction of hydrodynamic pressures with accurate capturing of maximum impulsive pressures and the sustainable pressure phase the maximum front face pressures estimated by the numerical model showed approximately 10 difference compared with those of the experimental results the vsiam3 tm model can be a reliable numerical tool to study wave structure interactions for the application in coastal structure design and tsunami mitigation planning with good accuracy and robustness given the simple benchmark problem and validation cases used in this study the authors hoped that the present findings could serve a wide range of validation for the free surface numerical model and tsunami

376,this study presents the development refinement and application of a 3 d multiphase flow model for the simulation of tsunami propagation on land and its hydrodynamic force on a coastal building the model is based on the volume surface integrated average based multi moment method vsiam3 with improved accuracy by adopting the temporary moment tm method to update the non normal flow variables a third order gradient approximation is chosen for the reconstruction of an interpolation profile in the cip cls3 advection solver to further reduce numerical diffusion and suppress numerical oscillation the moving interface between air water is captured by using the volume of fluid vof method the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc scheme is used to reproduce a sharp and smear less air water interface the model performance improved by as much as 16 in the estimation of impact force on the downstream wall in the dam break flow benchmarking problem by refining the original vsiam3 model the robustness of the model is further demonstrated by the accurate reproduction of tsunami wave propagation speed and its hydrodynamic pressures on a single box shaped obstacle the wave induced pressures on the front face of the obstacle are accurately reproduced with a maximum of 10 difference compared with the hydraulic experimental results thus the study shows that the overall robustness and hydrodynamic performance of the model can be improved by refining the original model keywords vsiam3 temporary moments dam break flow tsunami waves hydrodynamic pressure 1 introduction tsunami is one of the deadliest natural disasters in the last two decades tsunami disaster has claimed more than 250 000 lives and billions of dollars in economic losses 2004 indian ocean tsunami 2011 tohoku tsunami and 2018 sulawesi island tsunami combined video recordings from these events have demonstrated the destructive force of tsunami waves on coastal structures besides coastal structures inland structures also succumbed to damage due to the inland propagation of tsunami waves although tsunami warning could reduce casualties the damage brought by tsunami wave on coastal and inland structures could paralyze the coastal city for months and even years in some cases over the past decades researchers have conducted numerous experimental studies to improve the design

surface deformation involving overturning of waves jet plunging splash up breaking coalescing of water droplets and other 3 d flow structures pringle et al 2016 fujima et al 2002 simulating accurate surface configuration of wave onshore is especially critical in wave structure interaction because the surface configuration is related to the resultant hydrodynamic force shuto 1991 accurate bore propagation can only be achieved if the breaking wave dynamics are properly reproduced brocchini and dodd 2008 to overcome the deficiencies of the depth integrated model the navier stokes equation is

plunging was successfully modeled with the vof techniques by lubin and glockner 2015 free surface representation with the geometric vof method involves interface reconstruction and advection the widely used geometrical reconstruction technique is piecewise linear interface calculation plic scheme which can be complicated to apply in 3 d problems xiao et al 2011 kawano 2016 to avoid the geometric reconstruction of the interface algebraic techniques such as compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes cicsam and tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc are available christensen 2006 and xie 2013 demonstrated successful applications of cicsam in simulating wave breaking in the surf zone the application of the thinc scheme in the simulation of tsunami wave run up can be seen in the work of xie and xiao 2014b and cheng et al 2017 the algebraic vof method with the thinc scheme was comparable with the conventional plic method in reproducing a sharp and smear less interface xiao et al 2011 tsunami waves break and undergo complex deformation with abrupt temporal and spatial changes in pressure during the impingement on coastal structures numerical simulation of such an impulsive motion demands a robust and efficient momentum solver xiao et al 2005b proposed the volume surface integrated average based multi moment method vsiam3 as a numerical framework to solve the incompressible and compressible flows the vsiam3 framework inherits the conservative property of the finite volume method fvm because the governing equations are cast in the conservative form xiao et al 2005b two types of integrated moments are used namely the volume integrated average via and surface integrated average sia of the flow variables the advection term in the momentum equation is solved using a conservative advection transport solver known as the constrained interpolation profile conservative semi lagrangian cip csl scheme by utilizing the via and sia moments yabe et al 2001 the performance of the vsiam3 framework has been proven in several applications simulation of air water multiphase flow interaction in the design of ceramic sanitary ware ikebata et al 2012 non newtonian flows such as cement paste slump flow zheng et al 2015 and offshore wave flows with submerged obstacles xie and xiao 2014a however this framework still has room for improvement al mosallam and yokoi 2017 yokoi et al 2017 a different type of dimensional splitting formulation the so called temporary moment tm algorithm was proposed by yokoi et al 2017 to reduce the numerical viscosity of the original vsiam3 framework results have shown that the vsiam3 with tm algorithm could resolve the issues on numerical viscosity by simulating the lid driven cavity flows up to reynolds number re 7500 with improved accuracy fig 1 the performance of the proposed tm algorithm was well verified against several benchmark problems zalesak problem inviscid horizontal shear layer problem and 2 d incompressible lid driven cavity flow problem yokoi et al 2017 however the performance of the tm algorithm in the simulation of tsunami hydrodynamics is yet to be investigated given the above concerns a 3 d multiphase model is developed on the basis of the vsiam3 framework with the implementation of tm algorithm referred to as the vsiam3 tm model moon et al 2019a this study is conducted to highlight the applicability and potential of the model in simulating the hydrodynamics of the tsunami wave and its interaction with a simple coastal structure a scenario of an idealized tsunami wave propagating on an immobile coastal bed is reproduced in the laboratory and numerical model although such a condition may contribute to a higher tsunami momentum than the actual scenario the flow characteristics wave height and flow velocity have been validated against the 2004 indian ocean tsunami hitting the coastal areas of peninsular malaysia moon et al 2020b this paper is organized as follows the governing equations are first presented followed by the description of the numerical algorithms in section 2 section 3 presents the numerical model verification and comparison between vsiam3 tm and the original vsiam3 models section 4 presents the hydraulic experiment and numerical model setup this section also provides a discussion on the numerical and experimental results in section 5 conclusions are drawn from the study and some considerations for future work are discussed 2 numerical procedure 2 1 governing equations the momentum and continuity

filtering process rodi et al 2013 respectively 2 2 vsiam3 framework for 3 d model 2 2 1 integrated moments the numerical model adopts the vsiam3 framework introduced by xiao et al 2005b vsiam3 utilizes the fvm to discretize the governing equations eqs 1 and 2 and employs the m grid system xiao et al 2006 fig 2 in the m grid system the pressure is defined at the cell center whereas the velocities are defined at the cell center and on the cell boundaries thus the via and sia of a quantity q in cell i j k are defined by considering a computation cell i j k 4 q i j k via 1 δ x δ y δ z

respectively the x surface y surface and z surface are surfaces of the control volume with their surface normal vector parallel to the x y and z directions respectively 2 2 2 solution algorithm in the vsiam3 method time integration of eq 1 is performed by fractional step method kim and moin 1985 the calculation of the equation is divided into the advection and non advection phases as follows step 1

interpolation profile conservative semi lagrangian advection solver known as the cip csl3 scheme the initially known velocity field u n is upgraded to an intermediate value u after solving the advection term the diffusion terms are solved in step 2 where the shear stress τ which contains the viscous stress and turbulence stress is evaluated using u and the velocity field is updated to u in step 3 the projection method by chorin 1968 is used to form the poisson equation eq 11 by taking the divergence of eq 10 on both sides with the criteria of zero divergence of velocity after the poisson equation is solved the new velocity field is updated as in eq 12 in each time iteration appropriate boundary conditions are imposed additional information on the vsiam3 algorithm can be obtained in the work of xiao et al 2005b 2 2 3 cip csl3 scheme as mentioned in section 2 2 2 the advection phase in eq 8 is solved using the cip csl3 scheme xiao and ikebata 2003 the cip csl3 scheme is a 1 d scheme which solves the advection equation in the form shown in eq 13 where q is a scalar quantity and u is the advection velocity only the advection of q in x direction is explained here for brevity because the advection of q in the y and z directions are solved in a similar fashion 13 q t u q x 0 the conservative advection transport of scalar quantity q shown in eq 14 can be manipulated and rearranged into eq 15 accordingly the left hand side of eq 15 can be solved with the cip csl3 scheme 14 q t u q x 0 15 q t u q x q u x in the cip csl3 scheme a third order interpolation function is used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of q within a cell with two sias and one via as constraints fig 3 the interpolation function in cell i φ i x is given as follows 16 φ i x a 3 x x i 1 2

2 c i sign a i δ x if b i c i 0 0 otherwise the approximation of di with the cw method can reduce the numerical oscillation at discontinuities colella and woodward 1984 the sign ai operation in eq 21 returns a positive sign if ai 0 and a negative one if ai 0 ai bi and ci are defined as follows 22 a i 0 5 q i 1 j k q i 1 j k 23 b i q i 1 j k q i j k c i q i j k q i 1 j k where q is the cell center point which can be evaluated from eq 24 as follows 24 q i 3 2 δ x i q i j k via 1 4 q i 1 2 j k sia q i 1 2 j k sia the resulting scheme is referred to as the cip csl3 cw scheme in this study the sia of q on the x surface is updated from its initial value q i 1 2 j k n s i a in the semi lagrangian approach as in eq 25 and its updated value is denoted as q i 1 2 j k s i a 25 q i 1 2 j k sia φ i 1 x i 1 2 u i 1 2 δ t for u i 1 2 0 φ i x i 1 2 u i 1 2 δ t for u i 1 2 0 this operation is repeated for all sias on the x surface in the calculation domain subsequently the via of q i j k is updated in the finite volume approach by considering its flux f which enters and exits the control volume through x surface at x i 1 2 and x i 1 2 as follows 26 q i j k v i a q i j k n v i a δ t δ x f i 1 2 j k f i 1 2 j k the flux f passing through x surface at location x i 1 2 is evaluated as follows 27 f i 1 2 j k x i 1 2 x i 1 2 u i 1 2 δ t φ i 1 j k x d x for u i 1 2 0 x i 1 2 x i 1 2 u i 1 2 δ t φ i j k x d x for u i 1 2 0 the value of via in the cell is updated q i j k n v i a q i j k v i a upon the completion of the operation in eq 26 and repeated for all cells in the domain the advection of sia in eq 25 and updating of its corresponding via in eq 26 are represented by the following notation 28 cip csl 3 cw q i 1 2 j k n s i a q i 1 2 j k s i a u i 1 2 j k n q i j k n v i a q i j k v i a we refer q i 1 2 j k s i a as the normal sia because the normal vector on the x surface where the sia advection is performed in parallel with the direction of advection in this case the advection is in the x direction however in the 3 d case the remaining sia on the y surface and z surface q i j 1 2 k s i a and q i j k 1 2 s i a respectively are not updated after completing the operation in eq 28 these sias are referred to as the non normal sias because their surface s normal vectors are not parallel with the direction of advection these non normal sias are updated by using the tm algorithm which is described in the subsequent section 2 2 4 tm algorithm in the original vsiam3 framework the non normal sias are updated by using interpolation with via values which is referred to as the time evolution converting tec algorithm xiao et al 2005b for example after the operation in eq 28 is completed the non normal sias q i j 1 2 k n s i a and q i j k 1 2 n s i a are updated by using tec algorithm as follows 29 q i j 1 2 k s i a q i j 1 2 k n s i a 1 2 q i j k v i a q i j k n v i a q i j 1 k v i a q i j 1 k n v i a 30 q i j k 1 2 s i a q i j k 1 2 n s i a 1 2 q i j k v i a q i j k n v i a q i j k 1 v i a q i j k 1 n v i a however the tec algorithm tends to introduce implicit artificial viscosity for some high reynolds number cases yokoi et al 2017 to reduce the numerical diffusion the tm algorithm proposed by yokoi et al 2017 is adopted in this study to update the non normal sias in the tm algorithm tms are created to perform as line integrated averages lias fig 4 the sia and lia form a set of variables that can be updated by using the cip cls3 cw scheme where the sia is analogous to the via and the lia is similar to the sia in the cip csl3 cw operation in eq 28 the non normal sias namely q i j 1 2 k n s i a and q i j k 1 2 n s i a are updated with the auxiliary tm variables lias as follows 31 cip csl 3 cw q i 1 2 j 1 2 k n lia q i 1 2 j 1 2 k lia u i 1 2 j 1 2 k n q i j 1 2 k n sia q i j 1 2 k sia 32 cip csl 3 cw q i 1 2 j k 1 2 n lia q i 1 2 j k 1 2 lia u i 1 2 j k 1 2 n q i j k 1 2 n sia q i j k 1 2 sia the tm or lia quantities are evaluated by averaging the neighboring sias as follows 33 q i 1 2 j 1 2 k n l i a 1 2 q i j 1 2 k n s i a q i 1 j 1 2 k n s i a 34 q i 1 2 j k 1 2 n l i a 1 2 q i j k 1 2 n s i a q i 1 j k 1 2 n s i a given that the tm quantities act as auxiliary variables to update the non normal sias they are discarded after every cip csl3 cw operation to reduce memory usage in the calculation the velocities used to update the non normal sias in eqs 31 and 32 are situated at the location of the tm variables where they are not initially defined these velocities are evaluated by taking the average of the neighboring velocity values as follows 35 u i 1 2 j 1 2 k n 1 2 u i j 1 2 k n u i 1 j 1 2 k n 36 u i 1 2 j k 1 2 n 1 2 u i j k 1 2 n u i 1 j k 1 2 n the advection of normal sia in the y direction q i j 1 2 k s i a and normal sia in the z direction q i j k 1 2 s i a will involve updating their values with the cip csl3 cw operation followed by updating their non normal sias by using the tm algorithm 2 3 interface capturing after eqs 8 to 12 are solved a divergence free velocity field is obtained subsequently the vof function f is advected according to eq 37 with the new velocity field to update the fluid configuration 37 t ω f dv γ u f n ds ω f u dv 0 the vof function f has a value between 0 and 1 0 f 1 computation cells that are fully occupied with water have value f 1 the empty cells containing only air phase have value f 0 the cells with value 0 f 1 are assumed to contain the air water interface in the immiscible two phase flow a sharp interface exists which is represented by a sharp jump in the f value across the interface a diffusion less thinc scheme by xiao et al 2005a is used to solve the transport advection equation of f given in eq 37 to ensure that this sharp boundary is maintained under advection instead of using the heaviside step function originally proposed by hirt and nichols 1981 the thinc scheme employs a hyperbolic tangent function as in eq 38 to represent the abrupt change in the value of f across the air water interface only advection of f the x direction is explained here and the j and k indices are neglected for brevity e g x i 1 2 instead of x i 1 2 j k 38 f i x α 2 1 γ tanh β x x i 1 2 δ x i x i parameter x i in eq 38 is the middle point of the transition jump in the hyperbolic tangent function which can be computed from eq 39 f i n is the cell averaged value of f defined at the cell center x xi 39 f i n 1 δ x i x i 1 2 x i 1 2 f i x d x parameters α β and γ are determined as follows 40 α f i 1 n v i a if f i 1 n v i a f i 1 n v i a f i 1 n v i a otherwise β 3 5 γ 1 if f i 1 n v i a f i 1 n v i a 1 otherwise parameter β represents the steepness of the jump in the interpolation cell and the value of 3 5 is chosen to obtain a good balance between numerical dissipation and unphysical interface wrinkle xiao et al 2005a a high β value reduces the numerical dissipation but it introduces interface wrinkles that nearly align in the velocity direction parameter γ represents the slope orientation of the jump and α is introduced to ensure that the fi x value is bounded between f i 1 n and f i 1 n the flux across the cell boundary at x x i 1 2 during time interval δt is evaluated on the basis of the thinc interpolation profile in eq 38 41 g i 1 2 t t δ t f i x i 1 2 u i 1 2 δ t u d t for u i 1 2 0 t t δ t f i x i 1 2 u i 1 2 δ t u d t otherwise here fi x i 1 2 u i 1 2 δt means that the function f is evaluated at location x i 1 2 u i 1 2 δt the advection transport of f in eq 37 can be solved as follows 42 f i n 1 f i n g i 1 2 g i 1 2 δ x i δ t f i n u i 1 2 u i 1 2 δ x i with δxi as the cell size and δt as the integration time step the advection of f in the y and z directions are solved in a similar way 3 model verification the stability of the vsiam3 tm model was first verified with a benchmarking test i e dam break flow in a tank with a finite extent in the dam break flow problem several flow development stages can be observed advancing downstream wave followed by wave impact on the downstream wall wave run up overturning and breaking of the free surface accordingly dam break flow problem has been widely used to verify the numerical simulations involving free surface flows zhao 2011 ye et al 2016 moon et al 2018 the dam break flow problem has been also used as an analogy of tsunami wave propagation on land chanson 2006 nouri et al 2010 3 1 front wave propagation and attenuation of depth at origin in the numerical experiment the dam break flow was initiated from a water column placed at one end of the wall in the tank inset figure in fig 5 the initial height and length of the water column are ho 0 30 m and lo 0 15 m respectively four grids sizes 2 5 5 10 and 20 mm were used in the numerical experiment for the mesh convergence test the numerical model was first verified by comparing the temporal variation of the front wave length l against the experimental results by martin and moyce 1952 koshizuka and oka 1996 hu and sueyoshi 2010 and lobovský et al 2014 fig 5 the temporal variation of depth at the origin h was compared with that of martin and moyce 1952 experiment the rest of the experiments did not measure h in fig 6 in both plots l h and t are nondimensionalized to allow comparison of the temporal variation of l and h between experiments with different reservoir water column sizes discrepancies can be observed in the propagation of l between the experiments fig 5 ye et al 2016 pointed out that discrepancies are due to the different techniques used in the dam gate removal in the experiments the contrast results of the numerical and experimental data for the propagation of l indicated that the discrepancies between them were small except for the comparison with lobosky s case fig 5 the numerical model similarly performed at the initial stage for all grid sizes however the speed of the front wave at the later stage began to differ under different grid sizes although the propagation of l under a coarse grid 10 mm was closest to most experiments its performance for the attenuation of h was not as good as the case with grid sizes of 5 and 2 5 mm fig 6 figs 5 and 6 demonstrate that the numerical solution of the model converged with reducing grid size thus the 5 mm grid size was selected and used in the subsequent numerical simulation by considering the computational cost and overall performance propagation of l and attenuation of h 3 2 free surface evolution the free surface evolution in the dam break flow problem was used to evaluate the performance of the numerical model in reproducing an accurate free surface the dam break flow experiment by lobovský et al 2014 was chosen for comparison because the flow evolution was well captured in image form the wave induced pressures at the downstream wall were recorded in their experiment in the vsiam3 tm model a tank with 1 61 m long 0 15 m wide 0 60 m deep with an open top was modeled fig 7 a continuative boundary condition zero velocity and pressure gradient across the boundary was applied at the ceiling by contrast nonslip and zero normal velocity conditions were set at the floor and at the upstream and downstream walls the initial dam size of ho 0 3 m and lo 0 6 m and 5 mm grid size were used in the model the vsiam3 tm model showed good performance in reproducing the free surface evolution in the dam break flow problem fig 7 the main flow features such as the advancing free surface profile at the initial stage climbing wave at the downstream wall and subsequent flow overturning and breaking of waves were all numerically well produced after the initiation of dam break the flow advanced downstream coupled with the receding upstream water depth t 0 91 the flow front subsequently hit the downstream wall at approximately t 2 57 the flow climbed up the downstream wall as a substantial amount of fluid reached the downstream side thereby forming a thin film on the wall such a phenomenon can be observed in the numerical and experimental results at approximately t 3 27 from t 4 93 onwards the climbing wave started to collapse this situation leads to a formation of a plunging breaker which flowed back towards the upstream wall as propagating bore a layer of laminar flow was also observed at the bottom part which was flowing in the counter direction such wave overturning and free surface breaking features are shown at t 6 67 and 9 29 in fig 7 the overall good performance of the free surface reproduction of the vsiam3 tm model is partly owed to the adoption of a sharp and smear less thinc scheme in solving the transport equation of the vof function 3 3 impact pressure on downstream wall the hydrodynamic performance of the vsiam3 tm model was evaluated by comparing the numerical reproduction of impact pressure on the downstream wall against the experimental measurement by lobovský et al 2014 in addition to the comparison of the free surface profile pressures at four locations along the centerline of the downstream wall were recorded these four locations namely p1 p2 p3 and p4 are positioned at 3 15 30 and 80 mm from the floor respectively inset in fig 8 the recorded pressure p is nondimensionalized with regard to hydrostatic pressure ρgho and plotted against nondimensionalized time t fig 8 the results from the original vsiam3 with the tec algorithm vsiam3 tec model are also presented for comparison purpose in the same plot in the experiment the bottommost gauge p1 recorded the highest pressure reading upon the arrival of the leading wave at the downstream wall with approximately three times the hydrostatic pressure fig 8 a the remaining gauges p2 p3 and p4 that are located at the higher positions recorded pressure readings at a slightly later time when the water started to climb the downstream wall fig 8 b c and d the vsiam3 tm and original vsiam3 tec models performed well in terms of reproducing the impact pressures at the downstream wall pressure time history in fig 8 although a slight time lag was observed for pressure at p1 and p2 the overall pressure profile matched well with the experimental observation especially the bore pressure and sustainable pressure phase distribution the vsiam3 tm model performed better than the vsiam3 tec model in terms of the reproduction of peak pressure the induced peak pressure predicted by the original vsiam3 tec model was much lower than that in the experiment fig 8 a b and c the estimation of the maximum pressure improved as much as 16 by using the vsiam3 tm model as inferred by the difference in the line gradient of both models in fig 9 a second mild peak in pressure was recorded in the experimental and numerical results at approximately t 6 besides the peak pressure this phenomenon is caused by the collapse of flow run up at the downstream wall the second mild peak reproduced by the vsiam3 tm was closer to the experimental results compared with that by the original vsiam3 tec model except for the pressure at p3 this observation was most apparent at gauge p4 fig 8 d the newly fine tuned vsiam3 tec has shown an overall improved performance in the production of hydrodynamic pressures 4 model validation to reproduce the tsunami wave interaction with a simple coastal structure a hydraulic experiment was set up to simulate tsunami like waves travelling onshore before impacting a single building model the hydraulic experimental results were used to validate the numerical model in terms of the flow free surface evolution and the hydrodynamic pressures at the front and back faces of the building model induced by the tsunami wave impingement 4 1 experimental setup for tsunami wave a 1 50 scaled hydraulic experiment was conducted in a 40 m long 1 m wide and 1 m deep wave flume at the tsunami laboratory of universiti sains malaysia the laboratory setup is illustrated in fig 10 where a water storage tank was linked to the wave flume which was comprised of offshore and onshore profiles the offshore region was represented by a 470 mm deep water filled section the quiescent water level reached just to the top of the 1 200 slope the offshore and onshore beds were made of rigid material and their profiles were based on the typical gentle coast profile in malaysia further details on the experimental setup can be obtained in moon et al 2020a in the hydraulic experiment tsunami like waves were generated by releasing a water impoundment behind a gate that can be fully opened within 1 s waves with different nominal wave conditions were generated by varying the impoundment depth the advancing wave was first regulated by a wave baffle that was made of interlocking plastic modules the flow velocity decreased as the wave shoaled at the 1 4 sloping bed and the wave front became almost vertical the wave front eventually broke as a plunging type breaker and transformed into bores the broken wave subsequently streamed across the flume before ending in a sump at the downstream of the flume the tsunami runup and impact on a single story building were simulated in the experiment the model of a typical building with 8 m w 12 m l 3 6 m h in geometry was represented by a rectangular block made from acrylic plates in the experiment the scaled down model was installed on the horizontal dry bed section at a horizontal distance of 3225 mm and a vertical height of 25 mm from the shoreline fig 10 the building model was then subjected to two nominal wave conditions defined as the maximum water surface elevation at the vicinity of building h 40 mm non overtopping case and h 100 mm wave overtopping case as shown in the time histories in fig 11 the wave induced loading on the building model was measured by using the diaphragm type pressure gauge with a diameter of 10 mm and a thickness of 3 mm pressure gauges were placed at the front face and back face centerlines of the building model and they equally spaced from the bottom to the top at 21 mm distance fig 12 4 2 numerical setup simulation of a partial flume length was conducted in this study to reduce the computational cost the numerical simulation domain is shown in fig 13 the time histories of wave height h2 and flow velocity v2 obtained from the experiment fig 14 were used as input boundary conditions at x 0 in the numerical model nonslip boundary conditions were set for the sidewalls meanwhile a continuative boundary condition was set at the outlet boundary the 1 125 sloping bed and the building model were treated as rigid obstacles by using the fractional area volume obstacle representation favor technique due to its ease of implementation hirt and sicilian 1985 buccino et al 2019 considering the computational cost and accuracy a variable grid system was used with 484 90 and 65 grids in the x y and z directions respectively fig 15 illustrates the region with local fine gridding by using the continuous grid method a finer grid size of 5 mm was set around the building model in the x and z directions whereas a coarser 10 mm grid size was assigned elsewhere in the domain given that no discontinuous point is located on the grid line fig 15 a finite difference operator can be applied to deal with the transition zone between the different grid sizes fan et al 2015 the time step in the simulations was set at 1 0 10 4 s for all cases thus the average courant number was kept below 0 1 in the numerical simulation the pressure iteration loop was parallelized using the open multi processing openmp thereby leading to a reduction of approximately 50 in the computational time 4 3 sequence of wave attack on a building model the sequences of wave attack on the building model marked in dotted lines for the 40 and 100 mm nominal wave conditions are shown in figs 16 and 17 respectively for the experimental and numerical results upon the initial impact from the leading edge a sharp water jet was formed at the front face of the building model t 0 1 s for the case of the 40 mm nominal wave condition shown in fig 16 a at approximately t 0 4 s the splashed up wave collapsed at the front of the building model and the incoming wave subsequently split and spread to the side of the building the height of the building model 72 mm is greater than the nominal wave height 40 mm accordingly only a small amount of water was found landing on the top of the building model after the piled up wave collapsed at t 1 0 s when the wave attained its nominal height the building model was slightly overtopped by the wave at approximately t 2 0 s to 4 0 s the initial sharp water jet splitting and sideway spreading of flow collapse of the splashed up wave and slight overtopping features were satisfactorily reproduced by the vsiam3 tm model fig 16 b the results for the 100 mm nominal wave condition showed a high splashed up wave upon the initial wave impingement on the building model at approximately t 0 1 s fig 17 a in comparison with the 40 mm nominal wave condition a different scenario was observed the splashed up wave collapsed after t 0 4 s and the incident wave subsequently overtopped the building model before achieving its nominal height t 1 0 s the building model completely submerged underwater from t 2 0 s to 4 0 s as the incoming wave impinged the building the numerical results fig 17 b qualitatively agreed with the experimental observation in both simulation cases the robustness and good performance of the vsiam3 tm model in reproducing complicated free surface flow splitting breaking and coalescing processes during impulsive fluid structure interaction were adequately demonstrated 4 4 hydrodynamic pressure on building model the pressure time histories recorded at the bottommost portion of the building s front face p1 and back face p5 were compared with the experimental observation to further assess the hydrodynamic performance of the vsiam3 tm model the pressure time histories at p1 for the 40 and 100 mm nominal wave conditions are shown in fig 18 a the impingement of the leading edge on the building model gave a sharp rise in the pressure this sudden rise of pressure is referred to as the impulsive pressure maximum impulsive pressures of 10 and 35 cm were recorded for the 40 and 100 mm nominal wave conditions respectively in the experiment these maximum impulsive pressures were well reproduced by the vsiam3 tm model fig 18 a for both nominal wave conditions subsequently the pressures started to violently drop and fluctuate as the wave began to split and interfere with the incoming waves figs 16 and 17 from approximately t 0 4 s onwards this phenomenon was followed by a gradual increase in pressure when the wave started to pick up its nominal height this gradual rise was less obvious for the case of the 100 mm nominal wave condition due to a more violent pressure fluctuation at the later flow stage the front face pressure entered a sustained phase as the wave became quasi steady good agreement between the experimental and the numerical results can be seen in the reproduction of the sustained pressure phase with regard to the back face pressure p5 the vsiam3 tm model showed promising performance in terms of the wave arrival and pressure prediction fig 18 b in the non overtopping case h 40 mm the measured and simulated back face pressures slightly picked up later this situation occurred because the flow started to build up at the back of the building after t 2 0 s fig 16 the back face pressure increased towards the maximum value at the sustained pressure phase when the flow reached a quasi steady state in the case of the 100 mm nominal wave condition the peak pressure was recorded earlier in the experiment as the flow depth at the back of the building rose quickly due to the wave overtopping effect which occurred at approximately t 1 0 s this phenomenon led to a large wave impact at the back face fig 17 such a phenomenon was also observed in the numerical simulation although a slight underestimation of the initial impact pressure was observed in the nominal waves with and without overtopping the maximum back face pressure occurred when the wave was in the quasi steady flow the numerical results showed good agreement with the hydraulic experiment in terms of the overall impact pressures at the back face of the building thus further confirming the validity of the numerical model 4 5 variation in maximum pressure the spatial distributions of the maximum pressure acting on the building s front and back faces are presented in fig 19 a and b respectively for the experimental and numerical results fig 19 a demonstrates that the 100 mm nominal wave with a steep flow front induced a large pressure on the building s front face the vsiam3 tm model predicted well the maximum wave induced pressure on the building model s front face especially for the 40 mm nominal wave condition however a slight underestimation of the maximum front face pressure occurred for the overtopping case h 100 mm in the maximum back face pressure fig 19 b the vsiam3 tm model underestimated the maximum pressure especially at the mid section of the building model 0 1 z h 0 5 in the case of the 40 mm nominal wave condition in the 100 mm nominal wave condition a slight overestimation of the maximum back face pressure was observed the measured and simulated maximum pressures were almost equal to the hydrostatic pressures this situation is because of the back face area that was initially filled by overtopped waves and subsequently loaded from the sideway flow such a phenomenon is clearly reproduced by the numerical model fig 17 the accuracy of the vsiam3 tm model in reproducing the maximum pressure distribution at the building s front and back faces was assessed by plotting the numerical results against the experimental data fig 20 a and b these results demonstrated that the vsiam3 tm model could reproduce the maximum wave induced pressures on the building model with good accuracy especially for the front face pressure with a slight underestimation of approximately 10 fig 20a in the reproduction of the maximum back face pressure the vsiam3 tm model underestimated the measured one by approximately 20 for the case of 40 mm nominal wave condition fig 20 b this phenomenon might be caused by the inadequate mesh resolution to simulate accurate flow splitting and filling of the space behind the building model which is critical in the non overtopping case where the leading flow front is thin in the case of the 100 mm nominal wave condition the vsiam3 tm model slightly overestimated the maximum back face pressure by approximately 10 fig 20 b overall the vsiam3 tm model showed promising performance in reproducing wave induced hydrodynamic loading on the building model especially at the front face of the building model 5 conclusions in this study the robustness and accuracy of a modified 3 d multiphase model based on the vsiam3 framework were demonstrated the original momentum solver in the vsiam3 framework was modified by adopting the tm which reduces the numerical diffusion and oscillation the sharp and smear less thinc method was adopted for interface capturing which also contributed to the overall vsiam3 tm model performance the model was first verified by simulating the dam break flow benchmarking problem the estimation of the maximum pressures at the downstream wall improved as much as 16 compared with the tec algorithm used in the original vsiam3 framework through the adoption of the tm method the hydrodynamic performance of the finely tuned vsiam3 tm model was confirmed with the simulation of tsunami bore propagation and its interaction with a simple building model the vsiam3 tm model excellently performed in reproducing the violent and complicated free surface evolutions during the wave structure interactions the good performance of the model was further demonstrated in the reproduction of hydrodynamic pressures with accurate capturing of maximum impulsive pressures and the sustainable pressure phase the maximum front face pressures estimated by the numerical model showed approximately 10 difference compared with those of the experimental results the vsiam3 tm model can be a reliable numerical tool to study wave structure interactions for the application in coastal structure design and tsunami mitigation planning with good accuracy and robustness given the simple benchmark problem and validation cases used in this study the authors hoped that the present findings could serve a wide range of validation for the free surface numerical model and tsunami

377,foam in porous media has been studied as a tool for various applications recently the technology has become relevant for contaminated aquifer remediation where porous media are highly permeable therefore the behavior of foam flow in high permeability porous media still raises numerous questions in particular upscaling of the foam flow from pore to darcy scale is still under debate since the behavior of bulk foam has been studied principally in the food and cosmetics industries and foam flow in porous media has mainly been investigated in the oil industry the link between bulk foam behavior and foam flow in porous media is still missing the upscaling of foam flow from the pore scale to the laboratory scale could give valuable insight for understanding foam flow in aquifers we studied the behavior of pre generated foam with different foam qualities through the rheological characterization of bulk foam using a rheometer and also when flowing in a porous medium composed of 1 mm glass beads foam was formed by co injecting surfactant solution and nitrogen gas through a porous column filled by fine sand the homogenization method is used to study macroscopic foam flow properties in porous media by solving the non linear boundary value problem the rheology of bulk foam is then used as an input in the upscaling procedure for foam flow in different periodic model 2d and 3d unit cells from our experiments we found that the bulk foam is a yield stress fluid and that the yield stress values increase with foam quality moreover the rheology of bulk foam corresponds well to the yield stress herschel bulkley papanastasiou model we found that foam behaves as a continuous yield stress fluid in highly permeable porous media it was also shown that the apparent foam viscosity in porous media increases with the foam quality at the same total flow rate the results obtained from the rheometer successfully match the outcomes of apparent foam viscosity obtained by flow in porous media by a shifting parameter for the same foam quality the apparent foam viscosity found in 1 mm glass bead packing was much higher than bulk foam viscosity experimental results were compared to numerical results on simple unit cells although we observed considerable differences between the experimental and numerical results of upscaling the general trend was identical the differences can be explained by the complexity of the foam flow in porous media especially foam compressibility we found that foam flow at low capillary numbers is influenced by the trapping effect and at high pressure gradients by the compressibility compressibility was estimated for foam flow in 1 mm glass bead packing when foam compressibility is insignificant the upscaling model can predict foam flow behavior well at the darcy scale graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bulk foam porous media rheology non newtonian fluid yield stress upscaling 1 introduction foam is a two phase system where gas bubbles are dispersed in the continuous liquid phase the liquid phase in foam is generally an aqueous surfactant solution that plays a crucial role in stabilizing the liquid films between bubbles by increasing the surface tension foam is used in a wide variety of industrial applications due to its mechanical behavior combined with its sizeable specific area relative to the density prud homme and khan 2017 for instance foam in the oil industry can be used as a drilling fluid as a mobility control agent in enhanced oil recovery processes chen et al 2014 in matrix acidization treatments rossen and wang 1999 and in gas leakage prevention bernard and holm 1970 in soil remediation processes foam can be used as a sweeping pollutant fluid hirasaki et al 1997 as fluid that transports soil cleaning additives or gases maire et al 2019 choi et al 2009 moreover in ordinary life foam can be found in many food and cosmetic products the mechanical behavior of bulk foam is complicated due to elastic plastic and viscous properties therefore their complexity is analyzed using rheology coussot 2005 larson 1999 macosko 1994 many authors have experimentally studied the rheology of bulk foam in the last sixty years cohen addad et al 2013 denkov et al 2009 hohler and cohen addad 2005 katgert et al 2013 kraynik 1988 dollet and raufaste 2014 khan et al 1988 herzhaft 1999 denkov et al 2005 in most of the studies bulk foam was identified as a yield stress fluid and the majority of the results are commonly well fitted by the herschel bulkley law for instance khan et al 1988 investigated bulk foam through a rheometer with parallel plate geometry the geometry was covered with sandpaper to eliminate the wall slip velocity the average diameter of foam bubbles was 65 μm as measured by an optical method they demonstrated the existence of a yield stress for foams with 92 95 and 97 of gas fractions fg foam quality with the yield stress increasing with fg a full understanding of foam flow in porous media is hindered due to the complex behavior of foam associated with the complex microstructure of porous media there are also apparent contradictions in the conclusions of the studies on foam flow presented in the literature for instance some authors showed newtonian persoff et al 1991 foam flow behavior in porous media others shear thinning hirasaki and lawson 1985 falls et al 1989 a mixture of newtonian and shear thinning vassenden and holt 2000 or related to foam quality alvarez et al 2001 hirasaki and lawson 1985 reported non linear behavior in foam when flowing through a smooth capillary tube and pointed out the impact of foam texture bubble size on apparent foam viscosity shear thinning behavior of foam flow in homogenous bead packs was shown by falls et al 1989 rossen and wang 1999 modeled foam as a bingham plastic flowing in sandstones they assumed bubble size was fixed and roughly equal to pore size at low quality regimes some authors also considered the presence of yield stress based on a threshold pressure gradient which was linked with the types of gas and surfactant surfactant concentration and petrophysical properties of porous media rossen and gauglitz 1990 dicksen et al 2002 ransohoff and radke 1988 gauglitz et al 2002 omirbekov et al 2020 however in most of the foam modeling investigations in porous media foam was characterized as a pure power law fluid without assuming yield stress friedmann et al 1991 kovscek et al 1997 bertin et al 1998 myers and radke 2000 kam 2008 kovscek et al 2010 ashoori et al 2012 recently aranda et al 2020 experimentally found the shear thinning behavior of foam when studying the influence of permeability on the apparent foam viscosity in highly permeable porous media several foam modeling techniques have been developed since the 1980s to understand and predict the complex behavior of foam flow in porous media ma et al 2015 ma et al 2015 provided a complete overview of existing methods for modeling foam in porous media they categorized the modeling techniques into three groups depending on implicit or dynamic foam textures local equilibrium models population balance models and others they also indicated the possibility of using all models for direct incorporation into reservoir simulators based on material balance and darcy law they highlighted some studies on the upscaling of foam from laboratory scale to field scale in which the upscaling problems were pointed out due to entrance and end effects in laboratory core experiments on the other hand a link between pore or bubble scale discontinuous physics and darcy scale continuum models is missing this link is often ascertained through a variety of upscaling approaches berryman 2005 for instance darcy s law is obtained from the creeping incompressible flow of a newtonian fluid via the volume averaging method with a no slip boundary condition at the liquid solid interfaces quintard and whitaker 1993 1994 in this method intrinsic permeability is calculated as a function of closure variables for a given geometry porous media whitaker 1999 however upscaling is still a challenge for non newtonian fluids which are described by non linear partial differential equations there are very few experimental numerical or analytical studies on the upscaling of the non newtonian fluids flow in porous media several authors theoretically numerically investigated upscaling power law fluids idris et al 2004 wang et al 2014 woods et al 2003 orgéas et al 2006 viscoelastic fluids yield stress fluids or considered the case of generalized non newtonian fluids orgéas et al 2007 therefore the upscaling of foam flow in porous media is still questionable especially in soil remediation where the permeability of porous media is high some authors also empirically proposed a darcy scale equation for non newtonian fluids larry et al 1986 chauveteau 1982 chevalier et al 2013 rodríguez de castro 2019 put simply the extension of the darcy scale equation for yield stress fluid in anisotropic porous media is very complex and still open to our knowledge the modeling of non newtonian fluids especially yield stress fluid flow in porous media has received less attention due to strong coupling between the porous medium and the fluid s rheology most of the previous studies on foam in porous media were related to the oil industry where bubble size was considered to be roughly equal to pore size however in soil remediation cases the porous medium is highly permeable and consists of large pores and there the bubbles can be much smaller than the characteristic length in porous media consequently the main objective of this study was to show whether foam flow in highly permeable porous media can be deduced from the bulk foam behavior and if we can consider foam as a single phase yield stress fluid we also aimed to characterize the rheological behavior of bulk foam experimentally and to scale up analytically and numerically the foam flow from pore to laboratory darcy scale 2 theoretical considerations one of the important characteristics of foam is its foam quality which is the ratio of the injected gas volume to the total liquid and gas volume and can be expressed as 1 f g q g q g q l in which qg ml min and ql ml min are the volumetric gas and liquid flow rates respectively the sum of qg and ql provides the value of total flow rate q according to the value of gas fraction bulk foam can be dry fg 99 wet 64 fg 99 or considered as a bubbly liquid fg 64 langevin 2017 moreover foam bubble shape can be transformed from spherical to polyhedral by increasing the gas fraction kovscek and radke 1994 in porous media osterloh and jante 1992 distinguished two particular foam flow regimes depending on foam quality in sand pack experiments at a steady state they found a low quality regime wet in which the pressure gradient was constant regardless of the liquid flow rate and a high quality regime dry in which the pressure gradient was independent of the gas flow rate a transition foam quality f g divides these two regimes and depends on porous media characteristics types of surfactants and gas alvarez et al 2001 newtonian fluid flow in porous media can be considered as models of flow through a bundle of tortuous capillary tubes which have uniform radii r by the theory of kozeny carman kozeny 1927 carman 1997 tortuosity in capillaries is defined as the ratio between the effective length leff i e length of the tortuous capillaries and the lengths of equivalent straight capillary tubes l hence it was assumed that fluid entering into tortuous capillaries flows faster than the fluid flowing through the equivalent straight capillaries in order to reach to the end of the tube at the same time using this concept flow in porous media can be presented as follows 2 u r 2 δ p 8 μ l l l e f f 2 u m s and δp pa are darcy velocity and pressure drop in the direction parallel to length l m μ pa s is the dynamic fluid viscosity is the porous media porosity eq 2 is then identified with the darcy velocity for the flow of newtonian fluids in porous media darcy 1856 3 u q a k δ p μ l where q m3 s and a m2 are the flow rate and cross section surface area of the porous media the mean pore radius could be calculated as the radius of straight capillaries composing a bundle giving the same flow 4 r e q 2 r l l e f f 2 8 k in the preceding equation req m is the average pore throat radius k m2 is the intrinsic permeability of the porous media the term l l e f f 2 represents the tortuosity in porous media hence an equivalent shear rate γ e q for flow in porous media can be expressed as darby et al 2001 5 γ e q 4 α u r e q in which α is an empirical shift parameter associated with the bulk rheology of the fluid and the tortuosity of porous media chauveteau and zaitoun 1981 the tortuosity of packed spheres was assumed to be 25 12 from the derivation of the blake kozeny equation using the capillary model christopher and middleman 1965 hirasaki and pope 1974 as a consequence hirasaki and pope 1974 proposed to use α 0 69 through α 1 l l e f f for newtonian fluids recently rodriguez de castro 2019 experimentally found α equal to 0 68 in glass bead packings if we consider darcy s law as applicable for the flow of a non newtonian fluid in porous media the effect of non linear rheology of the fluid can be incorporated in the definition of an apparent viscosity given by 6 μ a p p k δ p u l this apparent viscosity μ app is not an intrinsic property of fluid and varies with the flow rate it is a non linear function of the equivalent shear rate given in eq 5 which can be varied relying on the flow rate moreover the shear rate varies considerably as a function of the structure and the heterogeneity of porous media that change interstitial velocity the rheological behavior of yield stress fluid for simple shear can be described through the herschel bulkley model herschel and bulkley 1926 7 τ τ 0 γ 0 solid regime τ τ 0 τ τ 0 a γ n liquid regime where τ pa is the shear stress γ 1 s is the shear rate τ0 pa is the yield stress a pa sn and n are the consistency and flow indexes respectively the continuous viscous model proposed by papanastasiou papanastasiou 1987 is used to prevent the main difficulty caused by the herschel bulkley model in numerical studies due to discontinuous behavior at insufficient shear rates that tend the apparent viscosity to infinity the herschel bulkley papanastasiou h b p model can be written as follows 8 μ γ a γ n 1 τ 0 γ 1 exp m γ in which m s is the exponent index based on the models mentioned above denkov et al 2005 studied foam rheology and wall slip velocity with 90 gas fraction using a rheometer the foam used was generated using a syringe with a needle with id inner diameter of 2 5 mm they found the power law index equal to 0 25 and 0 42 for tangentially mobile and immobile bubble surfaces respectively denkov et al 2009 studied the effects of surfactant type and bubble surfaces on bulk foam rheology with fg 80 they classified the rheological behavior of foam into two different classes depending on values of power law index n by taking into account the viscous friction between bubbles and also between bubbles and solid walls qualitatively the results with n 0 5 referred to the first system which was described as the dominant friction in foam films and the second type n 0 5 mostly between 0 2 and 0 25 was defined as the essential energy dissipation on the bubble surfaces these studies show solid plastic or viscoelastic behavior of foam below yield stress and non newtonian liquid regime above the yield stress the transition from solid like to liquid like mechanical behavior is called yielding the yielding can be explained through the complex shear modulus that appears at the transition from a mostly elastic regime where g storage modulus g loss modulus towards predominantly viscous behavior g g larson 1999 the behavior of inverse transition from liquid like to solid like is called jamming which was studied by slightly decreasing the shear rates and measuring the stress liu and nagel 1998 the apparent viscosity of foam is several times larger than the viscosity of the continuous liquid phase even at low shear rates this can be explained from a description of foam at the molecular and bubble scale hohler and cohen addad 2005 3 experimental approach here we present the fluids and materials used the experimental setups and procedures were provided to characterize the rheology of foam in bulk form and in porous media 3 1 fluids and materials 3 1 1 surfactant solution c14 16 alpha olefin sulfonate aos based surfactant rhodacal lss 40 ax solvay novecare and demineralized degassed water were used to prepare a surfactant solution the surfactant contained 40 wt of active materials in the aqueous solution the chemical surfactant was chosen on the basis of several factors like soil biodegradability tuvell et al 1978 talmage 1994 market accessibility cserháti et al 2002 and field tests for soil remediation purposes svab et al 2009 the critical micelle concentration cmc of the surfactant is 1 8 0 1 g l which is measured by the pendant drop method stauffer 1965 using a drop shape analyzer dsa 100s kruss the surfactant solution was prepared at a concentration of four times cmc to avoid adsorption paria 2008 omirbekov et al 2020 aranda et al 2020 at low concentrations and respect the biodegradability at high concentrations 3 1 2 gas the gas used to generate foam in all experiments was nitrogen provided by air liquide with a purity of 99 98 n2 was selected after considering several studies presented in the literature including foam stability farajzadeh et al 2009 zeng et al 2016 and solubility sander 1999 of gases also carbon dioxide purity 99 7 provided by air liquide is used for pre saturation procedures to avoid trapping of gas bubbles 3 1 3 porous media unconsolidated porous media made from calibrated silica sand br 37 and 1 mm glass beads are used which are provided by sibelco and sigma aldrich companies respectively the sand grading characteristics were as follows the uniformity coefficient cu is 0 72 the curvature coefficient cc is 0 98 the effective size d10 and mean grain size d50 are 0 180 and 0 135 mm respectively fine sand packing was used to generate foam while foam flow was examined in 1 mm glass bead gb packing the characteristics of the porous media are presented in table 1 3 2 experimental setups the setups used to conduct the experiments are shown in fig 1 to generate foam n2 and the surfactant solution were co injected into the foam generator column then the rheology of pre generated foam was studied with different methods a in bulk form using a rheometer bulk b in the main porous media column p m the mass flow controller el flow select f 201cv bronkhorst providing a range of 0 16 10 mln min 0 5 reading plus 0 1 full scale was used to control the gas flow rate and ensure the flow stability from a gas bottle a piston pump model 1hm eldex with a precision of 0 3 was used to inject the surfactant solution at a constant flow rate the foam generator column was 10 cm long with 4 cm inside diameter and made of transparent polyvinyl chloride pvc the sand pack was retained using a metallic grid with 42 µm cell size the following setups were used to investigate the pre generated foam properties a a rotational rheometer haake mars 60 thermofisher min torque rotation 0 02 µnm torque resolution 0 1 nnm with serrated parallel plate geometry p60 ti se and tmp60 se was used to examine the rheology of pre generated foam in bulk form b the main column made of pvc material with a length of 40 cm and an inner diameter of 4 cm packed by 1 mm glass beads was used to study foam from the foam generator column metallic grids with 150 µm cell size were used on each side of the column to contain the glass bead packing pressure drop along the main column was measured through a differential pressure transmitter rosemount 2051 emerson with a 0 2500 mbar range 7 mbar at the maximum value an electronic balance model stx 6201 ohaus with a precision of 0 1 g was used to measure the effluent weight the maximum pressure limit of the experimental installation was up to 6 bars controlled by the pump pressure sensor 3 3 experimental procedures first the porous columns were carefully packed and checked for leaks the columns were flushed by co2 gas to remove any air then degassed demineralized water was injected into the columns in a vertical position with a 0 5 ml min for at least five pore volumes pv to dissolve any co2 and thus to saturate the column thoroughly as co2 is highly soluble in the water this step was used to provide 100 of porous media saturation to measure pore volume and porosity the columns were weighed before and after the water saturation the subsequent experimental steps were carried out with the column in a horizontal position the permeability of the porous media was measured through the injection of degassed water with different flow rates while measuring the pressure difference and calculated via darcy s law eq 3 the measured properties of porous media were tabulated in table 1 next the column was flushed with 3 pv of surfactant solution to complete adsorption finally to generate foam the surfactant solution and the nitrogen gas were simultaneously injected into the foam generator 5 pv of fluids was co injected to obtain a stable pre generated foam the pre generated foam was further investigated a using the rheometer and b in glass bead packing a pre generated foams with 60 85 and 95 foam qualities generated at the same total flow rates q 2 ml min u 2 65 10 05 m s were investigated using the rheometer the mechanical properties of foam were probed through the rheometer considering previous studies larson 1999 macosko 1994 the parallel plate geometry with serrated surfaces was used to avoid wall slip velocity herzhaft 1999 marze et al 2008 princen and kiss 1989 the shear gap of the geometry was 1 mm which was chosen by taking into account previous studies herzhaft 1999 moreover before starting the experiments the dynamic stability of the foam at each quality was verified based on the study of khan et al 1988 by examining samples at a constant shear rate the idea was to observe how long the foam could withstand at constant torque the decrease in torque values indicates the change in the foam structure the volume of 3 1 ml of the foam sample was set in the gap and the experiments were run in triplicate for each foam quality b firstly the pre generated foam was connected to the main column to study the impact of fg and to determine the transition foam quality f g foam with a fixed total flow rate 2 ml min was studied for various foam qualities 40 99 the fractions of gas and liquid injected were controlled by the mass flow controller and the pump the foam flow experiments were examined through the flow rate and pressure drop measurements along the column consequently the apparent foam viscosity was derived from darcy s law eq 3 after determining f g foam flow in 1 mm gb packing was investigated at low quality regimes foam flow with fg 60 85 and 95 was studied for different total flow rates that were increased step by step from minimum q 0 2 ml min u 2 65 10 06 m s to maximum q 2 2 ml min u 2 92 10 05 m s technically possible values thus 905 and 82 min were required to inject 1 pv of pre generated foam through the main column at the minimum and maximum flow rates respectively experiments were duplicated by at least a descending flow rate experience at the same time the electronic balance measured the liquid effluent to determine the change of surfactant solution saturation sw inside the main column all experiments were carried out at 20 c controlled room temperature and atmospheric pressure 4 theoretical approach upscaling technique since the direct upscaling of foam flow from pore to laboratory scale is complex we used upscaling technique to scale up foam flow by using the rheological data of bulk foam as an input the objective was to examine whether foam flow behavior in porous media can be predicted from its bulk behavior for field application in aquifers a second upscaling from laboratory to aquifer scale should be considered that was beyond the scope of this study in order to numerically study the macroscopic behavior of foam flow it was first necessary to establish the geometry of representative elementary volume rev to correspond to the porous media permeability obtained from the laboratory experiments to do so we solved the closure problem for creeping flow of steady state newtonian fluids developed through the volume averaging method quintard and whitaker 1994 whitaker 1999 to define the permeability of the two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d unit cells see fig 3 the size of solid inclusion in each kind of unit cell was adjusted to obtain the same permeability as in the 1d column experiment then the boundary value problem developed using the homogenization method auriault 1991 was solved to study macroscopic foam flow behavior further the targets of the upscaling were to study the impact of fg and the effect of different unit cell geometries on foam flow then the outcome of the 1d porous column experiments was used to correlate and validate the findings from upscaling 4 1 description of foam flow at the pore scale the concept of porous media is presented in fig 2 in which we consider the foam flow through a periodic rev with ω being the total volume of rev the volume considered consists of ωσ rigid solid phase domain and the β yield stress fluid foam of volume ωβ the porosity of the porous medium can be defined as ωβ ω a no slip boundary condition is considered on the solid fluid interface denoted a βσ also the fluid is considered as incompressible purely viscous and isotropic since the flow is in creeping regime inertial effects are neglected and steady state the mass and momentum balance equations for a yield stress fluid are written as 9 0 p i μ γ v v t in ω β 10 v 0 in ω β 11 v 0 on a β σ where v is the fluid velocity field and p is the pressure μ is the dynamic fluid viscosity which can be defined by the h b p model eq 8 for our case hence the set of equations is the pore scale description of the foam flow problem in highly permeable porous media 4 2 characteristics of the microstructure foam flow in model porous media was investigated with fixed permeability the investigation was carried out in four different periodic 2d and two different 3d unit cells the pore fraction porosity was adjusted to obtain the same permeability as the porous column permeability the types of unit cells with their porosity values are presented in fig 3 with a square packed cylinders with a circular cross section spc b square packed cylinders with a square cross section sps c close packed cylinders with a circular cross section cpc d close packed cylinders with a square cross section cps e simple cubic packing of cubes scp f cubic body centered packing of spheres bcp the edge size of the periodic rev was selected to be 1 mm for all cases in order to be close to 1 mm gb size and the permeability was set equal to 8 3 10 10 m2 the permeability of each porous medium has been calculated by solving the closure problem for newtonian fluid flow through the volume averaging method quintard and whitaker 1994 whitaker 1999 it should be noted that ideally the unit cells chosen must have the same porosity and permeability as the experimental sample moreover they should feature similar microstructures in terms of disorder although all unit cells considered here are ordered geometries the porosity values for cells spc sps scp and bcp are relatively close to each other and also close to the value found for the glass bead packing the porosity for cpc and cps are significantly higher for the same value of the permeability 4 3 upscaling 4 3 1 separation of scales in order to meet the requirements of the homogenization method idris et al 2004 orgéas et al 2007 auriault 1991 papanicolau et al 1978 sanchez palencia 1980 the condition of separation of the scales must be satisfied for the porous media considered as fig 2 describes the characteristic rev length l is supposed to be small compared to the characteristic macroscopic length l which can be expressed as 12 ζ l l 1 where ζ represents the scale separation parameter 4 3 2 boundary value problem in this work the homogenization procedure proposed by orgeas 2007 has been used thus a generalized newtonian fluid through 2d and 3d elementary unit cells is studied using numerical simulations to study foam flow in porous media a boundary value problem concerning the first order velocity v 0 also to the second order pressure p 1 is presented in the following way 13 ζ p 1 τ 0 γ 1 exp m γ a γ n 1 v 0 v 0 t p x 0 in ω β 14 v 0 0 in ω β 15 v 0 0 on a β σ here the unknowns ζp 1 and v 0 are periodic and the macroscopic pressure gradient p x 0 is given on the whole rev as a source term foam was considered as a yield stress fluid following the rheological model h b p eq 8 where the fluid viscosity is supposed to be a function of the magnitude of the shear rate γ given by 16 γ 2 s s where the strain rate s is defined as a function of the velocity field v at the pore scale 17 s 1 2 v 0 v 0 t the boundary value problem given above was solved in the 2d periodic unit cell of circular cross section fig 3 a for fg 60 85 and 95 where the rheological parameters of the continuous viscous model were obtained from the experimental study foam with fg 85 was investigated in all geometries presented in fig 3 for all simulations in the ordered isotropic porous media the macroscopic pressure gradient imposed p x 0 was in the direction of the x axis the non linear boundary value problem eqs 13 15 was solved using comsol multiphysics finite element with a mixed pressure velocity p1 p2 formulation the flow problems were solved through the creeping flow module which is designed for solving stokes flow problems the dynamic viscosity of the module was user defined via the equation view section solving this problem was similar to solving the direct flow problem in simple unit cells the finite triangular elements were used to mesh the 2d geometries an example of mesh and boundary conditions used are in fig 4 results presented in the literature for the same geometries idris et al 2004 orgéas et al 2007 were used to verify the numerical procedure adopted here in the case of power law and generalized newtonian fluids 5 results and discussion 5 1 rheology of bulk foam fig 5 shows the rheology of pre generated foam for different foam qualities in which the shear stress τ is displayed as a function of the shear rate γ the dots represent the average value of experimental results and the lines describe the results of the h b p model table 2 shows the fitting parameters with coefficients of determination the exponent index m was chosen to be 10 000 in order to better represent the yield stress behavior in numerical studies from these results a non newtonian fluid behavior with yield stress is observed that was well fitted by the herschel bulkley papanastasiou model moreover we saw that yield stress increases with increasing foam quality thereby raising the bulk foam viscosity the increasing yield stress value with the foam quality which agrees with the literature results khan et al 1988 where the storage modulus g and τ0 as a function of foam quality marze et al 2009 saint jalmes and durian 1999 were measured the value of the yield stress increases by a factor 2 from fg 85 to fg 95 which can be explained by the evolution of the bubble shape from spherical to polyhedral form thereby increasing the friction between bubbles denkov et al 2009 it can therefore be concluded that in our experiments bulk foam can be clearly considered as a yield stress fluid this is in agreement with previous studies in which the value of the flow index n obtained experimentally was indicated close to 0 5 denkov et al 2009 marze et al 2008 princen and kiss 1989 ovarlez et al 2008 2010 tcholakova et al 2008 it should be noted that the measurement of the rheology for the foam with the quality of fg 60 was found to be complicated due to the drainage of foam liquid phase from the rheometer geometry therefore to avoid the liquid draining from the plates we loaded the exact necessary amount of the foam sample 3 1 ml by setting the gap to 3 mm where the foam sample was placed between two plates then the gap was decreased slowly until 1 mm to perform tests at different shear rates the foam with the quality of fg 60 was studied with great care at each shear rate by performing additional experiments to ensure accurate results these results are analyzed with the outcomes of the experimental study on porous media and further used as inputs for upscaling of foam flow in highly permeable porous media by considering foam as a yield stress fluid 5 2 rheology of foam in porous media darcy scale since foam was generated in the sand pack foam bubble size was expected to be smaller than the pore size of the glass bead packing therefore the bubble sizes were estimated according to previous studies for instance marsden et al 1967 noted that some foams generated in porous media could flow with bubbles much smaller than pores as well as a series of foam films of various sizes shapes and configurations depending on the medium they studied a pre generated foam through the series of four identical porous media consisting of sand with a porosity of 35 and a permeability of 5 2 darcy the foam texture was studied through optical cells and using a microscope they showed an increase in bubble size with a decrease in foam mobility the ratio of effective permeability to apparent viscosity however in later work the opposite was revealed hirasaki and lawson 1985 falls et al 1989 from the results of marsden et al 1967 we observed that the bubble size was smaller at high flow rates compared to the pore size which was estimated to be five times smaller than the grain diameter friedmann and jensen 1986 found that the size of foam bubbles decreased with increasing velocities at constant foam quality by observing the texture of the foam exiting from several different porous media ettinger and radke 1992 studied the foam texture of pre generated foam in berea sandstone they also observed a decrease in bubble size with an increase in flow rate however according to studies by falls et al 1989 the average size of the foam bubbles remained unchanged for the foam which was pre generated in 3 mm glass bead packing and introduced into the second pack with the same grain size the average size of the bubbles was estimated to be the same as the equivalent capillary radius of the packs consequently in this study we roughly assumed that the size of foam bubbles is equivalent to the pore size of the sand pack see table 1 the apparent foam viscosity calculated through darcy s law eq 6 for the experimental study of foam flow in the porous sample 1 mm glass bead packing as a function of foam quality is presented in fig 6 from these results the transition foam quality f g delimiting low and high quality regimes is determined we observed that the transition foam quality was quite high and equal to 97 dashed line hence this result is in good agreement with the results of some authors alvarez et al 2001 briceno and joseph 2003 omirbekov et al 2020 for instance alvarez et al 2001 found a value of f g 97 for an experimental study of foam flow in a sand pack with a permeability of 3 1 darcy where the foam was pre generated through bronze wool alvarez et al 2001 they used two types of surfactants an octyl ethoxylated alcohol and aos to generate foams however the bubble size of the pre generated foam was not mentioned in their work briceno and joseph 2003 investigated pre generated foam flow in a 1 2 m long channel 1 in tall 1 4 in wide and in a pipe 5 8 in inner diameter the foam was formed using an aqueous solution based on a mixture of aos polyacrylic acid polymer cosurfactants dodecanol solvent butanol and water they found f g 97 through the pressure gradient vs foam velocity plot where they discovered a shift in the results at fg 97 it was also visually shown that there was a change in the structure of foam at this transition zone in which foam flow behavior changed from uniform to slug flow recently omirbekov et al 2020 also found that transition foam quality is independent of the porous media grain size when the average foam bubble size is smaller than the pore size of the porous medium the value of transition foam quality for the same foam composition and pre generated foam used in this study was 97 for 2 mm 4 mm and 8 mm glass bead packing nevertheless the foam s bubble size can be changed depending on time this is discussed in appendix a with these results in mind all our further studies were chosen to be conducted in low quality regime fg 85 to avoid the instability around f g fig 7 shows the experimental results in terms of the pressure gradient along the porous column packed by 1 mm gb as a function of the foam flow velocity for fg 60 85 and 95 non linear behavior was observed where the pressure gradient of flow increased with foam quality we were unable to obtain p values above foam injection flowrate of 3 4 ml min due to the maximum pressure limit of the experimental configuration for fg 60 and 85 of foams to investigate the foam rheology the apparent viscosity variations versus the equivalent shear rate eq 5 were analyzed the apparent foam viscosity as a function of the equivalent shear rate eq 6 is plotted in fig 8 in which points represent experimental data and the lines correspond to the fitting curves by the h b p model results show that foams in porous media behave as non newtonian yield stress fluids and the apparent viscosity of foam increases with foam quality therefore we found that foam flow in porous media behaved as a bulk foam if the bubbles were smaller than the pore size and for a low quality foam flow regime in addition we observed that the yield stress values for foams in porous media were about twice as high as those found for bulk foams see table 3 moreover the fluidity index n increased when the gas fractions decreased and had a value of 0 65 for fg 60 in the literature n 0 5 is found for low quality bulk foams fg 75 y otsubo and prud homme 1994 1994 larmignat et al 2008 so it agrees with our results however note that the power law index n was around 0 5 for all bulk foams this may be a consequence of the surface roughness since our porous medium consisted of glass bead packing and the pore walls are smooth compared to the serrated geometry of the rheometer also it may be a result of the enduring sample preparation time for the foam with the quality of fg 60 mentioned in section 5 1 consequently the foams can be classified into two groups depending on foam quality and values of the power law index where we observed n 0 5 for fg 85 and 95 and n 0 5 for fg 60 foams in fig 9 a the apparent viscosity of the bulk foam defined as τ γ is plotted as a function of shear rate for various foam qualities on a log log scale the apparent viscosity obtained from experiments in porous media is also presented in the same figure the range of the shear rate was restricted in order to facilitate the comparison of the results fig 9b shows the fitted results with the shift parameter α for each foam quality eq 5 in this figure the colored dots represent the outcomes of foam flow in porous media and star dots are the result of the bulk foam examined through the rheometer the fitted shift parameters α with the coefficient of determination are tabulated in table 4 for each foam quality here the shift parameter is found to allow a good superposition of the apparent viscosities of bulk and in situ foam moreover α becomes more significant with increasing foam quality in previous studies related to yield stress fluids it was found that the shift parameter α 1 for sandstones fletcher et al 1991 and bead packings rodríguez de castro 2019 zitha et al 1995 also α was mostly assumed to be constant and independent of flow rate recently rodriguez de castro 2019 showed empirically in glass bead packings the dependence of α on flow rates where α 1 at slow flow rates and α 1 for high flow rates with a constant value at very high velocities however note that all these studies were related to the flow of polymer solutions in porous media and there is a lack of data for foams in this study it was found that the values of α for foams are even smaller than those for newtonian fluids in glass bead packings rodríguez de castro 2019 also we observed that apparent in situ foam viscosity is higher than bulk foam viscosity at the same shear rate since bulk foam was examined at ambient conditions this phenomenon may occur due to the effect of foam compressibility 5 3 upscaling of foam flow 5 3 1 influence of foam quality the outcome of the numerical study on foam flow in the periodic 2d spc unit cell is compared to the experimental results in terms of the velocity pressure gradient relationship in fig 10 for different foam qualities in order to compare model results and experimental data fig 10 was plotted on a semi logarithmic scale the dashed lines represent numerical results in which the size of the solid cylinder was set in order to fit the experimental data in terms of permeability k 8 3 10 10 m2 the colored dots correspond to experimental results in 1 mm gb packing thus the flow of foam with quality values of 60 85 and 95 were examined to study the influence of foam quality on foam flow behavior as experimental results it is observed that the foam flow viscosity in porous media increases with fg however results from the numerical study show higher foam mobility even at lower pressure gradients compared to experimental results the global trend of the curves and the behavior in terms of fg follow the same tendency as those of the experimental results 5 3 2 effect of porous media geometry fig 11 shows the superficial velocity of foam as a function of the pressure gradient in different 2d and 3d geometries for fg 85 the dashed lines correspond to the numerical results where the unit cell geometry was adjusted to match the k 8 3 10 10 m2 value in newtonian case and the colored dots represent the corresponding experimental results of gb packing for fg 85 as fig 11 shows the flow is non linear and depends on the geometry of porous media which plays a crucial role in the flow of yield stress fluids moreover flow in 2d spc and 2d sps geometries are close to each other but differ from the outcomes of other unit cells in addition the results for more complex 2d unit cells cpc and cps are very close to those of 3d unit cells scp and bcp since the upscaling results were plotted on the semi logarithmic scale the small difference between the results was not explicitly shown the porosity of 2d spc and 2d cps cells respectively equal 0 49 and 0 63 which is higher than the porosity of other unit cells where the values are close to 0 4 therefore we conclude that the foam s behavior depends on the porous media structure the results for the complex 2d and 3d geometries are closer to the experimental data than the simple 2d geometries the predicted superficial foam velocities are however still a few order of magnitudes higher than the experimental data this discrepancy can be attributed to the effects of compressibility and gas trapping which should be considered during the study of foam flow in porous media to estimate the trapping effect in foam injection experiments we calculated the capillary number nca using the following equation satter and iqbal 2015 18 n c a k p γ where γ 0 036 n m is gas liquid interfacial tension consequently the capillary numbers as a function of pressure gradient can be written as nca 2 31 10 8 p the minimum value of nca is then 2 55 10 3 which corresponds to our minimum measured pressure gradient 110 782 pa m where foam quality was 60 this capillary number is even greater than the critical capillary number of 10 5 above which the capillary forces become negligible according to several studies chatzis and morrow 1984 ding and kantzas 2007 therefore gas trapping can be negligible in our experiments to better observe the effects of gas trapping and compressibility of foam with fg 85 in the porous medium we closed the outlet of the generator column and measured the pressure drop along the main column at the end of the experiment from the result presented in fig 12 it is shown that the pressure in the column reduced gradually even after the foam supply was stopped during the first two hours the pressure gradient dropped sharply from 140 000 pa m to 37 000 pa m after gradually decreasing and the experiment lasted four days after closing the foam generator outlet foam continues flowing through the column this can be explained by the foam compressibility effect however the pressure gradient falls first very fast and then more slowly because of the gas trapping from the values of the capillary number shown in fig 12 we can say that the gas trapping occurs below a critical capillary pressure number nca 7 10 4 this shows that our foam flow experiments in 1 mm glass bead packing 2 55 10 3 nca 5 42 10 3 are not affected by the gas trapping we also observed the foam s compressibility and gas trapping effects by measuring the pressure gradient along the column and weighing the effluent the pre generated foam column was first connected to the gb column that was initially saturated by the surfactant solution fig 13 shows a plot of the effluent mass and pressure gradient as a function of the main column pv the pv of the gb packing was 180 9 ml which is shown in fig 13 by the continuous black line the total injection rate into the foam generator was 2 ml min including 1 20 ml min of n2 gas and 0 80 ml min of surfactant solution however the gas breakthrough happened after producing of 2 94 pv of liquid which corresponds to a slope change in the figure dotted black line hence 2 94 times more liquid was recovered than initially stated in the column this indicates compressibility and trapping of gas in porous media that delayed the gas breakthrough time from fig 12 we discovered that the gas was trapped considerably below 37 000 pa m thus the liquid flowed within foam lamellae at the low pressure gradients this phenomenon was also observed by falls et al 1989 they found the flow of foam lamellae through a single flow path where stationary lamellae blocked most of the cross sectional area of the bead pack at sufficiently low pressure gradients since the gas was trapped in the porous medium all liquids were transported through the lamellae thus delaying the gas breakthrough therefore we recovered 385 ml of liquid when the gas breakthrough occurred that is 2 1 times more than pv moreover based on the trend equation of liquid production for the first half of the curve the liquid recovery rate was approximately 128 8 ml per injected pv which is 24 less than the injection volume 180 9 ml if we consider that the liquid is an incompressible fluid the volume of gas is reduced to 40 therefore we can conclude that foam flow at low capillary numbers is influenced by the trapping effect and at high pressure gradients by the compressibility which tends to decrease the foam s gas volume after the breakthrough when the foam had reached the column outlet the change of effluent weight corresponded to the mass of the injected fluid as a consequence of these results foam compressibility must be taken into account during the study of foam rheology in confined media since most of the foam volume is gas compressibility is one of the essential parameters the compressibility is often described in terms of the expansion ratio ε which is defined as the ratio between the density of liquid phase ρ l and the foam density ρ f ε ρ l ρ f valko and economides 1992 the expansion pressure should be determined for each pressure drop using the volume equalization method proposed by valko and economides 1992 one should obtain a single master curve by plotting normalized shear stress τ ε versus normalized shear rate γ ε regardless of the pressure and foam quality according to valko and economides 1992 this method is relevant for low expansion foams ε 4 with spherical bubbles gardiner et al 1999 highlighted an increase in apparent foam viscosity with the expansion ratio by analyzing and fitting the foam viscosity data from previous research they also found that the volume equalization method proposed by valko and economides 1992 is applicable to polyhedral ε 5 and bubbly to polyhedral 5 ε 4 foams gardiner et al 1998 most of these studies were done using simple geometries such as pipes therefore the determination of the expansion ratio in a porous medium is more difficult if only the pressure drop along the column is measured to avoid the compressibility effect we investigated the upscaling of foam flow in a more highly permeable porous medium based on the results of 4 mm glass bead packing from omirbekov et al 2020 in this case foam was pre generated using the same surfactant solution and sand pack the maximum pressure gradient was 23 210 pa m at the flow rate of 3 ml min at fg 85 hence the permeability of the unit cells was adjusted to the permeability of 4 mm glass bead packing k 1 09 10 8 m2 no gas trapping was expected as the capillary numbers were 4 5 10 3 and 7 10 3 at the flow rates of 0 22 and 3 ml min respectively fig 14 shows the upscaling results through the different 2d and 3d geometries with the experimental outcomes from omirbekov et al 2020 in this case the upscaling results are close to the experimental data because the compressibility effect is insignificant in 4 mm glass bead packing ε 1 we estimated the expansion ratio for 1 mm glass bead packing using the volume equalization method of valko and economides 1992 in fig 15 we plotted the shear stress versus the shear rate of fg 85 foam in 1 mm glass bead packings without and with mean expansion factor based on the 4 mm gb packing results we found a mean expansion factor of ε 2 1 for 1 mm glass bead packing because the bubble shape of the foam in porous media is more spherical the method of valko and economides 1992 for low expansion foams is applicable we note also the simplicity of the unit cells considered here where the pore scale structure is highly ordered which may also influence the results and partly explain the discrepancies observed consequently upscaling is an encouraging tool if the input parameters are settled by taking into account not only the real structure of the porous medium but also all phenomena involved for foam flow in confined media in this paper we only investigated the upscaling of foam flow from pore scale to laboratory scale therefore the second upscaling from laboratory scale to field scale should be explored in the future then foam stability including coalescence and gravity segregation needs to be investigated we know that in field applications foam texture and bubble sizes may be different as foam residence time can be much longer 5 3 3 empirical darcy scale law to further study foam flow in porous media using the bulk foam viscosity as input we used the purely empirical approach of chevalier et al 2013 for the flow of yield stress fluids ysf in glass bead packings with a bead diameter d which is presented in the following form chevalier et al 2013 19 p χ τ 0 d ω a u d n d they considered a polymer carbopol aqueous solution and an emulsion water in oil emulsion with a surfactant solution as yield stress fluids in their study the relationship between the pressure gradient p and the darcy velocity u is of the same form as the constitutive law of the fluid which contains the yielding term in the preceding equation terms χ and ω are dimensionless coefficients that depend on the distribution of shear rate intensity and on the power law index chevalier et al 2014 to determine the dimensionless coefficients of ysf darcy s law we used the h b p fitting parameters of bulk foam and deduced χ and ω parameters by adjusting to u p results of foam flow in gb packing fig 16 presents the experimental results with the fitted ysf darcy law in which the colored dots represent the results of experiments through the gb packing and dotted lines are the results of the extended darcy s law for yield stress fluids with fitted parameters the corresponding dimensionless coefficients and coefficient of determination for each foam quality are presented in table 5 the values of the dimensionless coefficients determined are found to be very high in comparison to previous results of chevalier et al 2013 2014 chevalier et al 2013 2014 in which they found χ equal to 12 and 5 5 for the polymer solution and for the water in oil emulsion respectively the dimensionless coefficient ω was 85 for both types of fluids our results showed that χ decreases with increasing foam quality and is 2 6 times higher than the values found for the polymer and the emulsion therefore we recommend considering χ as a function depending on foam quality moreover it was observed that the coefficient ω was 870 for foams with 85 and 95 foam qualities but it was 535 6 for fg 60 these results can be an outcome of power law index values which was high for fg 60 foams thus in our case ω should be considered individually for bubbly liquids fg 64 low quality 64 fg 97 and high quality foams fg 97 consequently we can conclude that the darcy scale law depends on foam quality as foam rheology changes with the fraction of gas and liquid 6 conclusion this work investigated the upscaling of foam flow for very high permeability porous media the impact of foam quality on the apparent foam viscosity with a fixed flow rate was examined to distinguish the low and high quality regimes the rheology of pre generated foam through the fine sand was studied as a bulk foam in a rheometer foams of different qualities were also injected into a porous column filled with 1 mm glass beads from which the foam rheology was deduced the results of both methods were fitted by a rheological model herschel bulkley papanastasiou model and analyzed by comparison with each other foam flow s macroscopic behavior was also numerically studied in different periodic 2d and 3d unit cells by using the rheological data of bulk foam as an input we also used the empirical darcy scale law proposed by chevalier et al 2013 to derive dimensionless coefficients from our experimental results we draw the following conclusions bulk foam was found to behave as a yield stress fluid and the yield stress values increased with foam quality the rheological behavior of foam fits well with the herschel bulkley model foam in highly permeable porous media k 8 3 10 10 m2 was also found to behave as a yield stress shear thinning fluid regardless of the foam quality it was also shown that the apparent foam viscosity in porous media increases with the foam quality at the same total flow rate apparent foam viscosity was seen to be 3 4 times higher than bulk foam viscosity at the same shear rate which may be due to the complexity of the foam flow in porous media however this difference was smaller for very highly permeable porous media secondly the values of dimensionless coefficients of empirical extended darcy s law exhibited high values for foam compared to other yield stress fluids and varied depending on foam quality considerable differences were observed in the experimental and numerical results of upscaling the global trend of the curves and the behavior in terms of fg followed the same tendency as those of the experimental results the experimental results for a very highly permeable porous medium where the compressibility effect is not significant fitted well to the experimental data in the absence of the foam trapping e g a high capillary number the difference between upscaling results and experimental data can be related to the foam compressibility therefore foam rheological behavior in porous media can be easily predicted from the bulk foam in the case where the foam compressibility is negligible the calculated compressibility coefficients should be increased with increasing pressure gradients upscaling can be an encouraging tool to predict foam flow behavior from its bulk behavior however further investigations are necessary to incorporate the complex nature of the foam flow in porous media into the upscaling model these insights are a promising point for studying foam flow in highly permeable porous media credit authorship contribution statement sagyn omirbekov conceptualization

by the région centre val de loire and the european regional development fund appendix a to study the variation of foam bubbles in bulk form fig 1a a and in 1 mm gb packing fig 1ab we used a dynamic foam analyzer dfa 100 kruss the foam analyzer consists of a glass column 250 mm long and 40 mm internal diameter a camera and a light source the experiments were conducted as in studies by omirbekov et al 2020 where n2 gas was injected into the surfactant solution aos 4 cmc using a porous glass disc the porous glass disc was chosen according to the foam generator where the pore size varied from 10 to 16 µm in the porous medium the used volumetric amount of the surfactant solution and the gas injection time were reduced by 60 since the porosity of the bead pack was about 40 in both cases the camera height was set to 100 mm to record the change in bubble size over time fig 2a shows the change of structures in bulk foam and foam in 1 mm gb packing where the mean bubble area mba was compared after 60 300 and 900 s we observed that the bulk foam is less stable than foam in porous media it is the consequence of the drainage process which is greater for the bulk foam for instance the mba of bulk foam doubled after 300 s while the mba of foam in 1 mm gb packing increased twice in 900 s which was three times lower than the bulk foam the bulk foam decays faster than the foam in porous media due to gravity drainage and gas diffusion which tends to coalescence and coarsen average bubble size while in porous media the effect of gravity is small due to the short length scales within the bead pack therefore the hydrostatic pressure differences are slight jones et al 2016 jones et al 2016 also found a correlation between apparent foam viscosity in porous media and the stability of foam in bulk form moreover from fig 2a we can see that the shape of the bulk foam bubbles was changed from spherical to polyhedral over time while the shape of the foam bubbles in porous media did not change and it took the shape of pores to a greater degree in fig 3a we plot the characteristic ratio of the bubble area bc as a function of time where bc is the ratio of mbapm to mbabulk at the same time in the beginning the ratio is close to one however the values of bc decrease with time showing that the variation of foam bubbles is much higher than for foam in the porous medium nevertheless it must be noted that these experiments were conducted at ambient pressure in the static case in addition the height of the system exceeds 200 mm which tends to increase bubble coalescence due to gravity drainage in the 1d column experiment we expected the bubble change to be less than that detected by the foam analyzer because the foam was examined horizontally therefore the effect of gravity drainage was assumed to be weaker moreover the foam in the 1d column flowed under a certain pressure and according to the study by holt et al 1996 the foam strength made of aos surfactant increases with increasing system pressure in our recent study omirbekov et al 2020 we compared the behavior of foams in 1 mm gb packing where the foams were pre generated in a 1 mm bead pack and in a sand pack used in this study from the plot of apparent viscosity versus total flow rate we noticed that the apparent foam viscosities vary greatly even at low flow rates despite the long residence time of the foam in the column thus it can be concluded that foam stability in confined environments is much longer than in bulk form nevertheless we confirm that there was a small change in the size of the bubbles in the main column outlet this should be studied with great care in future studies 
377,foam in porous media has been studied as a tool for various applications recently the technology has become relevant for contaminated aquifer remediation where porous media are highly permeable therefore the behavior of foam flow in high permeability porous media still raises numerous questions in particular upscaling of the foam flow from pore to darcy scale is still under debate since the behavior of bulk foam has been studied principally in the food and cosmetics industries and foam flow in porous media has mainly been investigated in the oil industry the link between bulk foam behavior and foam flow in porous media is still missing the upscaling of foam flow from the pore scale to the laboratory scale could give valuable insight for understanding foam flow in aquifers we studied the behavior of pre generated foam with different foam qualities through the rheological characterization of bulk foam using a rheometer and also when flowing in a porous medium composed of 1 mm glass beads foam was formed by co injecting surfactant solution and nitrogen gas through a porous column filled by fine sand the homogenization method is used to study macroscopic foam flow properties in porous media by solving the non linear boundary value problem the rheology of bulk foam is then used as an input in the upscaling procedure for foam flow in different periodic model 2d and 3d unit cells from our experiments we found that the bulk foam is a yield stress fluid and that the yield stress values increase with foam quality moreover the rheology of bulk foam corresponds well to the yield stress herschel bulkley papanastasiou model we found that foam behaves as a continuous yield stress fluid in highly permeable porous media it was also shown that the apparent foam viscosity in porous media increases with the foam quality at the same total flow rate the results obtained from the rheometer successfully match the outcomes of apparent foam viscosity obtained by flow in porous media by a shifting parameter for the same foam quality the apparent foam viscosity found in 1 mm glass bead packing was much higher than bulk foam viscosity experimental results were compared to numerical results on simple unit cells although we observed considerable differences between the experimental and numerical results of upscaling the general trend was identical the differences can be explained by the complexity of the foam flow in porous media especially foam compressibility we found that foam flow at low capillary numbers is influenced by the trapping effect and at high pressure gradients by the compressibility compressibility was estimated for foam flow in 1 mm glass bead packing when foam compressibility is insignificant the upscaling model can predict foam flow behavior well at the darcy scale graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bulk foam porous media rheology non newtonian fluid yield stress upscaling 1 introduction foam is a two phase system where gas bubbles are dispersed in the continuous liquid phase the liquid phase in foam is generally an aqueous surfactant solution that plays a crucial role in stabilizing the liquid films between bubbles by increasing the surface tension foam is used in a wide variety of industrial applications due to its mechanical behavior combined with its sizeable specific area relative to the density prud homme and khan 2017 for instance foam in the oil industry can be used as a drilling fluid as a mobility control agent in enhanced oil recovery processes chen et al 2014 in matrix acidization treatments rossen and wang 1999 and in gas leakage prevention bernard and holm 1970 in soil remediation processes foam can be used as a sweeping pollutant fluid hirasaki et al 1997 as fluid that transports soil cleaning additives or gases maire et al 2019 choi et al 2009 moreover in ordinary life foam can be found in many food and cosmetic products the mechanical behavior of bulk foam is complicated due to elastic plastic and viscous properties therefore their complexity is analyzed using rheology coussot 2005 larson 1999 macosko 1994 many authors have experimentally studied the rheology of bulk foam in the last sixty years cohen addad et al 2013 denkov et al 2009 hohler and cohen addad 2005 katgert et al 2013 kraynik 1988 dollet and raufaste 2014 khan et al 1988 herzhaft 1999 denkov et al 2005 in most of the studies bulk foam was identified as a yield stress fluid and the majority of the results are commonly well fitted by the herschel bulkley law for instance khan et al 1988 investigated bulk foam through a rheometer with parallel plate geometry the geometry was covered with sandpaper to eliminate the wall slip velocity the average diameter of foam bubbles was 65 μm as measured by an optical method they demonstrated the existence of a yield stress for foams with 92 95 and 97 of gas fractions fg foam quality with the yield stress increasing with fg a full understanding of foam flow in porous media is hindered due to the complex behavior of foam associated with the complex microstructure of porous media there are also apparent contradictions in the conclusions of the studies on foam flow presented in the literature for instance some authors showed newtonian persoff et al 1991 foam flow behavior in porous media others shear thinning hirasaki and lawson 1985 falls et al 1989 a mixture of newtonian and shear thinning vassenden and holt 2000 or related to foam quality alvarez et al 2001 hirasaki and lawson 1985 reported non linear behavior in foam when flowing through a smooth capillary tube and pointed out the impact of foam texture bubble size on apparent foam viscosity shear thinning behavior of foam flow in homogenous bead packs was shown by falls et al 1989 rossen and wang 1999 modeled foam as a bingham plastic flowing in sandstones they assumed bubble size was fixed and roughly equal to pore size at low quality regimes some authors also considered the presence of yield stress based on a threshold pressure gradient which was linked with the types of gas and surfactant surfactant concentration and petrophysical properties of porous media rossen and gauglitz 1990 dicksen et al 2002 ransohoff and radke 1988 gauglitz et al 2002 omirbekov et al 2020 however in most of the foam modeling investigations in porous media foam was characterized as a pure power law fluid without assuming yield stress friedmann et al 1991 kovscek et al 1997 bertin et al 1998 myers and radke 2000 kam 2008 kovscek et al 2010 ashoori et al 2012 recently aranda et al 2020 experimentally found the shear thinning behavior of foam when studying the influence of permeability on the apparent foam viscosity in highly permeable porous media several foam modeling techniques have been developed since the 1980s to understand and predict the complex behavior of foam flow in porous media ma et al 2015 ma et al 2015 provided a complete overview of existing methods for modeling foam in porous media they categorized the modeling techniques into three groups depending on implicit or dynamic foam textures local equilibrium models population balance models and others they also indicated the possibility of using all models for direct incorporation into reservoir simulators based on material balance and darcy law they highlighted some studies on the upscaling of foam from laboratory scale to field scale in which the upscaling problems were pointed out due to entrance and end effects in laboratory core experiments on the other hand a link between pore or bubble scale discontinuous physics and darcy scale continuum models is missing this link is often ascertained through a variety of upscaling approaches berryman 2005 for instance darcy s law is obtained from the creeping incompressible flow of a newtonian fluid via the volume averaging method with a no slip boundary condition at the liquid solid interfaces quintard and whitaker 1993 1994 in this method intrinsic permeability is calculated as a function of closure variables for a given geometry porous media whitaker 1999 however upscaling is still a challenge for non newtonian fluids which are described by non linear partial differential equations there are very few experimental numerical or analytical studies on the upscaling of the non newtonian fluids flow in porous media several authors theoretically numerically investigated upscaling power law fluids idris et al 2004 wang et al 2014 woods et al 2003 orgéas et al 2006 viscoelastic fluids yield stress fluids or considered the case of generalized non newtonian fluids orgéas et al 2007 therefore the upscaling of foam flow in porous media is still questionable especially in soil remediation where the permeability of porous media is high some authors also empirically proposed a darcy scale equation for non newtonian fluids larry et al 1986 chauveteau 1982 chevalier et al 2013 rodríguez de castro 2019 put simply the extension of the darcy scale equation for yield stress fluid in anisotropic porous media is very complex and still open to our knowledge the modeling of non newtonian fluids especially yield stress fluid flow in porous media has received less attention due to strong coupling between the porous medium and the fluid s rheology most of the previous studies on foam in porous media were related to the oil industry where bubble size was considered to be roughly equal to pore size however in soil remediation cases the porous medium is highly permeable and consists of large pores and there the bubbles can be much smaller than the characteristic length in porous media consequently the main objective of this study was to show whether foam flow in highly permeable porous media can be deduced from the bulk foam behavior and if we can consider foam as a single phase yield stress fluid we also aimed to characterize the rheological behavior of bulk foam experimentally and to scale up analytically and numerically the foam flow from pore to laboratory darcy scale 2 theoretical considerations one of the important characteristics of foam is its foam quality which is the ratio of the injected gas volume to the total liquid and gas volume and can be expressed as 1 f g q g q g q l in which qg ml min and ql ml min are the volumetric gas and liquid flow rates respectively the sum of qg and ql provides the value of total flow rate q according to the value of gas fraction bulk foam can be dry fg 99 wet 64 fg 99 or considered as a bubbly liquid fg 64 langevin 2017 moreover foam bubble shape can be transformed from spherical to polyhedral by increasing the gas fraction kovscek and radke 1994 in porous media osterloh and jante 1992 distinguished two particular foam flow regimes depending on foam quality in sand pack experiments at a steady state they found a low quality regime wet in which the pressure gradient was constant regardless of the liquid flow rate and a high quality regime dry in which the pressure gradient was independent of the gas flow rate a transition foam quality f g divides these two regimes and depends on porous media characteristics types of surfactants and gas alvarez et al 2001 newtonian fluid flow in porous media can be considered as models of flow through a bundle of tortuous capillary tubes which have uniform radii r by the theory of kozeny carman kozeny 1927 carman 1997 tortuosity in capillaries is defined as the ratio between the effective length leff i e length of the tortuous capillaries and the lengths of equivalent straight capillary tubes l hence it was assumed that fluid entering into tortuous capillaries flows faster than the fluid flowing through the equivalent straight capillaries in order to reach to the end of the tube at the same time using this concept flow in porous media can be presented as follows 2 u r 2 δ p 8 μ l l l e f f 2 u m s and δp pa are darcy velocity and pressure drop in the direction parallel to length l m μ pa s is the dynamic fluid viscosity is the porous media porosity eq 2 is then identified with the darcy velocity for the flow of newtonian fluids in porous media darcy 1856 3 u q a k δ p μ l where q m3 s and a m2 are the flow rate and cross section surface area of the porous media the mean pore radius could be calculated as the radius of straight capillaries composing a bundle giving the same flow 4 r e q 2 r l l e f f 2 8 k in the preceding equation req m is the average pore throat radius k m2 is the intrinsic permeability of the porous media the term l l e f f 2 represents the tortuosity in porous media hence an equivalent shear rate γ e q for flow in porous media can be expressed as darby et al 2001 5 γ e q 4 α u r e q in which α is an empirical shift parameter associated with the bulk rheology of the fluid and the tortuosity of porous media chauveteau and zaitoun 1981 the tortuosity of packed spheres was assumed to be 25 12 from the derivation of the blake kozeny equation using the capillary model christopher and middleman 1965 hirasaki and pope 1974 as a consequence hirasaki and pope 1974 proposed to use α 0 69 through α 1 l l e f f for newtonian fluids recently rodriguez de castro 2019 experimentally found α equal to 0 68 in glass bead packings if we consider darcy s law as applicable for the flow of a non newtonian fluid in porous media the effect of non linear rheology of the fluid can be incorporated in the definition of an apparent viscosity given by 6 μ a p p k δ p u l this apparent viscosity μ app is not an intrinsic property of fluid and varies with the flow rate it is a non linear function of the equivalent shear rate given in eq 5 which can be varied relying on the flow rate moreover the shear rate varies considerably as a function of the structure and the heterogeneity of porous media that change interstitial velocity the rheological behavior of yield stress fluid for simple shear can be described through the herschel bulkley model herschel and bulkley 1926 7 τ τ 0 γ 0 solid regime τ τ 0 τ τ 0 a γ n liquid regime where τ pa is the shear stress γ 1 s is the shear rate τ0 pa is the yield stress a pa sn and n are the consistency and flow indexes respectively the continuous viscous model proposed by papanastasiou papanastasiou 1987 is used to prevent the main difficulty caused by the herschel bulkley model in numerical studies due to discontinuous behavior at insufficient shear rates that tend the apparent viscosity to infinity the herschel bulkley papanastasiou h b p model can be written as follows 8 μ γ a γ n 1 τ 0 γ 1 exp m γ in which m s is the exponent index based on the models mentioned above denkov et al 2005 studied foam rheology and wall slip velocity with 90 gas fraction using a rheometer the foam used was generated using a syringe with a needle with id inner diameter of 2 5 mm they found the power law index equal to 0 25 and 0 42 for tangentially mobile and immobile bubble surfaces respectively denkov et al 2009 studied the effects of surfactant type and bubble surfaces on bulk foam rheology with fg 80 they classified the rheological behavior of foam into two different classes depending on values of power law index n by taking into account the viscous friction between bubbles and also between bubbles and solid walls qualitatively the results with n 0 5 referred to the first system which was described as the dominant friction in foam films and the second type n 0 5 mostly between 0 2 and 0 25 was defined as the essential energy dissipation on the bubble surfaces these studies show solid plastic or viscoelastic behavior of foam below yield stress and non newtonian liquid regime above the yield stress the transition from solid like to liquid like mechanical behavior is called yielding the yielding can be explained through the complex shear modulus that appears at the transition from a mostly elastic regime where g storage modulus g loss modulus towards predominantly viscous behavior g g larson 1999 the behavior of inverse transition from liquid like to solid like is called jamming which was studied by slightly decreasing the shear rates and measuring the stress liu and nagel 1998 the apparent viscosity of foam is several times larger than the viscosity of the continuous liquid phase even at low shear rates this can be explained from a description of foam at the molecular and bubble scale hohler and cohen addad 2005 3 experimental approach here we present the fluids and materials used the experimental setups and procedures were provided to characterize the rheology of foam in bulk form and in porous media 3 1 fluids and materials 3 1 1 surfactant solution c14 16 alpha olefin sulfonate aos based surfactant rhodacal lss 40 ax solvay novecare and demineralized degassed water were used to prepare a surfactant solution the surfactant contained 40 wt of active materials in the aqueous solution the chemical surfactant was chosen on the basis of several factors like soil biodegradability tuvell et al 1978 talmage 1994 market accessibility cserháti et al 2002 and field tests for soil remediation purposes svab et al 2009 the critical micelle concentration cmc of the surfactant is 1 8 0 1 g l which is measured by the pendant drop method stauffer 1965 using a drop shape analyzer dsa 100s kruss the surfactant solution was prepared at a concentration of four times cmc to avoid adsorption paria 2008 omirbekov et al 2020 aranda et al 2020 at low concentrations and respect the biodegradability at high concentrations 3 1 2 gas the gas used to generate foam in all experiments was nitrogen provided by air liquide with a purity of 99 98 n2 was selected after considering several studies presented in the literature including foam stability farajzadeh et al 2009 zeng et al 2016 and solubility sander 1999 of gases also carbon dioxide purity 99 7 provided by air liquide is used for pre saturation procedures to avoid trapping of gas bubbles 3 1 3 porous media unconsolidated porous media made from calibrated silica sand br 37 and 1 mm glass beads are used which are provided by sibelco and sigma aldrich companies respectively the sand grading characteristics were as follows the uniformity coefficient cu is 0 72 the curvature coefficient cc is 0 98 the effective size d10 and mean grain size d50 are 0 180 and 0 135 mm respectively fine sand packing was used to generate foam while foam flow was examined in 1 mm glass bead gb packing the characteristics of the porous media are presented in table 1 3 2 experimental setups the setups used to conduct the experiments are shown in fig 1 to generate foam n2 and the surfactant solution were co injected into the foam generator column then the rheology of pre generated foam was studied with different methods a in bulk form using a rheometer bulk b in the main porous media column p m the mass flow controller el flow select f 201cv bronkhorst providing a range of 0 16 10 mln min 0 5 reading plus 0 1 full scale was used to control the gas flow rate and ensure the flow stability from a gas bottle a piston pump model 1hm eldex with a precision of 0 3 was used to inject the surfactant solution at a constant flow rate the foam generator column was 10 cm long with 4 cm inside diameter and made of transparent polyvinyl chloride pvc the sand pack was retained using a metallic grid with 42 µm cell size the following setups were used to investigate the pre generated foam properties a a rotational rheometer haake mars 60 thermofisher min torque rotation 0 02 µnm torque resolution 0 1 nnm with serrated parallel plate geometry p60 ti se and tmp60 se was used to examine the rheology of pre generated foam in bulk form b the main column made of pvc material with a length of 40 cm and an inner diameter of 4 cm packed by 1 mm glass beads was used to study foam from the foam generator column metallic grids with 150 µm cell size were used on each side of the column to contain the glass bead packing pressure drop along the main column was measured through a differential pressure transmitter rosemount 2051 emerson with a 0 2500 mbar range 7 mbar at the maximum value an electronic balance model stx 6201 ohaus with a precision of 0 1 g was used to measure the effluent weight the maximum pressure limit of the experimental installation was up to 6 bars controlled by the pump pressure sensor 3 3 experimental procedures first the porous columns were carefully packed and checked for leaks the columns were flushed by co2 gas to remove any air then degassed demineralized water was injected into the columns in a vertical position with a 0 5 ml min for at least five pore volumes pv to dissolve any co2 and thus to saturate the column thoroughly as co2 is highly soluble in the water this step was used to provide 100 of porous media saturation to measure pore volume and porosity the columns were weighed before and after the water saturation the subsequent experimental steps were carried out with the column in a horizontal position the permeability of the porous media was measured through the injection of degassed water with different flow rates while measuring the pressure difference and calculated via darcy s law eq 3 the measured properties of porous media were tabulated in table 1 next the column was flushed with 3 pv of surfactant solution to complete adsorption finally to generate foam the surfactant solution and the nitrogen gas were simultaneously injected into the foam generator 5 pv of fluids was co injected to obtain a stable pre generated foam the pre generated foam was further investigated a using the rheometer and b in glass bead packing a pre generated foams with 60 85 and 95 foam qualities generated at the same total flow rates q 2 ml min u 2 65 10 05 m s were investigated using the rheometer the mechanical properties of foam were probed through the rheometer considering previous studies larson 1999 macosko 1994 the parallel plate geometry with serrated surfaces was used to avoid wall slip velocity herzhaft 1999 marze et al 2008 princen and kiss 1989 the shear gap of the geometry was 1 mm which was chosen by taking into account previous studies herzhaft 1999 moreover before starting the experiments the dynamic stability of the foam at each quality was verified based on the study of khan et al 1988 by examining samples at a constant shear rate the idea was to observe how long the foam could withstand at constant torque the decrease in torque values indicates the change in the foam structure the volume of 3 1 ml of the foam sample was set in the gap and the experiments were run in triplicate for each foam quality b firstly the pre generated foam was connected to the main column to study the impact of fg and to determine the transition foam quality f g foam with a fixed total flow rate 2 ml min was studied for various foam qualities 40 99 the fractions of gas and liquid injected were controlled by the mass flow controller and the pump the foam flow experiments were examined through the flow rate and pressure drop measurements along the column consequently the apparent foam viscosity was derived from darcy s law eq 3 after determining f g foam flow in 1 mm gb packing was investigated at low quality regimes foam flow with fg 60 85 and 95 was studied for different total flow rates that were increased step by step from minimum q 0 2 ml min u 2 65 10 06 m s to maximum q 2 2 ml min u 2 92 10 05 m s technically possible values thus 905 and 82 min were required to inject 1 pv of pre generated foam through the main column at the minimum and maximum flow rates respectively experiments were duplicated by at least a descending flow rate experience at the same time the electronic balance measured the liquid effluent to determine the change of surfactant solution saturation sw inside the main column all experiments were carried out at 20 c controlled room temperature and atmospheric pressure 4 theoretical approach upscaling technique since the direct upscaling of foam flow from pore to laboratory scale is complex we used upscaling technique to scale up foam flow by using the rheological data of bulk foam as an input the objective was to examine whether foam flow behavior in porous media can be predicted from its bulk behavior for field application in aquifers a second upscaling from laboratory to aquifer scale should be considered that was beyond the scope of this study in order to numerically study the macroscopic behavior of foam flow it was first necessary to establish the geometry of representative elementary volume rev to correspond to the porous media permeability obtained from the laboratory experiments to do so we solved the closure problem for creeping flow of steady state newtonian fluids developed through the volume averaging method quintard and whitaker 1994 whitaker 1999 to define the permeability of the two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d unit cells see fig 3 the size of solid inclusion in each kind of unit cell was adjusted to obtain the same permeability as in the 1d column experiment then the boundary value problem developed using the homogenization method auriault 1991 was solved to study macroscopic foam flow behavior further the targets of the upscaling were to study the impact of fg and the effect of different unit cell geometries on foam flow then the outcome of the 1d porous column experiments was used to correlate and validate the findings from upscaling 4 1 description of foam flow at the pore scale the concept of porous media is presented in fig 2 in which we consider the foam flow through a periodic rev with ω being the total volume of rev the volume considered consists of ωσ rigid solid phase domain and the β yield stress fluid foam of volume ωβ the porosity of the porous medium can be defined as ωβ ω a no slip boundary condition is considered on the solid fluid interface denoted a βσ also the fluid is considered as incompressible purely viscous and isotropic since the flow is in creeping regime inertial effects are neglected and steady state the mass and momentum balance equations for a yield stress fluid are written as 9 0 p i μ γ v v t in ω β 10 v 0 in ω β 11 v 0 on a β σ where v is the fluid velocity field and p is the pressure μ is the dynamic fluid viscosity which can be defined by the h b p model eq 8 for our case hence the set of equations is the pore scale description of the foam flow problem in highly permeable porous media 4 2 characteristics of the microstructure foam flow in model porous media was investigated with fixed permeability the investigation was carried out in four different periodic 2d and two different 3d unit cells the pore fraction porosity was adjusted to obtain the same permeability as the porous column permeability the types of unit cells with their porosity values are presented in fig 3 with a square packed cylinders with a circular cross section spc b square packed cylinders with a square cross section sps c close packed cylinders with a circular cross section cpc d close packed cylinders with a square cross section cps e simple cubic packing of cubes scp f cubic body centered packing of spheres bcp the edge size of the periodic rev was selected to be 1 mm for all cases in order to be close to 1 mm gb size and the permeability was set equal to 8 3 10 10 m2 the permeability of each porous medium has been calculated by solving the closure problem for newtonian fluid flow through the volume averaging method quintard and whitaker 1994 whitaker 1999 it should be noted that ideally the unit cells chosen must have the same porosity and permeability as the experimental sample moreover they should feature similar microstructures in terms of disorder although all unit cells considered here are ordered geometries the porosity values for cells spc sps scp and bcp are relatively close to each other and also close to the value found for the glass bead packing the porosity for cpc and cps are significantly higher for the same value of the permeability 4 3 upscaling 4 3 1 separation of scales in order to meet the requirements of the homogenization method idris et al 2004 orgéas et al 2007 auriault 1991 papanicolau et al 1978 sanchez palencia 1980 the condition of separation of the scales must be satisfied for the porous media considered as fig 2 describes the characteristic rev length l is supposed to be small compared to the characteristic macroscopic length l which can be expressed as 12 ζ l l 1 where ζ represents the scale separation parameter 4 3 2 boundary value problem in this work the homogenization procedure proposed by orgeas 2007 has been used thus a generalized newtonian fluid through 2d and 3d elementary unit cells is studied using numerical simulations to study foam flow in porous media a boundary value problem concerning the first order velocity v 0 also to the second order pressure p 1 is presented in the following way 13 ζ p 1 τ 0 γ 1 exp m γ a γ n 1 v 0 v 0 t p x 0 in ω β 14 v 0 0 in ω β 15 v 0 0 on a β σ here the unknowns ζp 1 and v 0 are periodic and the macroscopic pressure gradient p x 0 is given on the whole rev as a source term foam was considered as a yield stress fluid following the rheological model h b p eq 8 where the fluid viscosity is supposed to be a function of the magnitude of the shear rate γ given by 16 γ 2 s s where the strain rate s is defined as a function of the velocity field v at the pore scale 17 s 1 2 v 0 v 0 t the boundary value problem given above was solved in the 2d periodic unit cell of circular cross section fig 3 a for fg 60 85 and 95 where the rheological parameters of the continuous viscous model were obtained from the experimental study foam with fg 85 was investigated in all geometries presented in fig 3 for all simulations in the ordered isotropic porous media the macroscopic pressure gradient imposed p x 0 was in the direction of the x axis the non linear boundary value problem eqs 13 15 was solved using comsol multiphysics finite element with a mixed pressure velocity p1 p2 formulation the flow problems were solved through the creeping flow module which is designed for solving stokes flow problems the dynamic viscosity of the module was user defined via the equation view section solving this problem was similar to solving the direct flow problem in simple unit cells the finite triangular elements were used to mesh the 2d geometries an example of mesh and boundary conditions used are in fig 4 results presented in the literature for the same geometries idris et al 2004 orgéas et al 2007 were used to verify the numerical procedure adopted here in the case of power law and generalized newtonian fluids 5 results and discussion 5 1 rheology of bulk foam fig 5 shows the rheology of pre generated foam for different foam qualities in which the shear stress τ is displayed as a function of the shear rate γ the dots represent the average value of experimental results and the lines describe the results of the h b p model table 2 shows the fitting parameters with coefficients of determination the exponent index m was chosen to be 10 000 in order to better represent the yield stress behavior in numerical studies from these results a non newtonian fluid behavior with yield stress is observed that was well fitted by the herschel bulkley papanastasiou model moreover we saw that yield stress increases with increasing foam quality thereby raising the bulk foam viscosity the increasing yield stress value with the foam quality which agrees with the literature results khan et al 1988 where the storage modulus g and τ0 as a function of foam quality marze et al 2009 saint jalmes and durian 1999 were measured the value of the yield stress increases by a factor 2 from fg 85 to fg 95 which can be explained by the evolution of the bubble shape from spherical to polyhedral form thereby increasing the friction between bubbles denkov et al 2009 it can therefore be concluded that in our experiments bulk foam can be clearly considered as a yield stress fluid this is in agreement with previous studies in which the value of the flow index n obtained experimentally was indicated close to 0 5 denkov et al 2009 marze et al 2008 princen and kiss 1989 ovarlez et al 2008 2010 tcholakova et al 2008 it should be noted that the measurement of the rheology for the foam with the quality of fg 60 was found to be complicated due to the drainage of foam liquid phase from the rheometer geometry therefore to avoid the liquid draining from the plates we loaded the exact necessary amount of the foam sample 3 1 ml by setting the gap to 3 mm where the foam sample was placed between two plates then the gap was decreased slowly until 1 mm to perform tests at different shear rates the foam with the quality of fg 60 was studied with great care at each shear rate by performing additional experiments to ensure accurate results these results are analyzed with the outcomes of the experimental study on porous media and further used as inputs for upscaling of foam flow in highly permeable porous media by considering foam as a yield stress fluid 5 2 rheology of foam in porous media darcy scale since foam was generated in the sand pack foam bubble size was expected to be smaller than the pore size of the glass bead packing therefore the bubble sizes were estimated according to previous studies for instance marsden et al 1967 noted that some foams generated in porous media could flow with bubbles much smaller than pores as well as a series of foam films of various sizes shapes and configurations depending on the medium they studied a pre generated foam through the series of four identical porous media consisting of sand with a porosity of 35 and a permeability of 5 2 darcy the foam texture was studied through optical cells and using a microscope they showed an increase in bubble size with a decrease in foam mobility the ratio of effective permeability to apparent viscosity however in later work the opposite was revealed hirasaki and lawson 1985 falls et al 1989 from the results of marsden et al 1967 we observed that the bubble size was smaller at high flow rates compared to the pore size which was estimated to be five times smaller than the grain diameter friedmann and jensen 1986 found that the size of foam bubbles decreased with increasing velocities at constant foam quality by observing the texture of the foam exiting from several different porous media ettinger and radke 1992 studied the foam texture of pre generated foam in berea sandstone they also observed a decrease in bubble size with an increase in flow rate however according to studies by falls et al 1989 the average size of the foam bubbles remained unchanged for the foam which was pre generated in 3 mm glass bead packing and introduced into the second pack with the same grain size the average size of the bubbles was estimated to be the same as the equivalent capillary radius of the packs consequently in this study we roughly assumed that the size of foam bubbles is equivalent to the pore size of the sand pack see table 1 the apparent foam viscosity calculated through darcy s law eq 6 for the experimental study of foam flow in the porous sample 1 mm glass bead packing as a function of foam quality is presented in fig 6 from these results the transition foam quality f g delimiting low and high quality regimes is determined we observed that the transition foam quality was quite high and equal to 97 dashed line hence this result is in good agreement with the results of some authors alvarez et al 2001 briceno and joseph 2003 omirbekov et al 2020 for instance alvarez et al 2001 found a value of f g 97 for an experimental study of foam flow in a sand pack with a permeability of 3 1 darcy where the foam was pre generated through bronze wool alvarez et al 2001 they used two types of surfactants an octyl ethoxylated alcohol and aos to generate foams however the bubble size of the pre generated foam was not mentioned in their work briceno and joseph 2003 investigated pre generated foam flow in a 1 2 m long channel 1 in tall 1 4 in wide and in a pipe 5 8 in inner diameter the foam was formed using an aqueous solution based on a mixture of aos polyacrylic acid polymer cosurfactants dodecanol solvent butanol and water they found f g 97 through the pressure gradient vs foam velocity plot where they discovered a shift in the results at fg 97 it was also visually shown that there was a change in the structure of foam at this transition zone in which foam flow behavior changed from uniform to slug flow recently omirbekov et al 2020 also found that transition foam quality is independent of the porous media grain size when the average foam bubble size is smaller than the pore size of the porous medium the value of transition foam quality for the same foam composition and pre generated foam used in this study was 97 for 2 mm 4 mm and 8 mm glass bead packing nevertheless the foam s bubble size can be changed depending on time this is discussed in appendix a with these results in mind all our further studies were chosen to be conducted in low quality regime fg 85 to avoid the instability around f g fig 7 shows the experimental results in terms of the pressure gradient along the porous column packed by 1 mm gb as a function of the foam flow velocity for fg 60 85 and 95 non linear behavior was observed where the pressure gradient of flow increased with foam quality we were unable to obtain p values above foam injection flowrate of 3 4 ml min due to the maximum pressure limit of the experimental configuration for fg 60 and 85 of foams to investigate the foam rheology the apparent viscosity variations versus the equivalent shear rate eq 5 were analyzed the apparent foam viscosity as a function of the equivalent shear rate eq 6 is plotted in fig 8 in which points represent experimental data and the lines correspond to the fitting curves by the h b p model results show that foams in porous media behave as non newtonian yield stress fluids and the apparent viscosity of foam increases with foam quality therefore we found that foam flow in porous media behaved as a bulk foam if the bubbles were smaller than the pore size and for a low quality foam flow regime in addition we observed that the yield stress values for foams in porous media were about twice as high as those found for bulk foams see table 3 moreover the fluidity index n increased when the gas fractions decreased and had a value of 0 65 for fg 60 in the literature n 0 5 is found for low quality bulk foams fg 75 y otsubo and prud homme 1994 1994 larmignat et al 2008 so it agrees with our results however note that the power law index n was around 0 5 for all bulk foams this may be a consequence of the surface roughness since our porous medium consisted of glass bead packing and the pore walls are smooth compared to the serrated geometry of the rheometer also it may be a result of the enduring sample preparation time for the foam with the quality of fg 60 mentioned in section 5 1 consequently the foams can be classified into two groups depending on foam quality and values of the power law index where we observed n 0 5 for fg 85 and 95 and n 0 5 for fg 60 foams in fig 9 a the apparent viscosity of the bulk foam defined as τ γ is plotted as a function of shear rate for various foam qualities on a log log scale the apparent viscosity obtained from experiments in porous media is also presented in the same figure the range of the shear rate was restricted in order to facilitate the comparison of the results fig 9b shows the fitted results with the shift parameter α for each foam quality eq 5 in this figure the colored dots represent the outcomes of foam flow in porous media and star dots are the result of the bulk foam examined through the rheometer the fitted shift parameters α with the coefficient of determination are tabulated in table 4 for each foam quality here the shift parameter is found to allow a good superposition of the apparent viscosities of bulk and in situ foam moreover α becomes more significant with increasing foam quality in previous studies related to yield stress fluids it was found that the shift parameter α 1 for sandstones fletcher et al 1991 and bead packings rodríguez de castro 2019 zitha et al 1995 also α was mostly assumed to be constant and independent of flow rate recently rodriguez de castro 2019 showed empirically in glass bead packings the dependence of α on flow rates where α 1 at slow flow rates and α 1 for high flow rates with a constant value at very high velocities however note that all these studies were related to the flow of polymer solutions in porous media and there is a lack of data for foams in this study it was found that the values of α for foams are even smaller than those for newtonian fluids in glass bead packings rodríguez de castro 2019 also we observed that apparent in situ foam viscosity is higher than bulk foam viscosity at the same shear rate since bulk foam was examined at ambient conditions this phenomenon may occur due to the effect of foam compressibility 5 3 upscaling of foam flow 5 3 1 influence of foam quality the outcome of the numerical study on foam flow in the periodic 2d spc unit cell is compared to the experimental results in terms of the velocity pressure gradient relationship in fig 10 for different foam qualities in order to compare model results and experimental data fig 10 was plotted on a semi logarithmic scale the dashed lines represent numerical results in which the size of the solid cylinder was set in order to fit the experimental data in terms of permeability k 8 3 10 10 m2 the colored dots correspond to experimental results in 1 mm gb packing thus the flow of foam with quality values of 60 85 and 95 were examined to study the influence of foam quality on foam flow behavior as experimental results it is observed that the foam flow viscosity in porous media increases with fg however results from the numerical study show higher foam mobility even at lower pressure gradients compared to experimental results the global trend of the curves and the behavior in terms of fg follow the same tendency as those of the experimental results 5 3 2 effect of porous media geometry fig 11 shows the superficial velocity of foam as a function of the pressure gradient in different 2d and 3d geometries for fg 85 the dashed lines correspond to the numerical results where the unit cell geometry was adjusted to match the k 8 3 10 10 m2 value in newtonian case and the colored dots represent the corresponding experimental results of gb packing for fg 85 as fig 11 shows the flow is non linear and depends on the geometry of porous media which plays a crucial role in the flow of yield stress fluids moreover flow in 2d spc and 2d sps geometries are close to each other but differ from the outcomes of other unit cells in addition the results for more complex 2d unit cells cpc and cps are very close to those of 3d unit cells scp and bcp since the upscaling results were plotted on the semi logarithmic scale the small difference between the results was not explicitly shown the porosity of 2d spc and 2d cps cells respectively equal 0 49 and 0 63 which is higher than the porosity of other unit cells where the values are close to 0 4 therefore we conclude that the foam s behavior depends on the porous media structure the results for the complex 2d and 3d geometries are closer to the experimental data than the simple 2d geometries the predicted superficial foam velocities are however still a few order of magnitudes higher than the experimental data this discrepancy can be attributed to the effects of compressibility and gas trapping which should be considered during the study of foam flow in porous media to estimate the trapping effect in foam injection experiments we calculated the capillary number nca using the following equation satter and iqbal 2015 18 n c a k p γ where γ 0 036 n m is gas liquid interfacial tension consequently the capillary numbers as a function of pressure gradient can be written as nca 2 31 10 8 p the minimum value of nca is then 2 55 10 3 which corresponds to our minimum measured pressure gradient 110 782 pa m where foam quality was 60 this capillary number is even greater than the critical capillary number of 10 5 above which the capillary forces become negligible according to several studies chatzis and morrow 1984 ding and kantzas 2007 therefore gas trapping can be negligible in our experiments to better observe the effects of gas trapping and compressibility of foam with fg 85 in the porous medium we closed the outlet of the generator column and measured the pressure drop along the main column at the end of the experiment from the result presented in fig 12 it is shown that the pressure in the column reduced gradually even after the foam supply was stopped during the first two hours the pressure gradient dropped sharply from 140 000 pa m to 37 000 pa m after gradually decreasing and the experiment lasted four days after closing the foam generator outlet foam continues flowing through the column this can be explained by the foam compressibility effect however the pressure gradient falls first very fast and then more slowly because of the gas trapping from the values of the capillary number shown in fig 12 we can say that the gas trapping occurs below a critical capillary pressure number nca 7 10 4 this shows that our foam flow experiments in 1 mm glass bead packing 2 55 10 3 nca 5 42 10 3 are not affected by the gas trapping we also observed the foam s compressibility and gas trapping effects by measuring the pressure gradient along the column and weighing the effluent the pre generated foam column was first connected to the gb column that was initially saturated by the surfactant solution fig 13 shows a plot of the effluent mass and pressure gradient as a function of the main column pv the pv of the gb packing was 180 9 ml which is shown in fig 13 by the continuous black line the total injection rate into the foam generator was 2 ml min including 1 20 ml min of n2 gas and 0 80 ml min of surfactant solution however the gas breakthrough happened after producing of 2 94 pv of liquid which corresponds to a slope change in the figure dotted black line hence 2 94 times more liquid was recovered than initially stated in the column this indicates compressibility and trapping of gas in porous media that delayed the gas breakthrough time from fig 12 we discovered that the gas was trapped considerably below 37 000 pa m thus the liquid flowed within foam lamellae at the low pressure gradients this phenomenon was also observed by falls et al 1989 they found the flow of foam lamellae through a single flow path where stationary lamellae blocked most of the cross sectional area of the bead pack at sufficiently low pressure gradients since the gas was trapped in the porous medium all liquids were transported through the lamellae thus delaying the gas breakthrough therefore we recovered 385 ml of liquid when the gas breakthrough occurred that is 2 1 times more than pv moreover based on the trend equation of liquid production for the first half of the curve the liquid recovery rate was approximately 128 8 ml per injected pv which is 24 less than the injection volume 180 9 ml if we consider that the liquid is an incompressible fluid the volume of gas is reduced to 40 therefore we can conclude that foam flow at low capillary numbers is influenced by the trapping effect and at high pressure gradients by the compressibility which tends to decrease the foam s gas volume after the breakthrough when the foam had reached the column outlet the change of effluent weight corresponded to the mass of the injected fluid as a consequence of these results foam compressibility must be taken into account during the study of foam rheology in confined media since most of the foam volume is gas compressibility is one of the essential parameters the compressibility is often described in terms of the expansion ratio ε which is defined as the ratio between the density of liquid phase ρ l and the foam density ρ f ε ρ l ρ f valko and economides 1992 the expansion pressure should be determined for each pressure drop using the volume equalization method proposed by valko and economides 1992 one should obtain a single master curve by plotting normalized shear stress τ ε versus normalized shear rate γ ε regardless of the pressure and foam quality according to valko and economides 1992 this method is relevant for low expansion foams ε 4 with spherical bubbles gardiner et al 1999 highlighted an increase in apparent foam viscosity with the expansion ratio by analyzing and fitting the foam viscosity data from previous research they also found that the volume equalization method proposed by valko and economides 1992 is applicable to polyhedral ε 5 and bubbly to polyhedral 5 ε 4 foams gardiner et al 1998 most of these studies were done using simple geometries such as pipes therefore the determination of the expansion ratio in a porous medium is more difficult if only the pressure drop along the column is measured to avoid the compressibility effect we investigated the upscaling of foam flow in a more highly permeable porous medium based on the results of 4 mm glass bead packing from omirbekov et al 2020 in this case foam was pre generated using the same surfactant solution and sand pack the maximum pressure gradient was 23 210 pa m at the flow rate of 3 ml min at fg 85 hence the permeability of the unit cells was adjusted to the permeability of 4 mm glass bead packing k 1 09 10 8 m2 no gas trapping was expected as the capillary numbers were 4 5 10 3 and 7 10 3 at the flow rates of 0 22 and 3 ml min respectively fig 14 shows the upscaling results through the different 2d and 3d geometries with the experimental outcomes from omirbekov et al 2020 in this case the upscaling results are close to the experimental data because the compressibility effect is insignificant in 4 mm glass bead packing ε 1 we estimated the expansion ratio for 1 mm glass bead packing using the volume equalization method of valko and economides 1992 in fig 15 we plotted the shear stress versus the shear rate of fg 85 foam in 1 mm glass bead packings without and with mean expansion factor based on the 4 mm gb packing results we found a mean expansion factor of ε 2 1 for 1 mm glass bead packing because the bubble shape of the foam in porous media is more spherical the method of valko and economides 1992 for low expansion foams is applicable we note also the simplicity of the unit cells considered here where the pore scale structure is highly ordered which may also influence the results and partly explain the discrepancies observed consequently upscaling is an encouraging tool if the input parameters are settled by taking into account not only the real structure of the porous medium but also all phenomena involved for foam flow in confined media in this paper we only investigated the upscaling of foam flow from pore scale to laboratory scale therefore the second upscaling from laboratory scale to field scale should be explored in the future then foam stability including coalescence and gravity segregation needs to be investigated we know that in field applications foam texture and bubble sizes may be different as foam residence time can be much longer 5 3 3 empirical darcy scale law to further study foam flow in porous media using the bulk foam viscosity as input we used the purely empirical approach of chevalier et al 2013 for the flow of yield stress fluids ysf in glass bead packings with a bead diameter d which is presented in the following form chevalier et al 2013 19 p χ τ 0 d ω a u d n d they considered a polymer carbopol aqueous solution and an emulsion water in oil emulsion with a surfactant solution as yield stress fluids in their study the relationship between the pressure gradient p and the darcy velocity u is of the same form as the constitutive law of the fluid which contains the yielding term in the preceding equation terms χ and ω are dimensionless coefficients that depend on the distribution of shear rate intensity and on the power law index chevalier et al 2014 to determine the dimensionless coefficients of ysf darcy s law we used the h b p fitting parameters of bulk foam and deduced χ and ω parameters by adjusting to u p results of foam flow in gb packing fig 16 presents the experimental results with the fitted ysf darcy law in which the colored dots represent the results of experiments through the gb packing and dotted lines are the results of the extended darcy s law for yield stress fluids with fitted parameters the corresponding dimensionless coefficients and coefficient of determination for each foam quality are presented in table 5 the values of the dimensionless coefficients determined are found to be very high in comparison to previous results of chevalier et al 2013 2014 chevalier et al 2013 2014 in which they found χ equal to 12 and 5 5 for the polymer solution and for the water in oil emulsion respectively the dimensionless coefficient ω was 85 for both types of fluids our results showed that χ decreases with increasing foam quality and is 2 6 times higher than the values found for the polymer and the emulsion therefore we recommend considering χ as a function depending on foam quality moreover it was observed that the coefficient ω was 870 for foams with 85 and 95 foam qualities but it was 535 6 for fg 60 these results can be an outcome of power law index values which was high for fg 60 foams thus in our case ω should be considered individually for bubbly liquids fg 64 low quality 64 fg 97 and high quality foams fg 97 consequently we can conclude that the darcy scale law depends on foam quality as foam rheology changes with the fraction of gas and liquid 6 conclusion this work investigated the upscaling of foam flow for very high permeability porous media the impact of foam quality on the apparent foam viscosity with a fixed flow rate was examined to distinguish the low and high quality regimes the rheology of pre generated foam through the fine sand was studied as a bulk foam in a rheometer foams of different qualities were also injected into a porous column filled with 1 mm glass beads from which the foam rheology was deduced the results of both methods were fitted by a rheological model herschel bulkley papanastasiou model and analyzed by comparison with each other foam flow s macroscopic behavior was also numerically studied in different periodic 2d and 3d unit cells by using the rheological data of bulk foam as an input we also used the empirical darcy scale law proposed by chevalier et al 2013 to derive dimensionless coefficients from our experimental results we draw the following conclusions bulk foam was found to behave as a yield stress fluid and the yield stress values increased with foam quality the rheological behavior of foam fits well with the herschel bulkley model foam in highly permeable porous media k 8 3 10 10 m2 was also found to behave as a yield stress shear thinning fluid regardless of the foam quality it was also shown that the apparent foam viscosity in porous media increases with the foam quality at the same total flow rate apparent foam viscosity was seen to be 3 4 times higher than bulk foam viscosity at the same shear rate which may be due to the complexity of the foam flow in porous media however this difference was smaller for very highly permeable porous media secondly the values of dimensionless coefficients of empirical extended darcy s law exhibited high values for foam compared to other yield stress fluids and varied depending on foam quality considerable differences were observed in the experimental and numerical results of upscaling the global trend of the curves and the behavior in terms of fg followed the same tendency as those of the experimental results the experimental results for a very highly permeable porous medium where the compressibility effect is not significant fitted well to the experimental data in the absence of the foam trapping e g a high capillary number the difference between upscaling results and experimental data can be related to the foam compressibility therefore foam rheological behavior in porous media can be easily predicted from the bulk foam in the case where the foam compressibility is negligible the calculated compressibility coefficients should be increased with increasing pressure gradients upscaling can be an encouraging tool to predict foam flow behavior from its bulk behavior however further investigations are necessary to incorporate the complex nature of the foam flow in porous media into the upscaling model these insights are a promising point for studying foam flow in highly permeable porous media credit authorship contribution statement sagyn omirbekov conceptualization

by the région centre val de loire and the european regional development fund appendix a to study the variation of foam bubbles in bulk form fig 1a a and in 1 mm gb packing fig 1ab we used a dynamic foam analyzer dfa 100 kruss the foam analyzer consists of a glass column 250 mm long and 40 mm internal diameter a camera and a light source the experiments were conducted as in studies by omirbekov et al 2020 where n2 gas was injected into the surfactant solution aos 4 cmc using a porous glass disc the porous glass disc was chosen according to the foam generator where the pore size varied from 10 to 16 µm in the porous medium the used volumetric amount of the surfactant solution and the gas injection time were reduced by 60 since the porosity of the bead pack was about 40 in both cases the camera height was set to 100 mm to record the change in bubble size over time fig 2a shows the change of structures in bulk foam and foam in 1 mm gb packing where the mean bubble area mba was compared after 60 300 and 900 s we observed that the bulk foam is less stable than foam in porous media it is the consequence of the drainage process which is greater for the bulk foam for instance the mba of bulk foam doubled after 300 s while the mba of foam in 1 mm gb packing increased twice in 900 s which was three times lower than the bulk foam the bulk foam decays faster than the foam in porous media due to gravity drainage and gas diffusion which tends to coalescence and coarsen average bubble size while in porous media the effect of gravity is small due to the short length scales within the bead pack therefore the hydrostatic pressure differences are slight jones et al 2016 jones et al 2016 also found a correlation between apparent foam viscosity in porous media and the stability of foam in bulk form moreover from fig 2a we can see that the shape of the bulk foam bubbles was changed from spherical to polyhedral over time while the shape of the foam bubbles in porous media did not change and it took the shape of pores to a greater degree in fig 3a we plot the characteristic ratio of the bubble area bc as a function of time where bc is the ratio of mbapm to mbabulk at the same time in the beginning the ratio is close to one however the values of bc decrease with time showing that the variation of foam bubbles is much higher than for foam in the porous medium nevertheless it must be noted that these experiments were conducted at ambient pressure in the static case in addition the height of the system exceeds 200 mm which tends to increase bubble coalescence due to gravity drainage in the 1d column experiment we expected the bubble change to be less than that detected by the foam analyzer because the foam was examined horizontally therefore the effect of gravity drainage was assumed to be weaker moreover the foam in the 1d column flowed under a certain pressure and according to the study by holt et al 1996 the foam strength made of aos surfactant increases with increasing system pressure in our recent study omirbekov et al 2020 we compared the behavior of foams in 1 mm gb packing where the foams were pre generated in a 1 mm bead pack and in a sand pack used in this study from the plot of apparent viscosity versus total flow rate we noticed that the apparent foam viscosities vary greatly even at low flow rates despite the long residence time of the foam in the column thus it can be concluded that foam stability in confined environments is much longer than in bulk form nevertheless we confirm that there was a small change in the size of the bubbles in the main column outlet this should be studied with great care in future studies 
378,despite a longstanding interest in understanding the effects of rock fragments on soil hydraulic properties physically based models to describe the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils are still rare the conductivity of stony soils is mostly described by simple scaling approaches assuming impermeable rock fragments we present a model based on the general effective medium gem theory to calculate the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils the model accounts for the volumetric content shape and orientation of rock fragments in the main direction of water flow rock fragments can either be permeable or impermeable in the model which allows to calculate the effective unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curve of stony soils over the full range of soil matric potentials existing models assume rock fragments to be isolated and their application is therefore limited to low to moderately stony soils in gem model interaction between rock fragments is allowed which makes it applicable in stony soils with high contents of rock fragments the mathematical simplicity of the model makes it suitable for practical applications and provides a strong theoretical basis for improving predictions of flow and transport in hydrological models applied in forested and agricultural watersheds and mountainous areas keywords stony soils hydraulic conductivity soil hydraulic properties general effective medium theory 1 introduction in soil science rock fragments are defined as particles with an equivalent diameter greater than 2 mm novák and hlaváčiková 2019 the fragments with a diameter of 2 d 76 mm are gravel and larger rock fragments are known as cobbles 76 d 250 stones 250 d 600 and boulders d 600 stony soils are soils with a considerable amount of rock fragments and are common features of mountainous and forested watersheds nikiforoff 1948 hlaváčiková et al 2019 the presence of rock fragments has an impact on water flow processes and hydraulic behavior of the soil and as a consequence on the water budget of a watershed cousin et al 2003 coppola et al 2013 however at all scales the effects of rock fragments on water fluxes are commonly ignored which increases uncertainty in hydrological modeling in stony watersheds novák and hlaváčiková 2016 the reasons why the effect of rock fragments on soil water flow and the transport of dissolved substances is often neglected are measurement difficulties corwin and lesch 2005 ma et al 2010 verbist et al 2010 2012 coppola et al 2013 beckers et al 2016 ilek et al 2019 the relatively large size of the representative elementary volume buchter et al 1994 hlaváčiková et al 2016 and a lack of comprehensive models to adequately describe water flow in stony soils hlaváčiková et al 2016 beckers et al 2016 naseri et al 2019 up to present the vast majority of models for calculating effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils assume that hydraulic conductivity of rock fragments is zero therefore rock fragments are conceptualized as barriers to water flow and water flow is assumed to take place exclusively in the background soil in such relatively simple scaling models the effective conductivity depends merely on the volumetric or gravimetric content of rock fragments bouwer and rice 1984 brakensiek et al 1986 hlaváčiková et al 2016 and the effects of shape and orientation of the rocky inclusions have hardly been parametrized see zimmermann and bodvarsson 1995 for an exception another example of an approach which does not account for the shape and orientation of rock fragments is the kozeny carman equation which allows to calculate hydraulic conductivity from porosity and the average grain diameter of a porous medium kozeny 1927 carman 1937 carrier 2003 for example koltermann and gorelick 1995 and zhang et al 2011 applied it to calculate saturated hydraulic conductivity in a bimodal mixture table 1 briefly illustrates some of the scaling models to describe hydraulic conductivity of stony soils and their underlying assumptions and theoretical considerations although the reduction in flow predicted by these scaling models is consistent with measured hydraulic conductivity values for low contents of rock fragments and saturated flow conditions model results are still much less accurate for high contents of rock fragments and unsaturated flow conditions grath et al 2015 beckers et al 2016 naseri et al 2019 evaluated the output of different scaling models using measured hydraulic properties of soil stone mixtures in the laboratory they used sand and sandy loam as background soils and embedded varying contents from 0 to 40 l3 l3 of crushed basalt the evaporation method peters et al 2015 was used to simultaneously determine the effective water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves of stony soils during drying an inadequate predictive capability of the evaluated models was found in particular for high contents of rock fragments these results highlight the need for developing new models accounting for more detailed properties of embedded rock fragments to improve hydraulic conductivity prediction for stony soils in a numerical study hlaváčiková et al 2016 simulated the two dimensional water flow in water saturated stony soil with the richards equation using the hydrus 2d 3d code šimůnek et al 2008 they derived effective saturated hydraulic conductivities and incorporated the effects of shape and size of rock fragments in a linear reduction model using a resistance parameter a see table 1 the model of corring and churchill 1961 which accounts for the shape of rock fragments performed better than the model of ravina and magier 1984 a completely different approach than applying simple scaling laws is the application of the effective medium theory emt also called effective medium approximation emt provides the effective properties of a mixture using the constituents properties and volumetric fractions it was primarily developed by bruggeman 1935 1936 1937 and proposed to calculate effective electrical properties i e the dielectric permittivity of a macroscopically inhomogeneous medium landauer 1978 mclachlan 2000 mclachlan and sauti 2007 emt has been applied to model i solute transport in highly heterogeneous saturated porous media dagan et al 2003 janković et al 2003 and soils ghanbarian et al 2016 ii the electrical conductivity under unsaturated conditions ghanbarian and sahimi 2017 iii gas permeability in shales ghanbarian and javadpour 2017 and iv the permittivity in deformable porous media richesson and sahimi 2019 many attempts to apply emt for the effective hydraulic conductivity in soils were made by dagan dagan et al 2003 fiori et al 2003 and sahimi sahimi et al 1983 sahimi 2003 2011 ghanbarian et al 2016 who tried to improve the accuracy of emt a detailed discussion of the theory and applications of effective medium approaches in porous media was given by sahimi 2003 2011 and hunt and sahimi 2017 based on the similarities between electrical and hydraulic flow fields zimmermann and bodvarsson 1995 applied the maxwell fricke approach maxwell 1873 fricke 1924 to stony soils and considered the effect of shape and orientation of rock fragments in their model they tested the validity of their results for volumetric contents of rock fragments up to about 30 l3 l3 using data from the literature zimmermann 1996 evaluated the applicability of maxwell s equation and bruggeman s asymmetric theory bruggeman 1935 1936 1937 to describe the effective thermal conductivity of matrix inclusion mixtures the medium under consideration consisted of elliptical inclusions randomly distributed in a homogeneous matrix more recently lutz and zimmermann 2016 developed a model based on maxwell s equation for the conductivity of a mixture containing spherical inclusions surrounded by an interphase zone which reflects the local change in conductivity around the inclusions such local changes at the interface between background soil and rock fragments which occur due to the shrinkage of the background soil have been reported to be hydrologically relevant and are known as micro cracks or coarse lacunar pores fiès and bruand 1998 fiès et al 2002 the quantitative description of the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils may benefit from considering additional properties of rock fragments such as shape size surface roughness orientation arrangement and conductivity zimmerman 1996 novák et al 2011 hlaváčiková et al 2016 furthermore given the theoretical and practical limitations of existing models to calculate the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils new formulations are required to describe accurately the conductivity of stony soils containing moderately high i e 20 to 40 l3 l3 and very high i e 40 l3 l3 volumetric contents of rock fragments in such systems background soil and rock fragments are tightly packed and rock fragments may touch and affect the local flow field around other rock fragments in this paper we propose a general model for the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils within the framework of emt we apply the general effective medium gem theory developed primarily by mclachlan 1985 1986 a b 1987 to calculate the effective conductivity of mixtures gem allows to consider the shape and orientation of inclusions toward flow and arbitrary hydraulic conductivities of inclusions and background material since more than two conductivities can be integrated into the model it is also applicable if the mixture consists of different types of inclusions here the model is presented as a means to calculate the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils however it may also be applied to estimate other effective transport properties like thermal or electrical conductivity and gas diffusivity in mixtures consisting of different constituents mclachlan et al 1990 lutz and zimmermann 2016 the article is organized as follows we briefly review emt and introduce gem in section 2 application of gem to stony soils is treated in section 3 in which we distinguish the two cases of impermeable and permeable rock fragments and extend the concept to the full hydraulic conductivity curve of stony soils in the final section we conclude and discuss possible applications and extensions of the presented theory 2 effective medium theory in general terms emt allows to calculate effective properties of a mixture consisting of two or more constituents using the properties and relative fractions of the constituents landauer 1978 a common step wise emt approach for a two component binary mixture consists of three steps fig 1 i considering one of the constituents is randomly distributed in the other one the inclusion host medium ii approximating the shape of inclusions as ellipsoids and iii estimating the effective property of the equivalent homogeneous medium maxwell 1873 was to our knowledge the first who introduced an expression for the effective electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility of a mixture maxwell 1873 emt was developed further by bruggeman 1935 who established two emts known as symmetric and asymmetric emts bruggeman 1935 1936 1937 more recently the general effective medium theory gem was developed by mclachlan 1985 1986 a b 1987 to resolve the limitations of bruggeman s symmetric and asymmetric emts in the following we give a brief overview of the theories of maxwell and the two approaches of bruggeman before we introduce gem 2 1 maxwell s model a maxwell medium consists of a dilute distribution of spherical inclusions which are embedded in a background material inclusions must be isolated and interactions between them are ignored the maxwell model can be applied to stony soils in which spherically shaped stony inclusions with low conductivity k 1 l t and volume fraction f l3 l3 are embedded in a background soil with a higher conductivity k 2 l t in such a mixture with two constituents the effective conductivity of the mixture k m l t is calculated as pal 2015 1 f k 1 k 2 k 1 2 k 2 k 2 k m k m 2 k 2 0 eq 1 can be solved for the relative conductivity k r defined as the ratio of the conductivities of mixture k m and background soil k 2 2 k r k m k 2 2 f k 2 k 1 2 k 2 k 1 f k 1 k 2 2 k 2 k 1 details of derivation of the maxwell model are given by pal 2015 and haus 2016 as mentioned earlier the maxwell model is only valid for low volumetric inclusion contents f where inclusions are isolated landauer 1978 pietrak and wiśniewski 2014 isolation means that inclusions have to be so distant that the flow field around one inclusion is not affected by other inclusions zimmerman et al 1992 assuming spherical inclusions meredith and tobias 1962 estimated maxwell model to be valid up to a maximum volume fraction of f 10 l3 l3 however it has been argued that this value might not be low enough to fulfill maxwell medium s condition for randomly oriented non spherical inclusions stubbe and gimsa 2015 pietrak and wiśniewski 2014 reported this limit to be lower than 25 l3 l3 a schematic view of the maxwell medium is illustrated in fig 2 left 2 2 bruggeman s symmetric model the bruggeman s symmetric medium is a mixture of two or more constituents with spherical grains that fill the medium completely in a symmetrical way complete filling means that the grains must have an infinite size range and symmetrical filling means that no assumption is made regarding which of the constituents is treated as inclusion or host both of the constituents are randomly distributed and each particle in the mixture may have contact with other particles of any of the constituents mclachlan 1985 the bruggeman s symmetric bs model for calculating the effective conductivity k m l t is landauer 1978 mclachlan 1985 3 f k 1 k m k 1 d 1 k m 1 f k 2 k m k 2 d 1 k m 0 in which d is the number of dimensions of the system eq 3 is a quadratic equation in k m and has two solutions if d 3 the negative solution is physically meaningless and the positive solution is landauer 1978 4 k m 1 4 γ γ 2 8 k 1 k 2 where 5 γ 3 f 1 k 1 2 3 f k 2 if the mixture is composed of more than two constituents n 2 with conductivities ki l t the respective volume fractions fi l3 l3 will add to unity i 1 n f i 1 and the equation for calculating the effective conductivity becomes 6 i n f i k i k m k i d 1 k m 0 2 3 bruggeman s asymmetric model the bruggeman s asymmetric ba theory is based on the assumption that one constituent inclusions rock fragments with the conductivity of k 1 is dispersed in the other material background soil having conductivity k 2 landauer 1978 the spherical in 3d circular in 2d inclusions must be uniformly coated by the background soil regardless of the volumetric content of inclusions mclachlan 1986a 1987 and the volume ratio of inclusion to the coating background material is identical for all the spherical inclusions regardless of their size mclachlan et al 1990 as a result the spherical inclusions have no contact to each other and the background material fills the whole space between them assume that spherical inclusions have a conductivity of k 1 the conductivity of the background material is k 2 and the volume fraction of the inclusions is again denoted by f if spheres have an infinite size range then they could be coated with the background material in all the volume fractions of inclusions 0 f 1 and even if the inclusions have zero conductivity the medium conducts for all inclusion contents because f cannot reach unity under the assumptions stated above the ba formula for calculating the effective conductivity k m is landauer 1978 mclachlan 1986b 7 k 1 k m k 1 k 2 1 f k m k 2 1 d eq 7 is a third order equation for d 3 the solution is estimated by taylor series expansion and can be found in sihvola 1999 the ba model shows reliable estimates for the effective conductivity of mixtures for low volume fractions of spherical inclusions its results improve when the sizes of the spherical particles vary over a wide range meredith and tobias 1962 mclachlan 1985 zimmermann 1996 however ba fails to predict the behavior of the percolating system when f reaches the highest possible packing fraction of the inclusions 2 4 general effective medium concept 2 4 1 basic model description according to the underlying assumptions of the bs and ba theories there should be an intermediate condition in which neither both constituents should fill the medium in a completely symmetrical way nor should spherical inclusions be fully coated by the background material mclachlan 1986a b 1987 1988 and 1990 developed the gem theory to also calculate the effective property for a case where inclusions have a high volumetric content are not isolated and can be in contact with each other mclachlan showed that gem is a general form of the bs and ba theories which interpolates between these two extreme cases regarding the distribution of constituents there is no inclusion host concept assumed in gem both constituents can touch each other and are not necessarily coated by the other constituent a schematic comparison of gem and maxwell media is given by fig 2 which emphasizes that in a gem media inclusions can even form clusters should not necessarily be isolated and interaction among them is allowed for a mixture with conductivities k 1 and k 2 and the volume fraction f corresponding to the component with k 1 the gem equation becomes mclachlan 1986a b 1987 1990 8 f k 1 k m k 1 f c 1 f c k m 1 f k 2 k m k 2 f c 1 f c k m 0 in which the uppercase k are defined as k 1 k 1 1 t k 2 k 2 1 t and k m k m 1 t the parameter t is an adjustable exponent related to the critical volume fraction fc and the shape and orientation of the inclusions as a result the effective conductivity of the mixture predicted by eq 8 depends on the volume fraction f the critical fraction fc and the shape and orientation of the inclusions eq 8 is quadratic in km and easily solved considering the conductivity ratios β k 1 k 2 and k r k m k 2 and the dimensionless parameter a f c 1 f c inserting these definitions into eq 8 and solving the equation results in two solutions where only the positive solution k r 0 is relevant 9 k r γ γ 2 4 a β 1 t 2 a t in which 10 γ f a β 1 t 1 a 1 a β 1 t eq 9 can be used to calculate the influence of volumetric inclusion content and shape on the effective conductivity note that k r in eq 9 becomes one if β is one i e if k 1 and k 2 are the same furthermore for f f c and k 1 0 k m becomes zero i e the effective conductivity becomes zero at and beyond the critical content for impermeable inclusions 2 4 2 critical volume fraction of the inclusions f c a critical volume fraction of the inclusions f c l3 l3 must be considered in a mixture such that for f f c and k 1 0 the effective conductivity k m becomes zero or if k 1 0 then km becomes inclusion dominated the reason for this is that the continuous percolation path within the permeable component is interrupted at f f c when inclusions are non conductive mclachlan 1986b celzard et al 2002 there are some methods to estimate values of f c zallen 1983 2002 proposed a value f c 0 55 0 03 in 2d and f c 0 84 0 02 in 3d the recommended value of f c 0 84 that is normally used in 3d porous media corresponds to a site percolation threshold in percolation theory for solid conducting spheres that touch their surrounding neighbors and are randomly packed with almost similar non conductive spheres mclachlan et al 1990 zallen 2002 mclachlan and sauti 2007 it must be considered that f c which is similar to the percolation threshold in percolation theory has no universal value and differs according to the geometrical physical and hydraulic aspects of the mixture the shape orientation size distribution of the constituents particles and the characteristics of the flow field affect the value of f c ruschau and newnham 1992 ghanbarian and daigle 2016 and studying the effects of these factors on critical volume fraction of inclusions in the composites is an ongoing research e g qu et al 2018 following zallen 1983 2002 we propose a value of f c 0 84 which is used in the computations presented below in a non consolidating mixture like stony soils higher values of f c can occur mclachlan and sauti 2007 the model of kusy 1977 can be applied to estimate the values of f c based on the properties of the constituents a sensitivity analysis using a plausible range of the input parameters in this model results in values of f c ranging from 0 847 to 0 982 more details of this model and its input parameters for stony soil are presented in appendix a 2 4 3 effects of shape and orientation of inclusions one fundamental advantage of gem is that effects of shape and orientation of the inclusions can be incorporated into the model using the parameter t whereas the inclusions are always assumed spherical in the maxwell and bruggeman media mclachlan 1987 in the next section we assess the influence of shape and orientation on k r for binary mixtures inclusions as oriented spheroids if one approximates the inclusions to be oriented spheroids the inclusion parameter t becomes mclachlan et al 1990 11 t f c 1 l where l 0 l 1 is the effective depolarization factor which is a function of shape and orientation of spheroidal inclusions towards flow jones and friedman 2000 the value of l represents the deviation of the shape of a spheroid from that of a sphere i e the extent of elongation of a prolate spheroid or the flattening of an oblate spheroid a spheroid is an ellipsoid in which two of the three main axes have an equal length if the third axis is longer than the other two the spheroid is prolate shaped like a rugby ball otherwise it is oblate shaped like a lentil obviously a sphere is an ellipsoid with three axes of equal length in fig 3 these three basic shapes have been visualized with the software hydrus 2d 3d šimůnek et al 2008 the depolarization factor l is calculated from the eccentricity e of the spheroids for the objects shown in fig 3 with the axes lengths a l and c l the equations for calculating e and l for prolate spheroids a c are sihvola 1999 12 e 1 a c 2 l x 1 e 2 2 e 3 ln 1 e 1 e 2 e l y l z 1 2 1 l x and for oblate spheroids a c one obtains 13 e a c 2 1 l z 1 e 2 e 3 e arctan e l x l y 1 2 1 l z lx ly and lz are the depolarization factors toward the three orthogonal directions x y and z and a c is the aspect ratio of the spheroid note that the three depolarization factors always sum to unity since a spheroid has two equal axes values of l for two of the three main directions are the same the case e 1 spherical inclusions a c cannot be handled by eq 12 and 13 in this case l 1 3 in all three directions in the general case of ellipsoidal inclusions with three different axes values of l can be calculated as shown in sihvola 1999 if inclusions have a dominant orientation towards the main flow direction the respective l must be chosen the spheroids shown in fig 3 can be rotated by 90 to adjust the depolarization factors accordingly the dependence of l on aspect ratio for prolate and oblate spheroids is illustrated in fig 4 a note that the dependence of the shape parameter t on the depolarization factor by eq 11 introduces anisotropy in the effective conductivity k m for all spheroids except spheres in the calculations the upper limit of the aspect ratio was selected to be 10 because in soil systems aspect ratios lower than 0 2 or higher than 5 are rarely found the reason for this is that rock fragments with such extreme aspect ratios tend to break fragment very easily mendelson and cohen 1982 aspect ratios of prolate spheroids are limited to a narrow range 0 a c 1 and correspond to spheroidal inclusions with depolarization factors 0 lx 0 33 and 0 33 ly lz 0 5 for oblate spheroids values of l are 0 07 lx ly 0 33 and 0 33 lz 0 86 the crossing point of all the curves at a c 1 corresponds to a sphere for which all three depolarization factors are 1 3 the values of l are used to calculate the parameter t in eq 11 which exerts a strong influence on k r calculated by eq 9 the dependence of kr on inclusion shape prolate or oblate aspect ratio and orientation for different volumetric contents of inclusions is shown in fig 4b and 4c the aspect ratios 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 2 5 10 were considered for prolate and oblate spheroids respectively and a critical inclusion fraction fc 0 84 and conductivity ratio β 0 001 were assumed in the calculations the value of β reflects a setup in which the inclusions have a negligible but nonzero conductivity the anisotropy of the relative effective conductivity k r becomes evident in fig 4 in the following we assume that the inclusions are oriented exactly as shown in fig 3 and discuss the reduction in conductivity for vertical flow as it is the dominant flow direction in soils however in groundwater systems with a dominant lateral flow occurs more one could focus on the horizontal directions instead in fig 4 the reduction in k r for more lentil shaped oblate inclusions is stronger than for rugby ball shaped prolates this can be explained by the fact that oblate inclusions with small conductivity restrict the cross section of the flow more effectively moreover the solid curves show a more significant variation for prolate compared to oblate inclusions this illustrates that the reduction in conductivity for oblate inclusions depends more strongly on the aspect ratio than for the prolate ones these results match those of the numerical study by hlaváčiková et al 2016 very well which showed a large difference in the reduction of effective hydraulic conductivity by horizontally and vertically oriented impermeable ellipses in two spatial dimensions inclusions as randomly oriented spheroids if inclusions in the mixture are randomly oriented spheroids the parameter t is obtained by mclachlan et al 1990 14 t m f c in which m includes the effect of orientation and shape of inclusions the value of m is 1 5 for spheres sen et al 1981 and increases depending on how aspherical the inclusions are mendelson and cohen 1982 obtained the values of m for randomly oriented spheroidal inclusions by 15 m 5 3 l 3 1 l 2 where l is the depolarization factor from eq 12 13 although the value of m can increase to 4 0 in cases of extreme aspect ratios mclachlan 1987 values in natural systems with aspect ratios ranging from 0 2 to 5 will be limited to values between 1 5 sphere and 2 1 oblate with an aspect ratio of 5 for prolate spheroids values of m lie in the narrow interval 1 5 1 67 as noted by mendelson and cohen 1982 the influence of m on the relative effective conductivity k r can be seen in fig 5 for spheres m 1 5 prolate spheroids with an aspect ratio of 0 1 extreme case m 1 67 and oblate spheroids with aspect ratios of 2 5 and 10 with corresponding m values of 1 6 2 1 and 3 1 respectively the values of f c and β were 0 84 and 0 001 respectively in all calculations similar to the case of oriented spheroids the substantial difference between m values for oblate and prolate inclusions is due to their different impacts on blocking the flow randomly oriented prolates have a smaller effect on reducing the flow compared to randomly oriented oblates mendelson and cohen 1982 furthermore when the inclusions are randomly oriented prolates their aspect ratio does not have a considerable impact on the reduction rate of k r however when inclusions are randomly oriented oblates the reduction of k r is substantially dependent on the aspect ratio of the inclusions the higher the aspect ratio the more noticeable is the impact on the reduction of k r spherical inclusions have the lowest impact because they cause the smallest resistance to flow therefore k r will be overestimated if inclusions are assumed to be spherical 3 application to stony soils 3 1 soils containing impermeable rock fragments a typical assumption in soil hydrological modeling is that rock fragments are impermeable i e that their hydraulic conductivity is zero k 1 0 in this case maxwell s model given by eq 2 reduces to 16 k r 2 1 f 2 f this is the model proposed by peck and watson 1979 for k l 0 the bs model expressed by eq 3 simplifies to 17 k r 1 d d 1 f which in three spatial dimensions d 3 becomes 18 k r 1 3 2 f in this case the critical volumetric fraction of rock fragments where k r becomes zero is f c 2 3 and eq 18 can only be applied if f 2 3 correspondingly the ba model given by eq 7 reduces to 19 k r 1 f d d 1 which in 3d is transformed into 20 k r 1 f 3 2 k r in eq 20 becomes zero at f 1 i e no critical volumetric content of rock fragments is considered in the ba model for the gem model the assumption k 1 0 in eq 8 leads to 21 k r 1 f f c t for f f c otherwise k r 0 the bs model with k 1 0 is a specific case of the gem model if t 1 and f c 2 3 according to eq 14 this implies that m 1 5 the value for spheres fig 6 shows a model comparison covering the models in table 1 the two bruggeman models bs and ba and the gem model because the latter allows incorporating the effects of shape and orientation by the parameter t a range of possible reduction functions is indicated by a gray shaded area bounded by the lowest possible reduction i e prolate spheroids aspect ratio of 0 2 oriented along the main flow direction t 0 89 and the most pronounced reduction that may occur in a natural system i e oblate spheroids aspect ratio of 5 oriented orthogonally to the main flow direction t 3 37 the gem curve for spheres t 1 26 for fc 0 84 is also included for the model of novák et al 2011 we assumed a 1 2 the value for a loamy sand background soil the fundamental assumptions and limitations of the models are presented in table 1 and the preceding sections the validity of all models except gem is restricted to low to medium volumetric contents of rock fragments i e up to 40 for novák and less for other models in fig 6 only the gem model is theoretically valid for soils with high volumetric rock fragments contents however the result of the bs ba peck and watson 1979 and gem for spherical inclusions are more similar at lower volumetric contents of rock fragments f 10 these models all assume a spherical shape for rock fragments in addition to this theoretical advantage gem is the most flexible of all models because it includes an additional parameter t basically all other models except the ravina and magier model lie within the gray shaded area for rock fragment contents up to almost 70 finally the model based on gem is able to predict a markedly higher decrease in effective conductivity for oblate shaped rock fragments which are oriented orthogonally to the main direction of water flow conversely for oriented prolate rock fragments the reduction predicted by gem is smaller than that of all other models except the ravina and magier 1984 model which predicts a linear reduction of conductivity with f and does not consider the additional reduction in hydraulic conductivity due to the shape and orientation of rock fragments and the resulting alteration of the flow field novák et al 2011 hlaváčiková et al 2016 3 2 saturated soils containing permeable rock fragments a significant feature of the gem model is that it allows rock fragments to conduct water k 1 0 fig 7 shows the effects of rock fragments content and their conductivity expressed by the conductivity ratio β k 1 k 2 on the effective conductivity of stony soils the sensitivity analysis was conducted using eqs 9 and 10 rock fragments were assumed to be spheres the critical fraction of rock fragments was set to f c 0 84 and as a result t was 1 26 a wide range of the hydraulic conductivity ratio β was considered to represent different hydraulic conductivity contrasts of rock fragments and background soil fig 7a illustrates the change in k r for various volumetric contents of rock fragments f ranging from 0 to 1 and five different values of β it becomes evident that the conductivity of the mixture decreases non linearly with f and the rate of decrease depends on β the decrease in k r is smaller for higher values of β i e the conductivities of rock fragments and background soil become more similar the curves for β 0 01 and β 0 001 are already quite similar indicating a convergence of the saturated effective conductivity for small values of k 1 for small values of β indicating inclusions with a negligible conductivity the effective conductivity k m approaches zero when f reaches its critical content f c note that k r is unity for all the rock fragment contents if β 1 curve not shown in fig 7a the relative hydraulic conductivity as a function of the hydraulic conductivity ratio β for different contents of rock fragments is shown in fig 7b all of the curves start in the top right corner with k r 1 where the conductivities of background soil and rock fragments are identical β 1 the value of k r decreases with decreasing β until the curves become horizontal around β 0 001 in agreement with fig 7a the content of rock fragments determines the asymptotic value of k r although higher amounts of rock fragments lead to lower hydraulic conductivities of the stony soil deviations become smaller when rock fragments have higher conductivities 3 3 variably saturated soils containing permeable rock fragments the scaling models used to describe the effective conductivity of stony soils table 1 are only valid if rock fragments are assumed to be impermeable k 1 0 these models can be applied to predict the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function of stony soils k m h l t where h l is the tension or absolute value of soil matric potential in most applications the models of describing the reduction in effective hydraulic conductivity affected by the presence of rock fragments are used to scale the entire function k m h hlaváčiková and novák 2014 this can easily be achieved by the conductivity functions which are based on the capillary bundle models in which the entire conductivity function is scaled by the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s technically one simply scales k s of the background soil by one of the models shown in fig 6 for more complex models of hydraulic conductivity which include a non capillary component e g caused by film and corner flow naseri et al 2019 provided a more specific scaling approach based on the same reasoning however cases in which rock fragments have nonzero conductivity cannot be treated with these approaches one of the advantages of gem is that the effective hydraulic conductivity curve k m h of a stony soil can be calculated in the case where the rock fragments conduct water k l 0 this characteristic makes gem a capable model to describe the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of stony soils where rock fragments might be either impermeable or permeable the results of a case study are illustrated in fig 8 to highlight the potential of the gem model assuming that rock fragments are porous with an effective water holding capacity θs1 the water retention curves wrc of background soil and rock fragments θ i h are calculated with the van genuchten 1980 model 22 s i h θ i h θ r i θ s i θ r i 1 1 α i h n i m i where θ si l3 l3 and θ ri l3 l3 are saturated and residual water contents si is the relative saturation function and α i 1 l ni and mi 1 1 n n 1 are shape parameters noting that rock fragments and background soil are denoted by i 1 and 2 respectively we applied the van genuchten model of wrc due to its popularity of course alternative parametrizations of shp can be used in the presented framework examples can be found in the review article of assouline and or 2013 naseri et al 2019 applied a parametrization over the full moisture range to stony soils the wrc of the stony soil θm h l3 l3 is then calculated as the volume averaging of the two curves peters and klavetter 1988 23 θ m h f θ 1 h 1 f θ 2 h the hydraulic conductivity curves of both components ki h l t are computed by 24 k i h k s i s i τ i 1 1 s i 1 m i m i 2 in which ksi l t is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and τ i is the pore connectivity parameter the model parameters are summarized in table 2 the parameters of the rock fragments in table 2 reflect a porosity of 10 a relatively large air entry tension corresponding to a small average pore size and a wide pore size distribution the parameters are expert guesses which serve to illustrate the behavior of the model it should be noted that the scaling of the entire hydraulic conductivity curve hinges on simplifying assumptions most importantly it is assumed that the presence of rock fragments does not alter the spatial distribution of matric potential and thus hydraulic conductivity in the vicinity of the rock fragments it is plausible to assume a downstream reduction in matric potential behind the inclusions which leads to a decrease in water content and hydraulic conductivity it is important to consider that the resulting spatial variability in hydraulic conductivity and the flow field are not accounted for in the scaling models applied in this section and in other studies like hlaváčiková and novák 2014 for estimating the hydraulic conductivity curve of stony soils in fact application of eq 24 rests on the assumption that local perturbations of matric potential and water flux are negligible and that the hydraulic conductivity derived from the average matric potential can serve as the effective hydraulic conductivity of the host material and the permeable inclusion given the hydraulic conductivity curves of rock fragments and background soil the effective hydraulic conductivity curve of the stony soil k m h was calculated by a pointwise calculation using eq 9 note that the conductivity ratio β k 1 k 2 is a function of the tension the effective wrc of stony soils for different rock fragment contents are shown in fig 8a the hydraulic conductivity curves of background soil dashed black line and embedded rock fragments dashed gray line are presented in fig 8b and 8c values of β range from 0 001 at water saturation to 1010 at air dryness the effective hydraulic conductivity curves were calculated for two shapes of rock fragments spheres fig 8b and oblate spheroids fig 8c as the hydraulic conductivity curves of rock fragments and background soil cross at about h 70 cm the discussion is divided into two parts to the left of the crossing point conductivity of the background soil dominates and the effective conductivity of the stony soil is decreased by the presence of rock fragments at the crossing point the hydraulic conductivities of rock fragments and background soil are identical β 1 and km k 1 k 2 to the right of the crossing point where the tension is high conductivity of rock fragments becomes increasingly influential for effective hydraulic conductivity with increasing amounts of rock fragments the effective conductivity of the stony soil becomes more similar to the conductivity curve of the rock fragments the shape of the effective conductivity functions is similar to those of the bimodal soil hydraulic property model presented by durner 1994 and priesack and durner 2006 however because the conductivity ratio β is a function of tension the effective curve can generally not be parametrized with this model more importantly the effective conductivity curves cannot be calculated by capillary bundle models applied to the effective retention curves shown in fig 8a the calculation of an effective hydraulic conductivity of soils containing permeable rock fragments is not restricted to the model of van genuchten 1980 and arbitrary parametrizations of the soil hydraulic properties can be selected and even combined 4 conclusions there is a lack of physically based models to describe hydraulic conductivity of stony soils in this article we suggest using the general effective medium theory gem as an improved flexible alternative to overcome most of the limitations of currently applied models the proposed model for calculating the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils considers hydraulic conductivities of rock fragments and background soil the volumetric content of rock fragments and a parameter t to characterize the shape and orientation of rock fragments towards flow the distinctive advantages of the gem model are i the applicability for soils with high contents of rock fragments where rock fragments do not need to be isolated and even can be in contact with each other ii the possibility to include the effects of shape and orientation of spheroidal rock fragments by a simple parametrization iii the ability to calculate the effective hydraulic conductivity of soils containing permeable rock fragments or any inclusions over the full range of soil matric potentials iv consideration of a critical fraction of rock fragments for which the effective conductivity becomes zero in case of impermeable rock fragments and v including the anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity caused by non spherical inclusions these characteristics make gem a more comprehensive model than the currently applied ones and an efficient alternative to calculate the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils in saturated and variably saturated conditions where limited hydraulic conductivity data is a major challenge finally we recommend the following to validate or falsify the presented model firstly experimental studies under various boundary conditions for different rock fragments contents types characteristics and different background soils secondly the theory can be tested using numerical simulations with the richards equation in three spatial dimensions for stony soils such efforts have been undertaken by novák et al 2011 and hlaváčiková et al 2016 but these were mainly limited to simulations in two spatial dimensions although the theory reviewed in this article clearly shows that effective flow properties depend on the dimensionality of the system since a homogeneous background soil was assumed in this study any elaborations accounting for the effects of rock fragments on the pore size distribution of the background soil or its heterogeneity would be an improvement of particular relevance

properties of the constituents in a mixture in this model if non conductive coarse inclusions with an effective diameter d 1 are embedded in the conducting fine constituent with an effective diameter

378,despite a longstanding interest in understanding the effects of rock fragments on soil hydraulic properties physically based models to describe the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils are still rare the conductivity of stony soils is mostly described by simple scaling approaches assuming impermeable rock fragments we present a model based on the general effective medium gem theory to calculate the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils the model accounts for the volumetric content shape and orientation of rock fragments in the main direction of water flow rock fragments can either be permeable or impermeable in the model which allows to calculate the effective unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curve of stony soils over the full range of soil matric potentials existing models assume rock fragments to be isolated and their application is therefore limited to low to moderately stony soils in gem model interaction between rock fragments is allowed which makes it applicable in stony soils with high contents of rock fragments the mathematical simplicity of the model makes it suitable for practical applications and provides a strong theoretical basis for improving predictions of flow and transport in hydrological models applied in forested and agricultural watersheds and mountainous areas keywords stony soils hydraulic conductivity soil hydraulic properties general effective medium theory 1 introduction in soil science rock fragments are defined as particles with an equivalent diameter greater than 2 mm novák and hlaváčiková 2019 the fragments with a diameter of 2 d 76 mm are gravel and larger rock fragments are known as cobbles 76 d 250 stones 250 d 600 and boulders d 600 stony soils are soils with a considerable amount of rock fragments and are common features of mountainous and forested watersheds nikiforoff 1948 hlaváčiková et al 2019 the presence of rock fragments has an impact on water flow processes and hydraulic behavior of the soil and as a consequence on the water budget of a watershed cousin et al 2003 coppola et al 2013 however at all scales the effects of rock fragments on water fluxes are commonly ignored which increases uncertainty in hydrological modeling in stony watersheds novák and hlaváčiková 2016 the reasons why the effect of rock fragments on soil water flow and the transport of dissolved substances is often neglected are measurement difficulties corwin and lesch 2005 ma et al 2010 verbist et al 2010 2012 coppola et al 2013 beckers et al 2016 ilek et al 2019 the relatively large size of the representative elementary volume buchter et al 1994 hlaváčiková et al 2016 and a lack of comprehensive models to adequately describe water flow in stony soils hlaváčiková et al 2016 beckers et al 2016 naseri et al 2019 up to present the vast majority of models for calculating effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils assume that hydraulic conductivity of rock fragments is zero therefore rock fragments are conceptualized as barriers to water flow and water flow is assumed to take place exclusively in the background soil in such relatively simple scaling models the effective conductivity depends merely on the volumetric or gravimetric content of rock fragments bouwer and rice 1984 brakensiek et al 1986 hlaváčiková et al 2016 and the effects of shape and orientation of the rocky inclusions have hardly been parametrized see zimmermann and bodvarsson 1995 for an exception another example of an approach which does not account for the shape and orientation of rock fragments is the kozeny carman equation which allows to calculate hydraulic conductivity from porosity and the average grain diameter of a porous medium kozeny 1927 carman 1937 carrier 2003 for example koltermann and gorelick 1995 and zhang et al 2011 applied it to calculate saturated hydraulic conductivity in a bimodal mixture table 1 briefly illustrates some of the scaling models to describe hydraulic conductivity of stony soils and their underlying assumptions and theoretical considerations although the reduction in flow predicted by these scaling models is consistent with measured hydraulic conductivity values for low contents of rock fragments and saturated flow conditions model results are still much less accurate for high contents of rock fragments and unsaturated flow conditions grath et al 2015 beckers et al 2016 naseri et al 2019 evaluated the output of different scaling models using measured hydraulic properties of soil stone mixtures in the laboratory they used sand and sandy loam as background soils and embedded varying contents from 0 to 40 l3 l3 of crushed basalt the evaporation method peters et al 2015 was used to simultaneously determine the effective water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves of stony soils during drying an inadequate predictive capability of the evaluated models was found in particular for high contents of rock fragments these results highlight the need for developing new models accounting for more detailed properties of embedded rock fragments to improve hydraulic conductivity prediction for stony soils in a numerical study hlaváčiková et al 2016 simulated the two dimensional water flow in water saturated stony soil with the richards equation using the hydrus 2d 3d code šimůnek et al 2008 they derived effective saturated hydraulic conductivities and incorporated the effects of shape and size of rock fragments in a linear reduction model using a resistance parameter a see table 1 the model of corring and churchill 1961 which accounts for the shape of rock fragments performed better than the model of ravina and magier 1984 a completely different approach than applying simple scaling laws is the application of the effective medium theory emt also called effective medium approximation emt provides the effective properties of a mixture using the constituents properties and volumetric fractions it was primarily developed by bruggeman 1935 1936 1937 and proposed to calculate effective electrical properties i e the dielectric permittivity of a macroscopically inhomogeneous medium landauer 1978 mclachlan 2000 mclachlan and sauti 2007 emt has been applied to model i solute transport in highly heterogeneous saturated porous media dagan et al 2003 janković et al 2003 and soils ghanbarian et al 2016 ii the electrical conductivity under unsaturated conditions ghanbarian and sahimi 2017 iii gas permeability in shales ghanbarian and javadpour 2017 and iv the permittivity in deformable porous media richesson and sahimi 2019 many attempts to apply emt for the effective hydraulic conductivity in soils were made by dagan dagan et al 2003 fiori et al 2003 and sahimi sahimi et al 1983 sahimi 2003 2011 ghanbarian et al 2016 who tried to improve the accuracy of emt a detailed discussion of the theory and applications of effective medium approaches in porous media was given by sahimi 2003 2011 and hunt and sahimi 2017 based on the similarities between electrical and hydraulic flow fields zimmermann and bodvarsson 1995 applied the maxwell fricke approach maxwell 1873 fricke 1924 to stony soils and considered the effect of shape and orientation of rock fragments in their model they tested the validity of their results for volumetric contents of rock fragments up to about 30 l3 l3 using data from the literature zimmermann 1996 evaluated the applicability of maxwell s equation and bruggeman s asymmetric theory bruggeman 1935 1936 1937 to describe the effective thermal conductivity of matrix inclusion mixtures the medium under consideration consisted of elliptical inclusions randomly distributed in a homogeneous matrix more recently lutz and zimmermann 2016 developed a model based on maxwell s equation for the conductivity of a mixture containing spherical inclusions surrounded by an interphase zone which reflects the local change in conductivity around the inclusions such local changes at the interface between background soil and rock fragments which occur due to the shrinkage of the background soil have been reported to be hydrologically relevant and are known as micro cracks or coarse lacunar pores fiès and bruand 1998 fiès et al 2002 the quantitative description of the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils may benefit from considering additional properties of rock fragments such as shape size surface roughness orientation arrangement and conductivity zimmerman 1996 novák et al 2011 hlaváčiková et al 2016 furthermore given the theoretical and practical limitations of existing models to calculate the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils new formulations are required to describe accurately the conductivity of stony soils containing moderately high i e 20 to 40 l3 l3 and very high i e 40 l3 l3 volumetric contents of rock fragments in such systems background soil and rock fragments are tightly packed and rock fragments may touch and affect the local flow field around other rock fragments in this paper we propose a general model for the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils within the framework of emt we apply the general effective medium gem theory developed primarily by mclachlan 1985 1986 a b 1987 to calculate the effective conductivity of mixtures gem allows to consider the shape and orientation of inclusions toward flow and arbitrary hydraulic conductivities of inclusions and background material since more than two conductivities can be integrated into the model it is also applicable if the mixture consists of different types of inclusions here the model is presented as a means to calculate the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils however it may also be applied to estimate other effective transport properties like thermal or electrical conductivity and gas diffusivity in mixtures consisting of different constituents mclachlan et al 1990 lutz and zimmermann 2016 the article is organized as follows we briefly review emt and introduce gem in section 2 application of gem to stony soils is treated in section 3 in which we distinguish the two cases of impermeable and permeable rock fragments and extend the concept to the full hydraulic conductivity curve of stony soils in the final section we conclude and discuss possible applications and extensions of the presented theory 2 effective medium theory in general terms emt allows to calculate effective properties of a mixture consisting of two or more constituents using the properties and relative fractions of the constituents landauer 1978 a common step wise emt approach for a two component binary mixture consists of three steps fig 1 i considering one of the constituents is randomly distributed in the other one the inclusion host medium ii approximating the shape of inclusions as ellipsoids and iii estimating the effective property of the equivalent homogeneous medium maxwell 1873 was to our knowledge the first who introduced an expression for the effective electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility of a mixture maxwell 1873 emt was developed further by bruggeman 1935 who established two emts known as symmetric and asymmetric emts bruggeman 1935 1936 1937 more recently the general effective medium theory gem was developed by mclachlan 1985 1986 a b 1987 to resolve the limitations of bruggeman s symmetric and asymmetric emts in the following we give a brief overview of the theories of maxwell and the two approaches of bruggeman before we introduce gem 2 1 maxwell s model a maxwell medium consists of a dilute distribution of spherical inclusions which are embedded in a background material inclusions must be isolated and interactions between them are ignored the maxwell model can be applied to stony soils in which spherically shaped stony inclusions with low conductivity k 1 l t and volume fraction f l3 l3 are embedded in a background soil with a higher conductivity k 2 l t in such a mixture with two constituents the effective conductivity of the mixture k m l t is calculated as pal 2015 1 f k 1 k 2 k 1 2 k 2 k 2 k m k m 2 k 2 0 eq 1 can be solved for the relative conductivity k r defined as the ratio of the conductivities of mixture k m and background soil k 2 2 k r k m k 2 2 f k 2 k 1 2 k 2 k 1 f k 1 k 2 2 k 2 k 1 details of derivation of the maxwell model are given by pal 2015 and haus 2016 as mentioned earlier the maxwell model is only valid for low volumetric inclusion contents f where inclusions are isolated landauer 1978 pietrak and wiśniewski 2014 isolation means that inclusions have to be so distant that the flow field around one inclusion is not affected by other inclusions zimmerman et al 1992 assuming spherical inclusions meredith and tobias 1962 estimated maxwell model to be valid up to a maximum volume fraction of f 10 l3 l3 however it has been argued that this value might not be low enough to fulfill maxwell medium s condition for randomly oriented non spherical inclusions stubbe and gimsa 2015 pietrak and wiśniewski 2014 reported this limit to be lower than 25 l3 l3 a schematic view of the maxwell medium is illustrated in fig 2 left 2 2 bruggeman s symmetric model the bruggeman s symmetric medium is a mixture of two or more constituents with spherical grains that fill the medium completely in a symmetrical way complete filling means that the grains must have an infinite size range and symmetrical filling means that no assumption is made regarding which of the constituents is treated as inclusion or host both of the constituents are randomly distributed and each particle in the mixture may have contact with other particles of any of the constituents mclachlan 1985 the bruggeman s symmetric bs model for calculating the effective conductivity k m l t is landauer 1978 mclachlan 1985 3 f k 1 k m k 1 d 1 k m 1 f k 2 k m k 2 d 1 k m 0 in which d is the number of dimensions of the system eq 3 is a quadratic equation in k m and has two solutions if d 3 the negative solution is physically meaningless and the positive solution is landauer 1978 4 k m 1 4 γ γ 2 8 k 1 k 2 where 5 γ 3 f 1 k 1 2 3 f k 2 if the mixture is composed of more than two constituents n 2 with conductivities ki l t the respective volume fractions fi l3 l3 will add to unity i 1 n f i 1 and the equation for calculating the effective conductivity becomes 6 i n f i k i k m k i d 1 k m 0 2 3 bruggeman s asymmetric model the bruggeman s asymmetric ba theory is based on the assumption that one constituent inclusions rock fragments with the conductivity of k 1 is dispersed in the other material background soil having conductivity k 2 landauer 1978 the spherical in 3d circular in 2d inclusions must be uniformly coated by the background soil regardless of the volumetric content of inclusions mclachlan 1986a 1987 and the volume ratio of inclusion to the coating background material is identical for all the spherical inclusions regardless of their size mclachlan et al 1990 as a result the spherical inclusions have no contact to each other and the background material fills the whole space between them assume that spherical inclusions have a conductivity of k 1 the conductivity of the background material is k 2 and the volume fraction of the inclusions is again denoted by f if spheres have an infinite size range then they could be coated with the background material in all the volume fractions of inclusions 0 f 1 and even if the inclusions have zero conductivity the medium conducts for all inclusion contents because f cannot reach unity under the assumptions stated above the ba formula for calculating the effective conductivity k m is landauer 1978 mclachlan 1986b 7 k 1 k m k 1 k 2 1 f k m k 2 1 d eq 7 is a third order equation for d 3 the solution is estimated by taylor series expansion and can be found in sihvola 1999 the ba model shows reliable estimates for the effective conductivity of mixtures for low volume fractions of spherical inclusions its results improve when the sizes of the spherical particles vary over a wide range meredith and tobias 1962 mclachlan 1985 zimmermann 1996 however ba fails to predict the behavior of the percolating system when f reaches the highest possible packing fraction of the inclusions 2 4 general effective medium concept 2 4 1 basic model description according to the underlying assumptions of the bs and ba theories there should be an intermediate condition in which neither both constituents should fill the medium in a completely symmetrical way nor should spherical inclusions be fully coated by the background material mclachlan 1986a b 1987 1988 and 1990 developed the gem theory to also calculate the effective property for a case where inclusions have a high volumetric content are not isolated and can be in contact with each other mclachlan showed that gem is a general form of the bs and ba theories which interpolates between these two extreme cases regarding the distribution of constituents there is no inclusion host concept assumed in gem both constituents can touch each other and are not necessarily coated by the other constituent a schematic comparison of gem and maxwell media is given by fig 2 which emphasizes that in a gem media inclusions can even form clusters should not necessarily be isolated and interaction among them is allowed for a mixture with conductivities k 1 and k 2 and the volume fraction f corresponding to the component with k 1 the gem equation becomes mclachlan 1986a b 1987 1990 8 f k 1 k m k 1 f c 1 f c k m 1 f k 2 k m k 2 f c 1 f c k m 0 in which the uppercase k are defined as k 1 k 1 1 t k 2 k 2 1 t and k m k m 1 t the parameter t is an adjustable exponent related to the critical volume fraction fc and the shape and orientation of the inclusions as a result the effective conductivity of the mixture predicted by eq 8 depends on the volume fraction f the critical fraction fc and the shape and orientation of the inclusions eq 8 is quadratic in km and easily solved considering the conductivity ratios β k 1 k 2 and k r k m k 2 and the dimensionless parameter a f c 1 f c inserting these definitions into eq 8 and solving the equation results in two solutions where only the positive solution k r 0 is relevant 9 k r γ γ 2 4 a β 1 t 2 a t in which 10 γ f a β 1 t 1 a 1 a β 1 t eq 9 can be used to calculate the influence of volumetric inclusion content and shape on the effective conductivity note that k r in eq 9 becomes one if β is one i e if k 1 and k 2 are the same furthermore for f f c and k 1 0 k m becomes zero i e the effective conductivity becomes zero at and beyond the critical content for impermeable inclusions 2 4 2 critical volume fraction of the inclusions f c a critical volume fraction of the inclusions f c l3 l3 must be considered in a mixture such that for f f c and k 1 0 the effective conductivity k m becomes zero or if k 1 0 then km becomes inclusion dominated the reason for this is that the continuous percolation path within the permeable component is interrupted at f f c when inclusions are non conductive mclachlan 1986b celzard et al 2002 there are some methods to estimate values of f c zallen 1983 2002 proposed a value f c 0 55 0 03 in 2d and f c 0 84 0 02 in 3d the recommended value of f c 0 84 that is normally used in 3d porous media corresponds to a site percolation threshold in percolation theory for solid conducting spheres that touch their surrounding neighbors and are randomly packed with almost similar non conductive spheres mclachlan et al 1990 zallen 2002 mclachlan and sauti 2007 it must be considered that f c which is similar to the percolation threshold in percolation theory has no universal value and differs according to the geometrical physical and hydraulic aspects of the mixture the shape orientation size distribution of the constituents particles and the characteristics of the flow field affect the value of f c ruschau and newnham 1992 ghanbarian and daigle 2016 and studying the effects of these factors on critical volume fraction of inclusions in the composites is an ongoing research e g qu et al 2018 following zallen 1983 2002 we propose a value of f c 0 84 which is used in the computations presented below in a non consolidating mixture like stony soils higher values of f c can occur mclachlan and sauti 2007 the model of kusy 1977 can be applied to estimate the values of f c based on the properties of the constituents a sensitivity analysis using a plausible range of the input parameters in this model results in values of f c ranging from 0 847 to 0 982 more details of this model and its input parameters for stony soil are presented in appendix a 2 4 3 effects of shape and orientation of inclusions one fundamental advantage of gem is that effects of shape and orientation of the inclusions can be incorporated into the model using the parameter t whereas the inclusions are always assumed spherical in the maxwell and bruggeman media mclachlan 1987 in the next section we assess the influence of shape and orientation on k r for binary mixtures inclusions as oriented spheroids if one approximates the inclusions to be oriented spheroids the inclusion parameter t becomes mclachlan et al 1990 11 t f c 1 l where l 0 l 1 is the effective depolarization factor which is a function of shape and orientation of spheroidal inclusions towards flow jones and friedman 2000 the value of l represents the deviation of the shape of a spheroid from that of a sphere i e the extent of elongation of a prolate spheroid or the flattening of an oblate spheroid a spheroid is an ellipsoid in which two of the three main axes have an equal length if the third axis is longer than the other two the spheroid is prolate shaped like a rugby ball otherwise it is oblate shaped like a lentil obviously a sphere is an ellipsoid with three axes of equal length in fig 3 these three basic shapes have been visualized with the software hydrus 2d 3d šimůnek et al 2008 the depolarization factor l is calculated from the eccentricity e of the spheroids for the objects shown in fig 3 with the axes lengths a l and c l the equations for calculating e and l for prolate spheroids a c are sihvola 1999 12 e 1 a c 2 l x 1 e 2 2 e 3 ln 1 e 1 e 2 e l y l z 1 2 1 l x and for oblate spheroids a c one obtains 13 e a c 2 1 l z 1 e 2 e 3 e arctan e l x l y 1 2 1 l z lx ly and lz are the depolarization factors toward the three orthogonal directions x y and z and a c is the aspect ratio of the spheroid note that the three depolarization factors always sum to unity since a spheroid has two equal axes values of l for two of the three main directions are the same the case e 1 spherical inclusions a c cannot be handled by eq 12 and 13 in this case l 1 3 in all three directions in the general case of ellipsoidal inclusions with three different axes values of l can be calculated as shown in sihvola 1999 if inclusions have a dominant orientation towards the main flow direction the respective l must be chosen the spheroids shown in fig 3 can be rotated by 90 to adjust the depolarization factors accordingly the dependence of l on aspect ratio for prolate and oblate spheroids is illustrated in fig 4 a note that the dependence of the shape parameter t on the depolarization factor by eq 11 introduces anisotropy in the effective conductivity k m for all spheroids except spheres in the calculations the upper limit of the aspect ratio was selected to be 10 because in soil systems aspect ratios lower than 0 2 or higher than 5 are rarely found the reason for this is that rock fragments with such extreme aspect ratios tend to break fragment very easily mendelson and cohen 1982 aspect ratios of prolate spheroids are limited to a narrow range 0 a c 1 and correspond to spheroidal inclusions with depolarization factors 0 lx 0 33 and 0 33 ly lz 0 5 for oblate spheroids values of l are 0 07 lx ly 0 33 and 0 33 lz 0 86 the crossing point of all the curves at a c 1 corresponds to a sphere for which all three depolarization factors are 1 3 the values of l are used to calculate the parameter t in eq 11 which exerts a strong influence on k r calculated by eq 9 the dependence of kr on inclusion shape prolate or oblate aspect ratio and orientation for different volumetric contents of inclusions is shown in fig 4b and 4c the aspect ratios 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 2 5 10 were considered for prolate and oblate spheroids respectively and a critical inclusion fraction fc 0 84 and conductivity ratio β 0 001 were assumed in the calculations the value of β reflects a setup in which the inclusions have a negligible but nonzero conductivity the anisotropy of the relative effective conductivity k r becomes evident in fig 4 in the following we assume that the inclusions are oriented exactly as shown in fig 3 and discuss the reduction in conductivity for vertical flow as it is the dominant flow direction in soils however in groundwater systems with a dominant lateral flow occurs more one could focus on the horizontal directions instead in fig 4 the reduction in k r for more lentil shaped oblate inclusions is stronger than for rugby ball shaped prolates this can be explained by the fact that oblate inclusions with small conductivity restrict the cross section of the flow more effectively moreover the solid curves show a more significant variation for prolate compared to oblate inclusions this illustrates that the reduction in conductivity for oblate inclusions depends more strongly on the aspect ratio than for the prolate ones these results match those of the numerical study by hlaváčiková et al 2016 very well which showed a large difference in the reduction of effective hydraulic conductivity by horizontally and vertically oriented impermeable ellipses in two spatial dimensions inclusions as randomly oriented spheroids if inclusions in the mixture are randomly oriented spheroids the parameter t is obtained by mclachlan et al 1990 14 t m f c in which m includes the effect of orientation and shape of inclusions the value of m is 1 5 for spheres sen et al 1981 and increases depending on how aspherical the inclusions are mendelson and cohen 1982 obtained the values of m for randomly oriented spheroidal inclusions by 15 m 5 3 l 3 1 l 2 where l is the depolarization factor from eq 12 13 although the value of m can increase to 4 0 in cases of extreme aspect ratios mclachlan 1987 values in natural systems with aspect ratios ranging from 0 2 to 5 will be limited to values between 1 5 sphere and 2 1 oblate with an aspect ratio of 5 for prolate spheroids values of m lie in the narrow interval 1 5 1 67 as noted by mendelson and cohen 1982 the influence of m on the relative effective conductivity k r can be seen in fig 5 for spheres m 1 5 prolate spheroids with an aspect ratio of 0 1 extreme case m 1 67 and oblate spheroids with aspect ratios of 2 5 and 10 with corresponding m values of 1 6 2 1 and 3 1 respectively the values of f c and β were 0 84 and 0 001 respectively in all calculations similar to the case of oriented spheroids the substantial difference between m values for oblate and prolate inclusions is due to their different impacts on blocking the flow randomly oriented prolates have a smaller effect on reducing the flow compared to randomly oriented oblates mendelson and cohen 1982 furthermore when the inclusions are randomly oriented prolates their aspect ratio does not have a considerable impact on the reduction rate of k r however when inclusions are randomly oriented oblates the reduction of k r is substantially dependent on the aspect ratio of the inclusions the higher the aspect ratio the more noticeable is the impact on the reduction of k r spherical inclusions have the lowest impact because they cause the smallest resistance to flow therefore k r will be overestimated if inclusions are assumed to be spherical 3 application to stony soils 3 1 soils containing impermeable rock fragments a typical assumption in soil hydrological modeling is that rock fragments are impermeable i e that their hydraulic conductivity is zero k 1 0 in this case maxwell s model given by eq 2 reduces to 16 k r 2 1 f 2 f this is the model proposed by peck and watson 1979 for k l 0 the bs model expressed by eq 3 simplifies to 17 k r 1 d d 1 f which in three spatial dimensions d 3 becomes 18 k r 1 3 2 f in this case the critical volumetric fraction of rock fragments where k r becomes zero is f c 2 3 and eq 18 can only be applied if f 2 3 correspondingly the ba model given by eq 7 reduces to 19 k r 1 f d d 1 which in 3d is transformed into 20 k r 1 f 3 2 k r in eq 20 becomes zero at f 1 i e no critical volumetric content of rock fragments is considered in the ba model for the gem model the assumption k 1 0 in eq 8 leads to 21 k r 1 f f c t for f f c otherwise k r 0 the bs model with k 1 0 is a specific case of the gem model if t 1 and f c 2 3 according to eq 14 this implies that m 1 5 the value for spheres fig 6 shows a model comparison covering the models in table 1 the two bruggeman models bs and ba and the gem model because the latter allows incorporating the effects of shape and orientation by the parameter t a range of possible reduction functions is indicated by a gray shaded area bounded by the lowest possible reduction i e prolate spheroids aspect ratio of 0 2 oriented along the main flow direction t 0 89 and the most pronounced reduction that may occur in a natural system i e oblate spheroids aspect ratio of 5 oriented orthogonally to the main flow direction t 3 37 the gem curve for spheres t 1 26 for fc 0 84 is also included for the model of novák et al 2011 we assumed a 1 2 the value for a loamy sand background soil the fundamental assumptions and limitations of the models are presented in table 1 and the preceding sections the validity of all models except gem is restricted to low to medium volumetric contents of rock fragments i e up to 40 for novák and less for other models in fig 6 only the gem model is theoretically valid for soils with high volumetric rock fragments contents however the result of the bs ba peck and watson 1979 and gem for spherical inclusions are more similar at lower volumetric contents of rock fragments f 10 these models all assume a spherical shape for rock fragments in addition to this theoretical advantage gem is the most flexible of all models because it includes an additional parameter t basically all other models except the ravina and magier model lie within the gray shaded area for rock fragment contents up to almost 70 finally the model based on gem is able to predict a markedly higher decrease in effective conductivity for oblate shaped rock fragments which are oriented orthogonally to the main direction of water flow conversely for oriented prolate rock fragments the reduction predicted by gem is smaller than that of all other models except the ravina and magier 1984 model which predicts a linear reduction of conductivity with f and does not consider the additional reduction in hydraulic conductivity due to the shape and orientation of rock fragments and the resulting alteration of the flow field novák et al 2011 hlaváčiková et al 2016 3 2 saturated soils containing permeable rock fragments a significant feature of the gem model is that it allows rock fragments to conduct water k 1 0 fig 7 shows the effects of rock fragments content and their conductivity expressed by the conductivity ratio β k 1 k 2 on the effective conductivity of stony soils the sensitivity analysis was conducted using eqs 9 and 10 rock fragments were assumed to be spheres the critical fraction of rock fragments was set to f c 0 84 and as a result t was 1 26 a wide range of the hydraulic conductivity ratio β was considered to represent different hydraulic conductivity contrasts of rock fragments and background soil fig 7a illustrates the change in k r for various volumetric contents of rock fragments f ranging from 0 to 1 and five different values of β it becomes evident that the conductivity of the mixture decreases non linearly with f and the rate of decrease depends on β the decrease in k r is smaller for higher values of β i e the conductivities of rock fragments and background soil become more similar the curves for β 0 01 and β 0 001 are already quite similar indicating a convergence of the saturated effective conductivity for small values of k 1 for small values of β indicating inclusions with a negligible conductivity the effective conductivity k m approaches zero when f reaches its critical content f c note that k r is unity for all the rock fragment contents if β 1 curve not shown in fig 7a the relative hydraulic conductivity as a function of the hydraulic conductivity ratio β for different contents of rock fragments is shown in fig 7b all of the curves start in the top right corner with k r 1 where the conductivities of background soil and rock fragments are identical β 1 the value of k r decreases with decreasing β until the curves become horizontal around β 0 001 in agreement with fig 7a the content of rock fragments determines the asymptotic value of k r although higher amounts of rock fragments lead to lower hydraulic conductivities of the stony soil deviations become smaller when rock fragments have higher conductivities 3 3 variably saturated soils containing permeable rock fragments the scaling models used to describe the effective conductivity of stony soils table 1 are only valid if rock fragments are assumed to be impermeable k 1 0 these models can be applied to predict the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function of stony soils k m h l t where h l is the tension or absolute value of soil matric potential in most applications the models of describing the reduction in effective hydraulic conductivity affected by the presence of rock fragments are used to scale the entire function k m h hlaváčiková and novák 2014 this can easily be achieved by the conductivity functions which are based on the capillary bundle models in which the entire conductivity function is scaled by the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s technically one simply scales k s of the background soil by one of the models shown in fig 6 for more complex models of hydraulic conductivity which include a non capillary component e g caused by film and corner flow naseri et al 2019 provided a more specific scaling approach based on the same reasoning however cases in which rock fragments have nonzero conductivity cannot be treated with these approaches one of the advantages of gem is that the effective hydraulic conductivity curve k m h of a stony soil can be calculated in the case where the rock fragments conduct water k l 0 this characteristic makes gem a capable model to describe the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of stony soils where rock fragments might be either impermeable or permeable the results of a case study are illustrated in fig 8 to highlight the potential of the gem model assuming that rock fragments are porous with an effective water holding capacity θs1 the water retention curves wrc of background soil and rock fragments θ i h are calculated with the van genuchten 1980 model 22 s i h θ i h θ r i θ s i θ r i 1 1 α i h n i m i where θ si l3 l3 and θ ri l3 l3 are saturated and residual water contents si is the relative saturation function and α i 1 l ni and mi 1 1 n n 1 are shape parameters noting that rock fragments and background soil are denoted by i 1 and 2 respectively we applied the van genuchten model of wrc due to its popularity of course alternative parametrizations of shp can be used in the presented framework examples can be found in the review article of assouline and or 2013 naseri et al 2019 applied a parametrization over the full moisture range to stony soils the wrc of the stony soil θm h l3 l3 is then calculated as the volume averaging of the two curves peters and klavetter 1988 23 θ m h f θ 1 h 1 f θ 2 h the hydraulic conductivity curves of both components ki h l t are computed by 24 k i h k s i s i τ i 1 1 s i 1 m i m i 2 in which ksi l t is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and τ i is the pore connectivity parameter the model parameters are summarized in table 2 the parameters of the rock fragments in table 2 reflect a porosity of 10 a relatively large air entry tension corresponding to a small average pore size and a wide pore size distribution the parameters are expert guesses which serve to illustrate the behavior of the model it should be noted that the scaling of the entire hydraulic conductivity curve hinges on simplifying assumptions most importantly it is assumed that the presence of rock fragments does not alter the spatial distribution of matric potential and thus hydraulic conductivity in the vicinity of the rock fragments it is plausible to assume a downstream reduction in matric potential behind the inclusions which leads to a decrease in water content and hydraulic conductivity it is important to consider that the resulting spatial variability in hydraulic conductivity and the flow field are not accounted for in the scaling models applied in this section and in other studies like hlaváčiková and novák 2014 for estimating the hydraulic conductivity curve of stony soils in fact application of eq 24 rests on the assumption that local perturbations of matric potential and water flux are negligible and that the hydraulic conductivity derived from the average matric potential can serve as the effective hydraulic conductivity of the host material and the permeable inclusion given the hydraulic conductivity curves of rock fragments and background soil the effective hydraulic conductivity curve of the stony soil k m h was calculated by a pointwise calculation using eq 9 note that the conductivity ratio β k 1 k 2 is a function of the tension the effective wrc of stony soils for different rock fragment contents are shown in fig 8a the hydraulic conductivity curves of background soil dashed black line and embedded rock fragments dashed gray line are presented in fig 8b and 8c values of β range from 0 001 at water saturation to 1010 at air dryness the effective hydraulic conductivity curves were calculated for two shapes of rock fragments spheres fig 8b and oblate spheroids fig 8c as the hydraulic conductivity curves of rock fragments and background soil cross at about h 70 cm the discussion is divided into two parts to the left of the crossing point conductivity of the background soil dominates and the effective conductivity of the stony soil is decreased by the presence of rock fragments at the crossing point the hydraulic conductivities of rock fragments and background soil are identical β 1 and km k 1 k 2 to the right of the crossing point where the tension is high conductivity of rock fragments becomes increasingly influential for effective hydraulic conductivity with increasing amounts of rock fragments the effective conductivity of the stony soil becomes more similar to the conductivity curve of the rock fragments the shape of the effective conductivity functions is similar to those of the bimodal soil hydraulic property model presented by durner 1994 and priesack and durner 2006 however because the conductivity ratio β is a function of tension the effective curve can generally not be parametrized with this model more importantly the effective conductivity curves cannot be calculated by capillary bundle models applied to the effective retention curves shown in fig 8a the calculation of an effective hydraulic conductivity of soils containing permeable rock fragments is not restricted to the model of van genuchten 1980 and arbitrary parametrizations of the soil hydraulic properties can be selected and even combined 4 conclusions there is a lack of physically based models to describe hydraulic conductivity of stony soils in this article we suggest using the general effective medium theory gem as an improved flexible alternative to overcome most of the limitations of currently applied models the proposed model for calculating the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils considers hydraulic conductivities of rock fragments and background soil the volumetric content of rock fragments and a parameter t to characterize the shape and orientation of rock fragments towards flow the distinctive advantages of the gem model are i the applicability for soils with high contents of rock fragments where rock fragments do not need to be isolated and even can be in contact with each other ii the possibility to include the effects of shape and orientation of spheroidal rock fragments by a simple parametrization iii the ability to calculate the effective hydraulic conductivity of soils containing permeable rock fragments or any inclusions over the full range of soil matric potentials iv consideration of a critical fraction of rock fragments for which the effective conductivity becomes zero in case of impermeable rock fragments and v including the anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity caused by non spherical inclusions these characteristics make gem a more comprehensive model than the currently applied ones and an efficient alternative to calculate the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils in saturated and variably saturated conditions where limited hydraulic conductivity data is a major challenge finally we recommend the following to validate or falsify the presented model firstly experimental studies under various boundary conditions for different rock fragments contents types characteristics and different background soils secondly the theory can be tested using numerical simulations with the richards equation in three spatial dimensions for stony soils such efforts have been undertaken by novák et al 2011 and hlaváčiková et al 2016 but these were mainly limited to simulations in two spatial dimensions although the theory reviewed in this article clearly shows that effective flow properties depend on the dimensionality of the system since a homogeneous background soil was assumed in this study any elaborations accounting for the effects of rock fragments on the pore size distribution of the background soil or its heterogeneity would be an improvement of particular relevance

379,this study characterized and modeled heterogeneous surface wettability in sandstone and investigated the role of spatial heterogeneity and correlation length of surface wettability on relative permeability in a supercritical co2 scco2 brine rock system understanding the role of wettability heterogeneity on relative permeability is essential to geological co2 sequestration oil and gas recovery and contaminated groundwater remediation although numerous studies have attempted to understand the influences of surface wettability capillary number ca and viscosity ratio the role of the spatial variation and correlation length of surface wettability on two phase flow in three dimensional 3d porous media has not been unraveled due to the challenges in the measurement and representation of realistic rock surface wettability in this work we conducted in situ measurements of surface contact angle ca in a bentheimer sandstone after co2 flooding using micro computed tomography micro ct and found that the pore scale ca distribution on rock surfaces followed a log normal distribution associated with a spatial correlation length based on the statistical information from ct scanning a gaussian random field was used to model ca distributions that had desired standard deviations and spatial correlation lengths which were then adjusted within a certain range of values for sensitivity analyses to study their combined effects on the two phase flow in the porous medium using the lattice boltzmann lb method the lb two phase flow simulation was accelerated using hybrid multicore parallel computing to overcome the challenges in simulating multiphase flow in a large 3d domain having 800 800 600 nodes the simulation results showed that the surface wettability heterogeneity i e standard deviation of ca had a lesser effect on the relative permeability of the wetting fluid water but a more significant impact on the relative permeability of the non wetting fluid scco2 the corey model was used to fit the lb simulated relative permeability curves of water and scco2 and showed that the variations in the relative permeability curves for both water and scco2 increased as the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of ca increased this study illustrated that the assumption of homogeneous surface wettability may cause errors in multiphase flow simulations the impacts of both the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of cas should be accounted for this is the first study that explored the spatial correlation lengths associated with ca distributions on sandstone surfaces and comprehensively investigated the roles of both spatial variation and correlation length of ca on two phase flow properties in 3d porous media the optimized lb multiphase flow model was proved a powerful tool to study the interplays and combined effects of these statistical parameters which had critical applications in numerous natural and

chen and zhang 2010 szulczewski et al 2012 chen et al 2013 and contaminated groundwater remediation keller et al 2000 davis et al 2009 fluid fluid displacement processes and the associated microscopic properties in a porous medium such as capillary pressure and relative permeability depend strongly on the wettability on the solid surface landry et al 2014 although the rapid development of experimental technologies has allowed for in situ measurements of surface wettability within porous media andrew et al 2014 dalton et al 2018 maziar arshadi 2020 accurate representation and reproduction of complex and heterogeneous surface wettability still remain a challenge surface wettability indicates the tendency of a fluid to adhere to solid surfaces resulting from intermolecular interactions with the solid surface and other immiscible fluids zhao et al 2018 macroscopic characterization of the wetting status of a rock is given by the amott harvey index amott 1959 or usbm index donaldson et al 1969 surface wettability is commonly characterized by the measurement of water s contact angle ca maziar arshadi et al 2020 which is the angle between the water solid interface and the water non aqueous fluid interface according to iglauer et al 2015 the wetting condition of a co2 water rock system can be categorized as completely water wet for a ca of 0 strongly water wet for 0 50 weakly water wet for 50 70 intermediate wet for 70 110 weakly co2 wet for 110 130 strongly co2 wet for 130 180 and completely co2 wet for 180 the ca can be uniformly and nonuniformly distributed over the solid surface uniform i e homogeneous wettability indicates that the ca throughout the entire solid surface in a porous medium is the same hwang et al 2006 whereas nonuniform i e heterogeneous wettability indicates that the ca value varies spatially over the rock surface in rocks surface cas are affected by pore geometry rock surface roughness and mineralogy which may lead to a strongly heterogeneous distribution of cas alratrout et al 2017 iglauer 2017 maziar arshadi et al 2020 yekeen et al 2020 cas in a co2 brine rock system are also affected by pressure and temperature which makes it more challenging to accurately characterize the surface wettability yekeen et al 2020 heterogeneous wettability on solid surfaces can be further categorized into two scenarios fractional wet and mixed wet fractional wet in a co2 water rock system in general assumes that water wet and co2 wet solid surfaces coexist and the spatial distribution of these two types of surfaces is heterogeneous bradford and leij 1996 on the other hand mixed wet assumes that the spatial distribution of surface wettability depends on the pore size solid surfaces in smaller pores and fractures are water wet whereas solid surfaces in larger pores and fractures are co2 wet salathiel 1973 valvatne and blunt 2004 in the past few decades the development of high resolution x ray micro computed tomography micro ct has provided a powerful tool for direct observations of internal pore structure and fluid and particle distribution within porous media at the pore scale chen et al 2008 chen et al 2009a iglauer et al 2011 silin et al 2011 kumar et al 2012 this non invasive three dimensional 3d visualization technology made it possible to conduct in situ pore scale ca measurements on solid surfaces in a porous medium andrew et al 2014 dalton et al 2018 blunt et al 2019 maziar arshadi 2020 with pore structure and fluid distributions characterized at the pore and sub pore scales numerical modeling has widely been used as a tool to study multiphase flow in the porous medium as well as its interactions with the pore geometry and surface wettability fan et al 2019 pore scale direct simulation methods are capable of accounting for detailed information on microscopic flow which makes it possible to investigate the underlying complex physics and key mechanisms in multiphase flow in porous media through recent developments the color gradient lattice boltzmann lb method has become a promising numerical method for simulating multiphase flow in complex 3d porous media because of its advantage in dealing with complex boundaries within porous media simplicity in optimization through parallel computing and capability to incorporate new physics shi and tang 2018 zhao et al 2018 yi et al 2019 wang et al 2020 particularly the continuous growth of computer performance and development of parallel computing devices such as graphics processing units gpus chen et al 2016 have greatly enhanced the lb method s capabilities in modeling multiphase flow in large scale 3d porous media landry et al investigated relative permeability in a bead packed porous medium having altered wetting conditions they found that the variation in surface wettability did not influence the wetting phase relative permeability noticeably but caused a significant decrease in the non wetting phase relative permeability landry et al 2014 hwang et at 2006 studied the impact of fractional wettability on the capillary pressure and relative permeability curves they found that a greater fraction of non water wetting solid surfaces caused a higher water relative permeability at a given water saturation hwang et al 2006 zhao et al 2018 investigated the impact of fractional wet solid surfaces on the relative permeability of computer generated two dimensional 2d porous media they found that the relative permeability curves of water and oil were not bounded between the pure water wet relative permeability curves and pure oil wet relative permeability curves zhao et al 2018 table 1 gives a comprehensive literature review that summarizes the recent studies on multiphase flow dynamics within porous media that have homogeneous and heterogeneous surface wettability it can be found that most existing studies on the effects of heterogeneous surface wettability made assumptions of fractional wet or mixed wet solid surfaces generally speaking in numerical modeling of fractional wet and mixed wet scenarios in a co2 water rock system binary ca values are assigned to rock surfaces i e a ca smaller than 90 is assigned to the water wet surfaces whereas a ca larger than 90 is assigned to the co2 wet surfaces furthermore there are in general no spatial correlation patterns associated with the distribution of the cas over the rock surfaces as discussed before however our recent works dalton et al 2018 fan et al 2019 on in situ measurements of cas in sandstone samples using micro ct illustrated that the spatial variation of ca on sandstone surfaces can be continuous which leads to a possibility that there may be a spatial correlation length associated with ca distributions on sandstone surfaces alratrout et al 2017 studied spatial correlations of cas in three carbonate cores their findings suggested that ca distribution was spatially correlated in carbonates and the correlation length was not larger than the average pore size alratrout et al 2017 however the impact of the spatial distribution pattern of cas on macroscopic multiphase flow properties in 3d porous media remains unknown this study aims to answer these fundamental questions in order to i find out if there exist spatial correlation patterns associated with the distribution of cas on sandstone surfaces ii unravel the role of spatial correlation length of ca distribution on multiphase flow in porous media and iii understand the interactions and combined effects between the ca s spatial heterogeneity and correlation length the workflow of this study is organized in the following order first brine and scco2 injection experiments were conducted on a bentheimer sandstone core and then the core was scanned using x ray micro ct second in situ ca measurements were conducted on the scco2 ganglia trapped in the sandstone and advanced image analyses were used to extract the variogram and covariance functions for the ca distribution on the sandstone surface third based on the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of ca measured from the micro ct scans autocorrelated gaussian random fields were used to generate nine realizations of ca distribution in the sandstone the values of the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of ca were shifted slightly from the reference values measured from the micro ct scans and then 3d lb multiphase flow modeling was used for comprehensive sensitivity analyses to unravel how the shifts in ca standard deviation and correlation length affect the relative permeability curves in the system by incorporating advanced optimization techniques such as gpu parallel computing and morphological drainage the lb simulator in this study is capable of performing large scale multiphase flow simulations on a domain having 800 800 600 pixels 2 materials and methods 2 1 core flooding experiment and micro ct imaging the core flooding experiment and x ray micro ct imaging were performed at u s department of energy doe s national energy technology laboratory netl the experimental setup was the same as in our previous studies dalton et al 2018 fan et al 2019 as illustrated in fig 1 one reactor and three isco pumps were used in the experiment a 12 volt heater was used to control the temperature the core sample was a bentheimer sandstone core of 2 54 cm 1 0 inch in length and 0 64 cm 0 25 inch in diameter before core flooding a 5 wt potassium iodide ki brine was exposed to co2 for 24 h to allow the brine to be fully saturated with co2 the bentheimer core was placed in a confining sleeve and aluminum spacers were placed at both ends of the core sample to properly situate the sample inside the core holder and to enable high quality ct imaging the core was then placed in a pressurized vessel which was mounted on the sample stage in a zeiss versa xrm 400 micro ct scanner ki was added to reduce the impact of clay swelling and to enhance the x ray attenuation contrast between brine and scco2 which was necessary for the micro ct to differentiate the wetting phase fluid brine and the non wetting phase fluid scco2 in the bentheimer sandstone dalton et al 2018 the core was initially saturated by brine the pore pressure was then raised to 12 4 mpa 1800 psi the confining pressure was raised to 14 5 mpa 2100 psi and the flow through temperature was kept at 24 c for all injections one cycle of the core flooding experiment involved a co2 injection i e step 1 drainage followed by a brine injection i e step 2 imbibition the flowrate was 0 1 ml min and 10 pore volumes 3 1 ml of each fluid in each step were injected through the sample the flow rate led to a capillary number ca of 1 3 10 7 which was in the range between 3 10 9 and 3 10 5 of the ca encountered in field co2 aquifer storage projects wei et al 2014 after one cycle of drainage imbibition the sample was set to a shut in condition the temperature was increased to the supercritical condition 48 c and the sample sat for 24 h before micro ct scanning which allowed scco2 to achieve a no flow steady state two drainage imbibition cycles in total were conducted and the micro ct scanning after cycle 2 was used to visualize scco2 brine distribution at the pore scale a high resolution of micro ct scanning is favorable for accurate measurements of scco2 blobs and pore geometry to keep a balance between scanning accuracy and a sufficiently large field of view chen et al 2008 2009a the micro ct scanning resolution was set as 1 66 μm per pixel length for simplicity hereafter we refer to the wetting fluid as water although the wetting fluid used in the experiments was actually co2 saturated 5 wt ki brine 2 2 generation of autocorrelated contact angle distributions representation of the heterogeneity in rock surface wettability is critical to study the role of wettability heterogeneity on the multiphase flow properties in porous media in this study the spatial pattern of the surface wettability heterogeneity was characterized by the standard deviation and correlation length of the static cas which were measured using micro ct scanning after the fluid distribution settled in the steady state based on the ct scanning results the surface ca distribution was found log normally distributed therefore in this study we modeled the logarithm of ca y log θ using an autocorrelated gaussian random field with a given correlation function where θ is the ca assuming the mean and standard deviation of y are μ y andσ y respectively the mean and variance of θ were calculated using μ θ e μ y σ y 2 2 and σ θ 2 e σ y 2 1 e 2 μ y σ y 2 respectively chen and zeng 2015 the correlation function between points x and y in the 3d space cy x y had an exponential form c y x y σ y 2 exp x 1 y 1 l 1 x 2 y 2 l 2 x 3 y 3 l 3 wherel 1 l 2 and l 3 were the spatial correlation lengths in the three principal directions to efficiently generate a large scale 3d random field in this paper the karhunen loève expansion method was used to solve the computational challenges zhang and lu 2004 the correlation function cy x y can be decomposed as zhang and lu 2004 1 c y x y n 1 λ n ψ n x ψ n y where λ n and ψ n x are the n th eigenvalues and eigenfunctions respectively the gaussian random field can then be generated using the karhunen loève expansion 2 y x y x n 1 ξ n λ n ψ n x where ξ n are independent zero mean gaussian random variables with unit variance in this process the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be computationally expensive for a computational domain of 800 800 600 pixels there are 3 8 108 grid nodes which leads to a challenge for the computations of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions this challenge was addressed by analytically calculating the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions from the exponential correlation function for a 3d field the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be analytically calculated as 3 λ n 4 l 1 l 2 l 3 σ y 2 l 1 2 ω i 1 2 1 l 2 2 ω j 2 2 1 l 3 2 ω k 3 2 1 and 4 ψ n x ψ i x 1 ψ j x 2 ψ k x 3 where ψ i x 1 ψ j x 2 and ψ k x 3 are the eigenfunctions in the three principal directions and can be calculated independently in each direction using 5 ψ n x i 1 l i 2 ω n 2 1 d i 2 l i l i ω n cos ω n x i sin ω n x i i 1 2 3 where ω n are the positive roots of the characteristic equation l i 2 ω 2 1 sin ω d i 2 l i ω cos ω d i and di is the side length of the computational domain in each direction once the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in the three principal directions are calculated the y field can be generated using eq 2 2 3 two phase flow simulation plan for sensitivity analyses the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of the cas at the bentheimer sandstone surface were measured and found as 9 and 71 pixel lengths respectively of which the details will be discussed in section 3 1 therefore we used 9 and 71 pixel lengths as the reference values for the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of ca respectively and then adjusted these values within a certain range for comprehensive sensitivity analysis to investigate the respective and combined effects of the standard deviation and correlation length of ca on the relative permeability curves in the rock specifically various ca distributions which had different combinations of ca standard deviation and ca correlation length were generated on the bentheimer sandstone surface using the gaussian random field method described in section 2 2 pore scale lb modeling was then used to simulate the water scco2 two phase flow in these pore geometries and to calculate the relative permeability curves in this study the 3d microstructure of the bentheimer sandstone was reconstructed from the micro ct images the computational domain for lb modeling has dimensions of 800 800 600 lu3 which means that there were 800 lattices in the x and y directions and 600 lattices in the z direction the spatial resolution was 1 66 μm per lu in this study one lattice length unit in lb modeling lu was equal to one pixel length in the micro ct imaging table 2 illustrates the comprehensive combinations of the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of ca specifically the standard deviation of ca took values of 2 9 and 18 and the spatial correlation length of ca took values of 35 71 and 105 pixel lengths the central block of the table shows the reference values i e a ca standard deviation of 9 and a ca correlation length of 71 pixel lengths measured from the laboratory micro ct scanning in the same row in the table the standard deviation of ca increases from left to right whereas the spatial correlation length stays constant in the same column in the table the spatial correlation length of ca increases from top to bottom whereas the standard deviation stays constant in this work the surface ca distribution was assumed isotropic which was confirmed through the micro ct scanning measurements and thus suggested that the spatial correlation lengths of ca were the same in the three principal directions the minimum dimension of the computational domain 600 pixel lengths was nearly six times larger than the maximum spatial correlation length 105 pixel lengths which suggests that sufficient statistical information was included in the generated gaussian random fields and thereby the ergodicity requirement was satisfied according to our previous research chen et al 2013 chen and zeng 2015 when a gaussian random field meets the ergodicity requirement the simulated system behaviors depend primarily on the statistical parameters i e standard deviation and spatial correlation length of the random variable and are relatively insensitive to the local heterogeneity in each specific realization 2 4 lattice boltzmann simulation of two phase flow in porous media the lb method is a mesoscopic kinetic equation based method for solving the navier stokes equations chen et al 1992 and

gradient nx ny and nz are the components of the unit norm vector n in the x y and z directions respectively the remaining moments are zero mcclure et al 2014 the phase distribution is described by the phase indicator field which is calculated as 10 φ ρ n ρ w ρ n ρ w where ρ n and ρ w are the densities of the nonwetting phase and wetting phase fluids respectively ϕ takes a value of 1 for the non wetting fluid and 1 for the wetting fluid within the interface zone ϕ takes values between 1 and 1 the color gradient c is the gradient of the phase indicator field written as c ϕ the wettability on the solid surface is controlled by setting the phase indicator to a constant value which is related to the surface ca as ϕ cos θ to enhance the simulation efficiency the d3q7 7 velocities in 3d space lattice model was employed to track the mass transfer the d3q7 model recovers the mass continuity equation accurately because there is no stress tensor in mass transport ginzburg 2005 zheng et al 2006 the discrete velocity space in the d3q7 model matches the first seven vectors in the d3q19 model mcclure et al 2014 the recoloring step is used to separate fluids and maintain the phase interface

been validated based on the comparison between ct scanned and simulated two fluid distributions and the comparison between simulated and experimental relative permeability curves for multiple materials and wetting conditions mcclure et al 2014 fan et al 2019 mcclure et al 2020 the initialization of fluid distribution at a given water saturation in the steady state relative permeability simulation was obtained from the unsteady state imbibition displacement process following the primary drainage process fan et al 2019 in the spontaneous imbibition process constant pressure boundary conditions were used and set at zero at both the inlet and outlet of the computational domain in this case water moved into the core spontaneously by means of capillary force in the forced imbibition process a constant water velocity boundary condition was used at the inlet and a constant pressure of zero was imposed at the outlet mcclure et al 2020 the viscosity ratio of water to scco2 was set as 4 1 in this study chen and zhang 2009 in the color gradient lb model spurious velocities can be canceled out when calculating the total flux over the entire computational domain therefore the spurious flow will not cause significant problems in simulating immiscible two fluid flow with a ca higher than 10 6 zhao et al 2017 fan et al 2019 the ca was set at 10 4 which was obtained by adjusting the body force in the lb model the ca used in lb multiphase flow modeling 10 4 was higher than that in the laboratory core flooding experiments 1 3 10 7 we found that the two fluid transport mechanisms under ca numbers of 1 3 10 7 and 10 4 were both dominated by the capillary force which led to similar properties of two fluid transport and distribution in the pore space from the perspective of lb modeling we chose ca 10 4 to reduce the computational time and to reduce the spurious velocity currents that start to interfere under low ca numbers fan et al 2019 the simulation of steady state relative permeability was terminated when the relative change in relative permeability for each 10 000 time steps was less than 0 01 the simulation took 20 000 000 lb time steps for the imbibition process and 1500 000 lb time steps for a single point on the relative permeability curves 2 5 hybrid multicore cpu gpu parallel computing lb simulations are demanding in computer memories and computing power mcclure et al 2014 the required central processing unit cpu time by the lb model is estimated 104 105 times higher than pore network models for a computational domain having the same dimensions vogel et al 2005 which poses a significant challenge for the lb model in simulating large computational domains as shown in table 1 the largest 3d simulation domain in the literature had dimensions of 5003 pixels which was reconstructed from a bentheimer sandstone wang et al 2020 to increase the spatial scale of the lb multiphase flow simulation model a hybrid multi core cpu gpu parallel computing scheme was used in this study where the gpu accelerated implementation of momentum transport simulation was combined with cpu based mass transport simulation using the compute unified device architecture parallel computing platform the gpu parallel computing can accelerate the implementation of the lb model by one order of magnitude walsh et al 2009 bernaschi et al 2010 mcclure et al 2010 rinaldi et al 2012 the mass transport simulation based on the d3q7 model greatly reduced the memory and computing demands and was implemented on cpus to maximize the usage of computing resources mcclure et al 2014 to improve the gpu parallel computing efficiency the data structure was optimized by removing the interior solid nodes in the porous medium in general a real rock has a porosity lower than 30 excluding the interior solid nodes that are not adjacent to fluids nodes leads to a sparse data structure that significantly reduces the computing time chen et al 2016 furthermore to enhance the implementation efficiency of the lb code a kernel tuning technique was used which included synchronizing fusing and coalescing of the lb methods chen et al 2016 synchronizing means doubling and flipping flopping of two solution arrays to avoid race conditions in the streaming step fusing is to fuse the streaming and collision operators into one kernel to avoid the time consuming multiple data reading and writing processes coalescing refers to the combination of multiple memory accesses into one transection the details can be found in one of our previous papers chen et al 2016 in addition a morphological drainage process was used to replace the primary drainage process in the lb model in order to further enhance the computing speed for a drainage process with a low ca direct simulation of a large scale computational domain using the lb multiphase flow model can be time consuming even using the hybrid multi core cpu gpu scheme in this work the primary drainage process simulation for a domain having 800 800 600 pixels can take 80 100 h a morphological drainage process can precisely resemble the primary drainage process with a low ca wang et al 2020 with this optimization the time for simulating the primary drainage process in this study was reduced to 20 min the parallel computing techniques described above greatly enhanced the performance of the hybrid multi core cpu gpu scheme the simulation was perform using 8 nvidia p100 gpus the lattice update rate is 12 988 million lattice updates per second mlups and 103 904 mlups in total 3 results and discussion 3 1 variogram covariance and spatial correlation length of measured contact angles fig 2 a illustrates a 2d cross section of the 3d reconstructed pore structure of the bentheimer sandstone and distributions of water and scco2 after two drainage imbibition cycles of core flooding based on the micro ct images the two point correlation function method berryman and blair 1986 berryman and blair 1987 chen et al 2009a chen et al 2009b was used to evaluate the porosity and average pore size of the bentheimer sandstone the two point correlation function s2 r is defined as s2 r g x g x r where x is an arbitrary position in the micro ct image and x r is another point separated by a distance of r the characteristic function g x is equal to 1 in the void region and 0 in the solid region the function of s2 r thus indicates the expectation that two points separated by a distance of r are both in the void space of the porous medium the porosity of the bentheimer sandstone φ is equal to s2 0 the average pore diameter d can be estimated using d ϕ s 2 0 where s2 0 is the derivative of s2 r at r 0 and the average particle diameter can be estimated as the separation distance at which s2 r first reaches the stable value berryman and blair 1987 fig 2b shows the two point correlation function for the bentheimer sandstone sample based on the image analysis the porosity of the bentheimer sandstone core was found as 25 3 the average particle size was found as 80 pixels 133 μm and the average pore diameter was found as 35 pixels 58 μm three hundred cas were measured after two drainage imbibition cycles of core flooding based on the micro ct images scanned on the bentheimer sandstone core using the angle tool package in the imagej software dalton et al 2018 the cas were measured when the trapped scco2 blobs were in the residual condition and the flow rate was zero the measurements considered the effects of sandstone surface roughness and pore size and shape to identify the spatial correlation of surface wettability variograms were calculated using the ct measured cas fig 3 a illustrates the histogram of the ct measured cas after two drainage imbibition cycles of core flooding the measured cas had a minimum value of 8 8 a maximum value of 59 7 a mean value of 29 2 a median value of 28 1 and a standard deviation of 9 1 the wide range of the ct measured cas illustrated that the wettability distribution on the sandstone surface was highly heterogeneous the mean value of the measured cas was higher than the median value which suggested that the ca distribution was right skewed with a long tail on the right side in addition based on the definition a ca value cannot be negative which suggests that zero is the lower bound of its distribution therefore a lognormal function was used to fit the measured cas as shown in fig 3a fig 3b shows the variogram and covariance curves of the ct measured cas the variogram was calculated as γ r 1 2 n r i 1 n r θ x i θ x i r 2 oliver and webster 2015 where r is the spatial separation distance between two ct measured cas n r is the total number of data pairs with the separation distance of r the covariance is calculated by c o v r σ θ 2 γ r where σ θ 2 is the variance of the ct measured cas oliver and webster 2015 fig 3b clearly illustrates that there was a characteristic length associated with the variogram and covariance curves when the separation distance was smaller than this characteristic length the variogram increased whereas the covariance decreased with the separation distance increasing which implies a decreasing similarity between two cas separated by the separation distance when the separation distance was larger than this characteristic length the variogram and covariance reached stable values and did not vary significantly with the separation distance increasing an exponential function was used to fit the data range in which the covariance declined leading to a spatial correlation length of 71 4 pixel lengths which suggested that statistically the covariance i e similarity between two ct measured ca values reduced to e 1 i e 36 8 of the variance of the random field when the separation distance reached 71 4 pixel lengths in the work of alratrout et al 2017 the spatial correlation length of ca distribution in carbonates was found not larger than the average pore size in comparison in this study the spatial correlation length of cas in the bentheimer sandstone was more than two times the average pore size this suggested that the pore geometry rock surface roughness and mineralogy all of which had an impact on the measured cas were generally more homogeneous in the bentheimer sandstone than in carbonates leading to a spatial correlation length of ca distribution that spanned a scale over several pore diameters or larger therefore in sandstone rocks it is necessary to consider the impact of relatively long correlation lengths that span over several pore diameters on the multiphase flow properties as illustrated in table 2 3 2 effect of the standard deviation of contact angle in this section the effect of the standard deviation of cas on the changes of scco2 and water relative permeability was illustrated fig 4 demonstrates the impact of the ca standard deviation on fluid distribution at the pore scale the ca correlation length was equal to the reference value 71 pixel lengths in both scenarios whereas the ca standard deviation in one scenario was reduced to 2 from the reference value 9 and it was increased to 18 in the other scenario as illustrated in the second row of table 2 the scco2 and water are shown in black and white respectively and the remaining region is the sandstone solid with the blue to red color gradient bar indicating the surface cas these 2d images are cross sections cut from the 3d fluid distributions simulated by the steady state lb multiphase flow model the water saturation was 0 55 in both scenarios and the main flow direction was perpendicular to the 2d cross sections when the ca standard deviation was raised to 18 certain pore wall surfaces had cas larger than 90 indicating a co2 wet surface as shown by the red circle in fig 4b in this case the scco2 was able to overcome the capillary pressure resistance and move into the relatively small fissures and pore throats in addition it was clear that the enhanced ca standard deviation caused fluid redistribution in larger pores as illustrated by the yellow circles in this case the scco2 ganglion was pulled toward the left side of the pore as shown in the yellow circle in fig 4b because the left side pore wall became more co2 wet note that the fluid distributions in both scenarios were simulated using the 3d lb multi phase flow model with the same initial scco2 water distribution it is clear that the difference in surface ca standard deviation led to different pore scale fluid distributions during the steady state two phase flow process which caused the variation in the relative permeability that was averaged over the entire computational domain the steady state relative permeability curves for both scco2 and water during the primary imbibition process were plotted based on the lb multiphase flow simulation results the corey model was used to fit the lb simulated relative permeability curves kr in order to quantitatively assess the role of the varying standard deviation and spatial correlation length of cas on kr the corey model is a commonly used fitting model which assumes that the relation between kr and the normalized water saturation follows a power law 14 k rw k rw o s w n w 15 k rg k rg o 1 s w n g where krw is water relative permeability krg is scco2 relative permeability k rw o is the end point relative permeability of water k rg o is the end point relative permeability of scco2 n w is the power law exponent for water relative permeability n g is the power law exponent for scco2 relative permeability s w is the normalized water saturation defined as s w s w s w i r 1 s w i r s g r w where sw is water saturation s w i r is irreducible water saturation and s g r w is residual scco2 saturation fig 5 illustrates the role of the varying standard deviation of cas on the kr curves the scattered data points are the steady state relative permeabilities measured by the lb multiphase flow mode in the primary imbibition process whereas the curves are the corey model fitting rows 1 2 and 3 represent the parameter values listed in the three rows in table 2 in each row of the table the standard deviation of ca increases from left to right whereas the spatial correlation length of ca stays constant therefore fig 5 shows the impact of the varying standard deviation of ca on the kr curves it is observed that the standard deviation of surface ca affects the relative permeability of scco2 krg more significantly than the relative permeability of water krw this was because despite of the different standard deviations in ca in all these simulation scenarios the average ca was the same and equal to 29 which suggested that the bentheimer sandstone surface was predominantly strongly water wet therefore in all these scenarios water formed a relatively thin coating near the rock surfaces and flowed within this 2d well connected water layer as a consequence the connectivity and effective permeability of water depended primarily on the average ca of the entire rock surface and was relatively insensitive to the local heterogeneity i e standard deviation in the rock surface ca conversely scco2 flowed mainly in pore centers because the rock surface was strongly water wet a relatively large standard deviation in surface ca may cause a small portion of local ca values larger than 90 leading to a co2 wet surface locally if these co2 wet surfaces occur in relatively small pores they might noticeably increase the resistance to the overall scco2 flow and hence reduce the connectivity and effective permeability of the scco2 phase which explains the more significant oscillations in the krg curves when the standard deviation of ca increased it is also observed that when water saturation approached zero and one the variations in krw and krg were not noticeable when the standard deviation of ca changed this was because when the water saturation was at 0 88 scco2 was at the residual saturation and immobilized and it was actually single phase flow of water that occurred in the pore space similarly when the water saturation was at 0 12 water was at the irreducible saturation and immobilized and the flow was single phase flow of scco2 in the pore space in either case the flow in the pore space was approximately equivalent to single phase flow and therefore there was no moving dynamic interfaces between water and scco2 as a consequence the heterogeneity i e standard deviation of ca on the rock surfaces had no impacts on krw and krg when the water saturation approached zero and one to accurately quantify the impact of the standard deviation of ca on the multiphase flow properties the standard deviations between the corey model fitted kr curves were calculated as a function of water saturation and illustrated in fig 6 a specifically the curve of sd of krg with l 35 pixels in fig 6a was calculated based on the three corey model fitted krg curves shown in fig 5a which were for the ca standard deviations of 2 8 and 19 separately at a specific water saturation the standard deviation of the three corey model fitted krg values was calculated and then plotted as a function of water saturation the same method was used to plot the other five curves in fig 6a which illustrates the impact of the varying ca standard deviation on the oscillation of the kr curves fig 6a confirms that the variation i e standard deviation in the krg curves was more significant than that of the krw curves when the ca standard deviation changed from 2 to 9 and then 18 furthermore it was confirmed that when the water saturation approached the two end points the variation in the kr curves was relatively small because the flow in the pore space was approximately equivalent to single phase flow when the water saturation was near the two end points in addition it was clear that when the ca standard deviation changed from 2 to 9 and then 18 the variation in the kr curves was more significant with a longer spatial correlation length this observation suggested that a longer spatial correlation length in ca distribution 105 pixel lengths enhanced the influence of the increasing ca standard deviation on the kr curves compared to shorter spatial correlation lengths i e 35 and 71 pixel lengths this finding is similar to a prior study chen et al 2013 which showed that a large spatial correlation length in a gaussian random field associated with a large standard deviation of the random variable led to the highest uncertainty in the system output to clearly illustrate the role of the spatial correlation length of ca when the standard deviation of ca varied the standard deviations of the model fitted relative permeability were averaged over the entire water saturation range from 0 2 through 0 8 shown in fig 6a and then plotted as a function of the corresponding correlation length as illustrated in fig 6b fig 6b confirms that the variation in the krg curves was more significant than that of the krw curves when the ca standard deviation increased from 2 to 9 and then 18 also it was confirmed that a longer spatial correlation length in ca distribution enhanced the influence of the increasing ca standard deviation on the kr curves 3 3 effect of the spatial correlation length of contact angle in this section the effect of the spatial correlation length of cas on the changes of the relative permeability of scco2 and water was investigated fig 7 demonstrates the impact of the ca s spatial correlation length on fluid distribution at the pore scale the ca standard deviation was equal to the reference value 9 in both scenarios whereas the ca s spatial correlation length in one scenario was reduced to 35 pixel lengths from the reference value 71 pixel lengths and it was increased to 105 pixel lengths in the other scenario as described in the second column of table 2 the water saturation was 0 55 in both scenarios and the main flow direction was perpendicular to these 2d cross sections because of the relatively low ca standard deviation 9 the rock surface cas in both scenarios were primarily close to their average value 29 and thus all smaller than 90 it was noticeable that the spatial distribution of ca had a spotted pattern in fig 7a due to its shorter ca correlation length conversely fig 7b illustrated a longer similarity length with respect to the ca spatial distribution because of its longer ca correlation length the longer ca correlation length can cause most of the inner wall area in a pore to become less water wet thereby attracting a significant amount of scco2 to move into this pore as demonstrated by the red circle in fig 7b fig 8 illustrates the role of the varying spatial correlation length of ca on the kr curves similarly the scattered data points are the steady state relative permeabilities measured by the lb multiphase flow model in the primary imbibition process whereas the curves are the corey model fitting columns 1 2 and 3 represent the parameter values listed in the three columns in table 2 in each column of table 2 the spatial correlation length of ca distribution increases from top to bottom whereas the standard deviation of ca stays constant therefore fig 8 demonstrates the impact of the varying spatial correlation length of ca distribution on the kr curves it is observed that the spatial correlation length of ca distribution affected krg more significantly than krw which is similar to the finding observed in fig 5 with the correlation lengths investigated i e 35 71 and 105 pixels most of the surface cas were smaller than 90 similar to the scenarios discussed in section 3 2 water had the tendency to coat the solid surface and form a well connected 2d water film therefore the connectivity and effective permeability of water were insensitive to the local heterogeneity of cas while the standard deviation determines the fine scale heterogeneity of cas the spatial correlation length controls the large scale heterogeneity of cas because water flows in the 2d well connected water film coating on the rock surface the relative permeability of water is insensitive to both the fine scale and large scale heterogeneities of cas compared to the relative permeability of scco2 it is also observed that when water saturation approached zero and one the variations in krw and krg were not noticeable when the spatial correlation length of ca distribution changed this can be explained using the same rationale that when the pore fluid distribution approached the irreducible water saturation or the residual scco2 saturation the flow in the pore space was approximately equivalent to single phase flow and therefore there was no moving interfaces between water and scco2 as a consequence the increasing spatial correlation length of ca distribution had no impacts on the krw and krg curves to accurately quantify the impact of the spatial correlation length of ca distribution on the multiphase flow properties the standard deviations between the corey model fitted kr curves were calculated as a function of water saturation and illustrated in fig 9 a specifically the curve of sd of krg with sd of ca 2 in fig 9a was calculated based on the three corey model fitted krg curves shown in fig 8a which were for the spatial correlation lengths of 35 71 and 105 pixels separately at a specific water saturation the standard deviation between the three corey model fitted krg values was calculated and then plotted as a function of water saturation the same method was used to plot the other five curves in fig 9a which illustrates the impact of the varying spatial correlation length of ca distribution on the oscillation of the kr curves fig 9a confirms that the variation i e standard deviation in the krg curves was more significant than that of the krw curves when the spatial correlation length of ca distribution changed from 35 to 71 and then 105 pixels it was also confirmed that when the water saturation approached the two end points the variation in the kr curves was relatively small because the flow in the pore space was approximately single phase flow when the water saturation was near the two end points in addition it was clear that when the spatial correlation length of ca distribution changed from 35 to 71 and then 105 pixels the variation in the kr curves was more significant with a larger standard deviation of ca this observation suggested that a larger standard deviation of ca i e 18 enhanced the influence of the increasing correlation length of ca on the kr curves compared to the smaller standard deviations of ca i e 2 and 9 this finding associated with the observation from fig 6 implies that a relatively large standard deviation of rock surface ca combined with a relatively long spatial correlation length of ca distribution will lead to relatively large variations in the kr curves of the rock in fig 9a the standard deviations between the model fitted relative permeability were averaged over the entire water saturation range from 0 2 through 0 8 and then plotted as a function of the corresponding standard deviation of ca as illustrated in fig 9b fig 9b confirms that the variation in the krg curves was more significant than that of the krw curves when the spatial correlation length of ca distribution increased from 35 to 71 and then 105 pixels also it was confirmed that a larger standard deviation of ca enhanced the influence of the increasing correlation length of ca distribution on the kr curves 4 discussion and conclusions this study investigated the role of the spatial heterogeneity and correlation length of surface cas on the relative permeability in a scco2 brine sandstone system the heterogeneous surface ca distributions used in lb two phase flow modeling were generated based on the statistical information obtained from in situ micro ct measurements of surface cas in a bentheimer sandstone after scco2 flooding the micro ct scanning found that the pore scale ca distribution on rock surfaces followed a log normal distribution associated with a spatial correlation length based on the statistical information from the ct scanning a gaussian random field was used to model surface ca distributions that have desired standard deviations and spatial correlation lengths the standard deviation and correlation length of ca distribution were then adjusted within a certain range of values for comprehensive sensitivity analyses to study their combined effects on the two phase flow properties in the porous medium the lb simulation results showed that even with the same initial fluid distribution the changes in the statistical properties of surface ca distribution led to noticeably different pore scale fluid distributions in the steady state two phase flow process which consequently caused the variation in the macroscopic relative permeability the surface wettability heterogeneity i e standard deviation of surface ca had a lesser effect on the relative permeability of the wetting fluid but a more noticeable impact on the relative permeability of the non wetting fluid the corey model was used to fit the lb simulated relative permeability of water and scco2 and the fitting results illustrated that the variations in the relative permeability curves for both water and scco2 increased as the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of ca increased these findings suggested that a relatively large standard deviation of rock surface ca combined with a relatively long spatial correlation length of ca distribution led to relatively large variations in the relative permeability curves of the rock this study illustrated that numerical modeling of multiphase flow and relative permeability in a natural rock using the assumption of homogeneous surface wettability may lead to errors the combined impact of both the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of rock surface cas should be accounted for to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that explored the spatial correlation lengths associated with ca distributions on sandstone surfaces and comprehensively investigated the roles of both spatial variation and correlation length of ca on two phase flow properties in 3d porous media in this study the spatial correlation length of surface ca in a bentheimer sandstone sample was found at least two times larger than the average pore size this finding suggested the necessity to account for the impact of relatively long correlation lengths that span over several pore diameters on the multiphase flow properties in 3d porous media additionally the lb multiphase flow model optimized by state of the art multicore cpu gpu parallel computing proved to be a powerful tool in the study of the interplays and combined effects of the spatial variation and correlation length of surface ca because in practice it is extremely challenging to fabricate 3d porous media that have desired and

379,this study characterized and modeled heterogeneous surface wettability in sandstone and investigated the role of spatial heterogeneity and correlation length of surface wettability on relative permeability in a supercritical co2 scco2 brine rock system understanding the role of wettability heterogeneity on relative permeability is essential to geological co2 sequestration oil and gas recovery and contaminated groundwater remediation although numerous studies have attempted to understand the influences of surface wettability capillary number ca and viscosity ratio the role of the spatial variation and correlation length of surface wettability on two phase flow in three dimensional 3d porous media has not been unraveled due to the challenges in the measurement and representation of realistic rock surface wettability in this work we conducted in situ measurements of surface contact angle ca in a bentheimer sandstone after co2 flooding using micro computed tomography micro ct and found that the pore scale ca distribution on rock surfaces followed a log normal distribution associated with a spatial correlation length based on the statistical information from ct scanning a gaussian random field was used to model ca distributions that had desired standard deviations and spatial correlation lengths which were then adjusted within a certain range of values for sensitivity analyses to study their combined effects on the two phase flow in the porous medium using the lattice boltzmann lb method the lb two phase flow simulation was accelerated using hybrid multicore parallel computing to overcome the challenges in simulating multiphase flow in a large 3d domain having 800 800 600 nodes the simulation results showed that the surface wettability heterogeneity i e standard deviation of ca had a lesser effect on the relative permeability of the wetting fluid water but a more significant impact on the relative permeability of the non wetting fluid scco2 the corey model was used to fit the lb simulated relative permeability curves of water and scco2 and showed that the variations in the relative permeability curves for both water and scco2 increased as the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of ca increased this study illustrated that the assumption of homogeneous surface wettability may cause errors in multiphase flow simulations the impacts of both the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of cas should be accounted for this is the first study that explored the spatial correlation lengths associated with ca distributions on sandstone surfaces and comprehensively investigated the roles of both spatial variation and correlation length of ca on two phase flow properties in 3d porous media the optimized lb multiphase flow model was proved a powerful tool to study the interplays and combined effects of these statistical parameters which had critical applications in numerous natural and

chen and zhang 2010 szulczewski et al 2012 chen et al 2013 and contaminated groundwater remediation keller et al 2000 davis et al 2009 fluid fluid displacement processes and the associated microscopic properties in a porous medium such as capillary pressure and relative permeability depend strongly on the wettability on the solid surface landry et al 2014 although the rapid development of experimental technologies has allowed for in situ measurements of surface wettability within porous media andrew et al 2014 dalton et al 2018 maziar arshadi 2020 accurate representation and reproduction of complex and heterogeneous surface wettability still remain a challenge surface wettability indicates the tendency of a fluid to adhere to solid surfaces resulting from intermolecular interactions with the solid surface and other immiscible fluids zhao et al 2018 macroscopic characterization of the wetting status of a rock is given by the amott harvey index amott 1959 or usbm index donaldson et al 1969 surface wettability is commonly characterized by the measurement of water s contact angle ca maziar arshadi et al 2020 which is the angle between the water solid interface and the water non aqueous fluid interface according to iglauer et al 2015 the wetting condition of a co2 water rock system can be categorized as completely water wet for a ca of 0 strongly water wet for 0 50 weakly water wet for 50 70 intermediate wet for 70 110 weakly co2 wet for 110 130 strongly co2 wet for 130 180 and completely co2 wet for 180 the ca can be uniformly and nonuniformly distributed over the solid surface uniform i e homogeneous wettability indicates that the ca throughout the entire solid surface in a porous medium is the same hwang et al 2006 whereas nonuniform i e heterogeneous wettability indicates that the ca value varies spatially over the rock surface in rocks surface cas are affected by pore geometry rock surface roughness and mineralogy which may lead to a strongly heterogeneous distribution of cas alratrout et al 2017 iglauer 2017 maziar arshadi et al 2020 yekeen et al 2020 cas in a co2 brine rock system are also affected by pressure and temperature which makes it more challenging to accurately characterize the surface wettability yekeen et al 2020 heterogeneous wettability on solid surfaces can be further categorized into two scenarios fractional wet and mixed wet fractional wet in a co2 water rock system in general assumes that water wet and co2 wet solid surfaces coexist and the spatial distribution of these two types of surfaces is heterogeneous bradford and leij 1996 on the other hand mixed wet assumes that the spatial distribution of surface wettability depends on the pore size solid surfaces in smaller pores and fractures are water wet whereas solid surfaces in larger pores and fractures are co2 wet salathiel 1973 valvatne and blunt 2004 in the past few decades the development of high resolution x ray micro computed tomography micro ct has provided a powerful tool for direct observations of internal pore structure and fluid and particle distribution within porous media at the pore scale chen et al 2008 chen et al 2009a iglauer et al 2011 silin et al 2011 kumar et al 2012 this non invasive three dimensional 3d visualization technology made it possible to conduct in situ pore scale ca measurements on solid surfaces in a porous medium andrew et al 2014 dalton et al 2018 blunt et al 2019 maziar arshadi 2020 with pore structure and fluid distributions characterized at the pore and sub pore scales numerical modeling has widely been used as a tool to study multiphase flow in the porous medium as well as its interactions with the pore geometry and surface wettability fan et al 2019 pore scale direct simulation methods are capable of accounting for detailed information on microscopic flow which makes it possible to investigate the underlying complex physics and key mechanisms in multiphase flow in porous media through recent developments the color gradient lattice boltzmann lb method has become a promising numerical method for simulating multiphase flow in complex 3d porous media because of its advantage in dealing with complex boundaries within porous media simplicity in optimization through parallel computing and capability to incorporate new physics shi and tang 2018 zhao et al 2018 yi et al 2019 wang et al 2020 particularly the continuous growth of computer performance and development of parallel computing devices such as graphics processing units gpus chen et al 2016 have greatly enhanced the lb method s capabilities in modeling multiphase flow in large scale 3d porous media landry et al investigated relative permeability in a bead packed porous medium having altered wetting conditions they found that the variation in surface wettability did not influence the wetting phase relative permeability noticeably but caused a significant decrease in the non wetting phase relative permeability landry et al 2014 hwang et at 2006 studied the impact of fractional wettability on the capillary pressure and relative permeability curves they found that a greater fraction of non water wetting solid surfaces caused a higher water relative permeability at a given water saturation hwang et al 2006 zhao et al 2018 investigated the impact of fractional wet solid surfaces on the relative permeability of computer generated two dimensional 2d porous media they found that the relative permeability curves of water and oil were not bounded between the pure water wet relative permeability curves and pure oil wet relative permeability curves zhao et al 2018 table 1 gives a comprehensive literature review that summarizes the recent studies on multiphase flow dynamics within porous media that have homogeneous and heterogeneous surface wettability it can be found that most existing studies on the effects of heterogeneous surface wettability made assumptions of fractional wet or mixed wet solid surfaces generally speaking in numerical modeling of fractional wet and mixed wet scenarios in a co2 water rock system binary ca values are assigned to rock surfaces i e a ca smaller than 90 is assigned to the water wet surfaces whereas a ca larger than 90 is assigned to the co2 wet surfaces furthermore there are in general no spatial correlation patterns associated with the distribution of the cas over the rock surfaces as discussed before however our recent works dalton et al 2018 fan et al 2019 on in situ measurements of cas in sandstone samples using micro ct illustrated that the spatial variation of ca on sandstone surfaces can be continuous which leads to a possibility that there may be a spatial correlation length associated with ca distributions on sandstone surfaces alratrout et al 2017 studied spatial correlations of cas in three carbonate cores their findings suggested that ca distribution was spatially correlated in carbonates and the correlation length was not larger than the average pore size alratrout et al 2017 however the impact of the spatial distribution pattern of cas on macroscopic multiphase flow properties in 3d porous media remains unknown this study aims to answer these fundamental questions in order to i find out if there exist spatial correlation patterns associated with the distribution of cas on sandstone surfaces ii unravel the role of spatial correlation length of ca distribution on multiphase flow in porous media and iii understand the interactions and combined effects between the ca s spatial heterogeneity and correlation length the workflow of this study is organized in the following order first brine and scco2 injection experiments were conducted on a bentheimer sandstone core and then the core was scanned using x ray micro ct second in situ ca measurements were conducted on the scco2 ganglia trapped in the sandstone and advanced image analyses were used to extract the variogram and covariance functions for the ca distribution on the sandstone surface third based on the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of ca measured from the micro ct scans autocorrelated gaussian random fields were used to generate nine realizations of ca distribution in the sandstone the values of the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of ca were shifted slightly from the reference values measured from the micro ct scans and then 3d lb multiphase flow modeling was used for comprehensive sensitivity analyses to unravel how the shifts in ca standard deviation and correlation length affect the relative permeability curves in the system by incorporating advanced optimization techniques such as gpu parallel computing and morphological drainage the lb simulator in this study is capable of performing large scale multiphase flow simulations on a domain having 800 800 600 pixels 2 materials and methods 2 1 core flooding experiment and micro ct imaging the core flooding experiment and x ray micro ct imaging were performed at u s department of energy doe s national energy technology laboratory netl the experimental setup was the same as in our previous studies dalton et al 2018 fan et al 2019 as illustrated in fig 1 one reactor and three isco pumps were used in the experiment a 12 volt heater was used to control the temperature the core sample was a bentheimer sandstone core of 2 54 cm 1 0 inch in length and 0 64 cm 0 25 inch in diameter before core flooding a 5 wt potassium iodide ki brine was exposed to co2 for 24 h to allow the brine to be fully saturated with co2 the bentheimer core was placed in a confining sleeve and aluminum spacers were placed at both ends of the core sample to properly situate the sample inside the core holder and to enable high quality ct imaging the core was then placed in a pressurized vessel which was mounted on the sample stage in a zeiss versa xrm 400 micro ct scanner ki was added to reduce the impact of clay swelling and to enhance the x ray attenuation contrast between brine and scco2 which was necessary for the micro ct to differentiate the wetting phase fluid brine and the non wetting phase fluid scco2 in the bentheimer sandstone dalton et al 2018 the core was initially saturated by brine the pore pressure was then raised to 12 4 mpa 1800 psi the confining pressure was raised to 14 5 mpa 2100 psi and the flow through temperature was kept at 24 c for all injections one cycle of the core flooding experiment involved a co2 injection i e step 1 drainage followed by a brine injection i e step 2 imbibition the flowrate was 0 1 ml min and 10 pore volumes 3 1 ml of each fluid in each step were injected through the sample the flow rate led to a capillary number ca of 1 3 10 7 which was in the range between 3 10 9 and 3 10 5 of the ca encountered in field co2 aquifer storage projects wei et al 2014 after one cycle of drainage imbibition the sample was set to a shut in condition the temperature was increased to the supercritical condition 48 c and the sample sat for 24 h before micro ct scanning which allowed scco2 to achieve a no flow steady state two drainage imbibition cycles in total were conducted and the micro ct scanning after cycle 2 was used to visualize scco2 brine distribution at the pore scale a high resolution of micro ct scanning is favorable for accurate measurements of scco2 blobs and pore geometry to keep a balance between scanning accuracy and a sufficiently large field of view chen et al 2008 2009a the micro ct scanning resolution was set as 1 66 μm per pixel length for simplicity hereafter we refer to the wetting fluid as water although the wetting fluid used in the experiments was actually co2 saturated 5 wt ki brine 2 2 generation of autocorrelated contact angle distributions representation of the heterogeneity in rock surface wettability is critical to study the role of wettability heterogeneity on the multiphase flow properties in porous media in this study the spatial pattern of the surface wettability heterogeneity was characterized by the standard deviation and correlation length of the static cas which were measured using micro ct scanning after the fluid distribution settled in the steady state based on the ct scanning results the surface ca distribution was found log normally distributed therefore in this study we modeled the logarithm of ca y log θ using an autocorrelated gaussian random field with a given correlation function where θ is the ca assuming the mean and standard deviation of y are μ y andσ y respectively the mean and variance of θ were calculated using μ θ e μ y σ y 2 2 and σ θ 2 e σ y 2 1 e 2 μ y σ y 2 respectively chen and zeng 2015 the correlation function between points x and y in the 3d space cy x y had an exponential form c y x y σ y 2 exp x 1 y 1 l 1 x 2 y 2 l 2 x 3 y 3 l 3 wherel 1 l 2 and l 3 were the spatial correlation lengths in the three principal directions to efficiently generate a large scale 3d random field in this paper the karhunen loève expansion method was used to solve the computational challenges zhang and lu 2004 the correlation function cy x y can be decomposed as zhang and lu 2004 1 c y x y n 1 λ n ψ n x ψ n y where λ n and ψ n x are the n th eigenvalues and eigenfunctions respectively the gaussian random field can then be generated using the karhunen loève expansion 2 y x y x n 1 ξ n λ n ψ n x where ξ n are independent zero mean gaussian random variables with unit variance in this process the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be computationally expensive for a computational domain of 800 800 600 pixels there are 3 8 108 grid nodes which leads to a challenge for the computations of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions this challenge was addressed by analytically calculating the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions from the exponential correlation function for a 3d field the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be analytically calculated as 3 λ n 4 l 1 l 2 l 3 σ y 2 l 1 2 ω i 1 2 1 l 2 2 ω j 2 2 1 l 3 2 ω k 3 2 1 and 4 ψ n x ψ i x 1 ψ j x 2 ψ k x 3 where ψ i x 1 ψ j x 2 and ψ k x 3 are the eigenfunctions in the three principal directions and can be calculated independently in each direction using 5 ψ n x i 1 l i 2 ω n 2 1 d i 2 l i l i ω n cos ω n x i sin ω n x i i 1 2 3 where ω n are the positive roots of the characteristic equation l i 2 ω 2 1 sin ω d i 2 l i ω cos ω d i and di is the side length of the computational domain in each direction once the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in the three principal directions are calculated the y field can be generated using eq 2 2 3 two phase flow simulation plan for sensitivity analyses the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of the cas at the bentheimer sandstone surface were measured and found as 9 and 71 pixel lengths respectively of which the details will be discussed in section 3 1 therefore we used 9 and 71 pixel lengths as the reference values for the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of ca respectively and then adjusted these values within a certain range for comprehensive sensitivity analysis to investigate the respective and combined effects of the standard deviation and correlation length of ca on the relative permeability curves in the rock specifically various ca distributions which had different combinations of ca standard deviation and ca correlation length were generated on the bentheimer sandstone surface using the gaussian random field method described in section 2 2 pore scale lb modeling was then used to simulate the water scco2 two phase flow in these pore geometries and to calculate the relative permeability curves in this study the 3d microstructure of the bentheimer sandstone was reconstructed from the micro ct images the computational domain for lb modeling has dimensions of 800 800 600 lu3 which means that there were 800 lattices in the x and y directions and 600 lattices in the z direction the spatial resolution was 1 66 μm per lu in this study one lattice length unit in lb modeling lu was equal to one pixel length in the micro ct imaging table 2 illustrates the comprehensive combinations of the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of ca specifically the standard deviation of ca took values of 2 9 and 18 and the spatial correlation length of ca took values of 35 71 and 105 pixel lengths the central block of the table shows the reference values i e a ca standard deviation of 9 and a ca correlation length of 71 pixel lengths measured from the laboratory micro ct scanning in the same row in the table the standard deviation of ca increases from left to right whereas the spatial correlation length stays constant in the same column in the table the spatial correlation length of ca increases from top to bottom whereas the standard deviation stays constant in this work the surface ca distribution was assumed isotropic which was confirmed through the micro ct scanning measurements and thus suggested that the spatial correlation lengths of ca were the same in the three principal directions the minimum dimension of the computational domain 600 pixel lengths was nearly six times larger than the maximum spatial correlation length 105 pixel lengths which suggests that sufficient statistical information was included in the generated gaussian random fields and thereby the ergodicity requirement was satisfied according to our previous research chen et al 2013 chen and zeng 2015 when a gaussian random field meets the ergodicity requirement the simulated system behaviors depend primarily on the statistical parameters i e standard deviation and spatial correlation length of the random variable and are relatively insensitive to the local heterogeneity in each specific realization 2 4 lattice boltzmann simulation of two phase flow in porous media the lb method is a mesoscopic kinetic equation based method for solving the navier stokes equations chen et al 1992 and has demonstrated excellent capabilities in simulating complex multiphase flow in porous media mcclure et al 2014 because of its advantages in the explicit evolution equation chen et al 2008 chen et al

such as fluid solid interactions at solid surfaces han and cundall 2013 yang et al 2019 the color gradient lb multiphase flow model was employed in this study the lb method discretizes fluids into particle distributions which are transported on discrete velocity space in this work the fluid momentum was calculated in the d3q19 19 velocity vectors in 3d space lattice model to recover the

gradient nx ny and nz are the components of the unit norm vector n in the x y and z directions respectively the remaining moments are zero mcclure et al 2014 the phase distribution is described by the phase indicator field which is calculated as 10 φ ρ n ρ w ρ n ρ w where ρ n and ρ w are the densities of the nonwetting phase and wetting phase fluids respectively ϕ takes a value of 1 for the non wetting fluid and 1 for the wetting fluid within the interface zone ϕ takes values between 1 and 1 the color gradient c is the gradient of the phase indicator field written as c ϕ the wettability on the solid surface is controlled by setting the phase indicator to a constant value which is related to the surface ca as ϕ cos θ to enhance the simulation efficiency the d3q7 7 velocities in 3d space lattice model was employed to track the mass transfer the d3q7 model recovers the mass continuity equation accurately because there is no stress tensor in mass transport ginzburg 2005 zheng et al 2006 the discrete velocity space in the d3q7 model matches the first seven vectors in the d3q19 model mcclure et al 2014 the recoloring step is used to separate fluids and maintain the phase interface

been validated based on the comparison between ct scanned and simulated two fluid distributions and the comparison between simulated and experimental relative permeability curves for multiple materials and wetting conditions mcclure et al 2014 fan et al 2019 mcclure et al 2020 the initialization of fluid distribution at a given water saturation in the steady state relative permeability simulation was obtained from the unsteady state imbibition displacement process following the primary drainage process fan et al 2019 in the spontaneous imbibition process constant pressure boundary conditions were used and set at zero at both the inlet and outlet of the computational domain in this case water moved into the core spontaneously by means of capillary force in the forced imbibition process a constant water velocity boundary condition was used at the inlet and a constant pressure of zero was imposed at the outlet mcclure et al 2020 the viscosity ratio of water to scco2 was set as 4 1 in this study chen and zhang 2009 in the color gradient lb model spurious velocities can be canceled out when calculating the total flux over the entire computational domain therefore the spurious flow will not cause significant problems in simulating immiscible two fluid flow with a ca higher than 10 6 zhao et al 2017 fan et al 2019 the ca was set at 10 4 which was obtained by adjusting the body force in the lb model the ca used in lb multiphase flow modeling 10 4 was higher than that in the laboratory core flooding experiments 1 3 10 7 we found that the two fluid transport mechanisms under ca numbers of 1 3 10 7 and 10 4 were both dominated by the capillary force which led to similar properties of two fluid transport and distribution in the pore space from the perspective of lb modeling we chose ca 10 4 to reduce the computational time and to reduce the spurious velocity currents that start to interfere under low ca numbers fan et al 2019 the simulation of steady state relative permeability was terminated when the relative change in relative permeability for each 10 000 time steps was less than 0 01 the simulation took 20 000 000 lb time steps for the imbibition process and 1500 000 lb time steps for a single point on the relative permeability curves 2 5 hybrid multicore cpu gpu parallel computing lb simulations are demanding in computer memories and computing power mcclure et al 2014 the required central processing unit cpu time by the lb model is estimated 104 105 times higher than pore network models for a computational domain having the same dimensions vogel et al 2005 which poses a significant challenge for the lb model in simulating large computational domains as shown in table 1 the largest 3d simulation domain in the literature had dimensions of 5003 pixels which was reconstructed from a bentheimer sandstone wang et al 2020 to increase the spatial scale of the lb multiphase flow simulation model a hybrid multi core cpu gpu parallel computing scheme was used in this study where the gpu accelerated implementation of momentum transport simulation was combined with cpu based mass transport simulation using the compute unified device architecture parallel computing platform the gpu parallel computing can accelerate the implementation of the lb model by one order of magnitude walsh et al 2009 bernaschi et al 2010 mcclure et al 2010 rinaldi et al 2012 the mass transport simulation based on the d3q7 model greatly reduced the memory and computing demands and was implemented on cpus to maximize the usage of computing resources mcclure et al 2014 to improve the gpu parallel computing efficiency the data structure was optimized by removing the interior solid nodes in the porous medium in general a real rock has a porosity lower than 30 excluding the interior solid nodes that are not adjacent to fluids nodes leads to a sparse data structure that significantly reduces the computing time chen et al 2016 furthermore to enhance the implementation efficiency of the lb code a kernel tuning technique was used which included synchronizing fusing and coalescing of the lb methods chen et al 2016 synchronizing means doubling and flipping flopping of two solution arrays to avoid race conditions in the streaming step fusing is to fuse the streaming and collision operators into one kernel to avoid the time consuming multiple data reading and writing processes coalescing refers to the combination of multiple memory accesses into one transection the details can be found in one of our previous papers chen et al 2016 in addition a morphological drainage process was used to replace the primary drainage process in the lb model in order to further enhance the computing speed for a drainage process with a low ca direct simulation of a large scale computational domain using the lb multiphase flow model can be time consuming even using the hybrid multi core cpu gpu scheme in this work the primary drainage process simulation for a domain having 800 800 600 pixels can take 80 100 h a morphological drainage process can precisely resemble the primary drainage process with a low ca wang et al 2020 with this optimization the time for simulating the primary drainage process in this study was reduced to 20 min the parallel computing techniques described above greatly enhanced the performance of the hybrid multi core cpu gpu scheme the simulation was perform using 8 nvidia p100 gpus the lattice update rate is 12 988 million lattice updates per second mlups and 103 904 mlups in total 3 results and discussion 3 1 variogram covariance and spatial correlation length of measured contact angles fig 2 a illustrates a 2d cross section of the 3d reconstructed pore structure of the bentheimer sandstone and distributions of water and scco2 after two drainage imbibition cycles of core flooding based on the micro ct images the two point correlation function method berryman and blair 1986 berryman and blair 1987 chen et al 2009a chen et al 2009b was used to evaluate the porosity and average pore size of the bentheimer sandstone the two point correlation function s2 r is defined as s2 r g x g x r where x is an arbitrary position in the micro ct image and x r is another point separated by a distance of r the characteristic function g x is equal to 1 in the void region and 0 in the solid region the function of s2 r thus indicates the expectation that two points separated by a distance of r are both in the void space of the porous medium the porosity of the bentheimer sandstone φ is equal to s2 0 the average pore diameter d can be estimated using d ϕ s 2 0 where s2 0 is the derivative of s2 r at r 0 and the average particle diameter can be estimated as the separation distance at which s2 r first reaches the stable value berryman and blair 1987 fig 2b shows the two point correlation function for the bentheimer sandstone sample based on the image analysis the porosity of the bentheimer sandstone core was found as 25 3 the average particle size was found as 80 pixels 133 μm and the average pore diameter was found as 35 pixels 58 μm three hundred cas were measured after two drainage imbibition cycles of core flooding based on the micro ct images scanned on the bentheimer sandstone core using the angle tool package in the imagej software dalton et al 2018 the cas were measured when the trapped scco2 blobs were in the residual condition and the flow rate was zero the measurements considered the effects of sandstone surface roughness and pore size and shape to identify the spatial correlation of surface wettability variograms were calculated using the ct measured cas fig 3 a illustrates the histogram of the ct measured cas after two drainage imbibition cycles of core flooding the measured cas had a minimum value of 8 8 a maximum value of 59 7 a mean value of 29 2 a median value of 28 1 and a standard deviation of 9 1 the wide range of the ct measured cas illustrated that the wettability distribution on the sandstone surface was highly heterogeneous the mean value of the measured cas was higher than the median value which suggested that the ca distribution was right skewed with a long tail on the right side in addition based on the definition a ca value cannot be negative which suggests that zero is the lower bound of its distribution therefore a lognormal function was used to fit the measured cas as shown in fig 3a fig 3b shows the variogram and covariance curves of the ct measured cas the variogram was calculated as γ r 1 2 n r i 1 n r θ x i θ x i r 2 oliver and webster 2015 where r is the spatial separation distance between two ct measured cas n r is the total number of data pairs with the separation distance of r the covariance is calculated by c o v r σ θ 2 γ r where σ θ 2 is the variance of the ct measured cas oliver and webster 2015 fig 3b clearly illustrates that there was a characteristic length associated with the variogram and covariance curves when the separation distance was smaller than this characteristic length the variogram increased whereas the covariance decreased with the separation distance increasing which implies a decreasing similarity between two cas separated by the separation distance when the separation distance was larger than this characteristic length the variogram and covariance reached stable values and did not vary significantly with the separation distance increasing an exponential function was used to fit the data range in which the covariance declined leading to a spatial correlation length of 71 4 pixel lengths which suggested that statistically the covariance i e similarity between two ct measured ca values reduced to e 1 i e 36 8 of the variance of the random field when the separation distance reached 71 4 pixel lengths in the work of alratrout et al 2017 the spatial correlation length of ca distribution in carbonates was found not larger than the average pore size in comparison in this study the spatial correlation length of cas in the bentheimer sandstone was more than two times the average pore size this suggested that the pore geometry rock surface roughness and mineralogy all of which had an impact on the measured cas were generally more homogeneous in the bentheimer sandstone than in carbonates leading to a spatial correlation length of ca distribution that spanned a scale over several pore diameters or larger therefore in sandstone rocks it is necessary to consider the impact of relatively long correlation lengths that span over several pore diameters on the multiphase flow properties as illustrated in table 2 3 2 effect of the standard deviation of contact angle in this section the effect of the standard deviation of cas on the changes of scco2 and water relative permeability was illustrated fig 4 demonstrates the impact of the ca standard deviation on fluid distribution at the pore scale the ca correlation length was equal to the reference value 71 pixel lengths in both scenarios whereas the ca standard deviation in one scenario was reduced to 2 from the reference value 9 and it was increased to 18 in the other scenario as illustrated in the second row of table 2 the scco2 and water are shown in black and white respectively and the remaining region is the sandstone solid with the blue to red color gradient bar indicating the surface cas these 2d images are cross sections cut from the 3d fluid distributions simulated by the steady state lb multiphase flow model the water saturation was 0 55 in both scenarios and the main flow direction was perpendicular to the 2d cross sections when the ca standard deviation was raised to 18 certain pore wall surfaces had cas larger than 90 indicating a co2 wet surface as shown by the red circle in fig 4b in this case the scco2 was able to overcome the capillary pressure resistance and move into the relatively small fissures and pore throats in addition it was clear that the enhanced ca standard deviation caused fluid redistribution in larger pores as illustrated by the yellow circles in this case the scco2 ganglion was pulled toward the left side of the pore as shown in the yellow circle in fig 4b because the left side pore wall became more co2 wet note that the fluid distributions in both scenarios were simulated using the 3d lb multi phase flow model with the same initial scco2 water distribution it is clear that the difference in surface ca standard deviation led to different pore scale fluid distributions during the steady state two phase flow process which caused the variation in the relative permeability that was averaged over the entire computational domain the steady state relative permeability curves for both scco2 and water during the primary imbibition process were plotted based on the lb multiphase flow simulation results the corey model was used to fit the lb simulated relative permeability curves kr in order to quantitatively assess the role of the varying standard deviation and spatial correlation length of cas on kr the corey model is a commonly used fitting model which assumes that the relation between kr and the normalized water saturation follows a power law 14 k rw k rw o s w n w 15 k rg k rg o 1 s w n g where krw is water relative permeability krg is scco2 relative permeability k rw o is the end point relative permeability of water k rg o is the end point relative permeability of scco2 n w is the power law exponent for water relative permeability n g is the power law exponent for scco2 relative permeability s w is the normalized water saturation defined as s w s w s w i r 1 s w i r s g r w where sw is water saturation s w i r is irreducible water saturation and s g r w is residual scco2 saturation fig 5 illustrates the role of the varying standard deviation of cas on the kr curves the scattered data points are the steady state relative permeabilities measured by the lb multiphase flow mode in the primary imbibition process whereas the curves are the corey model fitting rows 1 2 and 3 represent the parameter values listed in the three rows in table 2 in each row of the table the standard deviation of ca increases from left to right whereas the spatial correlation length of ca stays constant therefore fig 5 shows the impact of the varying standard deviation of ca on the kr curves it is observed that the standard deviation of surface ca affects the relative permeability of scco2 krg more significantly than the relative permeability of water krw this was because despite of the different standard deviations in ca in all these simulation scenarios the average ca was the same and equal to 29 which suggested that the bentheimer sandstone surface was predominantly strongly water wet therefore in all these scenarios water formed a relatively thin coating near the rock surfaces and flowed within this 2d well connected water layer as a consequence the connectivity and effective permeability of water depended primarily on the average ca of the entire rock surface and was relatively insensitive to the local heterogeneity i e standard deviation in the rock surface ca conversely scco2 flowed mainly in pore centers because the rock surface was strongly water wet a relatively large standard deviation in surface ca may cause a small portion of local ca values larger than 90 leading to a co2 wet surface locally if these co2 wet surfaces occur in relatively small pores they might noticeably increase the resistance to the overall scco2 flow and hence reduce the connectivity and effective permeability of the scco2 phase which explains the more significant oscillations in the krg curves when the standard deviation of ca increased it is also observed that when water saturation approached zero and one the variations in krw and krg were not noticeable when the standard deviation of ca changed this was because when the water saturation was at 0 88 scco2 was at the residual saturation and immobilized and it was actually single phase flow of water that occurred in the pore space similarly when the water saturation was at 0 12 water was at the irreducible saturation and immobilized and the flow was single phase flow of scco2 in the pore space in either case the flow in the pore space was approximately equivalent to single phase flow and therefore there was no moving dynamic interfaces between water and scco2 as a consequence the heterogeneity i e standard deviation of ca on the rock surfaces had no impacts on krw and krg when the water saturation approached zero and one to accurately quantify the impact of the standard deviation of ca on the multiphase flow properties the standard deviations between the corey model fitted kr curves were calculated as a function of water saturation and illustrated in fig 6 a specifically the curve of sd of krg with l 35 pixels in fig 6a was calculated based on the three corey model fitted krg curves shown in fig 5a which were for the ca standard deviations of 2 8 and 19 separately at a specific water saturation the standard deviation of the three corey model fitted krg values was calculated and then plotted as a function of water saturation the same method was used to plot the other five curves in fig 6a which illustrates the impact of the varying ca standard deviation on the oscillation of the kr curves fig 6a confirms that the variation i e standard deviation in the krg curves was more significant than that of the krw curves when the ca standard deviation changed from 2 to 9 and then 18 furthermore it was confirmed that when the water saturation approached the two end points the variation in the kr curves was relatively small because the flow in the pore space was approximately equivalent to single phase flow when the water saturation was near the two end points in addition it was clear that when the ca standard deviation changed from 2 to 9 and then 18 the variation in the kr curves was more significant with a longer spatial correlation length this observation suggested that a longer spatial correlation length in ca distribution 105 pixel lengths enhanced the influence of the increasing ca standard deviation on the kr curves compared to shorter spatial correlation lengths i e 35 and 71 pixel lengths this finding is similar to a prior study chen et al 2013 which showed that a large spatial correlation length in a gaussian random field associated with a large standard deviation of the random variable led to the highest uncertainty in the system output to clearly illustrate the role of the spatial correlation length of ca when the standard deviation of ca varied the standard deviations of the model fitted relative permeability were averaged over the entire water saturation range from 0 2 through 0 8 shown in fig 6a and then plotted as a function of the corresponding correlation length as illustrated in fig 6b fig 6b confirms that the variation in the krg curves was more significant than that of the krw curves when the ca standard deviation increased from 2 to 9 and then 18 also it was confirmed that a longer spatial correlation length in ca distribution enhanced the influence of the increasing ca standard deviation on the kr curves 3 3 effect of the spatial correlation length of contact angle in this section the effect of the spatial correlation length of cas on the changes of the relative permeability of scco2 and water was investigated fig 7 demonstrates the impact of the ca s spatial correlation length on fluid distribution at the pore scale the ca standard deviation was equal to the reference value 9 in both scenarios whereas the ca s spatial correlation length in one scenario was reduced to 35 pixel lengths from the reference value 71 pixel lengths and it was increased to 105 pixel lengths in the other scenario as described in the second column of table 2 the water saturation was 0 55 in both scenarios and the main flow direction was perpendicular to these 2d cross sections because of the relatively low ca standard deviation 9 the rock surface cas in both scenarios were primarily close to their average value 29 and thus all smaller than 90 it was noticeable that the spatial distribution of ca had a spotted pattern in fig 7a due to its shorter ca correlation length conversely fig 7b illustrated a longer similarity length with respect to the ca spatial distribution because of its longer ca correlation length the longer ca correlation length can cause most of the inner wall area in a pore to become less water wet thereby attracting a significant amount of scco2 to move into this pore as demonstrated by the red circle in fig 7b fig 8 illustrates the role of the varying spatial correlation length of ca on the kr curves similarly the scattered data points are the steady state relative permeabilities measured by the lb multiphase flow model in the primary imbibition process whereas the curves are the corey model fitting columns 1 2 and 3 represent the parameter values listed in the three columns in table 2 in each column of table 2 the spatial correlation length of ca distribution increases from top to bottom whereas the standard deviation of ca stays constant therefore fig 8 demonstrates the impact of the varying spatial correlation length of ca distribution on the kr curves it is observed that the spatial correlation length of ca distribution affected krg more significantly than krw which is similar to the finding observed in fig 5 with the correlation lengths investigated i e 35 71 and 105 pixels most of the surface cas were smaller than 90 similar to the scenarios discussed in section 3 2 water had the tendency to coat the solid surface and form a well connected 2d water film therefore the connectivity and effective permeability of water were insensitive to the local heterogeneity of cas while the standard deviation determines the fine scale heterogeneity of cas the spatial correlation length controls the large scale heterogeneity of cas because water flows in the 2d well connected water film coating on the rock surface the relative permeability of water is insensitive to both the fine scale and large scale heterogeneities of cas compared to the relative permeability of scco2 it is also observed that when water saturation approached zero and one the variations in krw and krg were not noticeable when the spatial correlation length of ca distribution changed this can be explained using the same rationale that when the pore fluid distribution approached the irreducible water saturation or the residual scco2 saturation the flow in the pore space was approximately equivalent to single phase flow and therefore there was no moving interfaces between water and scco2 as a consequence the increasing spatial correlation length of ca distribution had no impacts on the krw and krg curves to accurately quantify the impact of the spatial correlation length of ca distribution on the multiphase flow properties the standard deviations between the corey model fitted kr curves were calculated as a function of water saturation and illustrated in fig 9 a specifically the curve of sd of krg with sd of ca 2 in fig 9a was calculated based on the three corey model fitted krg curves shown in fig 8a which were for the spatial correlation lengths of 35 71 and 105 pixels separately at a specific water saturation the standard deviation between the three corey model fitted krg values was calculated and then plotted as a function of water saturation the same method was used to plot the other five curves in fig 9a which illustrates the impact of the varying spatial correlation length of ca distribution on the oscillation of the kr curves fig 9a confirms that the variation i e standard deviation in the krg curves was more significant than that of the krw curves when the spatial correlation length of ca distribution changed from 35 to 71 and then 105 pixels it was also confirmed that when the water saturation approached the two end points the variation in the kr curves was relatively small because the flow in the pore space was approximately single phase flow when the water saturation was near the two end points in addition it was clear that when the spatial correlation length of ca distribution changed from 35 to 71 and then 105 pixels the variation in the kr curves was more significant with a larger standard deviation of ca this observation suggested that a larger standard deviation of ca i e 18 enhanced the influence of the increasing correlation length of ca on the kr curves compared to the smaller standard deviations of ca i e 2 and 9 this finding associated with the observation from fig 6 implies that a relatively large standard deviation of rock surface ca combined with a relatively long spatial correlation length of ca distribution will lead to relatively large variations in the kr curves of the rock in fig 9a the standard deviations between the model fitted relative permeability were averaged over the entire water saturation range from 0 2 through 0 8 and then plotted as a function of the corresponding standard deviation of ca as illustrated in fig 9b fig 9b confirms that the variation in the krg curves was more significant than that of the krw curves when the spatial correlation length of ca distribution increased from 35 to 71 and then 105 pixels also it was confirmed that a larger standard deviation of ca enhanced the influence of the increasing correlation length of ca distribution on the kr curves 4 discussion and conclusions this study investigated the role of the spatial heterogeneity and correlation length of surface cas on the relative permeability in a scco2 brine sandstone system the heterogeneous surface ca distributions used in lb two phase flow modeling were generated based on the statistical information obtained from in situ micro ct measurements of surface cas in a bentheimer sandstone after scco2 flooding the micro ct scanning found that the pore scale ca distribution on rock surfaces followed a log normal distribution associated with a spatial correlation length based on the statistical information from the ct scanning a gaussian random field was used to model surface ca distributions that have desired standard deviations and spatial correlation lengths the standard deviation and correlation length of ca distribution were then adjusted within a certain range of values for comprehensive sensitivity analyses to study their combined effects on the two phase flow properties in the porous medium the lb simulation results showed that even with the same initial fluid distribution the changes in the statistical properties of surface ca distribution led to noticeably different pore scale fluid distributions in the steady state two phase flow process which consequently caused the variation in the macroscopic relative permeability the surface wettability heterogeneity i e standard deviation of surface ca had a lesser effect on the relative permeability of the wetting fluid but a more noticeable impact on the relative permeability of the non wetting fluid the corey model was used to fit the lb simulated relative permeability of water and scco2 and the fitting results illustrated that the variations in the relative permeability curves for both water and scco2 increased as the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of ca increased these findings suggested that a relatively large standard deviation of rock surface ca combined with a relatively long spatial correlation length of ca distribution led to relatively large variations in the relative permeability curves of the rock this study illustrated that numerical modeling of multiphase flow and relative permeability in a natural rock using the assumption of homogeneous surface wettability may lead to errors the combined impact of both the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of rock surface cas should be accounted for to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that explored the spatial correlation lengths associated with ca distributions on sandstone surfaces and comprehensively investigated the roles of both spatial variation and correlation length of ca on two phase flow properties in 3d porous media in this study the spatial correlation length of surface ca in a bentheimer sandstone sample was found at least two times larger than the average pore size this finding suggested the necessity to account for the impact of relatively long correlation lengths that span over several pore diameters on the multiphase flow properties in 3d porous media additionally the lb multiphase flow model optimized by state of the art multicore cpu gpu parallel computing proved to be a powerful tool in the study of the interplays and combined effects of the spatial variation and correlation length of surface ca because in practice it is extremely challenging to fabricate 3d porous media that have desired and
