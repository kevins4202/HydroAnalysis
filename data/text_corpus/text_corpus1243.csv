6215,karst systems can be generally characterised by their high hydrological heterogeneities related mainly to highly variable permeabilities which can significantly change over small spatial scales this makes tracing and quantification of water flow pathways an extremely demanding task in this study we present an analysis of hydrological characteristics of a complex karst system the ljubljanica river catchment in central slovenia spatially distributed data on stable isotope composition δ 18o δ 2h of precipitation as inputs and of several karst springs sinks as outputs were obtained these data were used to identify spatial and seasonal patterns and hydrological behaviour of the karst system in contrasting hydrological conditions the intensive mixing of continental and mediterranean air masses over the ljubljanica river catchment makes the precipitation source identification difficult however the results of the precipitation isotopic composition analysis indicate a spatial pattern that could be recognised also in the δ 18o and δ 2h values of the karst springs and sinks along the prevailing karst conduits the spatial differences in the δ 18o and δ 2h values decreased the mean transit time mtt estimates using δ 18o or δ 2h as tracers were similar with those for the main karst conduits and tributaries ranging between 0 34 and 0 74 years such a relatively short mtt could be expected for karst catchments without extensive deep groundwater storage the fraction of young water fyw for the whole catchment was 0 28 meaning that more than one quarter of the total discharge was younger than approximately 2 3 months assuming that the catchment transit time is described by exponential distribution small differences in the mtt over different parts of the karst catchment area might indicate intensive mixing and homogenisation of water along the underground conduits however the catchment s homogenisation strongly depends on the preceding hydrological conditions the differences in the isotope composition can be identified during low flow conditions which might indicate the dominant influence of the local recharge of the karst springs keywords karst catchment tracers stable isotopes mean transit time young water fraction 1 introduction in many parts of the world karst aquifers are important freshwater resources and their management requires improved quantitative understanding of the hydrologic functioning of karst catchments in order to develop water resources protection determine the potential impact of contaminants and plan management strategies this is becoming increasingly important in light of future climate change related alterations of precipitation patterns which will affect the transport of water and solutes through karst hydrogeological systems and consequently strongly influence water availability for different uses as water scarcity is an increasingly pressing issue in many karst areas hartmann et al 2014 chen et al 2018 generally the hydrological behaviour of a karst system can be characterised by temporally and spatially highly variable processes of recharge diffuse and concentrated storage in epikarst vadose and phreatic zones and flow type diffuse and along preferential conduits white 2002 perrin et al 2003 ford and williams 2007 karst catchments as hydrological systems express a high degree of complexity and heterogeneity in the karst aquifer structure which can be roughly characterised by the processes of concentrated and diffuse infiltration predominant conduit flow and rapid flow that can reach long distances in the underground conduit systems ravbar et al 2012 basic hydrological characteristics of karst systems are conceptually relatively well known however the role of particular hydrological processes and their dominance during different hydrological conditions are often difficult to quantify high karstic hydrogeological heterogeneity poses an additional challenge as it restricts spatial extrapolation of many small scale processes to larger catchment scales biogeochemical cycles contaminant transport and chemical weathering are regulated by the speed at which precipitation travels through landscapes until it reaches streams regional and temporal variations of isotopic fractionation because of latitudinal continental altitude and seasonal effects kendall and doctor 2004 urresti estala et al 2015 can help to define flow patterns streamflow is a mixture of young and old precipitation but proportions of these young and old components are usually rather unknown in view of the unique hydrological characteristics the study of karst aquifers requires specialized investigation methods goldscheider and drew 2007 a wide array of groundwater physico chemical parameters was used to obtain information on the hydrological behaviour of karst catchments however hydrochemical data rarely deliver straightforward and unambiguous interpretations on karst catchment functioning during non stationary contrasting hydrological conditions in this respect naturally occurring environmental isotopes e g 18o 2h provide additional information about specific underground flow paths and transit times of water within karst catchments such information is crucial in our endeavour to characterize different components of the transit time distribution mcdonnell et al 2010 several studies have applied environmental isotopes of water to estimate mixing between source components in karst aquifers provided some insight into karst aquifer recharge characteristics under different flow conditions and tried to estimate the mean transit time mtt in karst catchments e g maloszewski et al 2002 perrin et al 2003 doctor et al 2006 hu et al 2015 water isotopes are excellent conservative tracers as they are naturally injected in a diffuse way over the whole catchment during rainfall events mcguire and mcdonnell 2008 they are considered perfect tracers for hydrological applications as these elements belong to the water molecules themselves and are not chemically reactive within the environment at ambient temperatures gat 1996 stable isotopes 18o 2h vary in the rain signal both on a seasonal scale and during a recharge event and keep a stable ratio in the karst aquifer maloszewski et al 2002 in a karst catchment artificial tracers are usually injected into sinkholes and they supply information mainly on preferential flow paths along subsurface conduits on the other hand spatial heterogeneity in stable isotope inputs e g precipitation and outputs hydrogeological characteristics across the catchments has been along with time heterogeneity changing hydrological conditions widely recognised as a fundamental problem in stable isotope applications in the catchment hydrology literature further selection and interpretation of mixing models in view of catchment characteristics involving a limited number of tracers is often ambiguous kirchner 2016a despite of their limitations stable isotopes can be used to improve our understanding of complex heterogeneous hydrological systems such as karst catchments hartmann et al 2014 in this study stable isotopes δ 18o δ 2h have been monitored to improve our understanding of the hydrological functioning of a complex karst system of the ljubljanica river in slovenia we investigated spatial heterogeneity of stable isotopes in precipitation inputs and the dynamics of recharge from different parts of the catchment the goals of this study were to 1 obtain insight into spatial and temporal variability of precipitation stable isotope inputs over the studied ljubljanica river catchment with a climate characterised as a transitional area 2 improve understanding of karst aquifer behaviour during diverse hydrological conditions using stable isotope measurements 3 assess the mean transit times mtts of water and the fraction of young water fyw in different parts of the karst catchment and evaluate how stable isotope analysis agrees with the results of other studies where different artificial tracers were used 2 study area the investigated ljubljanica river catchment located in south and central slovenia can be characterised as a complex hydrologically highly heterogeneous karst catchment fig 1 the catchment covers an area of approx 1880 km2 the altitude ranges between 300 m a s l and 1800 m a s l the ljubljanica river is a typical karst river with its karst hinterland consisting of significantly fissured porous carbonate rock mainly limestone and dolomite only the northern lowland part of the catchment consists of non carbonate rocks because of the complex hydrogeological structure of the area surface river flows are generally short rivers and streams sink underground several times along the main flow paths consequently the ljubljanica river is known as a river of different names in the upper part of the ljubljanica karst catchment the unica and malenščica springs form the unica river its catchment can be divided into three hydrologically connected parts i e the javorniki pivka and cerknica parts of the catchment the central area javorniki part is the karst massif of javorniki and snežnik which borders the eastern side of the valley of the pivka river and its tributaries pivka part and the western side of a string of karst poljes the biggest of these is cerknica polje that are distributed gradually in the southeast northwest direction cerknica part the pivka valley is covered by very poorly permeable eocene flysch draining the surface network of the pivka river which sinks into the world famous postojna cave then follows the so called pivka cave stream of the planina cave and emerges again as the unica spring the pivka cave stream is joined underground by the rak cave stream which collects groundwater mainly from the areas of karst poljes in the cerknica part of the catchment petrič 2010 the majority of the catchment belongs to the javorniki karst plateau composed of well karstified jurassic and cretaceous limestones with karst fissure porosity the carbonate rocks are more than 1000 m thick and the depth of the unsaturated zone can reach up to several hundred meters ravbar et al 2012 in the javorniki part the underground flow is dominant while surface streams are also present in the other two parts they are recharged mainly by karst waters and after appearing as surface flows they sink underground again downstream of the unica and malenščica springs the unica river flows over the planina polje sinks again and re emerges as the ljubljanica river at several springs the two main ones are the retovje and močilnik springs and the ljubljanica river karstic tributaries such as the bistra spring these springs extend along the non carbonate lowland and carbonate rock higher terrain contact at the south western border of the ljubljana marshes the hydrogeology and underground connections of this particular karst system have been the subject of several studies in the past e g gams 1970 gospodarič and habič 1976 pezdič in urbanc 1987 gabrovšek and turk 2010 blatnik et al 2017 to the west there are the hotenjka and logaščica sinking streams which also recharge the springs of the ljubljanica river recent hydrogeological and hydrological studies focused on the hydraulic connections and hydrodynamic behaviour of the aquifer system using natural and artificial tracers e g kogovšek 2001 kogovsek 2004 gabrovšek et al 2010 kogovšek and petrič 2010 ravbar et al 2012 petrič et al 2018 however the study area has not yet been investigated in detail by stable isotope measurements the use of various artificial tracers revealed the relations between various contribution areas to the springs of the planina polje in general the malenščica spring is recharged mainly from the cerknica direction and the javorniki karst aquifer and there is no direct connection with the ponor of the pivka river sinking in the postojna cave during high streamflows when discharges of the malenščica spring are above approx 6 m3 s inflows from the cerknica part dominate this is related to high water levels in the intermittent cerknica lake on average the water stays in cerknica lake for 260 days year and high water levels are present 17 days year kranjc 1985 then the outflow from the malenščica spring is constrained and the rak cave stream in the planina cave acts as an overflow the rak cave stream is recharged from both the cerknica and javorniki parts and the pivka cave stream from the javorniki and the pivka parts ravbar et al 2012 long term mean daily discharge from the whole studied karst catchment is 24 m3 s the discharge can drop to approx 1 m3 s during prolonged dry periods in view of its climate the ljubljanica river catchment is a transitional area between sub mediterranean and temperate continental climates oceanic climate subtype cfb according to the köppen geiger climate classification system the prevailing direction of wet air masses is sw to ne which is also reflected in spatially declining rainfall sums in this direction however highly variable wet air mass directions and rainfall formation processes can be observed in different seasons krklec et al 2018 or even during particular rainfall events highest rainfall sums can be observed along the orographic barriers of the snežnik karst plateau rainfall sums exceeding 3000 mm year and along the javorniki karst plateau rainfall totals exceeding 2000 mm year the long term mean annual rainfall in the north eastern part of the ljubljanica river catchment is approx 1400 mm year and the mean air temperature is between 8 and 10 c the mean monthly reference evapotranspiration calculated for the period 1971 2000 using the penman monteith equation at meteorological station postojna rainfall sampling point p7 fig 1 is 15 mm for the winter months december to february and 112 mm for the summer months june to august the long term mean annual reference evapotranspiration is 720 mm 3 methods 3 1 sampling and analysis precipitation samples for stable isotope analysis δ 18o δ 2h were collected monthly from may 2016 to may 2018 at 7 meteorological stations operated by the slovenian environmental agency arso shown in fig 1 precipitation data were obtained by onset rg2 m tipping bucket rain gauges and ott pluvio2 l weighting rain gauges the rainfall samples for the stable isotope values analysis were collected daily at stations p1 p5 p6 and p7 and transferred to a larger bottle that was stored in a dark cold place and replaced every month the rainfall samples at stations p2 p3 and p4 were collected in plastic containers installed in approx 0 5 m deep trenches covered by brick plate and grass turf to minimize temperature variations and prevent evaporation the plastic containers were emptied each month the position of precipitation collectors assured relatively good spatial coverage of heterogeneity in precipitation input amounts water samples at karst river sinks ponors and springs were collected at 14 stations covering all main ljubljanica river flowpaths and its main tributaries fig 1 stream water samples were initially collected in august 2016 and january 2017 during the 1 year period i e from june 2017 to may 2018 the stream water samples were collected on a monthly basis water samples at stations s9 stržen stream and s10 cerkniščica stream were collected only occasionally during middle flow conditions due to the intermittent character of both streams during dry periods and the formation of the intermittent cerknica lake during wet hydrological conditions when the lake water body joins and overflows both sampling points at streamwater sampling locations we measured water temperature t ph and electrical conductivity ec using hydrolab ms5 and the hach pocket pro multi 2 tester at most sampling locations the discharge is monitored as part of the hydrological monitoring operated by arso the precipitation sampling locations and the streamwater sampling locations with some descriptive parameters are summarized in tables 1 and 2 respectively because precipitation and streamflow rates varied considerably during the observed period the tracer samples were weighted by its associate volume monthly precipitation amount and mean monthly discharge at streamwater sampling locations where the discharge data are not available the mean monthly discharge data from the nearest sampling station with known discharges were used as an approximation for assigning weights the isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen was measured after equilibration with co2 2 h and h2 6 h at 18 c respectively in the dhoeq48 equilibration unit the measurement was done using the finnigan mat delta plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer results are reported as the conventional delta δ notation δ 18o and δ 2h i e the relative deviation of the heavy to light isotope ratio of the sample from that of the standard vsmow expressed in per mil in house reference materials calibrated vs vsmow2 and slap2 international reference standards were used to calibrate the measurements the accuracy was checked using the usgs45 and usgs47 certified reference materials as controls randomly distributed in each batch the measurement uncertainty determined as long term deviation of control materials from their respective certified δ values was 0 05 for δ 18o and 0 7 for δ 2h 3 2 calculation and data analysis the monitoring of the precipitation isotope characteristics at 7 locations assured good spatial coverage over the studied catchment the spatial variability of monthly precipitation sums and the monthly precipitation isotopic composition over the sub catchment areas of selected karst springs and sinks was considered by using thiessen polygons the assessment of karst sub catchment areas extension was based on previous natural and artificial tracer dye tests done mainly by the karst research institute in some parts of the ljubljanica river catchment where additional data from tracers tests were not available the karst sub catchment areas were assessed using surface topography analysis given the basic data set available in terms of temporal monthly resolution the sine wave method was used which compares the amplitude of seasonal variations in δ 18o and δ 2h in precipitation and streamwater and uses the degree of damping to estimate the transit time the seasonal sine wave model for description of δ 18o time series was defined as rodgers et al 2005 1 δ 18 o δ 18 o mean a pors c o s c t θ where δ 18o and δ 18omean are the modelled and the mean annual measured δ 18o values respectively ap or s are the calculated fitted annual amplitudes of precipitation and of streamwater respectively c is the radial frequency of annual fluctuations 0 017247 rad day t is the time in days after the start of the sampling period and θ is the phase lag the same method was used for the δ 2h values for fitting the sinusoidal cycle of precipitation and streamwater δ 18o and δ 2h the iteratively reweighted least squares irls regression was used in order to limit the influence of outliers the shape of the travel time distribution ttd and its corresponding mean travel time mtt reflect storage and mixing processes in the catchment kirchner et al 2001 hrachowitz et al 2010a kirchner 2016b estimates of ttd and mtt have been in the literature correlated with a wide range of catchment characteristics e g mcguire et al 2005 soulsby and tetzlaff 2008 tetzlaff et al 2009 hrachowitz et al 2010b asano and uchida 2012 since a prevalence of flow paths with short transit times can be generally expected for karst aquifers e g along preferential conduits epikarst fissures the exponential distribution of the ttd was assumed the mtt for the exponential model is estimated by the following equation 2 mtt c 1 a s a p 2 1 0 5 where ap is the amplitude of precipitation as is the amplitude of the streamwater outputs and c is the radial frequency of annual fluctuations as defined in eq 1 past studies using different artificial tracers revealed that the relations between various contribution areas of the observed springs are strongly dependent on temporal hydrologic conditions petrič 2010 ravbar et al 2012 therefore to make a general differentiation in the hydrological conditions at the study area we considered monthly periods when the discharges at the sampling points were lower than the long term mean discharge values under low flow conditions whereas discharges higher than the mean values were denoted as high flow conditions normally distributed data were analysed using the t test for testing the differences in the measured parameters at different locations a significance level of 0 05 was selected 4 results 4 1 δ 18o and δ 2h values of precipitation the precipitation δ 18o and δ 2h values in monthly samples indicate continental effects a general decreasing trend of heavy isotope content in the sw ne direction this is the main direction of the wet air masses approaching the study area from the mediterranean the highest δ 18o and δ 2h values weighted mean 7 1 and 45 respectively were observed at rainfall station p6 ilirska bistrica located few kilometres outside the catchment area to the south the lowest δ 18o and δ 2h values weighted mean 8 7 and 57 were observed at station p5 babno polje the differences between weighted mean annual δ 18o and δ 2h values at stations positioned in the north eastern part of the catchment p1 p5 were rather small differences in δ 18o values below 0 4 and in δ 2h values below 3 interestingly the calculated δ 18o gradient for the neighbouring stations p2 dvor and p3 črni vrh positioned at different elevations was only 0 2 for the elevation difference of approx 450 m which is lower than the elevation gradient of 0 24 to 0 3 per 100 m reported for the n adriatic area vreča et al 2006 but still within the limits published by windhorst et al 2013 the differences between some neighbouring precipitation stations e g p1 p2 and p3 p4 and p5 were not statistically significant with the selected significance level of 0 05 for both δ 18o and δ 2h values the records of δ 18o and δ 2h values of precipitation have a seasonal cycle that is in phase with monthly air temperatures distinctive seasonal variations were observed at all stations with lower δ 18o and δ 2h values in winter the lowest values were measured during the cold and snowy february 2018 16 7 and 122 respectively at station p5 the highest values were measured in the summer of 2017 2 8 and 12 5 respectively at station p6 fig 2 shows the seasonal trend of the δ 18o and δ 2h values for the two most contrasting stations p6 and p5 the δ 18o and δ 2h values could not be measured at any of the precipitation stations in december 2016 when there was no precipitation larger seasonal variations in δ 18o and δ 2h were observed at station p5 12 7 and 101 3 compared to station p6 7 4 and 56 4 respectively the differences in the δ 18o and δ 2h seasonal amplitudes can be related to higher mean monthly air temperature variations at station p5 25 1 c compared to the air temperature variation at station p6 23 6 c whereas the summer δ 18o and δ 2h values at both stations are relatively similar the highest differences can be observed in the winter period when the average differences in the mean monthly air t between the two stations were higher 3 5 c compared to the difference in summer months 2 7 c the statistically significant pearson correlation coefficient r2 0 6 and p value 0 001 was calculated between the mean monthly air t and monthly precipitation δ 18o and δ 2h values for all precipitation sampling locations the pearson correlation coefficient between monthly δ 18o and δ 2h values in precipitation and the monthly amount of precipitation was relatively low r2 0 1 and not statistically significant at the selected significance level of 0 05 the seasonal variability of precipitation isotopic composition is evident when dividing all the monthly data p1 p7 into seasons i e spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february fig 3 left while the values of the spring and autumn months are in the middle of the scatter the most and least negative values of the isotopic composition of precipitation can be seen for winter and summer months however the scatter in the seasonal data is relatively high the relation between δ 18o and δ 2h for all precipitation sampling stations is shown in fig 3 right together with the global meteoric water line gmwl the local meteorological water lines lmwl at the precipitation sampling points are close to the gmwl the orthogonal regression equations between the isotopic values of individual monthly samples representing lmwls are summarized in table 3 the pearson correlation coefficients r between δ 2h and δ 18o values are high for all stations r 0 95 and all lmwls are close to the gmwl there is no evident change in the lmwl slope but there is an increase in the lmwl intercept with station elevation the only exception being station p6 where considerably higher δ 18o and δ 2h values were observed compared to other stations the monthly deuterium excess d excess ranged between 17 station p3 and 7 station p7 highest d excess values were generally observed in autumn october and november and the lowest values in the late spring and summer may to july the highest mean annual d excess value 13 was at station p3 črni vrh the precipitation sampling location positioned at the highest elevation 4 2 δ 18o and δ 2h values of karst springs and sinks following the spatial patterns of the precipitation δ 18o and δ 2h values the highest streamwater δ 18o values weighted mean values 7 7 and 49 respectively were measured at sampling point s14 sink to postojna cave and the lowest streamwater δ 18o and δ 2h values weighted mean values 8 8 and 57 respectively were measured at sampling point s7 malenščica spring the discharge weighted δ 18o and δ 2h values table 2 at the sampling stations following the two prevailing karst conduit directions the pivka river branch of the catchment following sampling point direction s14 s6 s8 the cerknica branch of the catchment following sampling point direction s9 s10 s11 s13 s7 s8 indicate the differences between the sampling points located in the headwater part of the catchment e g differences in the δ 18o and δ 2h values between sampling points s9 s10 and s14 the differences in the streamwater δ 18o and δ 2h values at sampling stations s1 s3 downstream of the sampling point s8 confluence of the two prevailing karst conduits are very small 0 2 for δ 18o and 2 for δ 2h values fig 4 shows the scatter plot of δ 18o vs δ 2h values during sampling campaigns in august 2017 and december 2017 in august 2017 the lowest mean monthly discharges were measured during the entire sampling period at the unica hasberg water station sampling point s8 positioned downstream of the confluence of the unica river and the malenščica stream sampling point s7 fig 1 whose catchment area covers approx 750 km2 the average daily discharge was only 3 3 m3 s during the december 2017 sampling campaign the highest mean monthly discharge 77 2 m3 s in the sampling period was measured during low flow conditions the difference between sampling points shown in fig 4 is much higher compared to the difference between the sampling points that were collected during high flow conditions the differences between some neighbouring sampling stations e g s1 s2 and s3 s4 and s5 s11 and s12 were not statistically significant with the selected significance level of 0 05 for both δ 18o and δ 2h values when considering the whole dataset in the statistical analysis the ph ranging between 7 5 and 8 5 and ec ranging between 350 and 550 μs cm measurements did not show statistically significant differences between the analysed karst springs and sinks that would indicate a spatial pattern we noticed a general decrease of the ec values with increasing discharge the pearson correlation matrix calculated based on the δ 18o and δ 2h values for the low flow conditions is shown in table 4 high correlation for both δ 18o and δ 2h values is observed between some of the sampling points positioned along the prevailing karst conduit directions e g sampling stations s8 and s1 s2 s6 and s3 p value 0 01 on the other hand there is a low correlation between sampling point s14 the most headwater station along the pivka river karst conduit branch and other downstream sampling points e g s6 s7 there is a high correlation between sampling stations s1 s2 and s3 which might indicate the presence of a common local recharge of the karst springs during low flow conditions when the catchment s contribution from headwater parts to the ljubljanica river discharge becomes very small on the other hand the low correlation between sampling points s3 s4 and s5 for δ 18o values could indicate hydrological heterogeneities in the local recharge of the karst springs the hotenjka stream sampling point s4 and the logaščica stream sampling point s5 are both intermittent karst sinking streams which collect water mainly from local surface and near surface flows additionally the differences between the sampling stations s1 and s2 s4 and s5 s11 and s12 are not statistically significant with the selected significance level of 0 05 for both δ 18o and δ 2h values when considering only the data collected during low flow conditions high correlation was calculated for both δ 18o and δ 2h values between the sampling point located at the logaščica stream s5 and sampling point s14 the pivka stream these two sampling points are not hydrologically connected the relatively important influence of surface drainage is a common characteristic of both sampling points which is apparent from previous tracer experiments conducted in the catchment 4 3 seasonal δ 18o and δ 2h cycles and estimation of mtt the seasonal cycle in δ 18o and δ 2h values in precipitation and streamwater were used to assess mtt fig 5 shows the seasonal cycle at sampling points s3 and s14 i e the most downstream and headwater sampling points respectively together with the seasonal cycle in precipitation over the selected sampling points sub catchments the spatial distribution of seasonal variations in δ 18o and δ 2h values weighted by precipitation amounts was determined using the thiessen polygons over the sampling points sub catchment areas the mse for the regression models of the δ 18o cycle in precipitation over the selected sub catchment areas was between 0 4 sampling point s7 and 0 7 sampling point s1 for the δ 2h cycle in precipitation the regression model mse was between 2 station s1 and 3 station s14 the mse for the regression models of the δ 18o cycle in streamwater ranged between 0 1 station s5 and 0 2 station s13 for the δ 2h cycle in streamwater the mse was between 1 station s5 and 3 station s4 there was approximately a 1 month lag between the seasonal cycle in precipitation and streamflow the water mtts of the karst springs and ponors are shown in fig 6 the shortest mtts were calculated for stations s14 0 34 years using δ 18o and 0 41 years using δ 2h and s11 0 36 years using δ 18o and 0 39 years using δ 2h station s14 is the most headwater station located at the ponor into the postojna cave whereas station s11 is located at the spring of the rak stream the water mtts at other sampling locations are rather similar ranging generally between 0 5 and 0 8 years an increasing trend in the mtt of water could be noticed along the karst conduit system of the pivka branch connecting the sampling points s14 s6 mtt of 0 54 years using δ 18o and 0 63 years using δ 2h similar behavior could be observed for the cerknica branch of the karst conduit system s13 mtt of 0 51 years using δ 18o and 0 48 years using δ 2h s7 mtt of 0 74 years using δ 18o and 0 66 years using δ 2h mtts for the sampling points located at the ljubljanica river karst tributaries are rather similar s1 bistra stream mtt of 0 56 years using δ 18o and 0 54 years using δ 2h s4 hotenjka stream mtt of 0 57 years using δ 18o and 0 52 years using δ 2h and s5 logaščica stream mtt of 0 50 years using δ 18o and 0 64 years using δ 2h 5 discussion 5 1 δ 18o and δ 2h values of precipitation over the catchment and their relation to meteorological conditions precipitation is a major input component of water to the catchments understanding the formation and sources of precipitation in terms of its spatial and temporal variability is crucial for any catchment hydrology studies the isotopic composition of precipitation is strongly controlled by the precipitation formation processes therefore the precipitation stable isotope composition can be very useful in explaining the precipitation sources in view of weather conditions the ljubljanica river catchment is an area where intensive mixing of continental and mediterranean air masses takes place this makes precipitation source identification difficult recently krklec et al 2018 showed a dense and highly scattered distribution of locations from where air masses passed over the study area and collect moisture nearly half of the precipitation originated from continental sources recycled moisture and more than 40 originated from central and western mediterranean consequently the inter month variability in precipitation isotope composition can be high and might even disrupt the identification of the seasonal cycle other studies of precipitation isotope composition over the wider south western part of slovenia demonstrated the predominant influence of atlantic air masses in the area although the influence of mediterranean air masses could not be excluded their contribution to precipitation in ljubljana was estimated to be in the range 15 26 vreča et al 2008 additionally the seasonal variations in the d excess values indicate the influence of mediterranean air masses which are characteristic in the autumn and winter months when the mediterranean cyclogenesis prevails over the study area namely higher d excess values are characteristic for precipitation in the mediterranean area reaching up to 25 whereas d excess values around 10 are typical for atlantic air masses gat and carmi 1970 merlivat and jouzel 1979 lykoudis and argiriou 2007 vreča et al 2007 gat et al 2011 according to the results of precipitation isotopic composition analysis in this study most monthly d excess values most evidently in autumn are above 10 and might indicate the influence of mediterranean air masses over the region the lowest values were observed in late spring and summer months may to july this could indicate the evaporation process at high temperatures and low relative humidity conditions and possibly also partial evaporation from the rain gauges good correlation between δ 18o and δ 2h values of precipitation and the mean monthly air t shows that the temperature appears to be a major parameter controlling the behaviour of the precipitation isotopic composition in the region similarly as discussed by vreča et al 2006 spatial coverage of the precipitation sampling stations enabled us to obtain relatively good insight into the spatial distribution of δ 18o and δ 2h values they considerably decrease from station p6 mean weighted δ 18o and δ 2h values 7 1 and 45 respectively towards station p7 8 0 and 52 and p5 8 7 and 57 when wet air masses travel along the main sw ne direction over the high terrain of the javorniki ridge and the snežnik plateau fig 1 a further decrease in the precipitation δ 18o and δ 2h values towards the sampling point located in the northern part of the catchment is much smaller e g mean δ 18o values 8 6 and mean δ 2h values 56 at station p1 5 2 mtt in light of the catchment characteristics water transit time is widely recognised as one of the fundamental catchment descriptors that reveal information about storage flow pathways and source of water kirchner et al 2000 mcdonnell et al 2010 however most of the calculated mtts are exposed to problems related to a priori selection of the travel time distribution and the problem of aggregation in spatially heterogeneous systems as recently discussed by kirchner 2016a b very little guidance exists for catchment hydrologists on the use and interpretation of the transit time modelling approaches for complex catchment systems mcdonnell et al 2010 in complex karst catchments where spatial hydrogeological heterogeneity defines the temporal hydrological responses of the catchment to rainfall inputs and further the actual extent of the karst catchment areas the travel time estimation problem becomes even more pronounced additional uncertainty in mtt estimates could be related to the influence of isotopic fractionation due to evapotranspiration comparison of local meteoric water lines slopes for all precipitation stations table 1 with those of the karst springs and sinks table 2 shows no measurable effect of evaporation on the isotopic composition of the analysed water this is in line with the findings of krklec et al 2018 who analysed the contribution of local moisture to the precipitation in the postojna area station p7 and estimated that in the overall recycling of water the contribution of evaporation is minor compared to that of leaf transpiration which contributes water vapor to the atmosphere with an oxygen isotope composition equal to that of soil water farquhar et al 2007 furthermore riechelmann et al 2017 reported that evaporation in the soil epikarst and cave generated no significant imprint on drip water isotopic signature at a temperate european setting similarly domínguez villar et al 2018 compared the isotopic composition of precipitation and drip water in the postojna cave in 2009 and 2010 and found that the mean annual δ18o values of drip water at 9 sampling sites in the cave resembled those of annual weighted mean δ18o values of precipitation therefore in the studied catchment the potential effect of evapotranspiration on the isotopic composition of infiltrated water and consequently on the mtt estimates is in our view relatively limited and was not considered in the mtt calculations kirchner 2016a proposed an alternative catchment storage metrics the young water fraction fyw in streamflow as the proportion of the transit time distribution younger than the threshold age of streamflow tyw he demonstrated that seasonal tracer cycles as the ones used in our study predict the fyw in runoff from a heterogeneous mixture of sub catchments much more reliably compared to the widely used estimates of mtt which are exposed to aggregation bias that arises from strong nonlinearity in the relationship between the tracer cycle amplitude and mtt additionally the ttd used to assess the mtt is usually selected arbitrarily as in our case by selecting the exponential distribution as the real ttd for a particular heterogeneous catchment is unknown as an alternative approach kirchner 2016a showed that the amplitude ratio as ap nearly equals fyw not only in individual catchments but also in the combined runoff from heterogeneous landscapes which is characteristic for karst catchments the discharge weighted fyw for the streamwater sampling stations varies between 0 2 and 0 3 the estimated tyw for the exponential distribution is 0 19 years only the results for the fyw using δ 18o as a tracer are shown since the tyw values using the δ 2h as a tracer are very similar fig 7 shows the scatter plot of fyw vs the mean long term daily discharge at the selected sampling points decrease in the fyw vs the mean daily discharge can be observed however the relationship is not statistically significant with the selected significance level of 0 05 we might conclude that important proportions of the streamwater at the selected sampling points can be considered as young water small karst sub catchment areas e g headwater areas of sampling points s11 and s14 have higher fyw reaching up to 0 4 this agrees with the intermittent nature of the streams in this part of the ljubljanica karst catchment namely the pivka river sampling point s14 discharge is controlled also by the surface and near surface water currents from flysch areas for the rak stream sampling point s11 the contribution of the cerkniščica stream with its developed surface and subsurface drainage network in porous dolomite is substantial the fyw for the whole catchment was 0 28 meaning that more than one quarter of the total discharge was younger than approximately 2 3 months assuming that the catchment transit times are described using the exponential distribution our fyw results are within the range of young water fractions reported for rivers in mountainous regions in north america and central europe by jasechko et al 2016 in view of the travel times the young water could be related to the streamwater that follows well developed karst conduits and the diffuse discharge through fissured and fractured vadose zone of the karst catchments rapid and considerably variable flow velocities through conduit systems reaching from a few m h to several 100 m h are indicative of karst aquifers ford and williams 2007 kresic 2007 in the studied catchment the transport velocities observed by injecting artificial fluorescent tracers in periods of low discharges ravbar et al 2012 were among the lowest reported for the karst aquifers ranging between 5 and 22 m h through well developed karst conduits and 3 4 m h through the vadose zone with the dominant influence of a diffuse recharge however there were considerable differences in the travel velocities and also travel directions during different hydrological conditions for the selected sampling points along the main karst conduits the calculated mtts are rather similar the mean mtt is 0 54 years using δ 18o values and 0 52 years using δ 2h values and can be characterised as relatively short brkić et al 2018 calculated mtts ranging between 0 3 and 0 6 years for a well developed karst aquifer system in western croatia which belongs to the same dinaric area as the ljubljanica river catchment such short mtt values could be expected for karst catchments without extensive deep groundwater storage as is the case with the large karst part of the ljubljanica river catchment the most headwater sampling points s11 and s14 have shorter mtts the contribution of the pivka river upstream of the sink to the postojna cave is small during low flow conditions the headwater part of the catchment along the pivka branch of the karst conduit system could become temporarily disconnected from the downstream part of the catchment e g sampling point s6 which is also indicated by the low correlation between sampling points s14 and s6 during low flow conditions table 4 similarly the hydrological disconnection can be indicated through the low correlation between the headwater sampling point s11 and other sampling points e g sampling points s6 and s7 for both δ 18o and δ 2h values namely the streamwater at sampling point s11 is mainly fed from the intermittent cerknica lake area during middle to high flow conditions large proportions of the observed water flux that appears to have very short mtts poses a potential risk to the water quality of the karst springs in the case of surface contamination by considering the long term average daily discharge at the selected sampling points where discharge was measured and the mtt was calculated theoretically the total water storage in the karst aquifers can be estimated as shown in fig 8 the storage of the two upstream branches sampling point s14 pivka branch and sampling point s11 cerknica branch is approx 50 106 m3 whereas the total storage downstream to the confluence of the main three hydrological parts sampling point s8 is 470 106 m3 the total storage from the studied part of the karst catchment is approx 550 106 m3 sampling points s1 s2 s3 however as the karst massif is also drained by several small springs the total volume of water is somewhat larger than the volume calculated in this study the rather small differences in the mtts over the catchment area might suggest intensive mixing and homogenisation of the water along the prevailing underground flowpaths the mixing and homogenisation processes might be indicated also by generally statistically insignificant differences in ph and ec values between the sampled karst springs and sinks positioned along the prevailing karst conduits on the other hand the contribution of local recharge during low flow conditions is indicated by the high scatter in stable isotope values during low flow conditions fig 4 the study of solute transport processes in the studied catchment by kogovšek and petrič 2014 indicates an important role of the epikarst layer as the most important storage layer in the study area however the role of the karst vadose zone storage is significantly influenced by the preceding hydrological conditions the local recharge could be amplified by intensive precipitation infiltration through the epikarst zone in the central part of the catchment where the surface stream network is scarce during prolonged dry periods some relatively large parts of the catchment could become hydrologically isolated which is indicated by the scatter during the low flows in fig 4 in general longer input and output data records produce more reliable estimates of the transit time distribution mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 in our case the calculated mtts and storage volumes are based on two years of precipitation and one year of karst springs sinks monitoring which raises the question of the mtt estimates reliability as discussed by hassan 2003 the key to the successful validation process is the use of a diverse set of tests that should be designed to evaluate a diverse set of aspects related to the modelled processes the differences in the calculated mtt values between neighbouring karst springs s6 s7 and s14 generally agree well with the results of artificial tracers applications presented by ravbar et al 2012 the longest delay in the artificial tracer detection was observed at station s7 which has according to our results the longest mtt as artificial tracers are generally injected into preferential flow paths the flow properties of the conduit system related to short transit times and high flow velocities can be investigated however these tracers omit the fissured porous matrix of the aquifer which plays an important role with respect to water storage in karst lauber and goldscheider 2014 in view of the mtt calculation reliability significant variations in the δ 18o and δ 2h values observed in precipitation samples over w slovenia can lead to considerable deviations from the sinusoidal seasonal pattern as reported by krklec et al 2018 since the δ 18o and δ 2h variability in precipitation is much higher than that in karst springs sinks samples we performed a sensitivity analysis where we analysed the influence of a changed precipitation seasonal amplitude on the calculated mtts e g a 25 change in seasonal precipitation amplitude caused a change of 0 10 to 0 20 years 0 16 years on average in the mtts based on the δ 18o values and a change of 0 12 to 0 17 years 0 14 years on average in the mtts calculated from the δ 2h values undoubtedly longer data series should be used to obtain more reliable results in view of contrasting hydrological conditions longer wet and dry periods which strongly influence the movement of water in the karst catchment 6 conclusion karst systems differ from other hydrological systems in terms of both their hydrogeological evolution and their hydrological behaviour they can be characterised by their high hydrological heterogeneities related to highly variable porosities which can significantly change over small spatial scales difficulties in collecting sufficient information about karst system properties in view of spatial heterogeneity and limited information on the discharge changes especially during contrasting hydrological conditions make the parametrisation and application of different hydrological analytical approaches highly uncertain therefore specific exploration techniques such as the use of artificial or natural tracers are needed to improve our understanding of the complex karst systems in this study we used spatially well distributed data on the rainfall δ 18o and δ 2h inputs and streamflow outputs to study the hydrological behaviour of the ljubljanica river karst catchment despite the changing influence of atlantic and mediterranean wet air masses over the studied catchment on the precipitation isotope composition the monthly precipitation isotope composition was relatively homogenous in the northern part of the catchment a transitional area over the high terrain of the javorniki ridge and the snežnik plateau in the central and south eastern part of the catchment could be noticed where the δ 18o and δ 2h values in precipitation considerably decreased the calculated mtts for the sampling points located along the main conduits and some major tributaries show relatively high hydrological homogenisation of the catchment in terms of the water travel times the catchment s homogenisation strongly depends on the preceding hydrological conditions differences in the isotope composition can be noticed during low flow conditions which might indicate the dominance of the local recharge of the karst springs additionally the fraction of the streamflow younger than the threshold age of 2 3 months is relatively high whereas the estimated mtts are relatively short the observed hydrological behaviour supports the previous studies where the dominance of the diffuse recharge through the vadose zone and the importance of the precipitation recharge by infiltration through the epikarst were assumed the obtained information offers a valuable integrated assessment of the differences in the runoff processes in the catchment and is extremely important for the planning of karst water resource strategies the short mtt indicates a high exposure of the water sources in the area to potential contamination this could become even more problematic in the case of soil or epikarst removal e g by quarrying as this would further reduce the important storage element of the studied karst system credit authorship contribution statement simon rusjan funding

6215,karst systems can be generally characterised by their high hydrological heterogeneities related mainly to highly variable permeabilities which can significantly change over small spatial scales this makes tracing and quantification of water flow pathways an extremely demanding task in this study we present an analysis of hydrological characteristics of a complex karst system the ljubljanica river catchment in central slovenia spatially distributed data on stable isotope composition δ 18o δ 2h of precipitation as inputs and of several karst springs sinks as outputs were obtained these data were used to identify spatial and seasonal patterns and hydrological behaviour of the karst system in contrasting hydrological conditions the intensive mixing of continental and mediterranean air masses over the ljubljanica river catchment makes the precipitation source identification difficult however the results of the precipitation isotopic composition analysis indicate a spatial pattern that could be recognised also in the δ 18o and δ 2h values of the karst springs and sinks along the prevailing karst conduits the spatial differences in the δ 18o and δ 2h values decreased the mean transit time mtt estimates using δ 18o or δ 2h as tracers were similar with those for the main karst conduits and tributaries ranging between 0 34 and 0 74 years such a relatively short mtt could be expected for karst catchments without extensive deep groundwater storage the fraction of young water fyw for the whole catchment was 0 28 meaning that more than one quarter of the total discharge was younger than approximately 2 3 months assuming that the catchment transit time is described by exponential distribution small differences in the mtt over different parts of the karst catchment area might indicate intensive mixing and homogenisation of water along the underground conduits however the catchment s homogenisation strongly depends on the preceding hydrological conditions the differences in the isotope composition can be identified during low flow conditions which might indicate the dominant influence of the local recharge of the karst springs keywords karst catchment tracers stable isotopes mean transit time young water fraction 1 introduction in many parts of the world karst aquifers are important freshwater resources and their management requires improved quantitative understanding of the hydrologic functioning of karst catchments in order to develop water resources protection determine the potential impact of contaminants and plan management strategies this is becoming increasingly important in light of future climate change related alterations of precipitation patterns which will affect the transport of water and solutes through karst hydrogeological systems and consequently strongly influence water availability for different uses as water scarcity is an increasingly pressing issue in many karst areas hartmann et al 2014 chen et al 2018 generally the hydrological behaviour of a karst system can be characterised by temporally and spatially highly variable processes of recharge diffuse and concentrated storage in epikarst vadose and phreatic zones and flow type diffuse and along preferential conduits white 2002 perrin et al 2003 ford and williams 2007 karst catchments as hydrological systems express a high degree of complexity and heterogeneity in the karst aquifer structure which can be roughly characterised by the processes of concentrated and diffuse infiltration predominant conduit flow and rapid flow that can reach long distances in the underground conduit systems ravbar et al 2012 basic hydrological characteristics of karst systems are conceptually relatively well known however the role of particular hydrological processes and their dominance during different hydrological conditions are often difficult to quantify high karstic hydrogeological heterogeneity poses an additional challenge as it restricts spatial extrapolation of many small scale processes to larger catchment scales biogeochemical cycles contaminant transport and chemical weathering are regulated by the speed at which precipitation travels through landscapes until it reaches streams regional and temporal variations of isotopic fractionation because of latitudinal continental altitude and seasonal effects kendall and doctor 2004 urresti estala et al 2015 can help to define flow patterns streamflow is a mixture of young and old precipitation but proportions of these young and old components are usually rather unknown in view of the unique hydrological characteristics the study of karst aquifers requires specialized investigation methods goldscheider and drew 2007 a wide array of groundwater physico chemical parameters was used to obtain information on the hydrological behaviour of karst catchments however hydrochemical data rarely deliver straightforward and unambiguous interpretations on karst catchment functioning during non stationary contrasting hydrological conditions in this respect naturally occurring environmental isotopes e g 18o 2h provide additional information about specific underground flow paths and transit times of water within karst catchments such information is crucial in our endeavour to characterize different components of the transit time distribution mcdonnell et al 2010 several studies have applied environmental isotopes of water to estimate mixing between source components in karst aquifers provided some insight into karst aquifer recharge characteristics under different flow conditions and tried to estimate the mean transit time mtt in karst catchments e g maloszewski et al 2002 perrin et al 2003 doctor et al 2006 hu et al 2015 water isotopes are excellent conservative tracers as they are naturally injected in a diffuse way over the whole catchment during rainfall events mcguire and mcdonnell 2008 they are considered perfect tracers for hydrological applications as these elements belong to the water molecules themselves and are not chemically reactive within the environment at ambient temperatures gat 1996 stable isotopes 18o 2h vary in the rain signal both on a seasonal scale and during a recharge event and keep a stable ratio in the karst aquifer maloszewski et al 2002 in a karst catchment artificial tracers are usually injected into sinkholes and they supply information mainly on preferential flow paths along subsurface conduits on the other hand spatial heterogeneity in stable isotope inputs e g precipitation and outputs hydrogeological characteristics across the catchments has been along with time heterogeneity changing hydrological conditions widely recognised as a fundamental problem in stable isotope applications in the catchment hydrology literature further selection and interpretation of mixing models in view of catchment characteristics involving a limited number of tracers is often ambiguous kirchner 2016a despite of their limitations stable isotopes can be used to improve our understanding of complex heterogeneous hydrological systems such as karst catchments hartmann et al 2014 in this study stable isotopes δ 18o δ 2h have been monitored to improve our understanding of the hydrological functioning of a complex karst system of the ljubljanica river in slovenia we investigated spatial heterogeneity of stable isotopes in precipitation inputs and the dynamics of recharge from different parts of the catchment the goals of this study were to 1 obtain insight into spatial and temporal variability of precipitation stable isotope inputs over the studied ljubljanica river catchment with a climate characterised as a transitional area 2 improve understanding of karst aquifer behaviour during diverse hydrological conditions using stable isotope measurements 3 assess the mean transit times mtts of water and the fraction of young water fyw in different parts of the karst catchment and evaluate how stable isotope analysis agrees with the results of other studies where different artificial tracers were used 2 study area the investigated ljubljanica river catchment located in south and central slovenia can be characterised as a complex hydrologically highly heterogeneous karst catchment fig 1 the catchment covers an area of approx 1880 km2 the altitude ranges between 300 m a s l and 1800 m a s l the ljubljanica river is a typical karst river with its karst hinterland consisting of significantly fissured porous carbonate rock mainly limestone and dolomite only the northern lowland part of the catchment consists of non carbonate rocks because of the complex hydrogeological structure of the area surface river flows are generally short rivers and streams sink underground several times along the main flow paths consequently the ljubljanica river is known as a river of different names in the upper part of the ljubljanica karst catchment the unica and malenščica springs form the unica river its catchment can be divided into three hydrologically connected parts i e the javorniki pivka and cerknica parts of the catchment the central area javorniki part is the karst massif of javorniki and snežnik which borders the eastern side of the valley of the pivka river and its tributaries pivka part and the western side of a string of karst poljes the biggest of these is cerknica polje that are distributed gradually in the southeast northwest direction cerknica part the pivka valley is covered by very poorly permeable eocene flysch draining the surface network of the pivka river which sinks into the world famous postojna cave then follows the so called pivka cave stream of the planina cave and emerges again as the unica spring the pivka cave stream is joined underground by the rak cave stream which collects groundwater mainly from the areas of karst poljes in the cerknica part of the catchment petrič 2010 the majority of the catchment belongs to the javorniki karst plateau composed of well karstified jurassic and cretaceous limestones with karst fissure porosity the carbonate rocks are more than 1000 m thick and the depth of the unsaturated zone can reach up to several hundred meters ravbar et al 2012 in the javorniki part the underground flow is dominant while surface streams are also present in the other two parts they are recharged mainly by karst waters and after appearing as surface flows they sink underground again downstream of the unica and malenščica springs the unica river flows over the planina polje sinks again and re emerges as the ljubljanica river at several springs the two main ones are the retovje and močilnik springs and the ljubljanica river karstic tributaries such as the bistra spring these springs extend along the non carbonate lowland and carbonate rock higher terrain contact at the south western border of the ljubljana marshes the hydrogeology and underground connections of this particular karst system have been the subject of several studies in the past e g gams 1970 gospodarič and habič 1976 pezdič in urbanc 1987 gabrovšek and turk 2010 blatnik et al 2017 to the west there are the hotenjka and logaščica sinking streams which also recharge the springs of the ljubljanica river recent hydrogeological and hydrological studies focused on the hydraulic connections and hydrodynamic behaviour of the aquifer system using natural and artificial tracers e g kogovšek 2001 kogovsek 2004 gabrovšek et al 2010 kogovšek and petrič 2010 ravbar et al 2012 petrič et al 2018 however the study area has not yet been investigated in detail by stable isotope measurements the use of various artificial tracers revealed the relations between various contribution areas to the springs of the planina polje in general the malenščica spring is recharged mainly from the cerknica direction and the javorniki karst aquifer and there is no direct connection with the ponor of the pivka river sinking in the postojna cave during high streamflows when discharges of the malenščica spring are above approx 6 m3 s inflows from the cerknica part dominate this is related to high water levels in the intermittent cerknica lake on average the water stays in cerknica lake for 260 days year and high water levels are present 17 days year kranjc 1985 then the outflow from the malenščica spring is constrained and the rak cave stream in the planina cave acts as an overflow the rak cave stream is recharged from both the cerknica and javorniki parts and the pivka cave stream from the javorniki and the pivka parts ravbar et al 2012 long term mean daily discharge from the whole studied karst catchment is 24 m3 s the discharge can drop to approx 1 m3 s during prolonged dry periods in view of its climate the ljubljanica river catchment is a transitional area between sub mediterranean and temperate continental climates oceanic climate subtype cfb according to the köppen geiger climate classification system the prevailing direction of wet air masses is sw to ne which is also reflected in spatially declining rainfall sums in this direction however highly variable wet air mass directions and rainfall formation processes can be observed in different seasons krklec et al 2018 or even during particular rainfall events highest rainfall sums can be observed along the orographic barriers of the snežnik karst plateau rainfall sums exceeding 3000 mm year and along the javorniki karst plateau rainfall totals exceeding 2000 mm year the long term mean annual rainfall in the north eastern part of the ljubljanica river catchment is approx 1400 mm year and the mean air temperature is between 8 and 10 c the mean monthly reference evapotranspiration calculated for the period 1971 2000 using the penman monteith equation at meteorological station postojna rainfall sampling point p7 fig 1 is 15 mm for the winter months december to february and 112 mm for the summer months june to august the long term mean annual reference evapotranspiration is 720 mm 3 methods 3 1 sampling and analysis precipitation samples for stable isotope analysis δ 18o δ 2h were collected monthly from may 2016 to may 2018 at 7 meteorological stations operated by the slovenian environmental agency arso shown in fig 1 precipitation data were obtained by onset rg2 m tipping bucket rain gauges and ott pluvio2 l weighting rain gauges the rainfall samples for the stable isotope values analysis were collected daily at stations p1 p5 p6 and p7 and transferred to a larger bottle that was stored in a dark cold place and replaced every month the rainfall samples at stations p2 p3 and p4 were collected in plastic containers installed in approx 0 5 m deep trenches covered by brick plate and grass turf to minimize temperature variations and prevent evaporation the plastic containers were emptied each month the position of precipitation collectors assured relatively good spatial coverage of heterogeneity in precipitation input amounts water samples at karst river sinks ponors and springs were collected at 14 stations covering all main ljubljanica river flowpaths and its main tributaries fig 1 stream water samples were initially collected in august 2016 and january 2017 during the 1 year period i e from june 2017 to may 2018 the stream water samples were collected on a monthly basis water samples at stations s9 stržen stream and s10 cerkniščica stream were collected only occasionally during middle flow conditions due to the intermittent character of both streams during dry periods and the formation of the intermittent cerknica lake during wet hydrological conditions when the lake water body joins and overflows both sampling points at streamwater sampling locations we measured water temperature t ph and electrical conductivity ec using hydrolab ms5 and the hach pocket pro multi 2 tester at most sampling locations the discharge is monitored as part of the hydrological monitoring operated by arso the precipitation sampling locations and the streamwater sampling locations with some descriptive parameters are summarized in tables 1 and 2 respectively because precipitation and streamflow rates varied considerably during the observed period the tracer samples were weighted by its associate volume monthly precipitation amount and mean monthly discharge at streamwater sampling locations where the discharge data are not available the mean monthly discharge data from the nearest sampling station with known discharges were used as an approximation for assigning weights the isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen was measured after equilibration with co2 2 h and h2 6 h at 18 c respectively in the dhoeq48 equilibration unit the measurement was done using the finnigan mat delta plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer results are reported as the conventional delta δ notation δ 18o and δ 2h i e the relative deviation of the heavy to light isotope ratio of the sample from that of the standard vsmow expressed in per mil in house reference materials calibrated vs vsmow2 and slap2 international reference standards were used to calibrate the measurements the accuracy was checked using the usgs45 and usgs47 certified reference materials as controls randomly distributed in each batch the measurement uncertainty determined as long term deviation of control materials from their respective certified δ values was 0 05 for δ 18o and 0 7 for δ 2h 3 2 calculation and data analysis the monitoring of the precipitation isotope characteristics at 7 locations assured good spatial coverage over the studied catchment the spatial variability of monthly precipitation sums and the monthly precipitation isotopic composition over the sub catchment areas of selected karst springs and sinks was considered by using thiessen polygons the assessment of karst sub catchment areas extension was based on previous natural and artificial tracer dye tests done mainly by the karst research institute in some parts of the ljubljanica river catchment where additional data from tracers tests were not available the karst sub catchment areas were assessed using surface topography analysis given the basic data set available in terms of temporal monthly resolution the sine wave method was used which compares the amplitude of seasonal variations in δ 18o and δ 2h in precipitation and streamwater and uses the degree of damping to estimate the transit time the seasonal sine wave model for description of δ 18o time series was defined as rodgers et al 2005 1 δ 18 o δ 18 o mean a pors c o s c t θ where δ 18o and δ 18omean are the modelled and the mean annual measured δ 18o values respectively ap or s are the calculated fitted annual amplitudes of precipitation and of streamwater respectively c is the radial frequency of annual fluctuations 0 017247 rad day t is the time in days after the start of the sampling period and θ is the phase lag the same method was used for the δ 2h values for fitting the sinusoidal cycle of precipitation and streamwater δ 18o and δ 2h the iteratively reweighted least squares irls regression was used in order to limit the influence of outliers the shape of the travel time distribution ttd and its corresponding mean travel time mtt reflect storage and mixing processes in the catchment kirchner et al 2001 hrachowitz et al 2010a kirchner 2016b estimates of ttd and mtt have been in the literature correlated with a wide range of catchment characteristics e g mcguire et al 2005 soulsby and tetzlaff 2008 tetzlaff et al 2009 hrachowitz et al 2010b asano and uchida 2012 since a prevalence of flow paths with short transit times can be generally expected for karst aquifers e g along preferential conduits epikarst fissures the exponential distribution of the ttd was assumed the mtt for the exponential model is estimated by the following equation 2 mtt c 1 a s a p 2 1 0 5 where ap is the amplitude of precipitation as is the amplitude of the streamwater outputs and c is the radial frequency of annual fluctuations as defined in eq 1 past studies using different artificial tracers revealed that the relations between various contribution areas of the observed springs are strongly dependent on temporal hydrologic conditions petrič 2010 ravbar et al 2012 therefore to make a general differentiation in the hydrological conditions at the study area we considered monthly periods when the discharges at the sampling points were lower than the long term mean discharge values under low flow conditions whereas discharges higher than the mean values were denoted as high flow conditions normally distributed data were analysed using the t test for testing the differences in the measured parameters at different locations a significance level of 0 05 was selected 4 results 4 1 δ 18o and δ 2h values of precipitation the precipitation δ 18o and δ 2h values in monthly samples indicate continental effects a general decreasing trend of heavy isotope content in the sw ne direction this is the main direction of the wet air masses approaching the study area from the mediterranean the highest δ 18o and δ 2h values weighted mean 7 1 and 45 respectively were observed at rainfall station p6 ilirska bistrica located few kilometres outside the catchment area to the south the lowest δ 18o and δ 2h values weighted mean 8 7 and 57 were observed at station p5 babno polje the differences between weighted mean annual δ 18o and δ 2h values at stations positioned in the north eastern part of the catchment p1 p5 were rather small differences in δ 18o values below 0 4 and in δ 2h values below 3 interestingly the calculated δ 18o gradient for the neighbouring stations p2 dvor and p3 črni vrh positioned at different elevations was only 0 2 for the elevation difference of approx 450 m which is lower than the elevation gradient of 0 24 to 0 3 per 100 m reported for the n adriatic area vreča et al 2006 but still within the limits published by windhorst et al 2013 the differences between some neighbouring precipitation stations e g p1 p2 and p3 p4 and p5 were not statistically significant with the selected significance level of 0 05 for both δ 18o and δ 2h values the records of δ 18o and δ 2h values of precipitation have a seasonal cycle that is in phase with monthly air temperatures distinctive seasonal variations were observed at all stations with lower δ 18o and δ 2h values in winter the lowest values were measured during the cold and snowy february 2018 16 7 and 122 respectively at station p5 the highest values were measured in the summer of 2017 2 8 and 12 5 respectively at station p6 fig 2 shows the seasonal trend of the δ 18o and δ 2h values for the two most contrasting stations p6 and p5 the δ 18o and δ 2h values could not be measured at any of the precipitation stations in december 2016 when there was no precipitation larger seasonal variations in δ 18o and δ 2h were observed at station p5 12 7 and 101 3 compared to station p6 7 4 and 56 4 respectively the differences in the δ 18o and δ 2h seasonal amplitudes can be related to higher mean monthly air temperature variations at station p5 25 1 c compared to the air temperature variation at station p6 23 6 c whereas the summer δ 18o and δ 2h values at both stations are relatively similar the highest differences can be observed in the winter period when the average differences in the mean monthly air t between the two stations were higher 3 5 c compared to the difference in summer months 2 7 c the statistically significant pearson correlation coefficient r2 0 6 and p value 0 001 was calculated between the mean monthly air t and monthly precipitation δ 18o and δ 2h values for all precipitation sampling locations the pearson correlation coefficient between monthly δ 18o and δ 2h values in precipitation and the monthly amount of precipitation was relatively low r2 0 1 and not statistically significant at the selected significance level of 0 05 the seasonal variability of precipitation isotopic composition is evident when dividing all the monthly data p1 p7 into seasons i e spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february fig 3 left while the values of the spring and autumn months are in the middle of the scatter the most and least negative values of the isotopic composition of precipitation can be seen for winter and summer months however the scatter in the seasonal data is relatively high the relation between δ 18o and δ 2h for all precipitation sampling stations is shown in fig 3 right together with the global meteoric water line gmwl the local meteorological water lines lmwl at the precipitation sampling points are close to the gmwl the orthogonal regression equations between the isotopic values of individual monthly samples representing lmwls are summarized in table 3 the pearson correlation coefficients r between δ 2h and δ 18o values are high for all stations r 0 95 and all lmwls are close to the gmwl there is no evident change in the lmwl slope but there is an increase in the lmwl intercept with station elevation the only exception being station p6 where considerably higher δ 18o and δ 2h values were observed compared to other stations the monthly deuterium excess d excess ranged between 17 station p3 and 7 station p7 highest d excess values were generally observed in autumn october and november and the lowest values in the late spring and summer may to july the highest mean annual d excess value 13 was at station p3 črni

the entire sampling period at the unica hasberg water station sampling point s8 positioned downstream of the confluence of the unica river and the malenščica stream sampling point s7 fig 1 whose catchment area covers approx 750 km2 the average daily discharge was only 3 3 m3 s during the december 2017 sampling campaign the highest mean monthly discharge 77 2 m3 s in the sampling period was measured during low flow conditions the difference between sampling points shown in fig 4 is much higher compared to the difference between the sampling points that were collected during high flow conditions the differences between some neighbouring sampling stations e g s1 s2 and s3 s4 and s5 s11 and s12 were not statistically significant with the selected significance level of 0 05 for both δ 18o and δ 2h values when considering the whole dataset in the statistical analysis the ph ranging between 7 5 and 8 5 and ec ranging between 350 and 550 μs cm measurements did not show statistically significant differences between the analysed karst springs and sinks that would indicate a spatial pattern we noticed a general decrease of the ec values with increasing discharge the pearson correlation matrix calculated based on the δ 18o and δ 2h values for the low flow conditions is shown in table 4 high correlation for both δ 18o and δ 2h values is observed between some of the sampling points positioned along the prevailing karst conduit directions e g sampling stations s8 and s1 s2 s6 and s3 p value 0 01 on the other hand there is a low correlation between sampling point s14 the most headwater station along the pivka river karst conduit branch and other downstream sampling points e g s6 s7 there is a high correlation between sampling stations s1 s2 and s3 which might indicate the presence of a common local recharge of the karst springs during low flow conditions when the catchment s contribution from headwater parts to the ljubljanica river discharge becomes very small on the other hand the low correlation between sampling points s3 s4 and s5 for δ 18o values could indicate hydrological heterogeneities in the local recharge of the karst springs the hotenjka stream sampling point s4 and the logaščica stream sampling point s5 are both intermittent karst sinking streams which collect water mainly from local surface and near surface flows additionally the differences between the sampling stations s1 and s2 s4 and s5 s11 and s12 are not statistically significant with the selected significance level of 0 05 for both δ 18o and δ 2h values when considering only the data collected during low flow conditions high correlation was calculated for both δ 18o and δ 2h values between the sampling point located at the logaščica stream s5 and sampling point s14 the pivka stream these two sampling points are not hydrologically connected the relatively important influence of surface drainage is a common characteristic of both sampling points which is apparent from previous tracer experiments conducted in the catchment 4 3 seasonal δ 18o and δ 2h cycles and estimation of mtt the seasonal cycle in δ 18o and δ 2h values in precipitation and streamwater were used to assess mtt fig 5 shows the seasonal cycle at sampling points s3 and s14 i e the most downstream and headwater sampling points respectively together with the seasonal cycle in precipitation over the selected sampling points sub catchments the spatial distribution of seasonal variations in δ 18o and δ 2h values weighted by precipitation amounts was determined using the thiessen polygons over the sampling points sub catchment areas the mse for the regression models of the δ 18o cycle in precipitation over the selected sub catchment areas was between 0 4 sampling point s7 and 0 7 sampling point s1 for the δ 2h cycle in precipitation the regression model mse was between 2 station s1 and 3 station s14 the mse for the regression models of the δ 18o cycle in streamwater ranged between 0 1 station s5 and 0 2 station s13 for the δ 2h cycle in streamwater the mse was between 1 station s5 and 3 station s4 there was approximately a 1 month lag between the seasonal cycle in precipitation and streamflow the water mtts of the karst springs and ponors are shown in fig 6 the shortest mtts were calculated for stations s14 0 34 years using δ 18o and 0 41 years using δ 2h and s11 0 36 years using δ 18o and 0 39 years using δ 2h station s14 is the most headwater station located at the ponor into the postojna cave whereas station s11 is located at the spring of the rak stream the water mtts at other sampling locations are rather similar ranging generally between 0 5 and 0 8 years an increasing trend in the mtt of water could be noticed along the karst conduit system of the pivka branch connecting the sampling points s14 s6 mtt of 0 54 years using δ 18o and 0 63 years using δ 2h similar behavior could be observed for the cerknica branch of the karst conduit system s13 mtt of 0 51 years using δ 18o and 0 48 years using δ 2h s7 mtt of 0 74 years using δ 18o and 0 66 years using δ 2h mtts for the sampling points located at the ljubljanica river karst tributaries are rather similar s1 bistra stream mtt of 0 56 years using δ 18o and 0 54 years using δ 2h s4 hotenjka stream mtt of 0 57 years using δ 18o and 0 52 years using δ 2h and s5 logaščica stream mtt of 0 50 years using δ 18o and 0 64 years using δ 2h 5 discussion 5 1 δ 18o and δ 2h values of precipitation over the catchment and their relation to meteorological conditions precipitation is a major input component of water to the catchments understanding the formation and sources of precipitation in terms of its spatial and temporal variability is crucial for any catchment hydrology studies the isotopic composition of precipitation is strongly controlled by the precipitation formation processes therefore the precipitation stable isotope composition can be very useful in explaining the precipitation sources in view of weather conditions the ljubljanica river catchment is an area where intensive mixing of continental and mediterranean air masses takes place this makes precipitation source identification difficult recently krklec et al 2018 showed a dense and highly scattered distribution of locations from where air masses passed over the study area and collect moisture nearly half of the precipitation originated from continental sources recycled moisture and more than 40 originated from central and western mediterranean consequently the inter month variability in precipitation isotope composition can be high and might even disrupt the identification of the seasonal cycle other studies of precipitation isotope composition over the wider south western part of slovenia demonstrated the predominant influence of atlantic air masses in the area although the influence of mediterranean air masses could not be excluded their contribution to precipitation in ljubljana was estimated to be in the range 15 26 vreča et al 2008 additionally the seasonal variations in the d excess values indicate the influence of mediterranean air masses which are characteristic in the autumn and winter months when the mediterranean cyclogenesis prevails over the study area namely higher d excess values are characteristic for precipitation in the mediterranean area reaching up to 25 whereas d excess values around 10 are typical for atlantic air masses gat and carmi 1970 merlivat and jouzel 1979 lykoudis and argiriou 2007 vreča et al 2007 gat et al 2011 according to the results of precipitation isotopic composition analysis in this study most monthly d excess values most evidently in autumn are above 10 and might indicate the influence of mediterranean air masses over the region the lowest values were observed in late spring and summer months may to july this could indicate the evaporation process at high temperatures and low relative humidity conditions and possibly also partial evaporation from the rain gauges good correlation between δ 18o and δ 2h values of precipitation and the mean monthly air t shows that the temperature appears to be a major parameter controlling the behaviour of the precipitation isotopic composition in the region similarly as discussed by vreča et al 2006 spatial coverage of the precipitation sampling stations enabled us to obtain relatively good insight into the spatial distribution of δ 18o and δ 2h values they considerably decrease from station p6 mean weighted δ 18o and δ 2h values 7 1 and 45 respectively towards station p7 8 0 and 52 and p5 8 7 and 57 when wet air masses travel along the main sw ne direction over the high terrain of the javorniki ridge and the snežnik plateau fig 1 a further decrease in the precipitation δ 18o and δ 2h values towards the sampling point located in the northern part of the catchment is much smaller e g mean δ 18o values 8 6 and mean δ 2h values 56 at station p1 5 2 mtt in light of the catchment characteristics water transit time is widely recognised as one of the fundamental catchment descriptors that reveal information about storage flow pathways and source of water kirchner et al 2000 mcdonnell et al 2010 however most of the calculated mtts are exposed to problems related to a priori selection of the travel time distribution and the problem of aggregation in spatially heterogeneous systems as recently discussed by kirchner 2016a b very little guidance exists for catchment hydrologists on the use and interpretation of the transit time modelling approaches for complex catchment systems mcdonnell et al 2010 in complex karst catchments where spatial hydrogeological heterogeneity defines the temporal hydrological responses of the catchment to rainfall inputs and further the actual extent of the karst catchment areas the travel time estimation problem becomes even more pronounced additional uncertainty in mtt estimates could be related to the influence of isotopic fractionation due to evapotranspiration comparison of local meteoric water lines slopes for all precipitation stations table 1 with those of the karst springs and sinks table 2 shows no measurable effect of evaporation on the isotopic composition of the analysed water this is in line with the findings of krklec et al 2018 who analysed the contribution of local moisture to the precipitation in the postojna area station p7 and estimated that in the overall recycling of water the contribution of evaporation is minor compared to that of leaf transpiration which contributes water vapor to the atmosphere with an oxygen isotope composition equal to that of soil water farquhar et al 2007 furthermore riechelmann et al 2017 reported that evaporation in the soil epikarst and cave generated no significant imprint on drip water isotopic signature at a temperate european setting similarly domínguez villar et al 2018 compared the isotopic composition of precipitation and drip water in the postojna cave in 2009 and 2010 and found that the mean annual δ18o values of drip water at 9 sampling sites in the cave resembled those of annual weighted mean δ18o values of precipitation therefore in the studied catchment the potential effect of evapotranspiration on the isotopic composition of infiltrated water and consequently on the mtt estimates is in our view relatively limited and was not considered in the mtt calculations kirchner 2016a proposed an alternative catchment storage metrics the young water fraction fyw in streamflow as the proportion of the transit time distribution younger than the threshold age of streamflow tyw he demonstrated that seasonal tracer cycles as the ones used in our study predict the fyw in runoff from a heterogeneous mixture of sub catchments much more reliably compared to the widely used estimates of mtt which are exposed to aggregation bias that arises from strong nonlinearity in the relationship between the tracer cycle amplitude and mtt additionally the ttd used to assess the mtt is usually selected arbitrarily as in our case by selecting the exponential distribution as the real ttd for a particular heterogeneous catchment is unknown as an alternative approach kirchner 2016a showed that the amplitude ratio as ap nearly equals fyw not only in individual catchments but also in the combined runoff from heterogeneous landscapes which is characteristic for karst catchments the discharge weighted fyw for the streamwater sampling stations varies between 0 2 and 0 3 the estimated tyw for the exponential distribution is 0 19 years only the results for the fyw using δ 18o as a tracer are shown since the tyw values using the δ 2h as a tracer are very similar fig 7 shows the scatter plot of fyw vs the mean long term daily discharge at the selected sampling points decrease in the fyw vs the mean daily discharge can be observed however the relationship is not statistically significant with the selected significance level of 0 05 we might conclude that important proportions of the streamwater at the selected sampling points can be considered as young water small karst sub catchment areas e g headwater areas of sampling points s11 and s14 have higher fyw reaching up to 0 4 this agrees with the intermittent nature of the streams in this part of the ljubljanica karst catchment namely the pivka river sampling point s14 discharge is controlled also by the surface and near surface water currents from flysch areas for the rak stream sampling point s11 the contribution of the cerkniščica stream with its developed surface and subsurface drainage network in porous dolomite is substantial the fyw for the whole catchment was 0 28 meaning that more than one quarter of the total discharge was younger than approximately 2 3 months assuming that the catchment transit times are described using the exponential distribution our fyw results are within the range of young water fractions reported for rivers in mountainous regions in north america and central europe by jasechko et al 2016 in view of the travel times the young water could be related to the streamwater that follows well developed karst conduits and the diffuse discharge through fissured and fractured vadose zone of the karst catchments rapid and considerably variable flow velocities through conduit systems reaching from a few m h to several 100 m h are indicative of karst aquifers ford and williams 2007 kresic 2007 in the studied catchment the transport velocities observed by injecting artificial fluorescent tracers in periods of low discharges ravbar et al 2012 were among the lowest reported for the karst aquifers ranging between 5 and 22 m h through well developed karst conduits and 3 4 m h through the vadose zone with the dominant influence of a diffuse recharge however there were considerable differences in the travel velocities and also travel directions during different hydrological conditions for the selected sampling points along the main karst conduits the calculated mtts are rather similar the mean mtt is 0 54 years using δ 18o values and 0 52 years using δ 2h values and can be characterised as relatively short brkić et al 2018 calculated mtts ranging between 0 3 and 0 6 years for a well developed karst aquifer system in western croatia which belongs to the same dinaric area as the ljubljanica river catchment such short mtt values could be expected for karst catchments without extensive deep groundwater storage as is the case with the large karst part of the ljubljanica river catchment the most headwater sampling points s11 and s14 have shorter mtts the contribution of the pivka river upstream of the sink to the postojna cave is small during low flow conditions the headwater part of the catchment along the pivka branch of the karst conduit system could become temporarily disconnected from the downstream part of the catchment e g sampling point s6 which is also indicated by the low correlation between sampling points s14 and s6 during low flow conditions table 4 similarly the hydrological disconnection can be indicated through the low correlation between the headwater sampling point s11 and other sampling points e g sampling points s6 and s7 for both δ 18o and δ 2h values namely the streamwater at sampling point s11 is mainly fed from the intermittent cerknica lake area during middle to high flow conditions large proportions of the observed water flux that appears to have very short mtts poses a potential risk to the water quality of the karst springs in the case of surface contamination by considering the long term average daily discharge at the selected sampling points where discharge was measured and the mtt was calculated theoretically the total water storage in the karst aquifers can be estimated as shown in fig 8 the storage of the two upstream branches sampling point s14 pivka branch and sampling point s11 cerknica branch is approx 50 106 m3 whereas the total storage downstream to the confluence of the main three hydrological parts sampling point s8 is 470 106 m3 the total storage from the studied part of the karst catchment is approx 550 106 m3 sampling points s1 s2 s3 however as the karst massif is also drained by several small springs the total volume of water is somewhat larger than the volume calculated in this study the rather small differences in the mtts over the catchment area might suggest intensive mixing and homogenisation of the water along the prevailing underground flowpaths the mixing and homogenisation processes might be indicated also by generally statistically insignificant differences in ph and ec values between the sampled karst springs and sinks positioned along the prevailing karst conduits on the other hand the contribution of local recharge during low flow conditions is indicated by the high scatter in stable isotope values during low flow conditions fig 4 the study of solute transport processes in the studied catchment by kogovšek and petrič 2014 indicates an important role of the epikarst layer as the most important storage layer in the study area however the role of the karst vadose zone storage is significantly influenced by the preceding hydrological conditions the local recharge could be amplified by intensive precipitation infiltration through the epikarst zone in the central part of the catchment where the surface stream network is scarce during prolonged dry periods some relatively large parts of the catchment could become hydrologically isolated which is indicated by the scatter during the low flows in fig 4 in general longer input and output data records produce more reliable estimates of the transit time distribution mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 in our case the calculated mtts and storage volumes are based on two years of precipitation and one year of karst springs sinks monitoring which raises the question of the mtt estimates reliability as discussed by hassan 2003 the key to the successful validation process is the use of a diverse set of tests that should be designed to evaluate a diverse set of aspects related to the modelled processes the differences in the calculated mtt values between neighbouring karst springs s6 s7 and s14 generally agree well with the results of artificial tracers applications presented by ravbar et al 2012 the longest delay in the artificial tracer detection was observed at station s7 which has according to our results the longest mtt as artificial tracers are generally injected into preferential flow paths the flow properties of the conduit system related to short transit times and high flow velocities can be investigated however these tracers omit the fissured porous matrix of the aquifer which plays an important role with respect to water storage in karst lauber and goldscheider 2014 in view of the mtt calculation reliability significant variations in the δ 18o and δ 2h values observed in precipitation samples over w slovenia can lead to considerable deviations from the sinusoidal seasonal pattern as reported by krklec et al 2018 since the δ 18o and δ 2h variability in precipitation is much higher than that in karst springs sinks samples we performed a sensitivity analysis where we analysed the influence of a changed precipitation seasonal amplitude on the calculated mtts e g a 25 change in seasonal precipitation amplitude caused a change of 0 10 to 0 20 years 0 16 years on average in the mtts based on the δ 18o values and a change of 0 12 to 0 17 years 0 14 years on average in the mtts calculated from the δ 2h values undoubtedly longer data series should be used to obtain more reliable results in view of contrasting hydrological conditions longer wet and dry periods which strongly influence the movement of water in the karst catchment 6 conclusion karst systems differ from other hydrological systems in terms of both their hydrogeological evolution and their hydrological behaviour they can be characterised by their high hydrological heterogeneities related to highly variable porosities which can significantly change over small spatial scales difficulties in collecting sufficient information about karst system properties in view of spatial heterogeneity and limited information on the discharge changes especially during contrasting hydrological conditions make the parametrisation and application of different hydrological analytical approaches highly uncertain therefore specific exploration techniques such as the use of artificial or natural tracers are needed to improve our understanding of the complex karst systems in this study we used spatially well distributed data on the rainfall δ 18o and δ 2h inputs and streamflow outputs to study the hydrological behaviour of the ljubljanica river karst catchment despite the changing influence of atlantic and mediterranean wet air masses over the studied catchment on the precipitation isotope composition the monthly precipitation isotope composition was relatively homogenous in the northern part of the catchment a transitional area over the high terrain of the javorniki ridge and the snežnik plateau in the central and south eastern part of the catchment could be noticed where the δ 18o and δ 2h values in precipitation considerably decreased the calculated mtts for the sampling points located along the main conduits and some major tributaries show relatively high hydrological homogenisation of the catchment in terms of the water travel times the catchment s homogenisation strongly depends on the preceding hydrological conditions differences in the isotope composition can be noticed during low flow conditions which might indicate the dominance of the local recharge of the karst springs additionally the fraction of the streamflow younger than the threshold age of 2 3 months is relatively high whereas the estimated mtts are relatively short the observed hydrological behaviour supports the previous studies where the dominance of the diffuse recharge through the vadose zone and the importance of the precipitation recharge by infiltration through the epikarst were assumed the obtained information offers a valuable integrated assessment of the differences in the runoff processes in the catchment and is extremely important for the planning of karst water resource strategies the short mtt indicates a high exposure of the water sources in the area to potential contamination this could become even more problematic in the case of soil or epikarst removal e g by quarrying as this would further reduce the important storage element of the studied karst system credit authorship contribution statement simon rusjan funding

6216,the aim of the study was the comparison of the soil hydraulic properties determined based on two different experimental methods of four large and macroporous soil samples an undisturbed cylindrical soil column h 60 cm and d 30 cm was obtained at a natural slope and quartered horizontally in the laboratory the four sub samples were saturated and subsequently drained using the extended multi step outflow method xmso retention curves and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves were derived via inverse modeling based on the measured drainage and corresponding pore water pressure after resaturation the evaporation method eva was used on the same four samples the samples were exposed to evaporation and the effective water contents and the average pore water pressures were recorded over time to determine soil hydraulic functions while both methods yielded similar results in the medium moisture range the advantage of the xmso method is its higher information content with respect to the hydraulic conductivity close to water saturation whereas the advantage of the eva method is its fast execution moreover the eva method is easier to handle and has significantly lower computational requirements than the xmso method furthermore since the four soil samples represent a soil profile in the field a depth dependent characterizing of the soil profile was possible and showed that the soil properties near saturation are greatly dominated by the ratio of macropores in the sample and that a decrease in the macropore ratio with soil depth was clearly reflected in the hydraulic functions keywords soil hydraulic properties multi step outflow method evaporation method hydraulic conductivity macropores soil sample extraction technique soil column laboratory experiment 1 introduction approaches to measure soil hydraulic properties include indirect estimation of hydraulic functions direct laboratory measurements and field methods durner and lipsius 2005 an overview of laboratory methods is given in kutílek and nielsen 1994 leij and van genuchten 1999 dane and topp 2002 and durner and lipsius 2005 transient methods simultaneous measure water content and pressure heads to derive water retention function durner et al 1999 they can be divided in one step outflow experiments parker et al 1985 and multi step outflow experiments mso where an initially moist sample is drained by applying a sequence of suction steps at the lower boundary in a typical mso experiment a fully saturated or high moist soil sample is placed on a porous plate one or more tensiometers are installed inside the soil core to measure pressure heads inside the sample during drainage hopmans et al 2002 based on one experiment using an inverse evaluation both the retention curve and the hydraulic conductivity curve are determined e g vrugt and dane 2005 puhlmann et al 2009 with the availability of increased computing power and suitable numerical codes the multi step outflow mso method is increasingly used to determine the hydraulic properties of soils e g van dam et al 1994 puhlmann et al 2009 weihermüller et al 2009 figueras and gribb 2009 laloy et al 2010 a major drawback of the mso method lies in the correct quantification of the conductivity at or close to full saturation vogel and cislerova 1988 this is especially true for structured soils where the extrapolation of the simple closed form conductivity functions towards water saturation is doubtful durner 1994 schaap and van genuchten 2005 to improve the estimation durner and iden 2011 introduced the extended multi step outflow method xmso in this method an experiment starts as a falling head experiment with saturated percolation followed by free drainage and continues as a standard mso experiment another method to derive soil hydraulic properties is the evaporation method eva here the soil sample is placed on a scale and the water loss due to evaporation is recorded as a function of time in parallel tensiometers are measuring the correspondent pressure changes in the soil thus the retention curve can be derived additionally the hydraulic conductivity can be obtained using the pressure gradient between tensiometers in different depths in relation to the evaporation rate these experiments provide reliable information on the soil hydraulic properties down to pressure heads of about 1000 cm wind 1968 schindler 1980 wendroth et al 1993 however due to small hydraulic gradients at nearly saturated conditions eva experiments do not provide reliable conductivity data for wet soils iden and durner 2008 peters and durner 2008 schelle et al 2010 studies comparing soil hydraulic properties obtained from mso and eva experiments have shown that both methods yield very similar results in the medium moisture range but deviate near saturation and for very dry soil eching et al 1994 garnier et al 1997 schelle et al 2010 the overall goal of the work presented in this paper was to provide insight in slope stability as a function of the dynamics of groundwater recharge these dynamics are a function of both the porous matrix and the macropores most studies on methods to determine soil hydraulic properties rely on small samples often well below one litre in volume eching et al 1994 schelle et al 2010 hardie et al 2013 weninger et al 2018 at the site investigated it was clear beforehand that extensive macropores are present in the clayey soil wienhöfer et al 2009 therefore large undisturbed sample sizes were utilized to determine effective soil hydraulic properties including the effects of a primary and secondary pore system the challenge in the present study was to take large undisturbed samples and to test if the standard methods mso and eva also work for structured soil in contrast to small homogeneously packed samples in a first step xmso experiments were conducted in the soil samples the pressure head and outflow data were measured and evaluated based on the inverse simulation with the free form approach of iden and durner 2007 then the samples were resaturated and eva experiments were performed and evaluated with a modified schindler approach schindler 1980 to obtain the samples a non standard sampling approach based on the work of bouma and dekker 1981 and germann et al 2002 was used after digging out the space around the sample the undisturbed sample was covered with cling film and polyurethane foam was injected into the space between cling film and a stainless steel casing thus the structure of the sample including the macropores could be preserved during transport and during the experiments in the laboratory the sample was quartered horizontally and the sequence of the four samples obtained represent a soil as profile thus the results of the single tests provided in addition depth dependent soil characteristics as the amount of macropores changes with depth macropores are very dominant and present at the investigated natural and mountainous research site focusing on the macropores and their influence on soil hydraulic properties helps to clarify catchments water flow models wienhöfer and zehe 2014 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling of soil column at the sampling site in ebnit heumöser slope austria alluvial soils about 60 cm are underlain by bedrock consisting of weathered silty and clay rich amden marl lindenmaier et al 2005 wienhöfer et al 2009 to obtain one soil column a trench was dug into the slope from this trench the cylindrical soil column l 60 cm d 30 cm representing the total soil profile to the bedrock was carved out carefully in addition to two roots d 0 5 and d 2 cm in the upper part of the profile many small roots were cut off carefully without disturbing the soil in the column the soil profile included a clearly visible dark horizon of 5 8 cm with organic content the underlying matrix was determined to consist of silt and clay more than 40 each their ratio being fairly constant throughout the whole profile table 1 the existing top horizon of litter 1 cm and remaining small plants were removed due to the cohesive nature of the clayey soil the column stood very stable fig 1 then the open surfaces of the sample side and top were wrapped several times with commercially available transparent cling film fig 1a four steel cylinder modules l 15 cm id 34 cm were slipped over the column fig 1b the gap between steel modules and cling film was filled with commercially available polyurethane foam germer and braun 2015 and the column was covered with a plastic bag to minimize the influence of rainfall and evaporation after the foam reached its final strength 24 h the soil column was cut off with a saw at the base and gently tilted sideways the upper and lower sample boundaries were covered with cling film the steel sample holder was closed with a wooden base and top and the respective slots were filled with cured foam to ensure maximum stability for the subsequent transport to the laboratory 2 2 set up for extended multi step outflow and evaporation experiments in the laboratory the undisturbed sample l 60 cm d 30 cm was carefully separated horizontally into four sample columns each l 15 cm d 30 cm to be investigated separately the samples were extended by a small steel module l 5 cm and covered with a wooden plate to minimize evaporation during the xmso experiments at the base of each of these samples a drainage module including a suction plate of a porous polyethylene polyamide membrane combination with a diameter of 30 cm ecotech environmental measuring systems gmbh bonn germany was installed fig 2 a these plates had an average pore size of 0 45 μm an air entry pressure of 0 1 bar and were very thin 1 mm the drainage modules were connected to a vacuum pump via a colleting bottle between sample and collecting bottle a pressure transmitter keller type 23 s measurement range 1 to 1 bar total error band 4 mbar was installed this pressure reading provided on the one hand the boundary conditions at the lower end of the sample and allowed on the other hand for a control of the suction pump which was set such that it restarted if the difference to the target pressure was more than 5 mbar the collecting bottle was placed on a scale ws 30 pce pce germany gmbh pce int meschede germany with a measuring range of 0 30 kg readability of 0 5 g and a total error band of 1 5 g the hoses connected to the collection bottle were fixed strain relief so that the hose weight and changes in position of the sample did not affect the weight measurement at the vertical center of the sample 7 5 cm from base a tensiometer was emplaced about 8 cm distance from the sample wall to monitor the average pore water pressure of the modules during the xmso experiments the tensiometers used in this study were self built with one bar soil moisture ceramic tips soilmoisture equipment corp goleta ca and connected via a stainless steel tube to pressure transducers series 33x keller ag für druckmesstechnik winterthur switzerland with a measurement range from 1 to 2 bar and a total error band of 1 5 mbar fig 2c the readings voltage of the pressure transducers were processed with a usb labjack ue9 data acquisition device labjack corp denver co and the software profilab 3 0 abacom ingenieurgesellschaft ganderkesee germany and the reading of the scale was logged permanently with a separate lab pc thus this setup allowed for very long days weeks experiments for the eva experiments two additional tensiometers were installed at a vertical distance of 7 5 cm from each other fig 2b each with an identical distance from the respective upper and lower boundary in module a where the sample height was 15 cm the upper tensiometer was very close to the sample surface thus an additional tensiometer was used for the data evaluation the outflow of the drainage module was sealed and the sample was placed on a platform scale pce ts 60 pce germany gmbh pce int meschede germany measuring range up to 60 kg accuracy 10 g and error band 20 g the scale and tensiometers were connected to the data acquisition system as described above the wiring of the tensiometers were attached strain relieved to the platform of the scale to ensure they did not affect the reading for the eva experiments the upper surface of the setup was open to the atmosphere to allow free evaporation fig 2b and c with two identical setups two of the four soil samples could be investigated simultaneously the exact dimensions of the samples are shown in table 1 2 3 procedure for the extended multi step outflow experiments prior to starting the experiments the outlet of the drainage module was connected to a constant head tank in order to saturate the initially partially saturated samples some caso4 was added to reduce the clay aggradation on the sample to start the experiments the hose to the sampling bottle was reconnected fig 2 initially the sample was allowed to drain freely gravity flow no additional suction via pump since the hose end in the collection bottle was some centimeters below the bottom of the sample some suction due to the hanging water column were taken into account free drainage ended when static conditions were reached i e the discharge ceased or reached an extremely small value and the tensiometer readings remained constant indicating a constant pore water pressure in the sample to reach these conditions could take up to five days after this initial free drainage process the suction pump was turned on to start the mso phase during the following approx two months suction was applied to the drainage module 150 cm 10 days 300 cm 10 days 500 cm 7 days and 600 cm approx 30 days due to the clayey material long time intervals and relatively high suction was required to drain the sample and reach quasi static conditions after each drainage step for the samples tested the applied suctions represent very moist to medium moist conditions lindenmaier et al 2005 wienhöfer et al 2009 after completion of the last 600 cm pressure step the vacuum was released the first xmso experiments were performed in parallel with modules a and c followed by modules b and d 2 4 procedure for the evaporation experiments for the eva experiments the samples were resaturated as described for the xmso experiments some cm of ponded water remaining then the samples were placed on the scales and weight as well as tensiometer readings were recorded at distinct time intervals as the water evaporated as the conditions in the laboratory could not be kept totally constant ambient pressure change due to weather daily temperature fluctuations 17 24 c variable light intensity windows it may be important to note that since two identical setups were available module a was run parallel to module c and subsequently module b parallel to module d moreover in order to accelerate evaporation a ventilator was placed on one side of the two samples its center at an elevation of approx 40 cm above the sample tops it was expected that the effect of the ventilator as it was placed closer on the sample c d is larger due to higher air flow rate and lower moisture content in the air no impact on the weight measurements due to air flow was recorded in these experiments two phases could be distinguished during phase a the ponded water evaporated and during phase b the evaporation of soil water from the sample took place the measuring range of the tensiometers did not cover very dry conditions scale sample mass and tensiometers were monitored throughout as described above 2 5 determination of soil parameters after completion of the eva experiments the modules were weighed and then dried together with the base plate and outer mantle module in a drying oven for 24 h at 105 c after the drying the setup was weighed again to determine the water content after the eva experiments the soil shrunk and hardened by the drying process was removed in one piece and weighed based on the weight of the dry soil and the water content the final saturation of the sample at the end of the free evaporation experiment could be determined now from each soil sample a small amount of soil of about 500 g was taken and using a pycnometer the particle densities of these soil samples were determined based on these values and the geometry of the sample bulk density pore volume and porosity could be determined table 1 from the same aliquot the grain size distribution was determined by dry sieving and areometer measurements for main fractions see table 1 2 6 data evaluation for the extended multi step outflow and evaporation experiments 2 6 1 extended multi step outflow xmso experiments to evaluate the xmso experiments the free form approach introduced by iden and durner 2007 was used in combination with the software hydrus 1d simunek et al 2008 water movement in the sample was assumed to be one dimensional increasing the suction at the drainage module yielded a drainage of the sample change in water content with a corresponding change of the distribution of the pore water pressure with the software hydrus 1d it is possible to inversely fit the measured data for discharge and pore water pressure head with changing boundary conditions suction applied via drainage module for this work a modified version of the hydrus 1d software code for numerically solving the richards equation with the shuffled complex evolution algorithm sce ua presented by duan et al 1992 was used the sce ua global optimization algorithm was utilized to estimate nodal values of the water content iden and durner 2007 in that approach the retention curve is described by a hermitian spline with an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and the only constraint is that the water content must decrease strongly monotonically from its maximum value at saturation to zero at oven dryness durner et al 2014 values for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves are then calculated using the instantaneous profile method and fitting a mualem integral to these values iden and durner 2007 for the evaluation of the experiments hydrus projects were set up using the sample as material 1 dimensions see table 1 the suction plate of the drainage module was described as material 2 with a very high conductivity thus it did not affect the determination of the soil conductivity the tensiometer measurement points were integrated as observation points the free form simulations were carried out on the basis of a five node algorithm r 5 the hydraulic properties of the free form curves of soil and of the suction plate were adjusted inversely an exception was the saturated water content θs which was set to the measured porosity table 1 2 6 2 evaporation eva experiments the evaluation of the eva experiments first introduced by wind 1968 followed closely the approach described by schindler 1980 and peters and durner 2008 based on the loss of weight monitored by the scales the average water content θ i of the sample as a function of time as well as the evaporation rate and thus discharge q across the upper boundary can be determined pairing the average water content at different time steps with the corresponding average pore water pressure head h i geometric mean of the tensiometer readings yields the retention curve h θ assuming that for a constant cross section a the discharge decreases linearly from top to bottom of the sample the discharge as well as the darcy flux q θ in the middle between the two tensiometers can be calculated based on this flux the distance between the tensiometer tips and their readings the darcy equation can be solved to yield the relation between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and water content k θ 3 results and discussion 3 1 extended multi step outflow experiments mso experiments usually consist of a drainage phase and a suction mso phase in this paper a percolation phase is added to determine fully saturated parameters thus the x stands for extended and may be regarded as an advance of the usually used phases the experiments may be divided into three phases during the percolation phase the ponding water percolates through the fully saturated sample in the drainage phase drainage commences but only approx 8 cm of suction are applied thus the cessation of the drainage phase corresponds approximately with the field capacity in the soil during the mso phase the suction to the drainage plate is increased stepwise up to approx 600 cm measured and simulated pore water pressure heads the default lower pressure boundary conditions and sample outflow amounts over time are shown for the four samples in fig 3 table 2 shows maximum water content porosity as well as the amount of water collected in the various xmso phases from the different samples a d from top to bottom during the percolation phase the discharge collected from all four samples was high compared to the drainage phase indicating that the saturated hydraulic conductivities were dominated by macropores the drainage however revealed a different behavior in the uppermost sample module a 37 3 of the pores drained during the drainage and mso phases this value decreased with depth 28 3 in module b 21 4 in module c and 10 9 in module d this significant decrease could be explained on the one hand by the decrease of macropores with depth clearly reflected in the amount of water collected during the drainage phase on the other hand it could be explained by a corresponding increase in bulk density presumably due to an increase in fine and clay fractions and consequently an increase in smaller pores which would not drain yet at the applied suction of 600 cm in all experiments the simulated outflow matches the measured outflow very well at the very beginning of the percolation phase however in some experiments a discrepancy between measured and simulated pore water pressure head is seen however this apparent inability of the model to reproduce the abrupt change from fully saturated conditions pos pressure to slightly desaturated ones neg pressure does not affect the quality of the simulation prediction as a whole in summary during the drainage and mso phase unsaturated flow the simulated water pressure heads nicely reproduced the experimental data during the preceding percolation phase this was not the case indicating that macropore flow dominated here and thus darcy s law is not applicable the soil hydraulic property curves determined by the simulation are shown in appendix a1 3 2 evaporation experiments the evaporation experiments may be subdivided into two phases the ponded water evaporation phase and the soil water evaporation phase the soil water evaporation phase might again be subdivided into a phase where the macropore water evaporates soil remains nearly saturated and a phase when the bulk soil is being drained drying the tensiometers could monitor the soil vapour evaporation phase initially however after some appreciable drainage the capillary pressure in the sample was beyond the measuring range of the tensiometers failure of the tensiometers was recorded for dry soil et 0 4 cm d 1 when evaporation was still capillary driven during approx the last 10 days of the eva experiments shrinkage cracks and an overall sample deformation could be seen for the evaporation phase the development of pore water pressures evaporation rate and cumulative evaporation are shown for the four modules from top to bottom a d in fig 4 incorporating the ponded water evaporation phase in the evaporation experiment after schindler 1980 has the advantage that the initial head of the ponded water phase can be used to correct the off set of the previously calibrated tensiometers moreover by monitoring the tensiometers during the different phases of the experiment three distinct slopes may distinguished fig 5 during the evaporation of the ponded water evaporation phase the slope is very small indicating just a corresponding decrease in positive pressure in the pores once the ponded water is gone evaporation of the soil water commences clearly to be seen in a change of the slope the water filled pore network of the sample becomes part of the evaporation system in addition to the climatic conditions pore size distribution pore connectivity sample depth and microgeomorphology of the sample surface are crucial evaporation at the surface affects the entire water filled pore system of the sample and is effective down to the depth of the sample as reflected in the lower tensiometer readings initially the water in the macropores replenished evaporated soil water thus the soil matrix remained more or less fully saturated with a corresponding constant hydraulic conductivity after recharge from pore water ceased approx 3 7 days in fig 5 the soil matrix drained resulting in a corresponding decrease in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and thus an increase in the slope of the pressure measurements the hydraulic evaluation of the experiments was based on the time period in which the tensiometers provided the realistic values approx 5 days during this time span the minimum pore water pressures recorded were between 600 cm and 900 cm fig 4 the corresponding water contents for the evaporation experiments etc are listed in table 3 the cumulative water mass during the 35 days of evaporation from soil was approx between 0 42 and 0 57 cm3 cm 3 of water content which accounted for between 67 and 94 of the initially available water in the sample table 3 daily hourly changes in temperature humidity and ambient pressure are reflected in widely varying evaporation rates fig 4 the initial evaporation rate in all experiments is fairly high about 0 5 cm d 1 and above and rapidly decreases within the first 5 to 10 days to about 0 2 0 1 cm d 1 thereafter the rate decreases to a rate below 0 1 cm d 1 shown clearly in sample d around day 25 another step decrease in the evaporation rate can be seen this corresponds to the transition from stage one evaporation mainly based on capillary flow to stage two evaporation mainly based on diffusive water movement or et al 2013 the total cumulative evaporation was highest in module d this sample had the highest ration in fine soil fractions silt clay resulting in a higher hydraulic conductivity for very small water contents as compared to the other samples and thus a higher evaporation rate after cessation of the experiments the samples were oven dried to close the mass balance this mass balance showed a deviation between 7 and 6 thus the difference remains within reasonable experimental limits the retention curves for the samples based on measured average pressure head and average saturation values are shown in fig 6 they show two distinct sections during the initial reduction of saturation the curve is nearly horizontal shaded grey in fig 6 in this macropore section the water in the macropores is being evaporated and thus while the saturation as a whole changes the actual porous media saturation remains very high once the macropores are dewatered the matrix section begins and the pore water pressure head capillary pressure increases with decreasing water content based on visual interpretation of the data the transition between the macropore section and the matrix section is at a pore water pressure of approx 7 5 cm the determination of the conductivity curves fig 6 based on evaporation data may not be sensible for the whole range of water saturation for nearly saturated porous media the potential darcy flux is greater for medium to coarse soils than the maximum flux potentially caused by evaporation qks qeva pot for the same saturation conditions but for soils with a low hydraulic conductivity the evaporation experiments may yield reasonable results qeva qeva pot as the saturation of the porous media decreases the conductivity decreases greatly thus now the potential evaporation rate greatly exceeds the corresponding darcy flux in the samples qeva qeva pot moreover the water loss due to evaporation leads to a decrease in the saturation profile primarily in the upper millimeters and centimeters deeper tensiometers hardly register the initial drainage but only later stages when the desaturation propagates through the sample profile therefore the determination of k θ is most accurate once an appreciable pressure differences between the upper and lower tensiometer is available e g δh δz 1 5 nevertheless the conductivities values were calculated and shown for the whole experimental phases as expected at high water saturations macropores not fully drained the k values were unrealistic and highly variable gray shaded area in fig 6 with decreasing water content for almost all k curves the fluctuations ceased and realistic steadily decreasing k values were obtained this of course coincides with the water content pore water pressure at which the desaturation curves increased their slope 3 3 comparison of the methods the porosity and thus the maximum water saturation of each sample was determined at the conclusion of all experiments it may be assumed though that the saturation at the beginning of the respective percolation phases was somewhat below this maximum value due to entrapped air moreover the transition between ponded phase and percolation phase is not abrupt but gradual thus the selected exact starting time or water content of the percolation phase also slightly influenced the initial water content in addition the high suction applied during the xmso experiments might have caused a slight increase in the macropore ratio during the eva experiments in order to allow for a better comparison of the two methods in fig 7 the retention curves of the xmso method were shifted horizontally to coincide with the respective eva curves at a pressure head of approx 50 cm the shape of the curves remain of course unchanged a corresponding saturation shift was applied to the k θ curves in fig 7 the k θ curves are shown for the stable range only i e for condition where macropore flow does not contribute shifted curves are marked with 3 3 1 retention curves comparing the retention curves of the two methods for the four samples shows that the curves for module a the uppermost sample agree well at a suction range from 100 to 600 cm for the other modules the retention curves based on mso experiments show a steeper slope in the matrix sections than those based on eva experiments this could be due to the fact that these samples contain less sand and more clay and could indicate that higher clay contents yield higher uncertainties in the determination of retention curves another cause for the discrepancy could be the manner in which the pore water pressure was determined while the mso experiments are based on measurements on a single elevation sample middle the eva experiments are based on readings at two elevations assuming that the water content profile is not linear for samples of this height it was concluded that the data based on two tensiometers and thus the evaporation results are more accurate similar discrepancies between the two methods were reported by zhuang et al 2017 who compared the hanging water column method with the hyprop evaporation method peters and durner 2008 schindler et al 2010 for their small sandy samples the hyprop results indicated a higher saturated water content and a lower residual water content additionally the retention curves were in a more negative pressure range similar discrepancies were reported by schelle et al 2013 who compared a pressure plate method with the evaporation method hyprop both zhuang et al 2017 and schelle et al 2013 used small samples and attributed the reported discrepancies partially to sample size the samples used for the experiments reported in this work are large and undisturbed even considering macropores they may well be regarded as rev the results presented are thus more representative to real field conditions than most experiments reported in literature 3 3 2 hydraulic conductivity curves as discussed previously the evaporation experiments do not yield meaningful k θ curves for high saturations i e when the macropores are full thus in fig 7 for the eva method only values pertaining to matrix flow are shown starting point for the k θ curves thus range between water contents of 0 42 0 44 for the upper samples a b and at a water content of about 0 53 in the lower samples c d for water contents below these starting points the two curves generally agree very well module d being somewhat off though these starting points reflecting drained macropores and fully saturated matrix yield k θ values increasing from 0 2 cm d 1 to 0 5 cm d 1 for module a to module d these values agree well with conductivity values given in literature for loamy clay soils e g domenico and schwartz 1990 clapp and hornberger 1978 for water contents beyond these limits the hydraulic conductivities increased rapidly the xmso experiments yielded hydraulic conductivity values of up to k 100 cm d 1 clearly reflecting that in this case the macropore flow dominated the xmso method was not only more reliable at high saturations it also proved to be useful for very low saturations while schelle et al 2010 and durner and iden 2011 showed that the multistep outflow method works reliably they limited their suctions to 100 cm durner and iden 2011 and 140 cm schelle et al 2010 thus in order to describe a porous media for a full range of saturations they had to rely on model functions e g van genuchten 1980 or use methods which work in medium moist and dryer ranges schelle et al 2010 compared the eva method and the mso method based on the same samples however as their suction was too low the measured range of the two approaches did not overlap and hence a direct comparison was not possible the experiments of zhuang et al 2017 also did not allow a direct comparison since the multistep flux method was limited to a suction of 50 cm while for the hyprop method the suction ranged between 50 and 200 cm in agreement with van schaik et al 2010 who used suction steps up to 1000 cm the work presented in this paper shows that even for large undisturbed samples a suction of 600 cm is possible allowing for the xmso method a very wide saturation range without the necessity of extrapolation 3 3 3 macropore ratio as stated above the water content necessary to achieve a saturated hydraulic conductivity in the matrix increased from module a through module d this means that concurrently the macropore ratio decreased with depth tables 1 and 3 this decrease could be confirmed visually at the soil profile during excavation of the samples and when separating the initial soil column to obtain the four sample modules these findings agree with wang et al 2013 who reported wide cracks near the surface which became more narrow as a function of depth and eventually vanished in the soil matrix germer and braun 2015 showed in a similar soil profile from this site that the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased by a factor of two laloy at al 2010 tried to describe soil hydraulic properties of structured soil in a virtual mso experiments and concluded neglecting the first mso steps can result in a perfect match of the soil matrix behavior and the mv model while they also showed that the dual porosity approach of gerke and genuchten 1993 yielded a good description of their structured soil it has to be pointed out that dual porosity dual permeability models are based on a wide range of parameters making them much less user friendly as the nearly equally accurate free form approach soto et al 2017 fitted data obtained from a medium size sample containing macropores with a multi step outflow method by using the hydrus 1d software the single porosity model was only able to describe the soil hydraulic properties for a small macropore content but did not work for a larger one in contrast the free form approach shown in this study worked well although the soils did have very high macropore ratios 4 conclusion for double porosity soil pore water pressure head h θ and hydraulic conductivity k θ were determined using large undisturbed soil samples gained at different depths for each sample l 15 cm d 30 cm the above mentioned relations were determined using an extended multi step outflow xmso and after resaturation an evaporation eva experiment the vacuum driven xmso experiments took up to 60 days and yielded very good results for fully saturated samples as well as for conditions when macropores were drained but matrix saturation remained high however as the pressure applied was limited to 600 cm these experiments were not applicable for low water content the set up for the eva method is less intricate and the method is faster 10 to 35 days it however gives no realistic information for highly saturated conditions as there is no significant upward flow gradient in the sample for very dry soil 800 cm pressure head this method proved to be challenging as the tensiometers fell dry and or lost hydraulic contact to the surrounding matrix the following conclusions could be drawn during the drainage and mso phase unsaturated flow the simulated water pressure heads closely reproduced the experimental data during the preceding percolation phase this was not the case this is most likely because macropores have a much higher impact on flow of saturated porous media dual porosity than on unsaturated flow an evaluation of the transition between extension ponding and drainage phase for the xmso experiments showed that the macropore ratio decreased with depth the macropores are clearly reflected in the results of the eva experiments which showed two distinct sections during the macropore section the water in the macropores is being evaporated and thus while the saturation as a whole changes the actual porous media saturation remains very high during the subsequent matrix section capillary pressure increases with decreasing water content the retention curves of the xmso experiments show a steeper slope than those of the eva experiments assuming that the results of the eva experiments based on two tensiometers are more reliable this would indicate that the xmso experiments are negatively influenced by increasing clay content in the matrix the curves for hydraulic conductivity as a function of water content of the two methods agree very well however xmso is also reliable for higher saturation due to the large clay content the water content remained fairly high within the measuring range of the tensiometers thus these could not cover the full drainage cycle a practical problem for the evaluation were different initial conditions in the water content which resulted from resaturating between the experiments hysteresis moreover shrinkage cracks seemed to have an effect on the measurements overall the evaporation method was shown to be reliable and at the same time faster and less complicated in the experimental setup and in the experimental evaluation the sample height should be reduced 10 cm though to minimize non linear moisture distributions in the sample profile however if the soil exhibits a propensity to shrinkage high clay content the application of the eva method should be limited to fairly high water contents credit authorship contribution statement kai germer conceptualization methodology investigation visualization writing original draft jürgen braun conceptualization

6216,the aim of the study was the comparison of the soil hydraulic properties determined based on two different experimental methods of four large and macroporous soil samples an undisturbed cylindrical soil column h 60 cm and d 30 cm was obtained at a natural slope and quartered horizontally in the laboratory the four sub samples were saturated and subsequently drained using the extended multi step outflow method xmso retention curves and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves were derived via inverse modeling based on the measured drainage and corresponding pore water pressure after resaturation the evaporation method eva was used on the same four samples the samples were exposed to evaporation and the effective water contents and the average pore water pressures were recorded over time to determine soil hydraulic functions while both methods yielded similar results in the medium moisture range the advantage of the xmso method is its higher information content with respect to the hydraulic conductivity close to water saturation whereas the advantage of the eva method is its fast execution moreover the eva method is easier to handle and has significantly lower computational requirements than the xmso method furthermore since the four soil samples represent a soil profile in the field a depth dependent characterizing of the soil profile was possible and showed that the soil properties near saturation are greatly dominated by the ratio of macropores in the sample and that a decrease in the macropore ratio with soil depth was clearly reflected in the hydraulic functions keywords soil hydraulic properties multi step outflow method evaporation method hydraulic conductivity macropores soil sample extraction technique soil column laboratory experiment 1 introduction approaches to measure soil hydraulic properties include indirect estimation of hydraulic functions direct laboratory measurements and field methods durner and lipsius 2005 an overview of laboratory methods is given in kutílek and nielsen 1994 leij and van genuchten 1999 dane and topp 2002 and durner and lipsius 2005 transient methods simultaneous measure water content and pressure heads to derive water retention function durner et al 1999 they can be divided in one step outflow experiments parker et al 1985 and multi step outflow experiments mso where an initially moist sample is drained by applying a sequence of suction steps at the lower boundary in a typical mso experiment a fully saturated or high moist soil sample is placed on a porous plate one or more tensiometers are installed inside the soil core to measure pressure heads inside the sample during drainage hopmans et al 2002 based on one experiment using an inverse evaluation both the retention curve and the hydraulic conductivity curve are determined e g vrugt and dane 2005 puhlmann et al 2009 with the availability of increased computing power and suitable numerical codes the multi step outflow mso method is increasingly used to determine the hydraulic properties of soils e g van dam et al 1994 puhlmann et al 2009 weihermüller et al 2009 figueras and gribb 2009 laloy et al 2010 a major drawback of the mso method lies in the correct quantification of the conductivity at or close to full saturation vogel and cislerova 1988 this is especially true for structured soils where the extrapolation of the simple closed form conductivity functions towards water saturation is doubtful durner 1994 schaap and van genuchten 2005 to improve the estimation durner and iden 2011 introduced the extended multi step outflow method xmso in this method an experiment starts as a falling head experiment with saturated percolation followed by free drainage and continues as a standard mso experiment another method to derive soil hydraulic properties is the evaporation method eva here the soil sample is placed on a scale and the water loss due to evaporation is recorded as a function of time in parallel tensiometers are measuring the correspondent pressure changes in the soil thus the retention curve can be derived additionally the hydraulic conductivity can be obtained using the pressure gradient between tensiometers in different depths in relation to the evaporation rate these experiments provide reliable information on the soil hydraulic properties down to pressure heads of about 1000 cm wind 1968 schindler 1980 wendroth et al 1993 however due to small hydraulic gradients at nearly saturated conditions eva experiments do not provide reliable conductivity data for wet soils iden and durner 2008 peters and durner 2008 schelle et al 2010 studies comparing soil hydraulic properties obtained from mso and eva experiments have shown that both methods yield very similar results in the medium moisture range but deviate near saturation and for very dry soil eching et al 1994 garnier et al 1997 schelle et al 2010 the overall goal of the work presented in this paper was to provide insight in slope stability as a function of the dynamics of groundwater recharge these dynamics are a function of both the porous matrix and the macropores most studies on methods to determine soil hydraulic properties rely on small samples often well below one litre in volume eching et al 1994 schelle et al 2010 hardie et al 2013 weninger et al 2018 at the site investigated it was clear beforehand that extensive macropores are present in the clayey soil wienhöfer et al 2009 therefore large undisturbed sample sizes were utilized to determine effective soil hydraulic properties including the effects of a primary and secondary pore system the challenge in the present study was to take large undisturbed samples and to test if the standard methods mso and eva also work for structured soil in contrast to small homogeneously packed samples in a first step xmso experiments were conducted in the soil samples the pressure head and outflow data were measured and evaluated based on the inverse simulation with the free form approach of iden and durner 2007 then the samples were resaturated and eva experiments were performed and evaluated with a modified schindler approach schindler 1980 to obtain the samples a non standard sampling approach based on the work of bouma and dekker 1981 and germann et al 2002 was used after digging out the space around the sample the undisturbed sample was covered with cling film and polyurethane foam was injected into the space between cling film and a stainless steel casing thus the structure of the sample including the macropores could be preserved during transport and during the experiments in the laboratory the sample was quartered horizontally and the sequence of the four samples obtained represent a soil as profile thus the results of the single tests provided in addition depth dependent soil characteristics as the amount of macropores changes with depth macropores are very dominant and present at the investigated natural and mountainous research site focusing on the macropores and their influence on soil hydraulic properties helps to clarify catchments water flow models wienhöfer and zehe 2014 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling of soil column at the sampling site in ebnit heumöser slope austria alluvial soils about 60 cm are underlain by bedrock consisting of weathered silty and clay rich amden marl lindenmaier et al 2005 wienhöfer et al 2009 to obtain one soil column a trench was dug into the slope from this trench the cylindrical soil column l 60 cm d 30 cm representing the total soil profile to the bedrock was carved out carefully in addition to two roots d 0 5 and d 2 cm in the upper part of the profile many small roots were cut off carefully without disturbing the soil in the column the soil profile included a clearly visible dark horizon of 5 8 cm with organic content the underlying matrix was determined to consist of silt and clay more than 40 each their ratio being fairly constant throughout the whole profile table 1 the existing top horizon of litter 1 cm and remaining small plants were removed due to the cohesive nature of the clayey soil the column stood very stable fig 1 then the open surfaces of the sample side and top were wrapped several times with commercially available transparent cling film fig 1a four steel cylinder modules l 15 cm id 34 cm were slipped over the column fig 1b the gap between steel modules and cling film was filled with commercially available polyurethane foam germer and braun 2015 and the column was covered with a plastic bag to minimize the influence of rainfall and evaporation after the foam reached its final strength 24 h the soil column was cut off with a saw at the base and gently tilted sideways the upper and lower sample boundaries were covered with cling film the steel sample holder was closed with a wooden base and top and the respective slots were filled with cured foam to ensure maximum stability for the subsequent transport to the laboratory 2 2 set up for extended multi step outflow and evaporation experiments in the laboratory the undisturbed sample l 60 cm d 30 cm was carefully separated horizontally into four sample columns each l 15 cm d 30 cm to be investigated separately the samples were extended by a small steel module l 5 cm and covered with a wooden plate to minimize evaporation during the xmso experiments at the base of each of these samples a drainage module including a suction plate of a porous polyethylene polyamide membrane combination with a diameter of 30 cm ecotech environmental measuring systems gmbh bonn germany was installed fig 2 a these plates had an average pore size of 0 45 μm an air entry pressure of 0 1 bar and were very thin 1 mm the drainage modules were connected to a vacuum pump via a colleting bottle between sample and collecting bottle a pressure transmitter keller type 23 s measurement range 1 to 1 bar total error band 4 mbar was installed this pressure reading provided on the one hand the boundary conditions at the lower end of the sample and allowed on the other hand for a control of the suction pump which was set such that it restarted if the difference to the target pressure was more than 5 mbar the collecting bottle was placed on a scale ws 30 pce pce germany gmbh pce int meschede germany with a measuring range of 0 30 kg readability of 0 5 g and a total error band of 1 5 g the hoses connected to the collection bottle were fixed strain relief so that the hose weight and changes in position of the sample did not affect the weight measurement at the vertical center of the sample 7 5 cm from base a tensiometer was emplaced about 8 cm distance from the sample wall to monitor the average pore water pressure of the modules during the xmso experiments the tensiometers used in this study were self built with one bar soil moisture ceramic tips soilmoisture equipment corp goleta ca and connected via a stainless steel tube to pressure transducers series 33x keller ag für druckmesstechnik winterthur switzerland with a measurement range from 1 to 2 bar and a total error band of 1 5 mbar fig 2c the readings voltage of the pressure transducers were processed with a usb labjack ue9 data acquisition device labjack corp denver co and the software profilab 3 0 abacom ingenieurgesellschaft ganderkesee germany and the reading of the scale was logged permanently with a separate lab pc thus this setup allowed for very long days weeks experiments for the eva experiments two additional tensiometers were installed at a vertical distance of 7 5 cm from each other fig 2b each with an identical distance from the respective upper and lower boundary in module a where the sample height was 15 cm the upper tensiometer was very close to the sample surface thus an additional tensiometer was used for the data evaluation the outflow of the drainage module was sealed and the sample was placed on a platform scale pce ts 60 pce germany gmbh pce int meschede germany measuring range up to 60 kg accuracy 10 g and error band 20 g the scale and tensiometers were connected to the data acquisition system as described above the wiring of the tensiometers were attached strain relieved to the platform of the scale to ensure they did not affect the reading for the eva experiments the upper surface of the setup was open to the atmosphere to allow free evaporation fig 2b and c with two identical setups two of the four soil samples could be investigated simultaneously the exact dimensions of the samples are shown in table 1 2 3 procedure for the extended multi step outflow experiments prior to starting the experiments the outlet of the drainage module was connected to a constant head tank in order to saturate the initially partially saturated samples some caso4 was added to reduce the clay aggradation on the sample to start the experiments the hose to the sampling bottle was reconnected fig 2 initially the sample was allowed to drain freely gravity flow no additional suction via pump since the hose end in the collection bottle was some centimeters below the bottom of the sample some suction due to the hanging water column were taken into account free drainage ended when static conditions were reached i e the discharge ceased or reached an extremely small value and the tensiometer readings remained constant indicating a constant pore water pressure in the sample to reach these conditions could take up to five days after this initial free drainage process the suction pump was turned on to start the mso phase during the following approx two months suction was applied to the drainage module 150 cm 10 days 300 cm 10 days 500 cm 7 days and 600 cm approx 30 days due to the clayey material long time intervals and relatively high suction was required to drain the sample and reach quasi static conditions after each drainage step for the samples tested the applied suctions represent very moist to medium moist conditions lindenmaier et al 2005 wienhöfer et al 2009 after completion of the last 600 cm pressure step the vacuum was released the first xmso experiments were performed in parallel with modules a and c followed by modules b and d 2 4 procedure for the evaporation experiments for the eva experiments the samples were resaturated as described for the xmso experiments some cm of ponded water remaining then the samples were placed on the scales and weight as well as tensiometer readings were recorded at distinct time intervals as the water evaporated as the conditions in the laboratory could not be kept totally constant ambient pressure change due to weather daily temperature fluctuations 17 24 c variable light intensity windows it may be important to note that since two identical setups were available module a was run parallel to module c and subsequently module b parallel to module d moreover in order to accelerate evaporation a ventilator was placed on one side of the two samples its center at an elevation of approx 40 cm above the sample tops it was expected that the effect of the ventilator as it was placed closer on the sample c d is larger due to higher air flow rate and lower moisture content in the air no impact on the weight measurements due to air flow was recorded in these experiments two phases could be distinguished during phase a the ponded water evaporated and during phase b the evaporation of soil water from the sample took place the measuring range of the tensiometers did not cover very dry conditions scale sample mass and tensiometers were monitored throughout as described above 2 5 determination of soil parameters after completion of the eva experiments the modules were weighed and then dried together with the base plate and outer mantle module in a drying oven for 24 h at 105 c after the drying the setup was weighed again to determine the water content after the eva experiments the soil shrunk and hardened by the drying process was removed in one piece and weighed based on the weight of the dry soil and the water content the final saturation of the sample at the end of the free evaporation experiment could be determined now from each soil sample a small amount of soil of about 500 g was taken and using a pycnometer the particle densities of these soil samples were determined based on these values and the geometry of the sample bulk density pore volume and porosity could be determined table 1 from the same aliquot the grain size distribution was determined by dry sieving and areometer measurements for main fractions see table 1 2 6 data evaluation for the extended multi step outflow and evaporation experiments 2 6 1 extended multi step outflow xmso experiments to evaluate the xmso experiments the free form approach introduced by iden and durner 2007 was used in combination with the software hydrus 1d simunek et al 2008 water movement in the sample was assumed to be one dimensional increasing the suction at the drainage module yielded a drainage of the sample change in water content with a corresponding change of the distribution of the pore water pressure with the software hydrus 1d it is possible to inversely fit the measured data for discharge and pore water pressure head with changing boundary conditions suction applied via drainage module for this work a modified version of the hydrus 1d software code for numerically solving the richards equation with the shuffled complex evolution algorithm sce ua presented by duan et al 1992 was used the sce ua global optimization algorithm was utilized to estimate nodal values of the water content iden and durner 2007 in that approach the retention curve is described by a hermitian spline with an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and the only constraint is that the water content must decrease strongly monotonically from its maximum value at saturation to zero at oven dryness durner et al 2014 values for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves are then calculated using the instantaneous profile method and fitting a mualem integral to these values iden and durner 2007 for the evaluation of the experiments hydrus projects were set up using the sample as material 1 dimensions see table 1 the suction plate of the drainage module was described as material 2 with a very high conductivity thus it did not affect the determination of the soil conductivity the tensiometer measurement points were integrated as observation points the free form simulations were carried out on the basis of a five node algorithm r 5 the hydraulic properties of the free form curves of soil and of the suction plate were adjusted inversely an exception was the saturated water content θs which was set to the measured porosity table 1 2 6 2 evaporation eva experiments the evaluation of the eva experiments first introduced by wind 1968 followed closely the approach described by schindler 1980 and peters and durner 2008 based on the loss of weight monitored by the scales the average water content θ i of the sample as a function of time as well as the evaporation rate and thus discharge q across the upper boundary can be determined pairing the average water content at different time steps with the corresponding average pore water pressure head h i geometric mean of the tensiometer readings yields the retention curve h θ assuming that for a constant cross section a the discharge decreases linearly from top to bottom of the sample the discharge as well as the darcy flux q θ in the middle between the two tensiometers can be calculated based on this flux the distance between the tensiometer tips and their readings the darcy equation can be solved to yield the relation between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and water content k θ 3 results and discussion 3 1 extended multi step outflow experiments mso experiments usually consist of a drainage phase and a suction mso phase in this paper a percolation phase is added to determine fully saturated parameters thus the x stands for extended and may be regarded as an advance of the usually used phases the experiments may be divided into three phases during the percolation phase the ponding water percolates through the fully saturated sample in the drainage phase drainage commences but only approx 8 cm of suction are applied thus the cessation of the drainage phase corresponds approximately with the field capacity in the soil during the mso phase the suction to the drainage plate is increased stepwise up to approx 600 cm measured and simulated pore water pressure heads the default lower pressure boundary conditions and sample outflow amounts over time are shown for the four samples in fig 3 table 2 shows maximum water content porosity as well as the amount of water collected in the various xmso phases from the different samples a d from top to bottom during the percolation phase the discharge collected from all four samples was high compared to the drainage phase indicating that the saturated hydraulic conductivities were dominated by macropores the drainage however revealed a different behavior in the uppermost sample module a 37 3 of the pores drained during the drainage and mso phases this value decreased with depth 28 3 in module b 21 4 in module c and 10 9 in module d this significant decrease could be explained on the one hand by the decrease of macropores with depth clearly reflected in the amount of water collected during the drainage phase on the other hand it could be explained by a corresponding increase in bulk density presumably due to an increase in fine and clay fractions and consequently an increase in smaller pores which would not drain yet at the applied suction of 600 cm in all experiments the simulated outflow matches the measured outflow very well at the very beginning of the percolation phase however in some experiments a discrepancy between measured and simulated pore water pressure head is seen however this apparent inability of the model to reproduce the abrupt change from fully saturated conditions pos pressure to slightly desaturated ones neg pressure does not affect the quality of the simulation prediction as a whole in summary during the drainage and mso phase unsaturated flow the simulated water pressure heads nicely reproduced the experimental data during the preceding percolation phase this was not the case indicating that macropore flow dominated here and thus darcy s law is not applicable the soil hydraulic property curves determined by the simulation are shown in appendix a1 3 2 evaporation experiments the evaporation experiments may be subdivided into two phases the ponded water evaporation phase and the soil water evaporation phase the soil water evaporation phase might again be subdivided into a phase where the macropore water evaporates soil remains nearly saturated and a phase when the bulk soil is being drained drying the tensiometers could monitor the soil vapour evaporation phase initially however after some appreciable drainage the capillary pressure in the sample was beyond the measuring range of the tensiometers failure of the tensiometers was recorded for dry soil et 0 4 cm d 1 when evaporation was still capillary driven during approx the last 10 days of the eva experiments shrinkage cracks and an overall sample deformation could be seen for the evaporation phase the development of pore water pressures evaporation rate and cumulative evaporation are shown for the four modules from top to bottom a d in fig 4 incorporating the ponded water evaporation phase in the evaporation experiment after schindler 1980 has the advantage that the initial head of the ponded water phase can be used to correct the off set of the previously calibrated tensiometers moreover by monitoring the tensiometers during the different phases of the experiment three distinct slopes may distinguished fig 5 during the evaporation of the ponded water evaporation phase the slope is very small indicating just a corresponding decrease in positive pressure in the pores once the ponded water is gone evaporation of the soil water commences clearly to be seen in a change of the slope the water filled pore network of the sample becomes part of the evaporation system in addition to the climatic conditions pore size distribution pore connectivity sample depth and microgeomorphology of the sample surface are crucial evaporation at the surface affects the entire water filled pore system of the sample and is effective down to the depth of the sample as reflected in the lower tensiometer readings initially the water in the macropores replenished evaporated soil water thus the soil matrix remained more or less fully saturated with a corresponding constant hydraulic conductivity after recharge from pore water ceased approx 3 7 days in fig 5 the soil matrix drained resulting in a corresponding decrease in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and thus an increase in the slope of the pressure measurements the hydraulic evaluation of the experiments was based on the time period in which the tensiometers provided the realistic values approx 5 days during this time span the minimum pore water pressures recorded were between 600 cm and 900 cm fig 4 the corresponding water contents for the evaporation experiments etc are listed in table 3 the cumulative water mass during the 35 days of evaporation from soil was approx between 0 42 and 0 57 cm3 cm 3 of water content which accounted for between 67 and 94 of the initially available water in the sample table 3 daily hourly changes in temperature humidity and ambient pressure are reflected in widely varying evaporation rates fig 4 the initial evaporation rate in all experiments is fairly high about 0 5 cm d 1 and above and rapidly decreases within the first 5 to 10 days to about 0 2 0 1 cm d 1 thereafter the rate decreases to a rate below 0 1 cm d 1 shown clearly in sample d around day 25 another step decrease in the evaporation rate can be seen this corresponds to the transition from stage one evaporation mainly based on capillary flow to stage two evaporation mainly based on diffusive water movement or et al 2013 the total cumulative evaporation was highest in module d this sample had the highest ration in fine soil fractions silt clay resulting in a higher hydraulic conductivity for very small water contents as compared to the other samples and thus a higher evaporation rate after cessation of the experiments the samples were oven dried to close the mass balance this mass balance showed a deviation between 7 and 6 thus the difference remains within reasonable experimental limits the retention curves for the samples based on measured average pressure head and average saturation values are shown in fig 6 they show two distinct sections during the initial reduction of saturation the curve is nearly horizontal shaded grey in fig 6 in this macropore section the water in the macropores is being evaporated and thus while the saturation as a whole changes the actual porous media saturation remains very high once the macropores are dewatered the matrix section begins and the pore water pressure head capillary pressure increases with decreasing water content based on visual interpretation of the data the transition between the macropore section and the matrix section is at a pore water pressure of approx 7 5 cm the determination of the conductivity curves fig 6 based on evaporation data may not be sensible for the whole range of water saturation for nearly saturated porous media the potential darcy flux is greater for medium to coarse soils than the maximum flux potentially caused by evaporation qks qeva pot for the same saturation conditions but for soils with a low hydraulic conductivity the evaporation experiments may yield reasonable results qeva qeva pot as the saturation of the porous media decreases the conductivity decreases greatly thus now the potential evaporation rate greatly exceeds the corresponding darcy flux in the samples qeva qeva pot moreover the water loss due to evaporation leads to a decrease in the saturation profile primarily in the upper millimeters and centimeters deeper tensiometers hardly register the initial drainage but only later stages when the desaturation propagates through the sample profile therefore the determination of k θ is most accurate once an appreciable pressure differences between the upper and lower tensiometer is available e g δh δz 1 5 nevertheless the conductivities values were calculated and shown for the whole experimental phases as expected at high water saturations macropores not fully drained the k values were unrealistic and highly variable gray shaded area in fig 6 with decreasing water content for almost all k curves the fluctuations ceased and realistic steadily decreasing k values were obtained this of course coincides with the water content pore water pressure at which the desaturation curves increased their slope 3 3 comparison of the methods the porosity and thus the maximum water saturation of each sample was determined at the conclusion of all experiments it may be assumed though that the saturation at the beginning of the respective percolation phases was somewhat below this maximum value due to entrapped air moreover the transition between ponded phase and percolation phase is not abrupt but gradual thus the selected exact starting time or water content of the percolation phase also slightly influenced the initial water content in addition the high suction applied during the xmso experiments might have caused a slight increase in the macropore ratio during the eva experiments in order to allow for a better comparison of the two methods in fig 7 the retention curves of the xmso method were shifted horizontally to coincide with the respective eva curves at a pressure head of approx 50 cm the shape of the curves remain of course unchanged a corresponding saturation shift was applied to the k θ curves in fig 7 the k θ curves are shown for the stable range only i e for condition where macropore flow does not contribute shifted curves are marked with 3 3 1 retention curves comparing the retention curves of the two methods for the four samples shows that the curves for module a the uppermost sample agree well at a suction range from 100 to 600 cm for the other modules the retention curves based on mso experiments show a steeper slope in the matrix sections than those based on eva experiments this could be due to the fact that these samples contain less sand and more clay and could indicate that higher clay contents yield higher uncertainties in the determination of retention curves another cause for the discrepancy could be the manner in which the pore water pressure was determined while the mso experiments are based on measurements on a single elevation sample middle the eva experiments are based on readings at two elevations assuming that the water content profile is not linear for samples of this height it was concluded that the data based on two tensiometers and thus the evaporation results are more accurate similar discrepancies between the two methods were reported by zhuang et al 2017 who compared the hanging water column method with the hyprop evaporation method peters and durner 2008 schindler et al 2010 for their small sandy samples the hyprop results indicated a higher saturated water content and a lower residual water content additionally the retention curves were in a more negative pressure range similar discrepancies were reported by schelle et al 2013 who compared a pressure plate method with the evaporation method hyprop both zhuang et al 2017 and schelle et al 2013 used small samples and attributed the reported discrepancies partially to sample size the samples used for the experiments reported in this work are large and undisturbed even considering macropores they may well be regarded as rev the results presented are thus more representative to real field conditions than most experiments reported in literature 3 3 2 hydraulic conductivity curves as discussed previously the evaporation experiments do not yield meaningful k θ curves for high saturations i e when the macropores are full thus in fig 7 for the eva method only values pertaining to matrix flow are shown starting point for the k θ curves thus range between water contents of 0 42 0 44 for the upper samples a b and at a water content of about 0 53 in the lower samples c d for water contents below these starting points the two curves generally agree very well module d being somewhat off though these starting points reflecting drained macropores and fully saturated matrix yield k θ values increasing from 0 2 cm d 1 to 0 5 cm d 1 for module a to module d these values agree well with conductivity values given in literature for loamy clay soils e g domenico and schwartz 1990 clapp and hornberger 1978 for water contents beyond these limits the hydraulic conductivities increased rapidly the xmso experiments yielded hydraulic conductivity values of up to k 100 cm d 1 clearly reflecting that in this case the macropore flow dominated the xmso method was not only more reliable at high saturations it also proved to be useful for very low saturations while schelle et al 2010 and durner and iden 2011 showed that the multistep outflow method works reliably they limited their suctions to 100 cm durner and iden 2011 and 140 cm schelle et al 2010 thus in order to describe a porous media for a full range of saturations they had to rely on model functions e g van genuchten 1980 or use methods which work in medium moist and dryer ranges schelle et al 2010 compared the eva method and the mso method based on the same samples however as their suction was too low the measured range of the two approaches did not overlap and hence a direct comparison was not possible the experiments of zhuang et al 2017 also did not allow a direct comparison since the multistep flux method was limited to a suction of 50 cm while for the hyprop method the suction ranged between 50 and 200 cm in agreement with van schaik et al 2010 who used suction steps up to 1000 cm the work presented in this paper shows that even for large undisturbed samples a suction of 600 cm is possible allowing for the xmso method a very wide saturation range without the necessity of extrapolation 3 3 3 macropore ratio as stated above the water content necessary to achieve a saturated hydraulic conductivity in the matrix increased from module a through module d this means that concurrently the macropore ratio decreased with depth tables 1 and 3 this decrease could be confirmed visually at the soil profile during excavation of the samples and when separating the initial soil column to obtain the four sample modules these findings agree with wang et al 2013 who reported wide cracks near the surface which became more narrow as a function of depth and eventually vanished in the soil matrix germer and braun 2015 showed in a similar soil profile from this site that the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased by a factor of two laloy at al 2010 tried to describe soil hydraulic properties of structured soil in a virtual mso experiments and concluded neglecting the first mso steps can result in a perfect match of the soil matrix behavior and the mv model while they also showed that the dual porosity approach of gerke and genuchten 1993 yielded a good description of their structured soil it has to be pointed out that dual porosity dual permeability models are based on a wide range of parameters making them much less user friendly as the nearly equally accurate free form approach soto et al 2017 fitted data obtained from a medium size sample containing macropores with a multi step outflow method by using the hydrus 1d software the single porosity model was only able to describe the soil hydraulic properties for a small macropore content but did not work for a larger one in contrast the free form approach shown in this study worked well although the soils did have very high macropore ratios 4 conclusion for double porosity soil pore water pressure head h θ and hydraulic conductivity k θ were determined using large undisturbed soil samples gained at different depths for each sample l 15 cm d 30 cm the above mentioned relations were determined using an extended multi step outflow xmso and after resaturation an evaporation eva experiment the vacuum driven xmso experiments took up to 60 days and yielded very good results for fully saturated samples as well as for conditions when macropores were drained but matrix saturation remained high however as the pressure applied was limited to 600 cm these experiments were not applicable for low water content the set up for the eva method is less intricate and the method is faster 10 to 35 days it however gives no realistic information for highly saturated conditions as there is no significant upward flow gradient in the sample for very dry soil 800 cm pressure head this method proved to be challenging as the tensiometers fell dry and or lost hydraulic contact to the surrounding matrix the following conclusions could be drawn during the drainage and mso phase unsaturated flow the simulated water pressure heads closely reproduced the experimental data during the preceding percolation phase this was not the case this is most likely because macropores have a much higher impact on flow of saturated porous media dual porosity than on unsaturated flow an evaluation of the transition between extension ponding and drainage phase for the xmso experiments showed that the macropore ratio decreased with depth the macropores are clearly reflected in the results of the eva experiments which showed two distinct sections during the macropore section the water in the macropores is being evaporated and thus while the saturation as a whole changes the actual porous media saturation remains very high during the subsequent matrix section capillary pressure increases with decreasing water content the retention curves of the xmso experiments show a steeper slope than those of the eva experiments assuming that the results of the eva experiments based on two tensiometers are more reliable this would indicate that the xmso experiments are negatively influenced by increasing clay content in the matrix the curves for hydraulic conductivity as a function of water content of the two methods agree very well however xmso is also reliable for higher saturation due to the large clay content the water content remained fairly high within the measuring range of the tensiometers thus these could not cover the full drainage cycle a practical problem for the evaluation were different initial conditions in the water content which resulted from resaturating between the experiments hysteresis moreover shrinkage cracks seemed to have an effect on the measurements overall the evaporation method was shown to be reliable and at the same time faster and less complicated in the experimental setup and in the experimental evaluation the sample height should be reduced 10 cm though to minimize non linear moisture distributions in the sample profile however if the soil exhibits a propensity to shrinkage high clay content the application of the eva method should be limited to fairly high water contents credit authorship contribution statement kai germer conceptualization methodology investigation visualization writing original draft jürgen braun conceptualization

6217,the real time operation of multi reservoir systems is a vital issue in the field of reservoir management the uncertainty caused by inflow forecasting means that risk analysis is necessary for such real time operation however differences in the length of the forecast periods for different reservoirs in the system are seldom considered in the risk analysis of multi reservoir systems this paper presents a two stage flood risk analysis method of multi reservoir systems that takes the differences in the length of forecast lead times into consideration the aim of the proposed method is to evaluate the uncertainty of the flood forecasting by dividing the operation horizon into the forecast lead time and the beyond forecast time period the risk within the forecast lead time is estimated by counting the frequency of failure numbers among all scenarios with the help of the scenario based forecasts the risk beyond the forecast time period is determined using reservoir flood routing with the design flood hydrographs which are selected according to the differences in the length of the forecast periods between any two reservoirs the proposed two stage risk analysis method is verified using stochastic simulations method based on monte carlo sampling a real time flood control operation model is established by taking the proposed two stage risk analysis method as a constraint china s ankang danjiangkou cascade reservoirs are considered as a case study and the results indicate that the proposed real time operation model can increase hydropower generation by 0 22 billion kwh during the summer flood season without increasing the flood risk in the multi reservoir system the proposed method enhances our understanding of risk management for the real time flood control operations in multi reservoir systems keywords risk analysis multi reservoir system real time operation two stage method 1 introduction reservoirs play an important role in the planning and management of water resources and the real time operation of multi reservoir systems is one of the most vital issues in the field of flood control management labadie 2004 liu et al 2011a ming et al 2017 wu and chen 2013 zhou et al 2018 reservoir real time operations generally involve decision making for future periods such as reservoir water level traces or the reservoir release process and are implemented on the basis of forecasted inflows huang et al 2018 kuo et al 1990 mesbah et al 2009 wu et al 2011 however the uncertainty caused by stochastic streamflow leads to a gap between the derived optimal decisions and the actual conditions liu et al 2015b yeh 1985 zhao et al 2011 zhu et al 2017 resulting in risk events e g underestimation of the magnitude of forecast inflow for reservoirs in the system therefore risk analysis must be conducted to quantify the uncertainties in the reservoir real time operation model of multi reservoir systems apel et al 2004 becker and yeh 1974 chen et al 2017 the risk analysis helps decision makers to balance the risk hazards and the profits of implementing reservoir real time operation liu et al 2015b plate 2002 many researchers have developed risk analysis methods for real time flood control operations these can be classified into analytical methods chen et al 2015a yan et al 2014 and numerical methods apel et al 2004 diao and wang 2010 analytical approaches analyze the risk through the probability density function of the uncertainties such as the first order second moment method using the stochastic differential equation method wu et al 2011 yan et al 2014 numerical methods employ stochastic simulations based on monte carlo sampling diao and wang 2010 kuo et al 1990 literature on risk analysis for the real time operation of multi reservoir systems is limited chen et al 2019 ouarda and labadie 2001 wei and hsu 2009 chen et al 2017 developed a decomposition integration risk analysis method by establishing several typical subsystem risk evaluation models chen et al 2019 presented a risk analysis model based on a dynamic bayesian network for real time flood control operations in a multi reservoir system their model consisted of three modules i e monte carlo simulations a dynamic bayesian network and risk informed inference for decision making ouarda and labadie 2001 proposed a chance constrained optimal control ccoc model to obtain the optimal operating policies for multi reservoir systems the ccoc model is equipped with the ability to select different operation schemes according to risk considerations for a multi reservoir system an analytical method for flood risk analysis is not easy to obtain because of the high dimensional and nonlinear joint probability density functions of the multiple uncertainties chen et al 2019 ouarda and labadie 2001 wei and hsu 2009 therefore the numerical method remains valuable for the research on the flood risk analysis of multi reservoir systems which is the basis for the motivation of this study differences in the length of the forecast period for different reservoirs in a system are seldom considered in the risk analysis of multi reservoir systems furthermore the abovementioned risk analysis methods for multi reservoir systems only estimate the risk in the forecast lead time period and they do not consider the possible risk beyond the forecast period for a single reservoir liu et al 2015b proposed a two stage method of quantitative flood risk analysis that divides the operation horizon into the forecast lead time and the consequent time period named as the beyond forecast time period thus a two stage method was adopted to bridge the gap between the forecast horizon and the entire real time operation horizon li et al 2018 liu et al 2015b zhao et al 2012 the primary purpose of this study was to propose a numerical flood risk analysis method for multi reservoir systems that considers the differences in the length of the forecast period for the different reservoirs the specific objectives were to propose a flood risk analysis method suitable for reservoirs in series systems by adopting a two stage method and to verify the proposed two stage risk analysis method using monte carlo simulations a novel real time flood control operation model was established by regarding the proposed two stage risk analysis method for multi reservoir systems as the main constraint this model was shown capable of achieving dynamic control of reservoir storages during the flood season the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the two stage method of flood risk analysis for multi reservoir systems the verification of the proposed two stage risk analysis method and the establishment of the real time flood control operation model section 3 introduces a case study of the ankang danjiangkou reservoirs finally the conclusions are given in section 4 2 methodology a two stage quantitative flood risk analysis

applying the two stage method to real time reservoir flood control operations is established in section 2 3 2 1 two stage flood risk analysis method for multi reservoir systems based on the two stage flood risk analysis method for a single reservoir system proposed by liu et al 2015b the future time period is divided into two stages by the forecast horizon point the forecast lead time i e stage 1 and the beyond forecast time period i e stage 2 in this study as shown in fig 1 for a two reservoir system in stage 1 the scenario based forecasts are used to derive the risk within forecast lead time i e the risk is defined as the frequency of the failure number among the forecast inflow hydrograph scenarios in stage 2 historical streamflow information is adopted for the beyond forecast time period because the inflow information beyond the forecast period is unknown therefore the design hydrographs are taken as the streamflow scenarios in stage 2 to represent the flood events that might possibly be faced in the future the risk in stage 2 that the release or the reservoir water level will be greater than critical values is derived by reservoir flood routing zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in particular this study takes the differences in the length of the forecast periods for each reservoir in the system into consideration the forecast inflow of the downstream reservoir is determined from channel flood routing using information on historical releases from the upstream reservoir and the forecast interval inflow between the two reservoirs the design hydrographs among reservoirs were selected according to the difference in the length of the forecast period between any two adjacent reservoirs which means the interval between the start time of the design hydrographs for two adjacent reservoirs should be in agreement with the difference in the length of their forecast periods as shown in fig 1 the length of the forecast lead time for the first reservoir is t f 1 and that for the second reservoir is t f 2 thus the difference in the length of the forecast period for these two reservoirs is t f 2 t f 1 then the difference in the start time of the design hydrographs for these two reservoirs should be in accord with t f 2 t f 1 meaning that the selection of typical flood hydrographs should take the differences in the start time into consideration to make full use of the forecast information provided by the reservoirs in the multi reservoir system 2 1 1 reservoir routing model the reservoir routing model is constructed on the basis of the water balance equation deng et al 2015 liu et al 2014 1 v t 1 k v t k i t k q t k δ t l t k where δ t is the time interval v t k is the storage value at time t of the kth reservoir k 1 2 n n is the number of reservoirs i t k and q t k denote the inflow and release of the kth reservoir during time period δ t respectively and l t k represents the water volume losses m 3 from the kth reservoir such as evaporation and seepage during the time period δ t these losses are assumed to be negligible in this study 2 1 2 risk within forecast lead time based on the scenario based forecast the risk within the forecast lead time is given by 2 r s 1 p k 1 n r k t h r e s h o l d k p k 1 n i k 1 m k r i k t k t h r e s h o l d k t t 1 t 2 t f k m k where m k is the number of scenarios for the kth reservoir threshol d k represents the kth reservoir s critical value which can be set to the maximum release threshold q ck or the maximum reservoir water level threshold z ck t f k is the end time of the forecast operation period and r i t k t h r e s h o l d k t t 1 t 2 t f k 1 r i t k t h r e s h o l d k t t 1 t 2 t f k 0 o t h e r w i s e is a binary variable for scenario i i e the value is equal to one if there exists any r i t k release q i t k or reservoir water level z i t k over the critical value otherwise the value is zero note that the value is equal to one even where there is more than one failure times i k 1 m k r i k t k t h r e s h o l d k t t 1 t 2 t f k indicates the number of scenarios where at least one of r i t k is greater than the critical value threshol d k the risk within the forecast lead time can then be calculated by deducing the joint probability of all reservoirs in the system 2 1 3 risk beyond forecast time period the risk beyond the forecast time is estimated by reservoir routing using the design flood hydrographs li et al 2010 liu et al 2015b as shown in fig 1 the reservoir water level at the end of the forecast lead time is assumed to be uncorrelated with future flood events after the forecast lead time period liu et al 2015b note that the initial reservoir water level for the reservoir routing in the stage 2 is set to the final reservoir water level in stage 1 thus the risk beyond the forecast time r s 2 can be written as 3 r s 2 i n 1 i n m n i n 1 1 i n 1 m n 1 i 1 1 i 1 m 1 r z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 z i n t f n n p z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 z i n t f n n i n 1 i n m n i n 1 1 i n 1 m n 1 i 1 1 i 1 m 1 r z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 z i n t f n n k 1 n m k where z i k t f k k is the reservoir water level of the kth reservoir at time t f k for scenario i k p z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 z i n t f n n represents the probability of the end water level being z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 z i n t f n n the value of p z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 z i n t f n n can be set as equal probability 1 k 1 n m k and r z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 z i n t f n n is the frequency of future flood events when the end water levels are z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 z i n t f n n the value of which can be derived by reservoir routing 2 1 4 entire risk the entire risk is regarded as the probability of failure events for all scenarios of the whole multi reservoir system as the operation period is divided into two stages the entire risk r ts can be described as the following sum 4 r ts r s 1 p r s 2 r s 1 p k 1 n i k 1 i k t k m k r i k t k t h r e s h o l d k t t 1 t 2 t f k m k i n 1 i n t n i n m n i n 1 1 i n 1 t n 1 i n 1 m n 1 i 1 1 i 1 t 1 i 1 m 1 r z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 z i n t f n n k 1 n m k where t k represents the set of scenarios in which at least one of r i t k release q i t k or reservoir water level z i t k is greater than the critical value for the kth reservoir the above estimated risk equation is based on the inflow scenarios the proposed risk is related to the flood protection standard which is described in terms of the return period therefore the given flood protection standard is regarded as the acceptable risk 2 2 verification for the two stage flood risk analysis method based on monte carlo experiments monte carlo method which is simple and commonly used for numerical experiments to produce random input samples data chen et al 2019 liu et al 2015b is adopted to verify the proposed floor risk analysis method framework of verification for the two stage flood risk analysis method is shown as fig 2 stochastic simulations for reservoirs in series allowing the generation of streamflow samples for multi reservoir systems are described in section 2 2 1 based on the streamflow samples two schemes are compared to verify the feasibility of the two stage flood risk analysis method in section 2 2 2 2 2 1 stochastic simulation of inflow for reservoirs in series a multisite stochastic simulation method is used to produce multiple stochastic simulation samples for reservoirs in series chen et al 2015b kumar et al 2000 mejia and rousselle 1976 we make the following considerations 1 a main site must first be selected from the multisite system this should be a site with a large basin control area and is usually the downstream flood control station of the whole multi reservoir system wang and ding 2007 the n upstream reservoirs in the system are named slave sites 2 the simulated streamflow of the main site is generated by two steps i randomly sampling n flood peak values or flood volume values from the frequency curves of the main site and ii deriving the design flood hydrographs by stochastically choosing the typical flood process from the observed streamflows of the main site the n simulated streamflow scenarios were derived in the same manner as the process of deducing the design floods and the same ratio magnification method was adopted the magnified ratio k main j for the main site at scenario j is expressed as follows 5 k main j w j d w j o where w j d is the maximum x day design flood volume value and w j o is the maximum x day flood volume value for the observed streamflow x can be set to 1 3 5 7 and so on 3 the simulated streamflows of slave sites are successively determined by choosing the corresponding typical flood process from the observed streamflow of the slave sites which naturally satisfies the flood encounter property of the reservoirs in the same basin area system 2 2 2 verification of the flood risk analysis method two cases are considered to verify the two stage flood risk analysis method based on the streamflow samples derived in section 2 2 1 1 the traditional risk statistic method case 1 the number of streamflow samples is n and the failure numbers f among these streamflow samples under regular reservoir operations are counted therefore the risk for this case is equal to f n 100 which should agree with the flood protection standard r accept of the multi reservoir system thus r accept f n 100 in case 1 2 the two stage flood risk analysis method case 2 the entire risk for the multi reservoir system is evaluated by the two stage flood risk analysis method based on eqs 1 4 the number of failure events under the reservoir storages decisions derived by the two stage flood risk analysis method e g establishing a real time flood control operation model based on the two stage flood risk analysis method in section 2 3 is f r and so the realistic flood risk r r f r n 100 the two stage flood risk analysis method is feasible if r r is not greater than r accept this means that the reservoir storage decisions made in case 2 will not increase the flood risk in other words the risk value assessed by the two stage method will not be underestimated 2 3 real time flood control operation model the two stage flood risk analysis method for multi reservoir systems can be applied to the real time flood control operation model as a constraint the rolling horizon approach was used to obtain the optimal reservoir release trajectory by combining the updated information from the rolling forecast li et al 2018 simonovic and burn 1989 zhao et al 2012 that is 1 when the current time is t 0 the optimal reservoir storage decision is made for the forecast horizon with the two stage flood risk analysis as a constraint 2 the current operation decisions are implemented for the decision horizon 3 the current time moves to the next period t 1 and the length of the future operation horizon is then reduced by the unit time interval δ t step 1 is repeated with the updated forecast streamflow information until the time reaches the end of the operation horizon t end 2 3 1 objective function the optimization objective function is expressed as the maximization of hydropower generation which is given by 6 max e total k 1 n e k v t 1 k v t 2 k v t f k k where v t k is the reservoir storage of the kth reservoir at time t f k t t 1 t 2 t f k e k is the kth reservoir s hydropower generation during the forecast operation period and e total denotes the total hydropower benefit for the whole multi reservoir system 2 3 2 constraints 1 two stage flood risk probability 7 r ts r accepted where the term r accepted is the flood protection standard for the multi reservoir system 2 reservoir storage limits 8 v min k v t k v max k where v min k and v max k are the minimum and maximum allowable reservoir storages of the kth reservoir during the flood season 3 release capacity limits 9 q t k q max k z t k where q max k z t k is the maximum discharge of the kth reservoir when the kth reservoir s water level is z t k at time t 4 inflow of the downstream reservoir 10 i t k f q t k 1 o t k where f is the channel flood routing function between the upstream and downstream reservoirs and o t k is the interval flow between the k 1 t h reservoir and the kth reservoir k 2 n 5 reservoir release fluctuation limits 11 q t k q t 1 k δ q m k where δ q m k is the allowable maximum release fluctuation of the kth reservoir the trust region reflective algorithm in matlab s optimization toolbox which returns the minimum of a nonlinear multivariate function is chosen as the optimization algorithm for the proposed real time flood control operation model 3 case study 3 1 study area and data the hanjiang river is the largest tributary of the yangtze river in china with a basin area of about 159 000 km2 the ankang and danjiangkou reservoirs lie adjacent to one another in the main stream of the hanjiang river see fig 3 the ankang danjiangkou reservoirs are taken as a case study the summer flood season for these two reservoirs runs from late june to late august the forecast lead time for the ankang reservoir is 6 h liu et al 2011b while that for the danjiangkou reservoir is 12 h duan et al 2018 in this case study the channel flood routing between these two reservoirs is considered by using a delay method with time lags the daily streamflow data from june 21 to august 20 over the 57 year period from 1954 to 2010 were selected as the base period dataset for the ankang reservoir danjiangkou reservoir and huangzhuang hydrological station the design floods were derived using the magnification method with respect to several typical flood hydrographs which is a method commonly used for the derivation of design floods for the case studies in china liu et al 2015a mwr 2006 zhang et al 2018 in this study six typical flood hydrographs from 1957 1978 1981 1983 1989 and 2010 were selected to derive the design floods zhang et al 2019 3 2 scenario based forecasts within the forecast period because of the limited data records sampling variability and model errors significant uncertainties exist in generating forecasted streamflow samples this means the uncertainties inherent in the data and methods cannot be avoided however this problem was not considered because this study used the forecasted streamflow samples as input for the flood risk analysis therefore a simple scenario based forecast method was adopted to generate the forecasted streamflow samples for the estimation of flood risk within the forecast period using the historical observed streamflow the observed reservoir inflow q ob was multiplied by random relative errors ε that followed a normal distribution i e ε ñ μ σ 2 and then the scenario based forecasts for the forecast lead time were generated bourdin et al 2014 peng et al 2017 wang et al 2012 the relative errors in the forecast lead time for the reservoirs in the system were determined in terms of their mean values and variances all mean values were zero because it was assumed that there was no systematic bias in the relative errors li et al 2018 therefore the random relative errors were determined only by their variance for the ankang reservoir the variance of the relative errors was 0 038 for a 6 h lead time liu et al 2011b while that for the danjiangkou reservoir was 0 021 for a 12 h lead time duan et al 2018 thus a forecast reservoir inflow scenario q f was produced by multiplying the historical observed streamflow by the corresponding relative errors i e q f q ob 1 ε fig 4 shows the scenario based forecast reservoir inflows of the ankang reservoir for the june 21 2010 observed streamflow with a forecast lead time of 6 h it should be noted that the cumulative errors have been omitted because the forecast streamflow was corrected in real time the forecast reservoir inflow scenarios for danjiangkou reservoir are similar to those in fig 4 and are therefore omitted from this paper 3 3 risk analysis beyond the forecast time period for the ankang danjiangkou reservoirs the risk beyond the forecast time r s 2 can be expressed as 12 r s 2 i n 1 i 2 m 2 i 1 1 i 1 m 1 r z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 p z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 i 2 1 i 2 m 2 i 1 1 i 1 m 1 r z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 m 1 m 2 where m 1 is the number of scenarios for the ankang reservoir m 2 is the number of scenarios for the danjiangkou reservoir both m 1 and m 2 were set to 100 in this study thus the total number of scenarios m 1 m 2 for this multi reservoir system was 10 000 and z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 are the water levels of the ankang and danjiangkou reservoirs respectively at the end of the forecast lead time the value of r z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 can be derived by reservoir routing with the design floods as the input streamflow the relationship between r s 2 and the end water level combination z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 was evaluated in advance to reduce the computation time for estimating the risk beyond the forecast time period which is shown in fig 5 the reservoir water level at the end of the forecast lead time for the ankang reservoir is assumed to range from 305 0 m to 330 0 m whereas that of the danjiangkou reservoir is assumed to range from 155 0 m to 170 0 m 3 4 result of verification for the flood risk analysis method 3 4 1 streamflow samples derived by stochastic simulation in this case study the huangzhuang hydrological station was chosen as the main site because it is the downstream flood control point for the whole multi reservoir system the ankang and danjiangkou reservoirs were denoted as the first and second slave sites respectively step 1 in section 2 2 1 setting n 10000 the maximum 7 day flood volumes i e w j d j 1 2 n for the main site were sampled from the pearson i i i frequency curves a commonly used frequency distribution in china of the huangzhuang hydrological station step 2 in section 2 2 1 table 1 presents the statistical parameter values and relative errors of the stochastic simulations for the main site and slave sites thus the design hydrograph samples of the ankang and danjiangkou reservoirs and the interval inflow between danjiangkou reservoir and huangzhuang station were deduced step 3 in section 2 2 1 3 4 2 verification results in the case study the term r accepted was found to be f n 100 10000 1 under the specified simulated streamflow scenarios step 1 in section 2 2 2 this was in agreement with the flood protection standard of the ankang danjiangkou reservoir system the realistic flood risk r r was found to be f r n 97 10000 0 97 based on the optimal decisions derived by the real time operation model in section 2 3 step 2 in section 2 2 2 therefore r r r accepted which means the risk value assessed by the two stage method is not an underestimate step 1 in section 2 2 2 3 5 result for the real time operation model the two stage flood risk analysis method for multi reservoir systems can be regarded as a constraint when applied to the dynamic control of reservoir storage during flood seasons specifically the optimal reservoir storage trajectories of the ankang and danjiangkou reservoirs were derived using the rolling horizon approach with the updated forecast information fig 6 shows the decision making process for the optimal operation of the ankang reservoir over the decision period 09 00 16 00 on july 24 2010 for example when the current time is 08 00 on this day the optimal decisions for the subsequent 6 h are shown by the red line with six new decision variables if the current time is moved to 09 00 only the first decision variable in the red line is adopted and the new optimal decisions for the subsequent 6 h become those shown by the orange line the above process was repeated until the end of the operation horizon giving the final optimal reservoir storage traces for the ankang reservoir as shown in fig 7 a because the decision making process for the optimal operation of the danjiangkou reservoir is similar to that in fig 6 these results are omitted table 2 and fig 7 describe the optimal reservoir operation for the ankang danjiangkou reservoirs system over the 2010 flood season the regular operation produced 1 33 billion kwh whereas the optimal operation would have produced 1 55 billion kwh without reducing the given flood protection standard which corresponds to the 1 design floods in fig 7 solid lines denote the reservoir storage traces under the regular scheme and dotted lines show the reservoir storage traces under the optimal scheme the dash dot lines show the inflow hydrographs of the reservoirs regarding the optimal reservoir storage traces the optimal decisions are performed to gain more hydropower benefit by increasing the release when the reservoir inflows are small see the condition for the time period from june 21 to july 16 or from july 31 to august 20 when the reservoir inflows are large the hydropower benefit is improved by increasing the hydropower head see the condition for the time period from july 16 31 4 conclusions real time flood control operations provide optimal decision making for future periods based on the forecast streamflow however risk events would arise because of uncertainties in the stochastic inflows and so risk analysis is vital for the real time operation models this study focused on the application of risk analysis methods to multi reservoir systems for the real time flood control operation the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 a two stage flood risk analysis method for a multi reservoir system was proposed this was based on a two stage quantitative flood risk analysis method for a single reservoir liu et al 2015b the proposed two stage flood risk analysis method divides the whole operation horizon into two parts i e the forecast horizon and the beyond forecast time horizon the risk within the forecast lead time was estimated by counting the frequency of the failure numbers among all scenarios with the help of the scenario based forecasts the risk beyond the forecast time period was determined using reservoir routing with design flood hydrographs the entire risk for the multi reservoir system was obtained by integrating the risk within the forecast lead time and the risk beyond the forecast time period 2 the proposed two stage risk analysis method for multi reservoir systems was verified using monte carlo simulations firstly the stochastic streamflow samples were generated using a multisite stochastic simulation method secondly the risk derived by the traditional risk statistic method was regarded as the acceptable risk level finally the entire risk for the multi reservoir system which was determined by the two stage flood risk analysis was verified to be not greater than the acceptable risk 3 a real time flood control operation model was established by taking the two stage risk analysis method for multi reservoir systems as a constraint the objective function of this model was to maximize the hydropower benefit the rolling horizon approach was used to obtain the optimal reservoir storage traces by combining the updated forecast information and the real time flood control operation model provided the optimal reservoir operation decisions in the case study the hydropower generation of the multi reservoir system is increased by 0 22 billion kwh during the summer flood season without increasing the flood risk in this study the application of the proposed two stage flood risk analysis method for a cascade reservoir system was demonstrated based on a two reservoir system in section 3 it can be generalized for a multi reservoir more than two system by conducting the same methodological process except for reestablishing the relationship between the risk beyond the forecast time period and the end water level combination for the reservoirs in the system only the uncertainty caused by stochastic streamflows was considered in this study thus further research should be conducted on the two stage flood risk analysis method that

6217,the real time operation of multi reservoir systems is a vital issue in the field of reservoir management the uncertainty caused by inflow forecasting means that risk analysis is necessary for such real time operation however differences in the length of the forecast periods for different reservoirs in the system are seldom considered in the risk analysis of multi reservoir systems this paper presents a two stage flood risk analysis method of multi reservoir systems that takes the differences in the length of forecast lead times into consideration the aim of the proposed method is to evaluate the uncertainty of the flood forecasting by dividing the operation horizon into the forecast lead time and the beyond forecast time period the risk within the forecast lead time is estimated by counting the frequency of failure numbers among all scenarios with the help of the scenario based forecasts the risk beyond the forecast time period is determined using reservoir flood routing with the design flood hydrographs which are selected according to the differences in the length of the forecast periods between any two reservoirs the proposed two stage risk analysis method is verified using stochastic simulations method based on monte carlo sampling a real time flood control operation model is established by taking the proposed two stage risk analysis method as a constraint china s ankang danjiangkou cascade reservoirs are considered as a case study and the results indicate that the proposed real time operation model can increase hydropower generation by 0 22 billion kwh during the summer flood season without increasing the flood risk in the multi reservoir system the proposed method enhances our understanding of risk management for the real time flood control operations in multi reservoir systems keywords risk analysis multi reservoir system real time operation two stage method 1 introduction reservoirs play an important role in the planning and management of water resources and the real time operation of multi reservoir systems is one of the most vital issues in the field of flood control management labadie 2004 liu et al 2011a ming et al 2017 wu and chen 2013 zhou et al 2018 reservoir real time operations generally involve decision making for future periods such as reservoir water level traces or the reservoir release process and are implemented on the basis of forecasted inflows huang et al 2018 kuo et al 1990 mesbah et al 2009 wu et al 2011 however the uncertainty caused by stochastic streamflow leads to a gap between the derived optimal decisions and the actual conditions liu et al 2015b yeh 1985 zhao et al 2011 zhu et al 2017 resulting in risk events e g underestimation of the magnitude of forecast inflow for reservoirs in the system therefore risk analysis must be conducted to quantify the uncertainties in the reservoir real time operation model of multi reservoir systems apel et al 2004 becker and yeh 1974 chen et al 2017 the risk analysis helps decision makers to balance the risk hazards and the profits of implementing reservoir real time operation liu et al 2015b plate 2002 many researchers have developed risk analysis methods for real time flood control operations these can be classified into analytical methods chen et al 2015a yan et al 2014 and numerical methods apel et al 2004 diao and wang 2010 analytical approaches analyze the risk through the probability density function of the uncertainties such as the first order second moment method using the stochastic differential equation method wu et al 2011 yan et al 2014 numerical methods employ stochastic simulations based on monte carlo sampling diao and wang 2010 kuo et al 1990 literature on risk analysis for the real time operation of multi reservoir systems is limited chen et al 2019 ouarda and labadie 2001 wei and hsu 2009 chen et al 2017 developed a decomposition integration risk analysis method by establishing several typical subsystem risk evaluation models chen et al 2019 presented a risk analysis model based on a dynamic bayesian network for real time flood control operations in a multi reservoir system their model consisted of three modules i e monte carlo simulations a dynamic bayesian network and risk informed inference for decision making ouarda and labadie 2001 proposed a chance constrained optimal control ccoc model to obtain the optimal operating policies for multi reservoir systems the ccoc model is equipped with the ability to select different operation schemes according to risk considerations for a multi reservoir system an analytical method for flood risk analysis is not easy to obtain because of the high dimensional and nonlinear joint probability density functions of the multiple uncertainties chen et al 2019 ouarda and labadie 2001 wei and hsu 2009 therefore the numerical method remains valuable for the research on the flood risk analysis of multi reservoir systems which is the basis for the motivation of this study differences in the length of the forecast period for different reservoirs in a system are seldom considered in the risk analysis of multi reservoir systems furthermore the abovementioned risk analysis methods for multi reservoir systems only estimate the risk in the forecast lead time period and they do not consider the possible risk beyond the forecast period for a single reservoir liu et al 2015b proposed a two stage method of quantitative flood risk analysis that divides the operation horizon into the forecast lead time and the consequent time period named as the beyond forecast time period thus a two stage method was adopted to bridge the gap between the forecast horizon and the entire real time operation horizon li et al 2018 liu et al 2015b zhao et al 2012 the primary purpose of this study was to propose a numerical flood risk analysis method for multi reservoir systems that considers the differences in the length of the forecast period for the different reservoirs the specific objectives were to propose a flood risk analysis method suitable for reservoirs in series systems by adopting a two stage method and to verify the proposed two stage risk analysis method using monte carlo simulations a novel real time flood control operation model was established by regarding the proposed two stage risk analysis method for multi reservoir systems as the main constraint this model was shown capable of achieving dynamic control of reservoir storages during the flood season the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the two stage method of flood risk analysis for multi reservoir systems the verification of the proposed two stage risk analysis method and the establishment of the real time flood control operation model section 3 introduces a case study of the ankang danjiangkou reservoirs finally the conclusions are given in section 4 2 methodology a two stage quantitative flood risk analysis method for reservoirs in series is proposed in section 2 1 section 2 2 describes how to verify the proposed two stage flood risk analysis method for a multi reservoir system an optimization model for applying the two stage method to real time reservoir flood control operations is established in section 2 3 2 1 two stage flood risk analysis method for multi reservoir systems based on the two stage flood risk analysis method for a single reservoir system proposed by liu et al 2015b the future time period is divided into two stages by the forecast horizon point the forecast lead time i e stage 1 and the beyond forecast time period i e stage 2 in this study as shown in fig 1 for a two reservoir system in stage 1 the scenario based forecasts are used to derive the risk within forecast lead time i e the risk is defined as the frequency of the failure number among the forecast inflow hydrograph scenarios in stage 2 historical streamflow information is adopted for the beyond forecast time period because the inflow information beyond the forecast period is unknown therefore the design hydrographs are taken as the streamflow scenarios in stage 2 to represent the flood events that might possibly be faced in the future the risk in stage 2 that the release or the reservoir water level will be greater than critical values is derived by reservoir flood routing zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in particular this study takes the differences in the length of the forecast periods for each reservoir in the system into consideration the forecast inflow of the downstream reservoir is determined from channel flood routing using information on historical releases from the upstream reservoir and the forecast interval inflow between the two reservoirs the design hydrographs among reservoirs were selected according to the difference in the length of the forecast period between any two adjacent reservoirs which means the interval between the start time of the design hydrographs for two adjacent reservoirs should be in agreement with the difference in the length of their forecast periods as shown in fig 1 the length of the forecast lead time for the first reservoir is t f 1 and that for the second reservoir is t f 2 thus the difference in the length of the forecast period for these two reservoirs is t f 2 t f 1 then the difference in the start time of the design hydrographs for these two reservoirs should be in accord with t f 2 t f 1 meaning that the selection of typical flood hydrographs should take the differences in the start time into consideration to make full use of the forecast information provided by the reservoirs in the multi reservoir system 2 1 1 reservoir routing model the reservoir routing model is constructed on the basis of the water balance equation deng et al 2015 liu et al 2014 1 v t 1 k v t k i t k q t k δ t l t k where δ t is the time interval v t k is the storage value at time t of the kth reservoir k 1 2 n n is the number of reservoirs i t k and q t k denote the inflow and release of the kth reservoir during time period δ t respectively and l t k represents the water volume losses m 3 from the kth reservoir such as evaporation and seepage during the time period δ t these losses are assumed to be negligible in this study 2 1 2 risk within forecast lead time based on the scenario based forecast the risk within the

within the forecast lead time can then be calculated by deducing the joint probability of all reservoirs in the system 2 1 3 risk beyond forecast time period the risk beyond the forecast time is estimated by reservoir routing using the design flood hydrographs li et al 2010 liu et al 2015b as shown in fig 1 the reservoir water level at the end of the forecast lead time is assumed to be uncorrelated with future flood events after the forecast lead time period liu et al 2015b note that the initial reservoir water level for the reservoir routing in the stage 2 is set to the final reservoir water level in stage 1 thus the risk beyond the forecast time r s 2 can be written as 3 r s 2 i n 1 i n m n i n 1 1 i n 1 m n 1 i 1 1 i 1 m 1 r z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 z i n t f n n p z

kth reservoir at time t f k for scenario i k p z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 z i n t f n n represents the probability of the end water level being z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 z i n t f n n the value of p z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 z i n t f n n can be set as equal probability 1 k 1 n m k and r z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 z i n t f n n is the frequency of future flood events when the end water levels are z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 z i n t f n n the value of which can be derived by reservoir routing 2 1 4 entire risk the entire risk is regarded as the probability of failure events for all scenarios of the whole multi reservoir system as the operation period is divided into two stages the entire risk r ts can be described as the following sum 4 r ts r s 1 p r s 2 r s 1 p k 1 n i k 1 i k t k m k r i k t k t h r e s h o l d k t t 1 t 2 t f k m k i n 1 i n t n i n m n i n 1 1 i n 1 t n 1 i n 1 m n 1 i 1 1 i 1 t 1 i 1 m 1 r z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 z i n t f n n k 1 n m k where t k represents the set of scenarios in which at least one of r i t k release q i t k or reservoir water level z i t k is greater than the critical value for the kth reservoir the above estimated risk equation is based on the inflow scenarios the proposed risk is related to the flood protection standard which is described in terms of the return period therefore the given flood protection standard is regarded as the acceptable risk 2 2 verification for the two stage flood risk analysis method based on monte carlo experiments monte carlo method which is simple and commonly used for numerical experiments to produce random input samples data chen et al 2019 liu et al 2015b is adopted to verify the proposed floor risk analysis method framework of verification for the two stage flood risk analysis method is shown as fig 2 stochastic simulations for reservoirs in series allowing the generation of streamflow samples for multi reservoir systems are described in section 2 2 1 based on the streamflow samples two schemes are compared to verify the feasibility of the two stage flood risk analysis method in section 2 2 2 2 2 1 stochastic simulation of inflow for reservoirs in series a multisite stochastic simulation method is used to produce multiple stochastic simulation samples for reservoirs in series chen et al 2015b kumar et al 2000 mejia and rousselle 1976 we make the following considerations 1 a main site must first be selected from the multisite system this should be a site with a large basin control area and is usually the downstream flood control station of the whole multi reservoir system wang and ding 2007 the n upstream reservoirs in the system are named slave sites 2 the simulated streamflow of the main site is generated by two steps i randomly sampling n flood peak values or flood volume values from the frequency curves of the main site and ii deriving the design flood hydrographs by stochastically choosing the typical flood process from the observed streamflows of the main site the n simulated streamflow scenarios were derived in the same manner as the process of deducing the design floods and the same ratio magnification method was adopted the magnified ratio k main j for the main site at scenario j is expressed as follows 5 k main j w j d w j o where w j d is the maximum x day design flood volume value and w j o is the maximum x day flood volume value for the observed streamflow x can be set to 1 3 5 7 and so on 3 the simulated streamflows of slave sites are successively determined by choosing the corresponding typical flood process from the observed streamflow of the slave sites which naturally satisfies the flood encounter property of the reservoirs in the same basin area system 2 2 2 verification of the flood risk analysis method two cases are considered to verify the two stage flood risk analysis method based on the streamflow samples derived in section 2 2 1 1 the traditional risk statistic method case 1 the number of streamflow samples is n and the failure numbers f among these streamflow samples under regular reservoir operations are counted therefore the risk for this case is equal to f n 100 which should agree with the flood protection standard r accept of the multi reservoir system thus r accept f n 100 in case 1 2 the two stage flood risk analysis method case 2 the entire risk for the multi reservoir system is evaluated by the two stage flood risk analysis method based on eqs 1 4 the number of failure events under the reservoir storages decisions derived by the two stage flood risk analysis method e g establishing a real time flood control operation model based on the two stage flood risk analysis method in section 2 3 is f r and so the realistic flood risk r r f r n 100 the two stage flood risk analysis method is feasible if r r is not greater than r accept this means that the reservoir storage decisions made in case 2 will not increase the flood risk in other words the risk value assessed by the two stage method will not be underestimated 2 3 real time flood control operation model the two stage flood risk analysis method for multi reservoir systems can be applied to the real time flood control operation model as a constraint the rolling horizon approach was used to obtain the optimal reservoir release trajectory by combining the updated information from the rolling forecast li et al 2018 simonovic and burn 1989 zhao et al 2012 that is 1 when the current time is t 0 the optimal reservoir storage decision is made for the forecast horizon with the two stage flood risk analysis as a constraint 2 the current operation decisions are implemented for the decision horizon 3 the current time moves to the next period t 1 and the length of the future operation horizon is then reduced by the unit time interval δ t step 1 is repeated with the updated forecast streamflow information until the time reaches the end of the operation horizon t end 2 3 1 objective function the optimization objective function is expressed as the maximization of hydropower generation which is given by 6 max e total k 1 n e k v t 1 k v t 2 k v t f k k where v t k is the reservoir storage of the kth reservoir at time t f k t t 1 t 2 t f k e k is the kth reservoir s hydropower generation during the forecast operation period and e total denotes the total hydropower benefit for the whole multi reservoir system 2 3 2 constraints 1 two stage flood risk probability 7 r ts r accepted where the term r accepted is the flood protection standard for the multi reservoir system 2 reservoir storage limits 8 v min k v t k v max k where v min k and v max k are the minimum and maximum allowable reservoir storages of the kth reservoir during the flood season 3 release capacity limits 9 q t k q max k z t k where q max k z t k is the maximum discharge of the kth reservoir when the kth reservoir s water level is z t k at time t 4 inflow of the downstream reservoir 10 i t k f q t k 1 o t k where f is the channel flood routing function between the upstream and downstream reservoirs and o t k is the interval flow between the k 1 t h reservoir and the kth reservoir k 2 n 5 reservoir release fluctuation limits 11 q t k q t 1 k δ q m k where δ q m k is the allowable maximum release fluctuation of the kth reservoir the trust region reflective algorithm in matlab s optimization toolbox which returns the minimum of a nonlinear multivariate function is chosen as the optimization algorithm for the proposed real time flood control operation model 3 case study 3 1 study area and data the hanjiang river is the largest tributary of the yangtze river in china with a basin area of about 159 000 km2 the ankang and danjiangkou reservoirs lie adjacent to one another in the main stream of the hanjiang river see fig 3 the ankang danjiangkou reservoirs are taken as a case study the summer flood season for these two reservoirs runs from late june to late august the forecast lead time for the ankang reservoir is 6 h liu et al 2011b while that for the danjiangkou reservoir is 12 h duan et al 2018 in this case study the channel flood routing between these two reservoirs is considered by using a delay method with time lags the daily streamflow data from june 21 to august 20 over the 57 year period from 1954 to 2010 were selected as the base period dataset for the ankang reservoir danjiangkou reservoir and huangzhuang hydrological station the design floods were derived using the magnification method with respect to several typical flood hydrographs which is a method commonly used for the derivation of design floods for the case studies in china liu et al 2015a mwr 2006 zhang et al 2018 in this study six typical flood hydrographs from 1957 1978 1981 1983 1989 and 2010 were selected to derive the design floods zhang et al 2019 3 2 scenario based forecasts within the forecast period because of the limited data records sampling variability and model errors significant uncertainties exist in generating forecasted streamflow samples this means the uncertainties inherent in the data and methods cannot be avoided however this problem was not considered because this study used the forecasted streamflow samples as input for the flood risk analysis therefore a simple scenario based forecast method was adopted to generate the forecasted streamflow samples for the estimation of flood risk within the forecast period using the historical observed streamflow the observed reservoir inflow q ob was multiplied by random relative errors ε that followed a normal distribution i e ε ñ μ σ 2 and then the scenario based forecasts for the forecast lead time were generated bourdin et al 2014 peng et al 2017 wang et al 2012 the relative errors in the forecast lead time for the reservoirs in the system were determined in terms of their mean values and variances all mean values were zero because it was assumed that there was no systematic bias in the relative errors li et al 2018 therefore the random relative errors were determined only by their variance for the ankang reservoir the variance of the relative errors was 0 038 for a 6 h lead time liu et al 2011b while that for the danjiangkou reservoir was 0 021 for a 12 h lead time duan et al 2018 thus a forecast reservoir inflow scenario q f was produced by multiplying the historical observed streamflow by the corresponding relative errors i e q f q ob 1 ε fig 4 shows the scenario based forecast reservoir inflows of the ankang reservoir for the june 21 2010 observed streamflow with a forecast lead time of 6 h it should be noted that the cumulative errors have been omitted because the forecast streamflow was corrected in real time the forecast reservoir inflow scenarios for danjiangkou reservoir are similar to those in fig 4 and are therefore omitted from this paper 3 3 risk analysis beyond the forecast time period for the ankang danjiangkou reservoirs the risk beyond the forecast time r s 2 can be expressed as 12 r s 2 i n 1 i 2 m 2 i 1 1 i 1 m 1 r z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 p z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 i 2 1 i 2 m 2 i 1 1 i 1 m 1 r z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 m 1 m 2 where m 1 is the number of scenarios for the ankang reservoir m 2 is the number of scenarios for the danjiangkou reservoir both m 1 and m 2 were set to 100 in this study thus the total number of scenarios m 1 m 2 for this multi reservoir system was 10 000 and z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 are the water levels of the ankang and danjiangkou reservoirs respectively at the end of the forecast lead time the value of r z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 can be derived by reservoir routing with the design floods as the input streamflow the relationship between r s 2 and the end water level combination z i 1 t f 1 1 z i 2 t f 2 2 was evaluated in advance to reduce the computation time for estimating the risk beyond the forecast time period which is shown in fig 5 the reservoir water level at the end of the forecast lead time for the ankang reservoir is assumed to range from 305 0 m to 330 0 m whereas that of the danjiangkou reservoir is assumed to range from 155 0 m to 170 0 m 3 4 result of verification for the flood risk analysis method 3 4 1 streamflow samples derived by stochastic simulation in this case study the huangzhuang hydrological station was chosen as the main site because it is the downstream flood control point for the whole multi reservoir system the ankang and danjiangkou reservoirs were denoted as the first and second slave sites respectively step 1 in section 2 2 1 setting n 10000 the maximum 7 day flood volumes i e w j d j 1 2 n for the main site were sampled from the pearson i i i frequency curves a commonly used frequency distribution in china of the huangzhuang hydrological station step 2 in section 2 2 1 table 1 presents the statistical parameter values and relative errors of the stochastic simulations for the main site and slave sites thus the design hydrograph samples of the ankang and danjiangkou reservoirs and the interval inflow between danjiangkou reservoir and huangzhuang station were deduced step 3 in section 2 2 1 3 4 2 verification results in the case study the term r accepted was found to be f n 100 10000 1 under the specified simulated streamflow scenarios step 1 in section 2 2 2 this was in agreement with the flood protection standard of the ankang danjiangkou reservoir system the realistic flood risk r r was found to be f r n 97 10000 0 97 based on the optimal decisions derived by the real time operation model in section 2 3 step 2 in section 2 2 2 therefore r r r accepted which means the risk value assessed by the two stage method is not an underestimate step 1 in section 2 2 2 3 5 result for the real time operation model the two stage flood risk analysis method for multi reservoir systems can be regarded as a constraint when applied to the dynamic control of reservoir storage during flood seasons specifically the optimal reservoir storage trajectories of the ankang and danjiangkou reservoirs were derived using the rolling horizon approach with the updated forecast information fig 6 shows the decision making process for the optimal operation of the ankang reservoir over the decision period 09 00 16 00 on july 24 2010 for example when the current time is 08 00 on this day the optimal decisions for the subsequent 6 h are shown by the red line with six new decision variables if the current time is moved to 09 00 only the first decision variable in the red line is adopted and the new optimal decisions for the subsequent 6 h become those shown by the orange line the above process was repeated until the end of the operation horizon giving the final optimal reservoir storage traces for the ankang reservoir as shown in fig 7 a because the decision making process for the optimal operation of the danjiangkou reservoir is similar to that in fig 6 these results are omitted table 2 and fig 7 describe the optimal reservoir operation for the ankang danjiangkou reservoirs system over the 2010 flood season the regular operation produced 1 33 billion kwh whereas the optimal operation would have produced 1 55 billion kwh without reducing the given flood protection standard which corresponds to the 1 design floods in fig 7 solid lines denote the reservoir storage traces under the regular scheme and dotted lines show the reservoir storage traces under the optimal scheme the dash dot lines show the inflow hydrographs of the reservoirs regarding the optimal reservoir storage traces the optimal decisions are performed to gain more hydropower benefit by increasing the release when the reservoir inflows are small see the condition for the time period from june 21 to july 16 or from july 31 to august 20 when the reservoir inflows are large the hydropower benefit is improved by increasing the hydropower head see the condition for the time period from july 16 31 4 conclusions real time flood control operations provide optimal decision making for future periods based on the forecast streamflow however risk events would arise because of uncertainties in the stochastic inflows and so risk analysis is vital for the real time operation models this study focused on the application of risk analysis methods to multi reservoir systems for the real time flood control operation the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 a two stage flood risk analysis method for a multi reservoir system was proposed this was based on a two stage quantitative flood risk analysis method for a single reservoir liu et al 2015b the proposed two stage flood risk analysis method divides the whole operation horizon into two parts i e the forecast horizon and the beyond forecast time horizon the risk within the forecast lead time was estimated by counting the frequency of the failure numbers among all scenarios with the help of the scenario based forecasts the risk beyond the forecast time period was determined using reservoir routing with design flood hydrographs the entire risk for the multi reservoir system was obtained by integrating the risk within the forecast lead time and the risk beyond the forecast time period 2 the proposed two stage risk analysis method for multi reservoir systems was verified using monte carlo simulations firstly the stochastic streamflow samples were generated using a multisite stochastic simulation method secondly the risk derived by the traditional risk statistic method was regarded as the acceptable risk level finally the entire risk for the multi reservoir system which was determined by the two stage flood risk analysis was verified to be not greater than the acceptable risk 3 a real time flood control operation model was established by taking the two stage risk analysis method for multi reservoir systems as a constraint the objective function of this model was to maximize the hydropower benefit the rolling horizon approach was used to obtain the optimal reservoir storage traces by combining the updated forecast information and the real time flood control operation model provided the optimal reservoir operation decisions in the case study the hydropower generation of the multi reservoir system is increased by 0 22 billion kwh during the summer flood season without increasing the flood risk in this study the application of the proposed two stage flood risk analysis method for a cascade reservoir system was demonstrated based on a two reservoir system in section 3 it can be generalized for a multi reservoir more than two system by conducting the same methodological process except for reestablishing the relationship between the risk beyond the forecast time period and the end water level combination for the reservoirs in the system only the uncertainty caused by stochastic streamflows was considered in this study thus further research should be conducted on the two stage flood risk analysis method that

6218,the local approximation prediction model lpm is a forecasting approach based on chaos theory it uses the euclidean distance to evaluate the spatial proximity between two phase points which is a measure of quantity similarity this study improved lpm by proposing a coupled quantity pattern similarity model cqpsm the pattern similarity is defined as the similarity of two phase points on internal structure and measured by a cumulative unit step function the forbearing stratified sequencing method is employed to solve the double objective optimization problem the proposed model was tested using the data from the danjiangkou reservoir basin for future 12 monthly precipitation forecasting with lead times from a month to a year four performance measures r rmse mare and nse were computed and compared to those of lpm and autoregressive ar model the results show a better performance of cqpsm and indicates the importance of considering pattern similarity between two phase points moreover the weighted euclidean distance based on partial information logic was discussed and applied to further improve the quantity similarity consequently the proposed cqpsm could provide a new alternative for hydrological forecasting keywords chaos theory phase space reconstruction coupled quantity pattern similarity model cumulative unit step function forbearing stratified sequencing method weighted euclidean distance 1 introduction reliable and accurate hydrological forecasting plays a vital role in potential flood risks reduction generating greater benefits of hydropower production and improving water resources management li et al 2019 wanders and wada 2015 traditionally two broad approaches have been employed in hydrological research deterministic and stochastic for most hydrological systems and processes both the deterministic approach and stochastic approach are complementary to each other thus chaos theory that can couple these two and serve as a middle ground would often be more appropriate sivakumar 2011 this paper developed the concept of quantity and pattern similarity to improve the classical local approximation prediction model lpm based on chaos theory the quantity similarity refers to the euclidean distance criterion that commonly used in lpm whereas the pattern similarity refers to the similarity of two phase points on internal structure this model takes the phase reconstruction parameters from chaos theory and its prediction algorithm is improved by considering the coupled quantity and pattern similarity of phase points the performance of cqpsm is then compared with two benchmark models of i lpm and ii autoregressive model ar data driven approaches have been widely used in hydrological forecasting such as artificial neural network ann edossa and babel 2011 random forest algorithm rf liang et al 2017a b support vector machine svm kisi and cimen 2011 and adaptive nero fuzzy inference system anfis khatibi et al 2011 there are two categories of data driven methods according to the corresponding factors one category is single factor forecasting which is based on the evolution of the hydrological sequence itself liang et al 2017a b the other category is multifactor forecasting which is built on the relationships exist between hydrological response and large scale climate elements with the climate elements separately forecasted by a dynamical model in recent decades many contemporary soft computing techniques have been used to enhance the understanding of hydrological process and have obtained some notable results xiao et al 2019 alizadeh et al 2017 kan et al 2016 chaos theory has been introduced to the field of hydrological forecasting in recent years and related studies have provided convincing evidence that chaos exists in hydrological data sets koutsoyiannis and pachakis 1996 puente and obregon 1996 sivakumar et al 1998 sivakumar et al 2001 applied a local polynomial approach based on phase space reconstruction to predict monthly runoff at the basin of coaracy nunes araguari river in northern brazil and observed satisfactory model performance sivakumar et al 2002 employed a nonlinear forecasting method to forecast the daily flow dynamics of chao phraya river in thailand phoon et al 2002 proposed a practical inverse approach for optimal selection of parameters involved in phase space reconstruction chaos identification and forecasting damle and yalcin 2007 developed a time series data mining approach for river flood forecasting which combined chaos theory and data mining technique zhang et al 2009 investigated the single point model multipoint model linear model and three parameter of local similarity model based on phase space reconstruction for long term runoff forecasting ghorbani et al 2018 integrated multigene genetic programming with chaos theory to develop a new hybrid model for river flow forecasting the research of chaos began with the french scientist henri poincare in 1903 while studying the three body problem he found it produced obvious random results in 1963 the american meteorologist lorenz 1963 investigated a system of three first order differential equations whose solutions were unstable and non periodic henton 1964 observed a simple mapping tend toward a strange attractor appearing to have the same basic properties as the lorenz system ruelle and takens 1971 first proposed chaos to describe the formation mechanism of turbulence and proved by rigorous mathematical analysis that there was a strange attractor in the dynamical system their remarkable work contributes to the birth of chaos theory li and yorke 1975 revealed the evolution from order to chaos and proposed li yorke theorem in the 1980s with the introduction of phase space reconstruction and statistical features of strange attractor such as lyapunov exponent kolmogorov entropy and fractal dimension chaos theory enters practical application stage since chaotic motion is widely encountered in various complex nonlinear systems predicting the evolution trends of chaotic systems from observations has become a pressing challenge loskutov et al 2008 qu et al 2014 in recent years many chaotic prediction approaches have been proposed and can be classified as two main categories global and local methods global methods approximate entire time series based on all attractors and yield a function valid at every point local methods only use some past information to approximate the local attractors and future values can be inferred based on the neighborhoods of the concerned phase point su 2010 dhanya and kumar 2010 previous studies indicated that local prediction methods can provide better performance farmer and sidorowichl 1988 li and zhang 2005 local prediction methods use only a limited number of neighbors in the reconstructed phase space there are two major classes of local methods those applying neighbor samples directly in the prediction and those fitting a function locally to the neighbors basing the prediction on the estimated function bjørn et al 1994 farmer and sidorowich 1987 first put forward to construct a local predictor by the nearest neighbor points such as zeroth order approximation first order approximation and linear approximation they did not observe significant improvements moving to higher order linsay 1991 put forward the linear interpolation method for forecasting chaotic time series another variant is to take the nearest neighbors and use the average of their state mappings as the predictor mcnames 2002 the k nearest neighbors is widely used in chaotic techniques which is introduced in farmer and sidorowich 1987 in this approach a future value can be approximately predicted from the evolution of k vectors or phase points called nearest neighbors which are chosen according to some closeness metrics such as euclidean distance kulesh et al 2008 the euclidean distance metric can also be regarded as similarity evaluation of phase points in fact this criterion is a measure of quantity similarity the similarity of two phase points involves not only the quantity similarity but also the similarity of internal structure between the two phase points the latter can be defined as pattern similarity both similarity degree measures should be considered but most previous studies only focused on quantity similarity even if the degree of quantity similarity is high there may be evident difference in the pattern similarity which will significantly influence the analysis results to overcome this drawback we developed an improved chaos similarity model coupled quantity pattern similarity model for hydrological prediction through the integration of both quantity and pattern similarity measures 2 methodology 2 1 phase space reconstruction theory psr as the basis of chaos system analysis phase space reconstruction provides a simplified multi dimensional representation of a one dimensional nonlinear time series and further reveals the hidden information of the original time series packard et al 1980 proposed a method of delays to reconstruct the phase space that was mathematically introduced by takens 1981 given a scalar time series e g a runoff or precipitation series x 1 x 2 x n a multi dimensional phase space can be expressed as follows 1 y i x i x i τ x i m 1 τ i 1 2 n where n n m 1 τ m is the dimension of the vector y i defined as the embedding dimension and τ is the delay time packard et al 1980 takens 1981 the crucial problem is to determine the appropriate embedding dimension m and delay time τ because they directly affect the accuracy of the feature of the strange attractor after phase space reconstruction various algorithms are now available to estimate m and τ of a time series the autocorrelation function acf is popular for its simplicity and practicability holzfuss and mayer kress 1986 and there are other methods such as the mutual information method fraser and swinney 1986 and the correlation integral method liebert and schuster 1989 for a discrete time series x i where i 1 2 n and for different delay times τ the acf is calculated as follows 2 r τ 1 n i 0 n 1 x i x i τ the use of acf to describing the dynamic properties of time series lies in its ability to determine the degree of dependence present in the values if τ is too small the phase space coordinates may not be independent leading to information loss regarding characteristics of attractor structure whereas if τ is too large there may be no dynamic correlation between the state vectors since the neighboring trajectory divergence would result in information loss for the original system dhanya and kumar 2010 commonly the corresponding time when the acf first reaches zero is set as the delay time τ this approach guarantees a minimum correlation among the embedding coordinates holzfuss and mayer kress 1986 the grassberger procaccia algorithm grassberger 1983 is used widely to estimate m for a time series for a given vector norm radius of a sphere r the proportion of the points with a distance less than r is used to defined as the correlation function cm r 3 c m r 1 n 2 i j 1 n h r y i y j where n is the number of phase points and f is the heaviside step function with h u 1 for u 0 and h u 0 for u 0 additionally u r y i y j and y i y j denotes the distance of the ith and jth phase points 4 h u 0 u 0 1 u 0 cm r is the correlation function of the attractor which describes the probability of a distance between the phase points being less than r the correlation dimension d reflects the self similar structure of the chaotic attractor which is given by the following equation 5 d lim r 0 log c m r l o g r the behavior of d provides one technique for determining the presence of chaos in a time series khatibi et al 2012 if the d saturates to a constant value even with increasing of the embedding dimension m the sequence is considered to exhibit chaotic behavior and the corresponding m can be used as the optimal embedding dimension 2 2 prediction models 2 2 1 autoregressive model ar the autoregressive model ar p a traditional statistical model is the simplest and one of the most widely used method in box jenkins models which is a special case of the arima model arima p 0 0 in this study ar p model is used as a benchmark model to lpm an ar model of order p predicts the current value of a time series based on the weighted sum of p previous values of the process plus a random shock ar p models purely autoregressive models can be expressed as follows 6 z t φ 1 z t 1 φ 2 z t 2 φ p z t p a t where φ 1 φ 2 φ p are model parameters and a t is the random component of the data that follows a normal distribution with mean 0 the autocorrelation functions acf and partial autocorrelation functions pcf are used to identify plausible ar p models and the model diagnostic is performed by the final prediction error fpe akaike 1969 akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 and bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 in this study 7 fpe n p 1 n p 1 1 n t 1 n z t z t p 2 8 aic 2 log l 2 p 9 bic 2 in l p log n where p represents the order of ar model n is the length of the time series l denotes the maximum likelihood estimator based on the assumed ar p model the optimal ar p model is obtained when the criterion functions reach their minimum value craparo et al 2015 dastorani et al 2016 2 2 2 local approximation prediction model lpm takens theorem takens 1981 states that a correct phase space reconstruction of dimension m allows one to interpret the underlying dynamics in the form of a m dimensional map f as follows 10 y t t f y t where t is the prediction step which can also be regarded as the lead time in hydrological forecasting y t t and y t are vectors of dimension m that describe the state of the system at time t t future state and t current state respectively the key task is to identify an appropriate expression of f and the local approximation prediction model lpm is used to solve the problem in this study the essence of lpm is to predict y t t by y t reflecting the evolution of a dynamic system assume that if the nearest phase point of y t in the phase space is y t then y t t can be predicted through y t t in practical applications k phase points can be searched and averaged for the prediction of y t t herein y t t is determined by the similar phase points as follows zhang et al 2009 11 y t t i 1 k φ i y i t t i 1 k where k is the number of similar phase points commonly k m 1 and m is the embedding dimension of phase space y i t is a point similar to y t and φi is the weight of y i t in general equal weights φi 1 k can be used the euclidean distance d is commonly used to evaluate the similarity between phase points y i t and y t in lpm 12 d y i t y t the smaller the distance the greater is the similarity degree for hydrological prediction taking monthly precipitation forecasting as an example each phase point consists of m monthly precipitation values or m dimensional coordinates for the two phase points y t 1 x 1 x 2 xm and y t 2 x 1 x 2 x m the euclidean distance of y t 1 and y t 2 represents their quantity similarity as shown in fig 1 a thus the euclidean distance criterion is used to evaluate the similarity degree of monthly precipitation for each dimension pair which is the quantity similarity in nature building on the above traditional similarity approach the paper offers the following three variations for improvement i coupled quantity pattern similarity model cqpsm ii improved quantity similarity model iqsm based on weighted euclidean distance and iii improved coupling quantity pattern similarity model icqpsm based on weighted euclidean distance 2 2 3 the coupled quantity pattern similarity model cqpsm the lpm model selects similar phase points according to euclidean distance quantity similarity criterion which considers the integral similarity of the phase points however even the euclidean distance of the points pair are equal there may still exist huge difference in points internal structure for example it can be seen from fig 1 b that although the euclidean distance of blue phase point and red phase point to green point y t 0 x 1 x 2 x m are equal the changing trends of blue and red points over dimension are completely different having significant impact on the results therefore the euclidean distance is regarded as quantity similarity and the concept of pattern similarity is introduced to evaluate the similarity in points internal structure this study expounds the limitation of the euclidean distance as the measure of points similarity and improves the original model through a coupled quantity pattern similarity model the pattern similarity is defined as the similarity degree of internal structure of two phase points for the phase points y t 1 x 1 x 2 xm and y t 2 x 1 x 2 x m a cumulative unit step function is defined to identify the pattern similarity between the phase points 13 c o n j x j x j 1 x j x j 1 14 s c o r e j 0 c o n j 0 1 c o n j 0 where j is the number of embedding dimensions con j represents the trends of the coordinates value of the phase points if the same trends exist for both points con j is positive and vice versa it is noteworthy that principally we can build the equation across all j s and then the sum the results to reflect the integral structure of the phase points in this paper the pattern similarity only considers the influence of the most adjacent dimension and the similar relationship is built between the dimension pair j and j 1 the similarity degree between two phase points can be identified by the cumulative unit step function j 1 m s c o r e j for which higher values indicate the greater pattern similarity associated with the internal structure between two phase points in the coupled quantity pattern similarity model cqpsm similar points in phase space are defined by the following two criteria 1 the criterion of quantity similarity the degree of spatial proximity between two phase points is defined as the quantity similarity measured with the euclidean distance criterion 15 f 1 min i y t y i t 2 the criterion of pattern similarity the similarity degree of internal structure between two phase points is defined as the pattern similarity measured by the cumulative unit step function 16 f 2 max i j 1 m s c o r e j according to eq 7 k 1 similar points are needed for chaotic prediction obviously this is a double objective optimization problem and the forbearing stratified sequencing method is applied to obtain the solution the core concept of stratified programming is to arrange different objectives according to importance and to then successively search for the optimal solution to each objective function first the set of optimal roots r 0 is evaluated for the first objective considering the involved constraints then the optimal root set is obtained for the second objective in r 0 to avoid the case that the optimal root set becomes empty or contains only one element leading to the interruption of the algorithm the problem would convert to the search of extreme values with tolerance conditions arunkumar et al 2006 therefore the solution of range for each objective function in the forbearing stratified sequencing algorithm can be loosened by introducing a tolerance ζ 0 the optimized solution would be obtained over a range near the optimal value of the previous objective function to avoid the interruption to the calculation process the procedure of the optimization solution can be described as follows 17 min f 1 i f 1 i n 18 max f 2 i f 2 i i i f 1 i f 1 ξ 1 where n is the total number of points in the reconstructed phase space i 1 is the similar phase points that meet the first optimization objective the quantity similarity criterion ζ 1 is the tolerance of the first optimal function f 1 is a selected similar point set according to the first optimization objective and f 2 is the similar points meeting both quantity and pattern similarity criteria the scheme of cqpsm is described as follows step a phase space reconstruction by determining two parameters the delay time and embedding dimension the m dimensional phase space can be reconstructed step b quantity similarity criterion the euclidean distance of the concerned point central point y t to other points y i t can be calculated thus the optimal solution f 1 obtained the ith point that meet the constraint i f y i t f 1 ζ 1 are empirically identified as similar points based on quantity similarity criterion step c pattern similarity criterion the cumulative unit step function is employed to calculate the internal structure similarity of the central point and the above similar points according to the pattern similarity criterion k filtered similar points neighbours with higher scores were used for forecasting step d chaotic prediction based on eq 11 the average of these similar points were used as a predictor 2 2 4 the improved models iqsm and icqpsm in the proposed cqpsm the quantity and pattern similarity criteria are evaluated by euclidean distance and cumulative unit step function respectively the adopted euclidean distance is based on equal weights that reflect average information across all embedding dimensions to further improve the quantity similarity the weighted euclidean distance based on partial information logic is introduced sharma et al 2016 set the precipitation values of all embedding dimensions of the reconstructed phase space y as possible influential factors and the forecasted values p i m 1 τ t of each phase point y i with different lead times t as the response thus information mining is performed to determine which embedding dimensions play major roles in controlling the quantity similarity for different lead times the weighted euclidean distance can be calculated based on partial information correlation between the possible factors and response the calculation procedure of partial weights can be found in a previously published study by sharma and mehrotra 2014 therefore the improved quantity similarity model based on weighted euclidean distance iqsm and improved chaos similarity model based on weighted euclidean distance and pattern similarity icqpsm are developed for further discussion in conclusion five models are developed table 1 a autoregressive model ar b local approximation prediction model lpm c coupled quantity pattern similarity model cqpsm d improved quantity similarity model iqsm e improved coupled quantity pattern similarity model icqpsm among them the lpm and ar model serve as the benchmark for cqpsm and the iqsm and icqpsm are the improved models to lpm and cqpsm respectively 2 3 performance measures model performance is assessed based on three different statistics the coefficient of correlation r root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute relative error mare and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse among these measures r is to evaluate the linear relationship between the observed and forecasted values rmse is to compute the standard deviation of the model forecasting error the difference between the forecasted and observed values mare is to measure the percentage error in forecasting and nse is a normalized statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance noise compared to the observed data variance information nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse indicates how well the plot of observed versus forecasted data fits the 1 1 line moriasi et al 2007 there are many performance measures can be used to evaluate the model accuracy such as bias forecast skill score ss and others we use the above four measures because they are simple and widely used 3 study area and data the danjiangkou reservoir basin is situated in the upper reaches of the hanjiang river crossing hubei henan and shaanxi provinces in china fig 2 it covers an area of 95 000 km2 accounting for 60 of the entire hanjiang river basin with mostly mountains and small areas of hills and plains the topography is complex in this area significantly falling in the direction from northwest to southeast the danjiangkou reservoir basin receives 873 mm of precipitation in average the precipitation distribution is uneven throughout the year and summer precipitation accounting for approximately 80 of rainfall danjiangkou reservoir is the source area of the middle route of the south to north water transfer project snwtp the corresponding water source is the hanjiang river and its tributaries which provide abundant and high quality water since the reservoir dam was constructed the normal water storage level has increased from 157 m to 170 m the water storage volume has increased from approximately 17 to 29 billion m3 and the northward water transfer volume has increased to 9 5 billion m3 the reservoir provides the comprehensive benefits of water supply flood control power generation shipping irrigation and tourism additionally the water body plays a crucial role in alleviating water shortage issues and promoting regional economic and social sustainable development there is a need to predict future precipitation trends in the basin for the water resource management of danjiangkou reservoir basin monthly precipitation data are collected at 146 stations from january 1980 to october 2017 by the bureau of hydrology yangtze river water resource commission china shown in fig 3 as the water source of the middle route of snwtp the forecasting of future areal mean precipitation trends in the danjiangkou reservoir basin is a significant need therefore the areal mean precipitation series from all 146 rain gauges were calculated using the thiessen polygon method the data from 1980 to 2014 were used for phase space reconstruction and identification of system behavior and the subsequent 2015 2017 were used for forecasting khatibi et al 2012 in this paper the monthly precipitation in 2015 2016 and 2017 were forecasted based on the monthly observations from 1980 to 2014 1980 to 2015 and 1980 to 2016 respectively the developed models were applied for future 12 month precipitation forecasts with lead times from a month to a year 4 results and discussion 4 1 determination of key parameters to fully reveal the dynamical characteristic of monthly precipitation series we conducted a chaotic characteristic analysis and determined the associated key parameters in the analysis the first subseries of monthly precipitation from 1980 to 2014 were used the phase space reconstruction process of a time series requires the knowledge of two parameters the delay time τ and the embedding dimension m which could be solved through the acf and g p algorithm respectively fig 4 shows the result of acf results for selected monthly precipitation series from the danjiangkou reservoir basin obvious yearly periodic variations in the monthly precipitation series can be observed the acf decreased with increasing delay time and finally reached zero at approximately τ 3 which can be used as the optimal delay time in the phase space reconstruction to determine optimal embedding dimension and saturation correlation dimension a logarithmic plot of c r and rd m is typically created in practical applications when the correlation dimension d m ceases to change as m increases the corresponding m value can be set as the optimal embedding dimension which is the minimum reconstructed phase for the strange attractor it should be noted that for a finite length sequence d m always increases as the embedding dimension m increases and it is not desirable to increase m to values greater than several tens by changing m from 1 to 12 the correlation function for different sphere radii r was calculated and the relationship of incm r inr according to the g p algorithm was obtained shown in fig 5 fig 6 displays the variation in correlation function with increasing embedding dimension and shows that correlation function reaches saturation around m 10 it passes from the saturation point and therefore this provides an evidence for a possible existence of chaotic signals in the data in addition the corresponding correlation dimension d 4 3 indicates that the monthly precipitation series has the chaotic characteristics therefore the optimal embedding dimension was set to m 10 on the basis of phase space reconstruction and the values of the delay time τ 3 and embedding dimension m 10 the monthly precipitation series can be converted into 393 phase points in a multidimensional phase space according to the constraint condition k m 1 the least number of similar points k 12 was adopted according to the principles of lpm the 12 closest points to the forecasting centre y 3 9 3 in terms of the euclidean distance were selected as the similar points for monthly precipitation forecasting there are three subseries in the study which are monthly observations from 1980 to 2014 1980 to 2015 and 1980 to 2016 the monthly precipitation in 2015 2016 and 2017 were forecasted based on the subseries of 1980 2014 1980 2015 and 1980 2016 respectively taking the forecasting for 2015 as an example if the monthly precipitation during 1980 2014 are used to phase space reconstruction the monthly precipitation in january 2015 can be forecasted with 1 month lead time the monthly precipitation in february 2015 can be forecasted with 2 month lead time likewise the monthly precipitation in december 2015 can be forecasted with 12 month lead time within the framework of cqpsm the first objective function was solved by the forbearing stratified sequencing method and the optimal solution f 1 f 260 68 23 was obtained the second objective function was solved in the former optimal solution set and the first objective function was transformed into an auxiliary constraint we used ζ 1 100 and 50 similar points were empirically identified based on quantity similarity criterion then the cumulative unit step function j 1 m s c o r e j was calculated with the pattern similarity principle and the 12 points the least number of similar points with highest scores were obtained as the final set of similar phase points the 12 filtered similar phase points were used for monthly precipitation forecasting 4 2 results of prediction models in this study five models are developed a autoregressive model ar b local approximation prediction model lpm c coupled quantity pattern similarity model cqpsm d improved quantity similarity model iqsm e improved coupled quantity pattern similarity model icqpsm autoregressive model ar p a traditional statistical model was used as a benchmark model to see the performance of lpm according to fig 7 the autocorrelation function acf values are high until lag 3 and the partial autocorrelation function pacf is found truncated at lag 3 indicating that the current monthly precipitation has relative stronger relationship with the previous three monthly precipitations from table 2 ar 3 has the lowest fpe aic and bic values based on these characteristics the appropriate model for the monthly precipitation in danjiangkou reservoir basin is ar 3 fig 8 shows a comparison of model performances for the five models in terms of the mare index in monthly scale the mare index was averaged for each month during the forecasting period table 3 presents the r rmse mare and nse of the five models 4 3 discussion of lpm ar and cqpsm the results indicate that the mare metric is generally less than 40 from january to june and such values may be acceptable in hydrological forecasting at monthly to yearly scale additionally the forecasting accuracy decreased with increasing lead time the forecasting performance seemed to be just passable with the further increase of lead time e g as reflected by the mare index accuracy from july to december it can be concluded that during a year the mare index values of monthly precipitation from may to july obtained by lpm were less than 25 and the errors in the other months were relatively large the ar p model yielded 4 months with mare values less than 25 and cqpsm generated mare values less than 25 in 6 months overall the mean mare index values calculated over the entire flood season using the lpm ar p model and cqpsm were 34 43 and 23 respectively and the corresponding values for the non flood season were 47 32 and 31 respectively based on the correlation coefficient the three models produced relatively high agreement r 0 9 during both flood and non flood seasons consequently cqpsm yielded better results in the flood season compared to the results of the other two models moreover during the entire forecasting period the annual average mare of cqpsm decreased from 39 to 26 compared to lpm table 3 in addition the cqpsm exhibited the highest r and nse values and lowest values of rmse and mare these results were indicators of the better performance of the coupled quantity pattern similarity model over the other two models fig 9 presented a comparison between the observed and predicted monthly precipitation time series based on the three different models moreover the corresponding scatter plots of solid 1 1 diagonal lines were shown in fig 10 the results of the improved model were more concentrated in the vicinity of the 1 1 line and the correlation coefficient was also the largest the comparisons suggest that the improved similarity model provides estimates that were closer to the observed monthly precipitation series than the other two models lpm and ar model therefore the improved similarity model of chaos phase space has an obvious improvement in hydrological forecasting many of the studies about monthly precipitation forecasting were implemented by data driven methods with one step lead time awan and bae 2014 ramana et al 2013 however there is few studies that explored the performance of data driven models for forecasting lead times greater than 1 month which needs further exploration he et al 2015 developed a hybrid wavelet network model hwnn for forecasting monthly rainfall over australia with one month lead time in this study the relative average error from hwnn ranged from 12 to 66 with an approximate average value of 27 the nse from hwnn varied from 0 14 to 0 95 with an approximate average value of 0 75 the performance of cqpsm in this paper r 0 86 mare 26 nse 0 73 is about the same to that of the above study and its lead time varied from 1 month to 12 month in china for national and provincial water management departments large reservoirs like three gorge reservoir and power generation companies it is usually necessary to make monthly hydrological forecasts for the next year at the beginning of the year to facilitate water resources planning and utilization dangjiangkou reservoir as the water source of the middle route of south to north water transfer project is also in need of such hydrological forecasts for the coming year by analyzing the water demand of the target areas and the incoming water of the reservoir the water transfer plan for the next year can be designated in practical application it is necessary to make continuous rolling prediction and adjust the decision therefore the paper extended the lead time from 1 month to 12 month 4 4 discussion of improved models as shown in fig 8 the iqsm had 7 months with mare values less than 30 and lpm had 5 months with mare values less than 30 the iqsm produced better results than lpm in some months and the mare values in these months were reduced by an average of 17 in other months the iqsm yielded poorer results than lpm with an average mare increase of 8 overall the mare of iqsm is lower than that of lpm the icqpsm had 7 months of mare less of 20 9 months of mare less than 30 while cqpsm had 5 months of mare less of 20 8 months of mare less than 30 it can be concluded that the icqpsm had slightly better performance in terms of mare in most months of the year the results indicated the importance of weighted euclidean distance in quantity similarity based methods from table 3 the iqsm yielded r rmse mare and nse statistics of 0 78 35 mm 36 and 0 60 respectively which were better compared than those of lpm and ar model the icqpsm obtained r rmse mare and nse statistics of 0 87 27 mm 24 and 0 75 respectively the icqpsm gave much lower values of rmse and mare while higher r and nse among all models investigated in this study thus it appears the icqpsm can provide more accurate forecasts to monthly precipitation forecasting the hydrographs and scatter diagrams for monthly precipitation forecasting by iqsm and icqpsm were presented in figs 11 and 12 and indicate that the precipitation values forecasted by icqpsm were closely matched with the observed values the best value of correlation coefficient r was 0 87 from icqpsm while the original chaos similarity model performed worst 0 74 therefore the icqpsm based on weighted euclidean distance and pattern similarity outperformed all other models investigated in this study the application of weighted euclidean distance in quantity similarity is an improvement compared to lpm 5 conclusions this paper developed the concept of quantity and pattern similarity to improve the classical local approximation prediction model lpm building on the traditional similarity approach in chaos theory three models are constructed for improvement which are i coupled quantity pattern similarity model cqpsm ii improved quantity similarity model iqsm and iii improved coupling quantity pattern similarity model icqpsm moreover autoregressive model ar is used as a benchmark model for comparison the case study uses monthly precipitation records over danjiangkou reservoir basin from january 1980 to october 2017 the main conclusions are as follows 1 the local approximation prediction model lpm uses the euclidean distance criterion to evaluate the similarity degree between the phase points which can be regarded as the quantity similarity to comprehensively measure the similarity the concept of pattern similarity is proposed to evaluate the similarity of internal structure between two phase points therefore the coupled quantity pattern similarity model cqpsm was developed for hydrological forecasting 2 the cqpsm was applied to the danjiangkou reservoir basin for future 12 month precipitation forecasting the results showed that cqpsm improved forecasting accuracy compared to the lpm and the ar p model for example the r values of the lpm ar p model and cqpsm were 0 74 0 73 and 0 86 respectively and the rmses of the three models were 38 mm 40 mm and 28 mm respectively the nses of the three models were 0 52 0 47 and 0 73 respectively on average the mare of monthly precipitation forecasting was reduced from 39 to 26 between the cqpsm and lpm this finding indicated that the coupled quantity pattern similarity model can be effectively applied providing a new method for monthly precipitation forecasting 3 the application of the weighted euclidean distance in quantity similarity is an improvement compared to lpm which is based on the regular euclidean distance for instance the r rmse mare and nse values of cqpsm based on the regular distance and pattern similarity were 0 86 28 mm 26 and 0 73 respectively while those of the icqpsm based on weighted euclidean distance and pattern similarity were 0 87 27 mm 24 and 0 75 respectively therefore the weighted euclidean distance based on partial information logic is more reasonable than the regular distance further improving the performance of the proposed coupled quantity pattern similarity model 4 although the coupled quantity pattern similarity model was proposed for long term forecasting the model concept is applicable to hydrological time series forecasting with different lead time scales declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the study is financially supported by the national key r d

6218,the local approximation prediction model lpm is a forecasting approach based on chaos theory it uses the euclidean distance to evaluate the spatial proximity between two phase points which is a measure of quantity similarity this study improved lpm by proposing a coupled quantity pattern similarity model cqpsm the pattern similarity is defined as the similarity of two phase points on

computed and compared to those of lpm and autoregressive ar model the results show a better performance of cqpsm and indicates the importance of considering pattern similarity between two phase points moreover the weighted euclidean distance based on partial information logic was discussed and applied to further improve the quantity similarity consequently the proposed cqpsm could provide a new alternative for hydrological forecasting keywords chaos theory phase space reconstruction coupled quantity pattern similarity model cumulative unit step function forbearing stratified sequencing method weighted euclidean distance 1 introduction reliable and accurate hydrological forecasting plays a vital role in potential flood risks reduction generating greater benefits of hydropower production and improving water resources management li et al 2019 wanders and wada 2015 traditionally two broad approaches have been employed in hydrological research deterministic and stochastic for most hydrological systems and processes both the deterministic approach and stochastic approach are complementary to each other thus chaos theory that can couple these two and serve as a middle ground would often be more appropriate sivakumar 2011 this paper developed the concept of quantity and pattern similarity to improve the classical local approximation prediction model lpm based on chaos theory the quantity similarity refers to the euclidean distance criterion that commonly used in lpm whereas the pattern similarity refers to the similarity of two phase points on internal structure this model takes the phase reconstruction parameters from chaos theory and its prediction algorithm is improved by considering the coupled quantity and pattern similarity of phase points the performance of cqpsm is then compared with two benchmark models of i lpm and ii autoregressive model ar data driven approaches have been widely used in hydrological forecasting such as artificial neural network ann edossa and babel 2011 random forest algorithm rf liang et al 2017a b support vector machine svm kisi and cimen 2011 and adaptive nero fuzzy inference system anfis khatibi et al 2011 there are two categories of data driven methods according to the corresponding factors one category is single factor forecasting which is based on the evolution of the hydrological sequence itself liang et al 2017a b the other category is multifactor forecasting which is built on the relationships exist between hydrological response and large scale climate elements with the climate elements separately forecasted by a dynamical model in recent decades many contemporary soft computing techniques have been used to enhance the understanding of hydrological process and have obtained some notable results xiao et al 2019 alizadeh et al 2017 kan et al 2016 chaos theory has been introduced to the field of hydrological forecasting in recent years and related studies have provided convincing evidence that chaos exists in hydrological data sets koutsoyiannis and pachakis 1996 puente and obregon 1996 sivakumar et al 1998 sivakumar et al 2001 applied a local polynomial approach based on phase space reconstruction to predict monthly runoff at the basin of coaracy nunes araguari river in northern brazil and observed satisfactory model performance sivakumar et al 2002 employed a nonlinear forecasting method to forecast the daily flow dynamics of chao phraya river in thailand phoon et al 2002 proposed a practical inverse approach for optimal selection of parameters involved in phase space reconstruction chaos identification and forecasting damle and yalcin 2007 developed a time series data mining approach for river flood forecasting which combined chaos theory and data mining technique zhang et al 2009 investigated the single point model multipoint model linear model and three parameter of local similarity model based on phase space reconstruction for long term runoff forecasting ghorbani et al 2018 integrated multigene genetic programming with chaos theory to develop a new hybrid model for river flow forecasting the research of chaos began with the french scientist henri poincare in 1903 while studying the three body problem he found it produced obvious random results in 1963 the american meteorologist lorenz 1963 investigated a system of three first order differential equations whose solutions were unstable and non periodic henton 1964 observed a simple mapping tend toward a strange attractor appearing to have the same basic properties as the lorenz system ruelle and takens 1971 first proposed chaos to describe the formation mechanism of turbulence and proved by rigorous mathematical analysis that there was a strange attractor in the dynamical system their remarkable work contributes to the birth of chaos theory li and yorke 1975 revealed the evolution from order to chaos and proposed li yorke theorem in the 1980s with the introduction of phase space reconstruction and statistical features of strange attractor such as lyapunov exponent kolmogorov entropy and fractal dimension chaos theory enters practical application stage since chaotic motion is widely encountered in various complex nonlinear systems predicting the evolution trends of chaotic systems from observations has become a pressing challenge loskutov et al 2008 qu et al 2014 in recent years many chaotic prediction approaches have been proposed and can be classified as two main categories global and local methods global methods approximate entire time series based on all attractors and yield a function valid at every point local methods only use some past information to approximate the local attractors and future values can be inferred based on the neighborhoods of the concerned phase point su 2010 dhanya and kumar 2010 previous studies indicated that local prediction methods can provide better performance farmer and sidorowichl 1988 li and zhang 2005 local prediction methods use only a limited number of neighbors in the reconstructed phase space there are two major classes of local methods those applying neighbor samples directly in the prediction and those fitting a function locally to the neighbors basing the prediction on the estimated function bjørn et al 1994 farmer and sidorowich 1987 first put forward to construct a local predictor by the nearest neighbor points such as zeroth order approximation first order approximation and linear approximation they did not observe significant improvements moving to higher order linsay 1991 put forward the linear interpolation method for forecasting chaotic time series another variant is to take the nearest neighbors and use the average of their state mappings as the predictor mcnames 2002 the k nearest neighbors is widely used in chaotic techniques which is introduced in farmer and sidorowich 1987 in this approach a future value can be approximately predicted from the evolution of k vectors or phase points called nearest neighbors which are chosen according to some closeness metrics such as euclidean distance kulesh et al 2008 the euclidean distance metric can also be regarded as similarity evaluation of phase points in fact this criterion is a measure of quantity similarity the similarity of two phase points involves not only the quantity similarity but also the similarity of internal structure between the two phase points the latter can be defined as pattern similarity both similarity degree measures should be considered but most previous studies only focused on quantity similarity even if the degree of quantity similarity is high there may be evident difference in the pattern similarity which will significantly influence the analysis results to overcome this drawback we developed an improved chaos similarity model coupled quantity pattern similarity model for hydrological prediction through the integration of both quantity and pattern similarity measures 2 methodology 2 1 phase space reconstruction theory psr as the basis of chaos system analysis phase space reconstruction provides a simplified multi dimensional representation of a one dimensional nonlinear time series and further reveals the hidden information of the original time series packard et al 1980 proposed a method of delays to reconstruct the phase space that was mathematically introduced by takens 1981 given a scalar time series e g a runoff or precipitation series x 1 x 2 x n a multi dimensional phase space can be expressed as follows 1 y i x i x i τ x i m 1 τ i 1 2 n where n n m 1 τ m is the dimension of the vector y i defined as the embedding dimension and τ is the delay time packard et al 1980 takens 1981 the crucial problem is to determine the appropriate embedding dimension m and delay time τ because they directly affect the accuracy of the feature of the strange attractor after phase space reconstruction various algorithms are now available to estimate m and τ of a time series the autocorrelation function acf is popular for its simplicity and practicability holzfuss and mayer kress 1986 and there are other methods such as the mutual information method fraser and swinney 1986 and the correlation integral method liebert and schuster 1989 for a discrete time series x i where i 1 2 n and for different delay times τ the acf is calculated as follows 2 r τ 1 n i 0 n 1 x i x i τ the use of acf to describing the dynamic properties of time series lies in its ability to determine the degree of dependence present in the values if τ is too small the phase space coordinates may not be independent leading to information loss regarding characteristics of attractor structure whereas if τ is too large there may be no dynamic correlation between the state vectors since the neighboring trajectory divergence would result in information loss for the original system dhanya and kumar 2010 commonly the corresponding time when the acf first reaches zero is set as the delay time τ this approach guarantees a minimum correlation among the embedding coordinates holzfuss and mayer kress 1986 the grassberger procaccia algorithm grassberger 1983 is used widely to estimate m for a time series for a given vector norm radius of a sphere r the proportion of the points with a distance less than r is used to defined as the correlation function cm r 3 c m r 1 n 2 i j 1 n h r y i y j where n is the number of phase points and f is the heaviside step function with h u 1 for u 0 and h u 0 for u 0 additionally u r y i y j and y i y j denotes the distance of the ith and jth phase points 4 h u 0 u 0 1 u 0 cm r is the correlation function of the attractor which describes the probability of a distance between the phase points being less than r the correlation dimension d reflects the self similar structure of the chaotic attractor which is given by the following equation 5 d lim r 0 log c m r l o g r the behavior of d provides one technique for determining the presence of chaos in a time series khatibi et al 2012 if the d saturates to a constant value even with increasing of the embedding dimension m the sequence is considered to exhibit chaotic behavior and the corresponding m can be used as the optimal embedding dimension 2 2 prediction models 2 2 1 autoregressive model ar the autoregressive model ar p a traditional statistical model is the simplest and one of the most widely used method in box jenkins models which is a special case of the arima model arima p 0 0 in this study ar p model is used as a benchmark model to lpm an ar model of order p predicts the current value of a time series based on the weighted sum of p previous values of the process plus a random shock ar p models purely autoregressive models can be expressed as follows 6 z t φ 1 z t 1 φ 2 z t 2 φ p z t p a t where φ 1 φ 2 φ p are model parameters and a t is the random component of the data that follows a normal distribution with mean 0 the autocorrelation functions acf and partial autocorrelation functions pcf are used to identify plausible ar p models and the model diagnostic is performed by the final prediction error fpe akaike 1969 akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 and bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 in this study 7 fpe n p 1 n p 1 1 n t 1 n z t z t p 2 8 aic 2 log l 2

obtained when the criterion functions reach their minimum value craparo et al 2015 dastorani et al 2016 2 2 2 local approximation prediction model lpm takens theorem takens 1981 states that a correct phase space reconstruction of dimension m allows one to interpret the underlying dynamics in the form of a m dimensional map f as follows 10 y t t f y t where t is the prediction step which can also be regarded as the lead time in hydrological forecasting y t t and y t are vectors of dimension m that describe the state of the system at time t t future state and t current state respectively the key task is to identify an appropriate expression of f and the local approximation prediction model lpm is used to solve the problem in this study the essence of lpm is to predict y t t by y t reflecting the evolution of a dynamic system assume that if the nearest phase point of y t in the phase space is y t then y t t can be predicted through y t t in practical applications k phase points can be searched and averaged for the prediction of y t t herein y t t is determined by the similar phase points as follows zhang et al 2009 11 y t t i 1 k φ i y i t t i 1 k where k is the number of similar phase points commonly k m 1 and m is the embedding dimension of phase space y i t is a point similar to y t and φi is the weight of y i t in general equal weights φi 1 k can be used the euclidean distance d is commonly used to evaluate the similarity between phase points y i t and y t in lpm 12 d y i t y t the smaller the distance the greater is the similarity degree for hydrological prediction taking monthly precipitation forecasting as an example each phase point consists of m monthly precipitation values or m dimensional coordinates for the two phase points y t 1 x 1 x 2 xm and y t 2 x 1 x 2 x m the euclidean distance of y t 1 and y t 2 represents their quantity similarity as shown in fig 1 a thus the euclidean distance criterion is used to evaluate the similarity degree of monthly precipitation for each dimension pair which is the quantity similarity in nature building on the above traditional similarity approach the paper offers the following three variations for improvement i coupled quantity pattern similarity model cqpsm ii improved quantity similarity model iqsm based on weighted euclidean distance and iii improved coupling quantity pattern similarity model icqpsm based on weighted euclidean distance 2 2 3 the coupled quantity pattern similarity model cqpsm the lpm model selects similar phase points according to euclidean distance quantity similarity criterion which considers the integral similarity of the phase points however even the euclidean distance of the points pair are equal there may still exist huge difference in points internal structure for example it can be seen from fig 1 b that although the euclidean distance of blue phase point and red phase point to green point y t 0 x 1 x 2 x m are equal the changing trends of blue and red points over dimension are completely different having significant impact on the results therefore the euclidean distance is regarded as quantity similarity and the concept of pattern similarity is introduced to evaluate the similarity in points internal structure this study expounds the limitation of the euclidean distance as the measure of points similarity and improves the original model through a coupled quantity pattern similarity model the pattern similarity is defined as the similarity degree of internal structure of two phase points for the phase points y t 1 x 1 x 2 xm and y t 2 x 1 x 2 x m a cumulative unit step function is defined to identify the pattern similarity between the phase points 13 c o n j x j x j 1 x j x j 1 14 s c o r e j 0 c o n j 0 1 c o n j 0 where j is the number of embedding dimensions con j represents the trends of the coordinates value of the phase points if the same trends exist for both points con j is positive and vice versa it is noteworthy that principally we can build the equation across all j s and then the sum the results to reflect the integral structure of the phase points in this paper the pattern similarity only considers the influence of the most adjacent dimension and the similar relationship is built between the dimension pair j and j 1 the similarity degree between two phase points can be identified by the cumulative unit step function j 1 m s c o r e j for which higher values indicate the greater pattern similarity associated with the internal structure between two phase points in the coupled quantity pattern similarity model cqpsm similar points in phase space are defined by the following two criteria 1 the criterion of quantity similarity the degree of spatial proximity between two phase points is defined as the quantity similarity measured with the euclidean distance criterion 15 f 1 min i y t y i t 2 the criterion of pattern similarity the similarity degree of internal structure between two phase points is defined as the pattern similarity measured by the cumulative unit step function 16 f 2 max i j 1 m s c o r e j according to eq 7 k 1 similar points are needed for chaotic prediction obviously this is a double objective optimization problem and the forbearing stratified sequencing method is applied to obtain the solution the core concept of stratified programming is to arrange different objectives according to importance and to then successively search for the optimal solution to each objective function first the set of optimal roots r 0 is evaluated for the first objective considering the involved constraints then the optimal root set is obtained for the second objective in r 0 to avoid the case that the optimal root set becomes empty or contains only one element leading to the interruption of the algorithm the problem would convert to the search of extreme values with tolerance conditions arunkumar et al 2006 therefore the solution of range for each objective function in the forbearing stratified sequencing algorithm can be loosened by introducing a tolerance ζ 0 the optimized solution would be obtained over a range near the optimal value of the previous objective function to avoid the interruption to the calculation process the procedure of the optimization solution can be described as follows 17 min f 1 i f 1 i n 18 max f 2 i f 2 i i i f 1 i f 1 ξ 1 where n is the total number of points in the reconstructed phase space i 1 is the similar phase points that meet the first optimization objective the quantity similarity criterion ζ 1 is the tolerance of the first optimal function f 1 is a selected similar point set according to the first optimization objective and f 2 is the similar points meeting both quantity and pattern similarity criteria the scheme of cqpsm is described as follows step a phase space reconstruction by determining two parameters the delay time and embedding dimension the m dimensional phase space can be reconstructed step b quantity similarity criterion the euclidean distance of the concerned point central point y t to other points y i t can be calculated thus the optimal solution f 1 obtained the ith point that meet the constraint i f y i t f 1 ζ 1 are empirically identified as similar points based on quantity similarity criterion step c pattern similarity criterion the cumulative unit step function is employed to calculate the internal structure similarity of the central point and the above similar points according to the pattern similarity criterion k filtered similar points neighbours with higher scores were used for forecasting step d chaotic prediction based on eq 11 the average of these similar points were used as a predictor 2 2 4 the improved models iqsm and icqpsm in the proposed cqpsm the quantity and pattern similarity criteria are evaluated by euclidean distance and cumulative unit step function respectively the adopted euclidean distance is based on equal weights that reflect average information across all embedding dimensions to further improve the quantity similarity the weighted euclidean distance based on partial information logic is introduced sharma et al 2016 set the precipitation values of all embedding dimensions of the reconstructed phase space y as possible influential factors and the forecasted values p i m 1 τ t of each phase point y i with different lead times t as the response thus information mining is performed to determine which embedding dimensions play major roles in controlling the quantity similarity for different lead times the weighted euclidean distance can be calculated based on partial information correlation between the possible factors and response the calculation procedure of partial weights can be found in a previously published study by sharma and mehrotra 2014 therefore the improved quantity similarity model based on weighted euclidean distance iqsm and improved chaos similarity model based on weighted euclidean distance and pattern similarity icqpsm are developed for further discussion in conclusion five models are developed table 1 a autoregressive model ar b local approximation prediction model lpm c coupled quantity pattern similarity model cqpsm d improved quantity similarity model iqsm e improved coupled quantity pattern similarity model icqpsm among them the lpm and ar model serve as the benchmark for cqpsm and the iqsm and icqpsm are the improved models to lpm and cqpsm respectively 2 3 performance measures model performance is assessed based on three different statistics the coefficient of correlation r root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute relative error mare and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse among these measures r is to evaluate the linear relationship between the observed and forecasted values rmse is to compute the standard deviation of the model forecasting error the difference between the forecasted and observed values mare is to measure the percentage error in forecasting and nse is a normalized statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance noise compared to the observed data variance information nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse indicates how well the plot of observed versus forecasted data fits the 1 1 line moriasi et al 2007 there are many performance measures can be used to evaluate the model accuracy such as bias forecast skill score ss and others we use the above four measures because they are simple and widely used 3 study area and data the danjiangkou reservoir basin is situated in the upper reaches of the hanjiang river crossing hubei henan and shaanxi provinces in china fig 2 it covers an area of 95 000 km2 accounting for 60 of the entire hanjiang river basin with mostly mountains and small areas of hills and plains the topography is complex in this area significantly falling in the direction from northwest to southeast the danjiangkou reservoir basin receives 873 mm of precipitation in average the precipitation distribution is uneven throughout the year and summer precipitation accounting for approximately 80 of rainfall danjiangkou reservoir is the source area of the middle route of the south to north water transfer project snwtp the corresponding water source is the hanjiang river and its tributaries which provide abundant and high quality water since the reservoir dam was constructed the normal water storage level has increased from 157 m to 170 m the water storage volume has increased from approximately 17 to 29 billion m3 and the northward water transfer volume has increased to 9 5 billion m3 the reservoir provides the comprehensive benefits of water supply flood control power generation shipping irrigation and tourism additionally the water body plays a crucial role in alleviating water shortage issues and promoting regional economic and social sustainable development there is a need to predict future precipitation trends in the basin for the water resource management of danjiangkou reservoir basin monthly precipitation data are collected at 146 stations from january 1980 to october 2017 by the bureau of hydrology yangtze river water resource commission china shown in fig 3 as the water source of the middle route of snwtp the forecasting of future areal mean precipitation trends in the danjiangkou reservoir basin is a significant need therefore the areal mean precipitation series from all 146 rain gauges were calculated using the thiessen polygon method the data from 1980 to 2014 were used for phase space reconstruction and identification of system behavior and the subsequent 2015 2017 were used for forecasting khatibi et al 2012 in this paper the monthly precipitation in 2015 2016 and 2017 were forecasted based on the monthly observations from 1980 to 2014 1980 to 2015 and 1980 to 2016 respectively the developed models were applied for future 12 month precipitation forecasts with lead times from a month to a year 4 results and discussion 4 1 determination of key parameters to fully reveal the dynamical characteristic of monthly precipitation series we conducted a chaotic characteristic analysis and determined the associated key parameters in the analysis the first subseries of monthly precipitation from 1980 to 2014 were used the phase space reconstruction process of a time series requires the knowledge of two parameters the delay time τ and the embedding dimension m which could be solved through the acf and g p algorithm respectively fig 4 shows the result of acf results for selected monthly precipitation series from the danjiangkou reservoir basin obvious yearly periodic variations in the monthly precipitation series can be observed the acf decreased with increasing delay time and finally reached zero at approximately τ 3 which can be used as the optimal delay time in the phase space reconstruction to determine optimal embedding dimension and saturation correlation dimension a logarithmic plot of c r and rd m is typically created in practical applications when the correlation dimension d m ceases to change as m increases the corresponding m value can be set as the optimal embedding dimension which is the minimum reconstructed phase for the strange attractor it should be noted that for a finite length sequence d m always increases as the embedding dimension m increases and it is not desirable to increase m to values greater than several tens by changing m from 1 to 12 the correlation function for different sphere radii r was calculated and the relationship of incm r inr according to the g p algorithm was obtained shown in fig 5 fig 6 displays the variation in correlation function with increasing embedding dimension and shows that correlation function reaches saturation around m 10 it passes from the saturation point and therefore this provides an evidence for a possible existence of chaotic signals in the data in addition the corresponding correlation dimension d 4 3 indicates that the monthly precipitation series has the chaotic characteristics therefore the optimal embedding dimension was set to m 10 on the basis of phase space reconstruction and the values of the delay time τ 3 and embedding dimension m 10 the monthly precipitation series can be converted into 393 phase points in a multidimensional phase space according to the constraint condition k m 1 the least number of similar points k 12 was adopted according to the principles of lpm the 12 closest points to the forecasting centre y 3 9 3 in terms of the euclidean distance were selected as the similar points for monthly precipitation forecasting there are three subseries in the study which are monthly observations from 1980 to 2014 1980 to 2015 and 1980 to 2016 the monthly precipitation in 2015 2016 and 2017 were forecasted based on the subseries of 1980 2014 1980 2015 and 1980 2016 respectively taking the forecasting for 2015 as an example if the monthly precipitation during 1980 2014 are used to phase space reconstruction the monthly precipitation in january 2015 can be forecasted with 1 month lead time the monthly precipitation in february 2015 can be forecasted with 2 month lead time likewise the monthly precipitation in december 2015 can be forecasted with 12 month lead time within the framework of cqpsm the first objective function was solved by the forbearing stratified sequencing method and the optimal solution f 1 f 260 68 23 was obtained the second objective function was solved in the former optimal solution set and the first objective function was transformed into an auxiliary constraint we used ζ 1 100 and 50 similar points were empirically identified based on quantity similarity criterion then the cumulative unit step function j 1 m s c o r e j was calculated with the pattern similarity principle and the 12 points the least number of similar points with highest scores were obtained as the final set of similar phase points the 12 filtered similar phase points were used for monthly precipitation forecasting 4 2 results of prediction models in this study five models are developed a autoregressive model ar b local approximation prediction model lpm c coupled quantity pattern similarity model cqpsm d improved quantity similarity model iqsm e improved coupled quantity pattern similarity model icqpsm autoregressive model ar p a traditional statistical model was used as a benchmark model to see the performance of lpm according to fig 7 the autocorrelation function acf values are high until lag 3 and the partial autocorrelation function pacf is found truncated at lag 3 indicating that the current monthly precipitation has relative stronger relationship with the previous three monthly precipitations from table 2 ar 3 has the lowest fpe aic and bic values based on these characteristics the appropriate model for the monthly precipitation in danjiangkou reservoir basin is ar 3 fig 8 shows a comparison of model performances for the five models in terms of the mare index in monthly scale the mare index was averaged for each month during the forecasting period table 3 presents the r rmse mare and nse of the five models 4 3 discussion of lpm ar and cqpsm the results indicate that the mare metric is generally less than 40 from january to june and such values may be acceptable in hydrological forecasting at monthly to yearly scale additionally the forecasting accuracy decreased with increasing lead time the forecasting performance seemed to be just passable with the further increase of lead time e g as reflected by the mare index accuracy from july to december it can be concluded that during a year the mare index values of monthly precipitation from may to july obtained by lpm were less than 25 and the errors in the other months were relatively large the ar p model yielded 4 months with mare values less than 25 and cqpsm generated mare values less than 25 in 6 months overall the mean mare index values calculated over the entire flood season using the lpm ar p model and cqpsm were 34 43 and 23 respectively and the corresponding values for the non flood season were 47 32 and 31 respectively based on the correlation coefficient the three models produced relatively high agreement r 0 9 during both flood and non flood seasons consequently cqpsm yielded better results in the flood season compared to the results of the other two models moreover during the entire forecasting period the annual average mare of cqpsm decreased from 39 to 26 compared to lpm table 3 in addition the cqpsm exhibited the highest r and nse values and lowest values of rmse and mare these results were indicators of the better performance of the coupled quantity pattern similarity model over the other two models fig 9 presented a comparison between the observed and predicted monthly precipitation time series based on the three different models moreover the corresponding scatter plots of solid 1 1 diagonal lines were shown in fig 10 the results of the improved model were more concentrated in the vicinity of the 1 1 line and the correlation coefficient was also the largest the comparisons suggest that the improved similarity model provides estimates that were closer to the observed monthly precipitation series than the other two models lpm and ar model therefore the improved similarity model of chaos phase space has an obvious improvement in hydrological forecasting many of the studies about monthly precipitation forecasting were implemented by data driven methods with one step lead time awan and bae 2014 ramana et al 2013 however there is few studies that explored the performance of data driven models for forecasting lead times greater than 1 month which needs further exploration he et al 2015 developed a hybrid wavelet network model hwnn for forecasting monthly rainfall over australia with one month lead time in this study the relative average error from hwnn ranged from 12 to 66 with an approximate average value of 27 the nse from hwnn varied from 0 14 to 0 95 with an approximate average value of 0 75 the performance of cqpsm in this paper r 0 86 mare 26 nse 0 73 is about the same to that of the above study and its lead time varied from 1 month to 12 month in china for national and provincial water management departments large reservoirs like three gorge reservoir and power generation companies it is usually necessary to make monthly hydrological forecasts for the next year at the beginning of the year to facilitate water resources planning and utilization dangjiangkou reservoir as the water source of the middle route of south to north water transfer project is also in need of such hydrological forecasts for the coming year by analyzing the water demand of the target areas and the incoming water of the reservoir the water transfer plan for the next year can be designated in practical application it is necessary to make continuous rolling prediction and adjust the decision therefore the paper extended the lead time from 1 month to 12 month 4 4 discussion of improved models as shown in fig 8 the iqsm had 7 months with mare values less than 30 and lpm had 5 months with mare values less than 30 the iqsm produced better results than lpm in some months and the mare values in these months were reduced by an average of 17 in other months the iqsm yielded poorer results than lpm with an average mare increase of 8 overall the mare of iqsm is lower than that of lpm the icqpsm had 7 months of mare less of 20 9 months of mare less than 30 while cqpsm had 5 months of mare less of 20 8 months of mare less than 30 it can be concluded that the icqpsm had slightly better performance in terms of mare in most months of the year the results indicated the importance of weighted euclidean distance in quantity similarity based methods from table 3 the iqsm yielded r rmse mare and nse statistics of 0 78 35 mm 36 and 0 60 respectively which were better compared than those of lpm and ar model the icqpsm obtained r rmse mare and nse statistics of 0 87 27 mm 24 and 0 75 respectively the icqpsm gave much lower values of rmse and mare while higher r and nse among all models investigated in this study thus it appears the icqpsm can provide more accurate forecasts to monthly precipitation forecasting the hydrographs and scatter diagrams for monthly precipitation forecasting by iqsm and icqpsm were presented in figs 11 and 12 and indicate that the precipitation values forecasted by icqpsm were closely matched with the observed values the best value of correlation coefficient r was 0 87 from icqpsm while the original chaos similarity model performed worst 0 74 therefore the icqpsm based on weighted euclidean distance and pattern similarity outperformed all other models investigated in this study the application of weighted euclidean distance in quantity similarity is an improvement compared to lpm 5 conclusions this paper developed the concept of quantity and pattern similarity to improve the classical local approximation prediction model lpm building on the traditional similarity approach in chaos theory three models are constructed for improvement which are i coupled quantity pattern similarity model cqpsm ii improved quantity similarity model iqsm and iii improved coupling quantity pattern similarity model icqpsm moreover autoregressive model ar is used as a benchmark model for comparison the case study uses monthly precipitation records over danjiangkou reservoir basin from january 1980 to october 2017 the main conclusions are as follows 1 the local approximation prediction model lpm uses the euclidean distance criterion to evaluate the similarity degree between the phase points which can be regarded as the quantity similarity to comprehensively measure the similarity the concept of pattern similarity is proposed to evaluate the similarity of internal structure between two phase points therefore the coupled quantity pattern similarity model cqpsm was developed for hydrological forecasting 2 the cqpsm was applied to the danjiangkou reservoir basin for future 12 month precipitation forecasting the results showed that cqpsm improved forecasting accuracy compared to the lpm and the ar p model for example the r values of the lpm ar p model and cqpsm were 0 74 0 73 and 0 86 respectively and the rmses of the three models were 38 mm 40 mm and 28 mm respectively the nses of the three models were 0 52 0 47 and 0 73 respectively on average the mare of monthly precipitation forecasting was reduced from 39 to 26 between the cqpsm and lpm this finding indicated that the coupled quantity pattern similarity model can be effectively applied providing a new method for monthly precipitation forecasting 3 the application of the weighted euclidean distance in quantity similarity is an improvement compared to lpm which is based on the regular euclidean distance for instance the r rmse mare and nse values of cqpsm based on the regular distance and pattern similarity were 0 86 28 mm 26 and 0 73 respectively while those of the icqpsm based on weighted euclidean distance and pattern similarity were 0 87 27 mm 24 and 0 75 respectively therefore the weighted euclidean distance based on partial information logic is more reasonable than the regular distance further improving the performance of the proposed coupled quantity pattern similarity model 4 although the coupled quantity pattern similarity model was proposed for long term forecasting the model concept is applicable to hydrological time series forecasting with different lead time scales declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the study is financially supported by the national key r d

6219,climate variability and land use cover change have a significant impact on hydrological regimes especially in arid and semi arid regions which have critical water shortage problems using the mann kendall s test methodology trends in hydro climatic variables including precipitation temperature land use and water balance indicators have been detected during the last 60 years in the middle yellow river basin myrb generally the myrb has become much warmer and drier compared with 1980 the land use has also changed to a small degree by 2000 and to a significant degree by 2015 with an increase in vegetation coverage there are decreasing trends for streamflow and water resources and a shift in water balance with less precipitation generating streamflow and more water being evaporated especially after 2000 the response of water balance to climate change and land use cover change and the attribution for streamflow decrease was analyzed in the 10 sub regions of the myrb based on the regionalization of parameter w of fu s formula the results indicate that with an increase of e0 p potential evaporation precipitation or w there is an increase of et p evapotranspiration precipitation and a decrease of r p streamflow precipitation but the increasing rate of et p decreases with an increase of e0 p or w based on the natural period streamflow of 1956 1979 climate variability accounts for 75 8 of streamflow decrease in 1980 2000 but in 2001 2016 land use cover change is the main factor in streamflow decrease accounting for 75 5 of the decline the results are useful for understanding what has happened and what will happen under climate change and land use cover change for adaption to future water resources management keywords impact climate variability land use cover change water balance middle yellow river basin 1 introduction the yellow river is the second longest river in china and its contribution to chinese civilisation has earned it the title of the country s mother river it has a total length of about 5464 km and drains a watershed of 752 443 km2 it accounts for about 2 6 of china s water putting it fourth among the country s seven major rivers because of less precipitation there is a critical water shortage problem in the yellow river basin the basin has only 620 m3 in per capita water resources which is 30 and 7 5 of the national and global per capita water resources respectively wang et al 2000 fu et al 2004 more seriously due to climate variability and land use cover change there has been a significant decreasing trend for observed streamflow at several main gauging stations along the yellow river during the last several decades zhao et al 2015 this may lead to more serious water shortages in the future therefore it is essential to assess the impact of climate variability and land use cover change on the water balance in the yellow river basin to understand what has happened and what will happen for adaption in future water resources management the impact of climate change on hydrology and water resources is a 10 year 2013 2022 research theme of the international association of hydrological sciences montanari et al 2013 and has been investigated in many parts of the world it has been investigated on a global scale arnell and lloyd hughes 2014 in the nile river siam and eltahir 2017 on the southern california coast lopez et al 2013 in the continental united states renner and bernhofer 2012 in the murray darling basin in australia donohue et al 2011 in china wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2015a b in northern china yang and yang 2011 on the huang huai hai plain in china dan et al 2012 in the hai river basin in china bao et al 2012a and in south central ethiopia legesse et al 2003 among other places generally there are two methodologies to assess the impact of climate change on hydrology one is based on a hydrological model using hypothetical climatic scenarios while the other is based on the elasticity of hydrology to climate change using long term observed data the hydrological simulation based methodology has been used widely several studies indicate that a 1 increase in precipitation leads to an increase in streamflow of between 2 1 and 2 5 in 22 catchments in australia jones et al 2006 and streamflow decreases of 30 result from a 10 decrease in precipitation in south central ethiopia legesse et al 2003 etc but because of the uncertainty of model structure and parameters different models showed different results even in the same catchments highlighting the need to define a formula to assess the elasticity of streamflow to precipitation sankarasubramanian et al 2001 fu et al 2007 developed the one parameter elasticity formula into a two parameter precipitation and temperature elasticity formula furthermore yang and yang 2011 investigated the sensitivity of streamflow to precipitation net radiation air temperature wind speed and relative humidity recently hasan et al 2018 used the budyko curve and climate elasticity to investigate streamflow sensitivity to climate change in the nile river basin and the results indicated that a 10 decrease in precipitation leads to a decrease in streamflow of between 19 in tropical zones and 30 in arid zones besides climate change land use cover change is another important factor influencing hydrological regimes sun et al 2018 wang et al 2019 three methodologies have been used to assess the regimes impact on hydrology and water resources paired catchments huang et al 1999 long term time series analysis jothityangkoon et al 2001 yang and tian 2009 and hydrological simulation schilling et al 2008 based on the paired catchments muñoz villers mcdonnell 2013 compared the streamflow generation of three neighbouring catchments in eastern mexico with different land cover and found that pasture showed a 10 higher mean annual streamflow compared to mature and secondary forest most likely because of lower rainfall interception however this methodology is only suitable for small watersheds and not applicable to large watersheds lorup et al 1998 li et al 2009 because the influence of climate change on hydrological processes cannot be isolated by the method of long term time series analysis costa et al 2003 the hydrological simulation based methodology has been used more and more widely for example schilling et al 2008 used the soil and water assessment tool swat to study the impact of land use and land cover change on the water balance of a large agricultural watershed in the united states their results indicated that increased corn production might decrease annual evapotranspiration and increase water yield meanwhile stehr et al 2010 used a physically based distributed precipitation runoff model and different land use scenarios generated by heuristic rules and logistic regression models to investigate mean annual discharge increases with agricultural land use and diminishment with introduced forest coverage of the vergara watershed located in central chile this methodology has also been applied to a catchment on the loess plateau china and the results showed that the higher the growth of forest and grassland the greater the evapotranspiration transferred and the less surface streamflow and soil water generated yan et al 2018 recently the combined effect of climate change and land use cover change on hydrology has been in focus bao et al 2012b for example there was a strong connection between the extent of forest cover and the response of a catchment s hydrological regime to climate change teutschbein et al 2018 fresh water resources on earth are fragile especially in arid and semi arid regions and may be strongly affected by climate change and human activities with a consequence for human society and ecosystems bates et al 2008 taking the shiyang river basin in the arid region of northwest china as an example ma et al 2008 concluded that climate variability mainly in the form of decreased precipitation accounted for over 64 of the reduction in mean annual streamflow during the last 50 years while human activities accounted for 36 cuo et al 2013 used the variable infiltration capacity model to study the impacts of climate change and land cover use transition on the hydrology in the upper yellow river basin and found that there was a decrease in wet and warm season streamflow and annual streamflow due to the combined effects of changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration otherwise the conservation programs had some positive impacts on water resources numerous studies have also been done on the impact of climate change and land cove use change on hydrology in the myrb generally these studies have consistent conclusions i e the land use cover change by soil conservation is the main reason for streamflow decrease in the myrb over the last several decades zhao et al 2014 for example li et al 2007 found that soil conservation measures account for 87 of the streamflow reduction in the wuding river basin zhang et al 2008 pointed out that the land use cover changes accounted for over 50 of the streamflow reduction in eight out of the 11 catchments in the loess plateau gao et al 2016 concluded that 70 of the streamflow reduction can be attributed to land use change in the myrb despite the depth of research in the area several questions need further investigation first the previous studies mainly focused on the typical catchment scale because the parameters of the hydrologic model were calibrated in the sub catchments so the question is how does climate variability and land use cover change affect the water balance for the entire myrb and what s the spatial distribution second the total contributions of climate variability and land use cover change on streamflow reduction have been detected by some previous studies but in some sub periods the impact of climate variability may be important otherwise in other sub periods the impact of land use cover change may be much significant that raises the question what s the temporal distribution of the impact of climate variability and land use cover change on streamflow reduction furthermore besides streamflow evapotranspiration is an important factor in the hydrological cycle especially in the myrb because it accounts for more than 80 of precipitation while streamflow contributes less than 20 how then does climate variability and land use cover change affect the water balance i e the rations of streamflow and evapotranspiration to precipitation in the myrb these questions will be further discussed in this study the remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows the study area and dataset are summarized in section 2 the methodologies trend analysis and water balance formula are introduced in section 3 section 4 shows the hydro meteorological trends and land use cover changes water balance simulation and the impact of climate variability and land use cover change on water balance in the myrb finally the results and conclusions are discussed and summarized in sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 study area and dataset 2 1 the middle yellow river basin the yellow river originates in the northern foot of the bayankarla mountains in the qinghai plateau it flows through the loess plateau and the huang huai hai plain and finally joins the bohai sea the yellow river is the main water source for north and northwest china it is also the most prominent river in china especially its middle reaches located in arid and semi arid areas the middle yellow river basin is selected as the study area fig 1 the middle reaches of the yellow river refer to the interval from the hekou town to taohuayu the toudaoguai and huayuankou hydrological stations are the entry and exit control stations the myrb lies between 32 and 42 north latitude and 104 113 east longitude the total length of the main stream is 1234 km and the catchment area is about 362 000 km2 the myrb is located at an altitude of 80 4000 m most of the myrb is loess plateau and wei river and fen river valley are in the south and east respectively the myrb has been divided into 10 sub regions indicating different geographical features the myrb is located in the continental monsoon climate zone with an average annual precipitation of 518 mm an annual mean temperature of 9 33 c and an average annual potential evaporation of 1055 mm due to the alternation of winter and summer winds and the surrounding terrain the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation is uneven in the mryb it s dry in winter and rainy in summer precipitation in winter and spring accounts for 20 of annual precipitation and that in june and september of the flood season accounts for about 70 spatially annual precipitation decreases from southeast to northwest in the southern area of the qinling mountains annual precipitation can reach 700 1000 mm which is a humid and semi humid area while in the northwest of shanxi province and inner mongolia annual precipitation is less than 300 mm making them typical arid and semi arid climates the myrb is short of water and a large number of water conservancy projects have been built to improve the water supply for industry agriculture and urban and rural people there are 12 large reservoirs 103 medium sized reservoirs and 848 small reservoirs in the myrb between the toudaoguai and tongguan hydrological stations liu et al 2016 to effectively prevent and control soil erosion a large number of soil and water conservation projects have been carried out in the myrb since the 1970 s by 2012 above the tongguan hydrological station terraces covered 36 000 km2 and 57 914 silt dams with a capacity of more than 10 000 m3 had been built at the same time forest and grass coverage has increased significantly 2 2 dataset the data from 18 hydrological stations with observed daily streamflow are used in this study the basic information of these hydrological stations is expressed in table 1 the toudaoguai tongguan and huayuankou hydrological stations are located on the main reaches of the yellow river while the other 15 reflect the hydrological regimes of sub reaches of the myrb with the drainage area varying from 3175 km2 to 38 728 km2 the observed daily streamflow data in the 18 hydrological stations during 1951 2016 was extracted from china s hydrological yearbook published by the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources china the data about natural streamflow in 1956 1979 and 1980 2000 came from china s first and second water resources assessment the data about natural streamflow and water usage in 2001 2016 were collected from the china water resources bulletin and the yellow river water resources bulletin there are 39 standard meteorological stations in the myrb with daily precipitation mean temperature and pan evaporation data fig 1 the high quality meteorological data at these 39 stations were released by the china meteorological administration in line with standard quality control methodology the longest available data period is from 1951 to 2016 out of the 39 meteorological stations 23 59 with observed data were built before 1956 and 37 95 stations were built before 1960 due to the high quality of the meteorological data the missing data could be ignored as the regional average values were used in this study the regional climatic variables were calculated using the average of values at each station with available data in the target region the dem data were obtained from the srtm 90 m digital elevation data the land use data was mainly based on landsat tm etm remote sensing images and artificial visual interpretation of six periods 1980 1990 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 this information was obtained from the resources and environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn default aspx of the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research csa the normalized difference vegetation index data for 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 were also obtained from the resources and environment data cloud platform xu 2018 3 methodology 3 1 the mann kendall s test the nonparametric mann kendall s test mann 1945 kendall 1975 developed by mann and kendall is used to detect trends and breakpoints of hydro climatic variables in the myrb this methodology is widely used and has following advantages 1 it can handle non normality and censoring data 2 it has a high asymptotic efficiency fu et al 2004 a hypothesis test based on the mann kendall s statistic u f i for a significance level of α is applied to all variables the following test is done to prove or to disprove an assumption i e is there any statistically significant increasing or decreasing trend for the variable the test statistic u f i is calculated by the following formula zhang et al 2007 1 u f i s i e s i var s i i 1 2 n 2 s k i 1 k r i k 2 3 n 3 r i 1 x i x j 0 x i x j j 1 2 i 1 where xi is the variable which is an independent and identically distributed random variable with sample of n the expected value e s k and variance var s k could be estimated as follows 4 e s i i i 1 4 5 var s i i i 1 2 i 5 72 the null hypothesis h0 meaning that u f i are not statistically significant i e no significant warming cooling or wetting drying trend is accepted if u f i u α 2 where u α 2 is the standard normal deviates alternatively it is accepted that h1 i e u f i are statistically significant if u f i u α 2 a positive u f i value denotes a positive trend and a negative u f i value denotes a negative trend and then according to the inverse time series x n x n 1 x 1 u f i can be calculated again redefine u b i u f i i n n 1 1 plot the curve of u f i and u b i if there is a match point of the 2 curves between the boundary line at significant level α 0 05 the match point is the break point of the time series in addition to assessing the degree of change in the hydro climatic variables the coefficients of the liner regression equation of the time series have been used to identify the increasing decreasing rate 3 2 fu s water balance formula in a catchment the water balance equation can be expressed as 6 p r e δ s where p is precipitation r is streamflow e is evapotranspiration and δ s is the change of water storage on a multi year scale the water storage change can be assumed to be zero then the ratios of streamflow and evapotranspiration to precipitation could indicate the multi year water balance budyko 1974 has constructed a model to simulate the relationship between long term water precipitation and energy potential evaporation according to the hydrological and climatic physical mechanism of the basin the first analytical expression of budyko s hypothesis was constructed by fu 1981 and the multi year evapotranspiration could be estimated as 7 e p 1 e 0 p 1 e 0 p w 1 w where e 0 is potential evaporation w is a parameter that characterizes the natural geographical features of a basin such as vegetation type aridity index topography etc the relationship between parameter w and vegetation change at catchment scale has been detailed discussed by zhang et al 2001 first using long term data for precipitation streamflow and potential evaporation the parameter w is calibrated at the 15 sub catchments above the selected 15 hydrological stations except for three stations at the main reach of the yellow river to simulate the multi year water balance in the 10 sub regions of the myrb a multiple regression equation was used for regionalization of parameter w wilkerson and merwade 2010 seven physical descriptors were used for regionalization including annual precipitation p annual mean temperature t annual potential evaporation e0 aridity index e0 p farmland coverage rate fac forest coverage rate foc and grassland coverage rate gc using calibrated parameter w and seven physical characteristics in the 15 catchments the regression equation can be expressed as 8 w a 0 i 1 7 a i x i where xi are independent variables i e the seven physical descriptors of the catchment and a 0 a 1 a 7 are regression parameters which are calibrated by a widely used criterion the least square of the errors based on the regionalized fu s formula and analysis methodology of attribution of streamflow change bao et al 2012b the contribution of climate variability and human activities could be investigated 4 results 4 1 trends of climatic variables in the myrb the myrb has become much warmer and drier fig 2 during the last 60 years 1956 2016 the annual mean temperature has increased by 0 26 c per decade there is an oscillation in the annual mean temperature before 1996 over the last 60 years 1984 and 2015 are the coldest and hottest years respectively the increasing rate of annual mean temperature after 1997 is much higher than that before 1996 the multi year annual mean temperature is 8 92 c 9 25 c and 10 04 c in 1956 1979 1980 2000 and 2001 2016 respectively the 1980 2000 multi year average temperature is 0 33 warmer than that in 1956 1979 but the 2001 2016 multi year average temperature is 0 79 warmer than that in 1980 2000 the p value 1 04 10 10 of the liner regression equation and mann kendall s test value 5 73 both indicate that the increasing trend of annual mean temperature is statistically significant figs 2 a and 7 the time series of myrb areal precipitation from 1956 to 2016 is shown in fig 2 b there is a decreasing trend in the myrb during the last 60 years it is wetter during 1956 1964 with the highest annual precipitation reaching 768 mm in 1964 and then continues to decrease until 1997 which is the driest year with the annual precipitation only 336 mm then annual precipitation increased in the last 19 years the multi year average annual precipitation is 540 mm 498 mm and 512 mm in 1956 1979 1980 2000 and 2001 2016 respectively the 1980 2000 multi year average annual precipitation is 42 mm less than that in 1956 1979 otherwise the 2001 2016 multi year average annual precipitation is 14 mm higher than that in 1980 2000 during the 60 years the annual precipitation decreased by 66 mm i e the decreasing rate is 10 9 mm per decade statistically the p value 0 0584 of the liner regression equation indicates that the decreasing trend of annual precipitation is insignificant at α 0 05 level fig 2 b otherwise the mann kendall s test value 1 97 shows that the decreasing trend of annual precipitation is significant at α 0 05 level fig 7 therefore the significant level of the annual precipitation change might be uncertain 4 2 land use cover change in the myrb the land use of the myrb for the six periods i e 1980 1990 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 is shown in fig 3 farmland is the biggest usage in the myrb accounting for about 40 of the area it is mainly distributed in the wei river and fen river valleys grassland is next on 34 and forest on 20 the remaining 6 is surface water urban land and unused land the water surface area is the smallest the towns are scattered and the unused land is mainly located in sub regions ii and iii of the northwest mryb compared with 1980 the land use change is small by 2000 but significant by 2015 with a decrease in farmland and an increase in forest fig 4 for example in the myrb the farmland coverage rate increased by 0 1 in 2000 and decreased by 1 1 in 2015 compared to 1980 the forest coverage rate in 2000 is little changed from 1980 but increased by 0 5 in 2015 at the same time the change in grassland area is very small spatially the land use change of each sub region is not consistent with greatest changes in sub regions ii and iii located in the northwest myrb for example compared with 1980 the forest coverage rate in 2015 in sub regions ii and iii increased by 1 and 2 1 respectively which is much higher than other sub regions compared with 1980 the farmland area in all sub regions decreased in 2015 except for region x as it is difficult to accurately reflect the growth of vegetation based on the land use cover the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi change has been analyzed which is an important factor for catchment water balance fig 4 d from 2000 to 2015 the ndvi increased by 0 12 from 0 51 to 0 63 spatially in the 10 sub regions at 2015 the lowest and highest ndvi values were 0 40 and 0 78 in the sub region ii and viii respectively from 2000 to 2015 the largest variation of ndvi was in sub region vii with a change value of 0 15 and the smallest one was in sub region ix with a change of 0 07 4 3 trends in hydrology and water balance in the myrb during the last 60 years the annual mean streamflow has decreased at the toudaoguai tongguan and huayuankou hydrological stations by 7 1 m3 s 15 1 m3 s and 15 1 m3 s per year respectively fig 5 a like precipitation the streamflow begins to increase after 1997 at the three hydrological stations similarly the water resources of the myrb show a decreasing trend during the last 60 years fig 5 b the multi year annual total water resources of the myrb is 29 5 25 9 and 23 9 billion m3 in 1956 1979 1980 2000 and 2001 2016 respectively for the whole period the total water resources of the myrb have decreased by 9 9 billion m3 i e the decreasing rate is 0 162 billion m3 per year the mann kendall s test results show that the decreasing trends of the streamflow at the three hydrological stations and total water resources of the myrb are statistically significant at α 0 01 level fig 7 the water balance of the myrb has changed from 1956 to 2016 with less precipitation generating to streamflow and more water being evaporated fig 6 as shown in figs 6 and 7 there are decreasing and increasing trends for the ratio of streamflow and evapotranspiration to precipitation respectively and the trends are statistically significant at α 0 01 level in 1956 1979 1980 2000 and 2001 2016 the ratio of streamflow to precipitation is 0 151 0 144 and 0 129 respectively that means that for 1980 2000 the relationship of precipitation and streamflow is almost unchanged with a 0 007 decrease in the ratio of streamflow to precipitation otherwise it has a significant decrease after 2000 i e the ratio of streamflow to precipitation decreased by 0 022 the result is consistent with the relationship between annual streamflow and precipitation shown in fig 8 the solid red line and the dotted blue line coincide roughly which indicates the rainfall runoff relationship in 1956 1979 and 1980 2000 respectively but they differ greatly from the solid green line indicating 2000 2016 therefore compared to 1956 1979 with the same precipitation almost the same streamflow could be generated in 1980 2000 but less in 2001 2016 using the mann kendall s test methodology 1980 has been detected as the breakpoint of the streamflow in the myrb the whole period 1956 2016 can be divided into two sub periods 1956 1979 and 1980 2016 the period 1956 1979 can be regarded as the natural period or baseline period in which the hydrological cycle and water resources system keep their natural status and there is less impact of climate variability and human activities the period 1980 2016 is called the impacted period in which there is a statistically significant change of streamflow compared to it in the natural period this is consistent with the climate variability and human activities in the myrb but there are significant increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation after 1980 the 1980 s was the beginning of the reform and opening policy in china and human activities sediment check dams terraces water usage et al had a significant impact on hydrological processes in addition since 1999 the policy of returning farmland to forest and grazing prohibition has been fully implemented in the loess plateau for controlling water and soil erosion meantime precipitation began to increase after 2000 the coverage rate of forest and grassland increased by 20 30 in 1998 2014 a much higher change a 3 9 increase than that in 1978 1998 to analyze the detailed temporal distribution of the impact of climate variability and land use cover change on hydrology the impacted period has been divided into two sub periods 1980 2000 and 2001 2016 therefore three sub periods 1956 1979 1980 2000 and 2001 2016 have been split and used to analyze the impact of climate variability and land use cover change on the water balance in the myrb 4 4 regionalization of the parameter w of fu s formula the long term hydro climatic data were used to estimate the multi year water balance eq 6 at the catchments above the 15 hydrological stations located in the sub reaches of the myrb then the parameter w of the fu s formula i e eq 7 could be calculated for the 15 catchments before regionalization the relationship between the parameter w value and climatic and land cover characteristics in the catchments was analyzed fig 9 generally there is a positive relationship between parameter w and annual precipitation the correlation coefficient is 0 22 and farmland coverage rate the correlation coefficient is 0 47 and a negative relationship between parameter w and annual potential evaporation the correlation coefficient is 0 70 and the aridity index the correlation coefficient is 0 61 otherwise there are no significant correlations between parameter w and annual mean temperature and coverage rate of forest and grassland the scatterplot of the calibrated and regressed values of the parameter w is shown in fig 10 a the result indicates good performance of the multi regression equation for the regionalization of parameter w the correlation coefficient is 0 87 for the calibrated and regressed values the significance f value of the multi regression equation is 0 000909 i e the significance level is 99 9 therefore the multi regression equation is useful to estimate the parameter w value in the 10 subregions the regionalized values of the parameter w for the 10 subregions in three periods 1956 1979 1980 2000 and 2001 2016 are shown in fig 10 b spatially the lowest value of parameter w is in subregion i ii and x the highest value of parameter w is in sub region v and vii temporally the value of the parameter w has increased from 1956 1979 to 2001 2016 for example the values of the parameter w for sub region i are 2 29 2 45 and 2 51 in 1956 1979 1980 2000 and 2001 2016 respectively 4 5 impact of climate variability and land use cover change on water balance with the parameter w indicating the multi year relationship between water and energy the response of water balance i e the ratio of streamflow and evapotranspiration to precipitation to the change of parameter w and aridity index e0 p has been analyzed fig 11 1 with an increase of e0 p or w there is an increase of et p and a decrease of r p i e more water will be evaporated and less water will be generated to streamflow for example if the parameter w is 1 9 the value of et p is 0 67 and 0 78 when e0 p is 1 5 and 2 5 respectively similarly if the value of e0 p is 1 5 the values of et p will increase from 0 67 to 0 92 as the parameter w varies from 1 5 to 3 7 2 the increasing rate of et p decreases with an increase of e0 p for example when the parameter w is 1 9 et p increases by 0 066 from 0 668 to 0 734 as e0 p increases from 1 5 to 2 0 but et p only increases by 0 044 from 0 734 to 0 778 as e0 p increases from 2 0 to 2 5 3 the increasing rate of et p decreases as an increase of w for example when the e0 p is 1 5 et p increases by 0 175 from 0 668 to 0 843 as w increases from 1 9 to 2 8 but et p only increases by 0 073 from 0 843 to 0 916 as w increases from 2 8 to 3 7 based on the regionalized parameter w the multi year water balance of the 10 sub regions has been estimated for three periods 1956 1979 1980 2000 and 2001 2016 fig 12 spatially the highest and lowest et p are located in sub regions iv and x respectively during the last 60 years the et p has increased for the all 10 sub regions with the highest and lowest changes in sub regions ii and x respectively for example in 1956 1979 the et p of sub region ii was 0 846 then increased to 0 888 in 1980 2000 and finally reached 0 940 in 2001 2016 the water balance change for the myrb is shown in fig 13 compared with the value in 1956 1979 the parameter w changed slightly 0 03 in 1980 2000 but changed extensively 0 15 in 2001 2016 that means there are similar water energy relationships between 1956 and 1979 and 1980 2000 but those changed in 2001 2016 compared to the hydro climatic variables in 1956 1979 and in 1980 2000 the precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow have decreased by 42 5 mm 32 6 mm and 9 9 mm respectively table 2 using the parameter w estimated in 1956 1979 the simulated evapotranspiration and streamflow are 423 8 mm and 73 9 mm in 1980 2000 respectively therefore the streamflow decreased by 7 5 mm 81 5 73 9 and 2 4 mm 73 9 71 5 as a result of climate variability and land use cover change respectively due to the change of land use cover 2 4 mm of streamflow changed to evapotranspiration climate variability and land use cover change accounts for 75 8 7 5 9 9 and 24 2 2 4 9 9 of the streamflow decrease in the myrb respectively compared to that in 1956 1979 and 1980 2000 comparing the hydro climatic variables in 1956 1979 and in 2001 2016 the precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow have decreased by 27 7 mm 12 3 mm and 15 5 mm respectively table 2 using the parameter w estimated in 1956 1979 the simulated evapotranspiration and streamflow are 434 8 mm and 77 7 mm in 2001 2016 respectively therefore streamflow decreased by 3 8 mm 81 5 77 7 and 11 7 mm 77 7 66 0 due to climate variability and land use cover change respectively due to the change of land use cover 11 7 mm of streamflow changed to evapotranspiration climate variability and land use cover change accounted for 24 5 3 8 15 5 and 75 5 11 7 15 5 of the streamflow decrease in the myrb respectively between 1956 and 1979 and 2001 2016 compared to 1956 1979 climate variability is the main factor for streamflow decrease in 1980 2000 otherwise land use cover change is the main factor for streamflow decrease in 2001 2016 5 discussion 5 1 the mechanism of precipitation variability the dynamic mechanism of precipitation trends is complex the yellow river precipitation trend is likely due to the el niño southern oscillation enso as measured by the southern oscillation index soi the pacific decadal oscillation pdo the interdecadal pacific oscillation ipo and the magnitude of the east asian monsoon zhu and wang 2002 xue and liu 2008 fu et al 2009 the precipitation is likely to have a positive correlation with soi and a negative relationship with pdo and ipo fig 2 c for example in 1956 1979 the precipitation and soi are positive but the ipo and pdo are negative however in 1980 2000 the precipitation and soi are negative but the ipo and pdo are positive and in 2001 2016 the soi is positive but the ipo and pdo are negative and the precipitation has increased from the long term low value negative soi values are associated with warmer central and eastern tropical pacific ocean temperatures and a decrease in pacific trade winds known as el niño episodes a decrease in precipitation is usually detected in the myrb during negative soi and vice versa lim and kim 2007 the pdo is an indicator of the temperature of the pacific surface water north of 20 n a positive pdo value indicates that the western pacific has cooled and north china will be controlled by high pressure and precipitation decreases yang et al 2005 the ipo is also an indicator of surface water temperature but in both the north and south pacific a positive ipo value means the surface sea water in the tropical eastern pacific is warmer and the location of the sub tropical high pressure system is anomalously north meaning less vapor will be transferred to north china these all lead to the decline of precipitation in north china hao and lu 2006 our results are consistent with these mechanisms 5 2 the link between the rainfall runoff relationship and land use cover as shown in fig 8 there is a similar rainfall runoff relationship between 1956 and 1979 and 1980 2000 but there is a dramatic change in 2001 2016 this is consistent with the change of land use cover in the myrb mainly caused by human activities including sediment check dams terraces returning farmland to forest grazing bans and other soil and water conservation measures even though the sediment check dams and terraces were built in the 1960s the coverage rate of forest and grassland only increased by 3 9 in 1978 1998 because of the long term decrease of precipitation liu et al 2016 since 1999 the policy of returning farmland to forest and grazing bans has been fully implemented on the loess plateau forests can store more water than farmland and decreasing streamflow and increasing evapotranspiration schilling et al 2008 meanwhile the precipitation begins to increase after 1998 the coverage rate of forest and grassland increased by 20 30 in 1998 2014 this can also be investigated by the change of ndvi which increased from 0 51 in 2000 to 0 63 in 2015 fig 4 d the better the vegetation grows the more water is trapped and absorbed by the plants and eventually consumed by evapotranspiration resulting in less streamflow zhang et al 2008 2014 therefore with the same precipitation less streamflow is generated in 2001 2016 compared to 1956 1979 the parameter w also indicates the multi year rainfall runoff relationship the change of parameter w has similar temporal characteristics with the land cover change i e it is similar from 1956 to 1979 and 1980 to 2000 but the change is relatively large from 2001 to 2016 fig 13 there is a positive relationship between the parameter w and ndvi the larger the ndvi the larger the parameter w will be and vice versa this is consistent with the findings by zhang et al 2001 i e the largest value of w is in forest followed by mixed and then pasture 5 3 the combined effect of climate change and land use cover change on water balance climate change and land use cover change have had significant impacts on the water balance in the myrb during the last 60 years the combined effect of climate change and land use cover change cannot be ignored based on the sensitivity analysis as an increase of parameter w there is a decrease of the response of et p to the e0 p increase fig 11 for example as the e0 p increases from 1 5 to 2 5 the et p will increase by 0 111 and 0 061 when the parameter w is 1 9 and 3 7 respectively this is consistent with the results of teutschbein et al 2018 i e there is a strong connection between the extent of forest cover and the sensitivity of hydrology to changing climate at the same time with an increase in e0 p there is a decrease in the response of et p to the parameter w increase for example as the parameter w increases from 1 9 to 3 7 the et p will increase by 0 249 and 0 199 when the e0 p is 1 5 and 2 5 respectively 5 4 comparison with previous studies the decreasing trends of streamflow and precipitation and increasing trend of temperature in the myrb are consistent with previous results yang et al 2004 liang et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 numerous studies have also investigated the impact of climate variability and land use cove change on hydrology in some typical catchments located in the myrb and conclude that the land use cover change by soil conservation is the main reason for streamflow decrease in the myrb over the last several decades li et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 2014 the consistent results have also been investigated in this study as with previous studies the whole period 1956 2016 is divided into two sub periods by the breakpoint of the streamflow compared to the baseline period 1956 1979 the streamflow decreased by 12 3 mm in 1980 2016 in which 5 7 mm 81 5 75 8 and 6 6 mm 75 8 69 2 were caused by climate variability and land use cover change respectively table 2 therefore climate variability and land use cover change accounts for 46 3 5 7 12 3 and 53 7 6 6 12 3 of the streamflow decrease in the myrb respectively the attribution of streamflow change is sensitive to the breakpoint of annual streamflow bao et al 2012b based on the mann kendall test the lines uf and ub are close together during 1972 1988 fig 14 a to investigate the temporal variability of the contribution of climate variability and land use cover change the sensitivity of attribution of streamflow change to the break of the time series has been analyzed fig 14b from 1972 to 1988 the contribution of climate variability and land use cover change for streamflow decrease was sensitive to the breakpoint for example the highest and lowest values of the contribution of climate variability are 67 7 and 38 2 respectively therefore it is essential to analyze this in more detail based on the variability of hydro climatic variables and land cover use change the long term period has been divided into three sub periods of this paper compared to 1956 1979 climate variability was the main factor accounting for 75 8 for streamflow decrease in 1980 2000 while land use cover change was the main factor 75 5 for streamflow decrease in 2001 2016 this is different to the previous studies which divide the long term period into two sub periods by the breakpoint of streamflow using 1956 1979 as the baseline period the precipitation change in 1980 2000 is larger than that in 2001 2016 but the streamflow change is smaller this is because of the change of evapotranspiration which accounts for more than 80 of precipitation in the myrb compared to the baseline period 1956 1979 2 4 mm of streamflow shifted to evapotranspiration in 1980 2000 due to the change of land use cover in 2001 2016 11 7 mm of streamflow was stored in the soil and evaporated the detailed analysis of the temporal variability of the attribution of hydrological regimes change is useful to understand what has happened in the basin and why therefore during the whole period land use cover change is the main reason for water balance change in the myrb especially after 2000 6 conclusions located in semi humid and semi arid regions the myrb has a severe water shortage problem based on the hydro climatic data and land use cover data the changes of precipitation temperature land use cover and water balance have been investigated during the last 60 years using the mann kendall s test methodology based on the parameter w regionalization the response of water balance to climate change and land use cover change and the attribution for streamflow decrease have been analyzed in the 10 sub regions of the myrb the findings are listed as follows 1 during the last 60 years 1956 2016 the myrb has become much warmer and drier with a statistically significant increasing trend of annual mean temperature at α 0 01 level but the significant level of precipitation decrease is uncertain 2 compared with 1980 the land use change in 2000 is small but significant in 2015 with a decrease in farmland and an increase in forest i e an increase of ndvi 3 there are decreasing trends for streamflow and water resources in the myrb the water balance of the myrb has changed from 1956 to 2016 with less precipitation generating to streamflow and more water being stored in the soil and then evaporating especially after 2000 4 based on the analysis of the relationship between the parameter w of the fu s formula and climatic and land use cover characteristics the parameter w is regionalized using a multi regression equation and the result denotes good performance 5 with an increase of e0 p or w there is an increase of et p and a decrease of r p but the increasing rate of et p decreases with an increase of e0 p or w 6 compared with 1956 1979 climate variability and land use cover change accounts for 75 8 and 24 2 of the streamflow decrease in 1980 2000 of the myrb however climate variability and land use cover change account for 24 5 and 75 5 of the streamflow decrease in 2001 2016 respectively therefore climate variability is the main factor for streamflow decrease in 1980 2000 while land use cover change is the main factor for streamflow decrease in 2001 2016 the results are useful for understanding what has happened and what will happen under climate change and land use cover changes for adaptive future water resources management declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this research is funded by

6219,climate variability and land use cover change have a significant impact on hydrological regimes especially in arid and semi arid regions which have critical water shortage problems using the mann kendall s test methodology trends in hydro climatic variables including precipitation temperature land use and water balance indicators have been detected during the last 60 years in the middle yellow river basin myrb generally the myrb has become much warmer and drier compared with 1980 the land use has also changed to a small degree by 2000 and to a significant degree by 2015 with an increase in vegetation coverage there are decreasing trends for streamflow and water resources and a shift in water balance with less precipitation generating streamflow and more water being evaporated especially after 2000 the response of water balance to climate change and land use cover change and the attribution for streamflow decrease was analyzed in the 10 sub regions of the myrb based on the regionalization of parameter w of fu s formula the results indicate that with an increase of e0 p potential evaporation precipitation or w there is an increase of et p evapotranspiration precipitation and a decrease of r p streamflow precipitation but the increasing rate of et p decreases with an increase of e0 p or w based on the natural period streamflow of 1956 1979 climate variability accounts for 75 8 of streamflow decrease in 1980 2000 but in 2001 2016 land use cover change is the main factor in streamflow decrease accounting for 75 5 of the decline the results are useful for understanding what has happened and what will happen under climate change and land use cover change for adaption to future water resources management keywords impact climate variability land use cover change water balance middle yellow river basin 1 introduction the yellow river is the second longest river in china and its contribution to chinese civilisation has earned it the title of the country s mother river it has a total length of about 5464 km and drains a watershed of 752 443 km2 it accounts for about 2 6 of china s water putting it fourth among the country s seven major rivers because of less precipitation there is a critical water shortage problem in the yellow river basin the basin has only 620 m3 in per capita water resources which is 30 and 7 5 of the national and global per capita water resources respectively wang et al 2000 fu et al 2004 more seriously due to climate variability and land use cover change there has been a significant decreasing trend for observed streamflow at several main gauging stations along the yellow river during the last several decades zhao et al 2015 this may lead to more serious water shortages in the future therefore it is essential to assess the impact of climate variability and land use cover change on the water balance in the yellow river basin to understand what has happened and what will happen for adaption in future water resources management the impact of climate change on hydrology and water resources is a 10 year 2013 2022 research theme of the international association of hydrological sciences montanari et al 2013 and has been investigated in many parts of the world it has been investigated on a global scale arnell and lloyd hughes 2014 in the nile river siam and eltahir 2017 on the southern california coast lopez et al 2013 in the continental united states renner and bernhofer 2012 in the murray darling basin in australia donohue et al 2011 in china wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2015a b in northern china yang and yang 2011 on the huang huai hai plain in china dan et al 2012 in the hai river basin in china bao et al 2012a and in south central ethiopia legesse et al 2003 among other places generally there are two methodologies to assess the impact of climate change on hydrology one is based on a hydrological model using hypothetical climatic scenarios while the other is based on the elasticity of hydrology to climate change using long term observed data the hydrological simulation based methodology has been used widely several studies indicate that a 1 increase in precipitation leads to an increase in streamflow of between 2 1 and 2 5 in 22 catchments in australia jones et al 2006 and streamflow decreases of 30 result from a 10 decrease in precipitation in south central ethiopia legesse et al 2003 etc but because of the uncertainty of model structure and parameters different models showed different results even in the same catchments highlighting the need to define a formula to assess the elasticity of streamflow to precipitation sankarasubramanian et al 2001 fu et al 2007 developed the one parameter elasticity formula into a two parameter precipitation and temperature elasticity formula furthermore yang and yang 2011 investigated the sensitivity of streamflow to precipitation net radiation air temperature wind speed and relative humidity recently hasan et al 2018 used the budyko curve and climate elasticity to investigate streamflow sensitivity to climate change in the nile river basin and the results indicated that a 10 decrease in precipitation leads to a decrease in streamflow of between 19 in tropical zones and 30 in arid zones besides climate change land use cover change is another important factor influencing hydrological regimes sun et al 2018 wang et al 2019 three methodologies have been used to assess the regimes impact on hydrology and water resources paired catchments huang et al 1999 long term time series analysis jothityangkoon et al 2001 yang and tian 2009 and hydrological simulation schilling et al 2008 based on the paired catchments muñoz villers mcdonnell 2013 compared the streamflow generation of three neighbouring catchments in eastern mexico with different land cover and found that pasture showed a 10 higher mean annual streamflow compared to mature and secondary forest most likely because of lower rainfall interception however this methodology is only suitable for small watersheds and not applicable to large watersheds lorup et al 1998 li et al 2009 because the influence of climate change on hydrological processes cannot be isolated by the method of long term time series analysis costa et al 2003 the hydrological simulation based methodology has been used more and more widely for example schilling et al 2008 used the soil and water assessment tool swat to study the impact of land use and land cover change on the water balance of a large agricultural watershed in the united states their results indicated that increased corn production might decrease annual evapotranspiration and increase water yield meanwhile stehr et al 2010 used a physically based distributed precipitation runoff model and different land use scenarios generated by heuristic rules and logistic regression models to investigate mean annual discharge increases with agricultural land use and diminishment with introduced forest coverage of the vergara watershed located in central chile this methodology has also been applied to a catchment on the loess plateau china and the results showed that the higher the growth of forest and grassland the greater the evapotranspiration transferred and the less surface streamflow and soil water generated yan et al 2018 recently the combined effect of climate change and land use cover change on hydrology has been in focus bao et al 2012b for example there was a strong connection between the extent of forest cover and the response of a catchment s hydrological regime to climate change teutschbein et al 2018 fresh water resources on earth are fragile especially in arid and semi arid regions and may be strongly affected by climate change and human activities with a consequence for human society and ecosystems bates et al 2008 taking the shiyang river basin in the arid region of northwest china as an example ma et al 2008 concluded that climate variability mainly in the form of decreased precipitation accounted for over 64 of the reduction in mean annual streamflow during the last 50 years while human activities accounted for 36 cuo et al 2013 used the variable infiltration capacity model to study the impacts of climate change and land cover use transition on the hydrology in the upper yellow river basin and found that there was a decrease in wet and warm season streamflow and annual streamflow due to the combined effects of changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration otherwise the conservation programs had some positive impacts on water resources numerous studies have also been done on the impact of climate change and land cove use change on hydrology in the myrb generally these studies have consistent conclusions i e the land use cover change by soil conservation is the main reason for streamflow decrease in the myrb over the last several decades zhao et al 2014 for example li et al 2007 found that soil conservation measures account for 87 of the streamflow reduction in the wuding river basin zhang et al 2008 pointed out that the land use cover changes accounted for over 50 of the streamflow reduction in eight out of the 11 catchments in the loess plateau gao et al 2016 concluded that 70 of the streamflow reduction can be attributed to land use change in the myrb despite the depth of research in the area several questions need further investigation first the previous studies mainly focused on the typical catchment scale because the parameters of the hydrologic model were calibrated in the sub catchments so the question is how does climate variability and land use cover change affect the water balance for the entire myrb and what s the spatial distribution second the total contributions of climate variability and land use cover change on streamflow reduction have been detected by some previous studies but in some sub periods the impact of climate variability may be important otherwise in other sub periods the impact of land use cover change may be much significant that raises the question what s the temporal distribution of the impact of climate variability and land use cover change on streamflow reduction furthermore besides streamflow evapotranspiration is an important factor in the hydrological cycle especially in the myrb because it accounts for more than 80 of precipitation while streamflow contributes less than 20 how then does climate variability and land use cover change affect the water balance i e the rations of streamflow and evapotranspiration to precipitation in the myrb these questions will be further discussed in this study the remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows the study area and dataset are summarized in section 2 the methodologies trend analysis and water balance formula are introduced in section 3 section 4 shows the hydro meteorological trends and land use cover changes water balance simulation and the impact of climate variability and land use cover change on water balance in the myrb finally the results and conclusions are discussed and summarized in sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 study area and dataset 2 1 the middle yellow river basin the yellow river originates in the northern foot of the bayankarla mountains in the qinghai plateau it flows through the loess plateau and the huang huai hai plain and finally joins the bohai sea the yellow river is the main water source for north and northwest china it is also the most prominent river in china especially its middle reaches located in arid and semi arid areas the middle yellow river basin is selected as the study area fig 1 the middle reaches of the yellow river refer to the interval from the hekou town to taohuayu the toudaoguai and huayuankou hydrological stations are the entry and exit control stations the myrb lies between 32 and 42 north latitude and 104 113 east longitude the total length of the main stream is 1234 km and the catchment area is about 362 000 km2 the myrb is located at an altitude of 80 4000 m most of the myrb is loess plateau and wei river and fen river valley are in the south and east respectively the myrb has been divided into 10 sub regions indicating different geographical features the myrb is located in the continental monsoon climate zone with an average annual precipitation of 518 mm an annual mean temperature of 9 33 c and an average annual potential evaporation of 1055 mm due to the alternation of winter and summer winds and the surrounding terrain the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation is uneven in the mryb it s dry in winter and rainy in summer precipitation in winter and spring accounts for 20 of annual precipitation and that in june and september of the flood season accounts for about 70 spatially annual precipitation decreases from southeast to northwest in the southern area of the qinling mountains annual precipitation can reach 700 1000 mm which is a humid and semi humid area while in the northwest of shanxi province and inner mongolia annual precipitation is less than 300 mm making them typical arid and semi arid climates the myrb is short of water and a large number of water conservancy projects have been built to improve the water supply for industry agriculture and urban and rural people there are 12 large reservoirs 103 medium sized reservoirs and 848 small reservoirs in the myrb between the toudaoguai and tongguan hydrological stations liu et al 2016 to effectively prevent and control soil erosion a large number of soil and water conservation projects have been carried out in the myrb since the 1970 s by 2012 above the tongguan hydrological station terraces covered 36 000 km2 and 57 914 silt dams with a capacity of more than 10 000 m3 had been built at the same time forest and grass coverage has increased significantly 2 2 dataset the data from 18 hydrological stations with observed daily streamflow are used in this study the basic information of these hydrological stations is expressed in table 1 the toudaoguai tongguan and huayuankou hydrological stations are located on the main reaches of the yellow river while the other 15 reflect the hydrological regimes of sub reaches of the myrb with the drainage area varying from 3175 km2 to 38 728 km2 the observed daily streamflow data in the 18 hydrological stations during 1951 2016 was extracted from china s hydrological yearbook published by the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources china the data about natural streamflow in 1956 1979 and 1980 2000 came from china s first and second water resources assessment the data about natural streamflow and water usage in 2001 2016 were collected from the china water resources bulletin and the yellow river water resources bulletin there are 39 standard meteorological stations in the myrb with daily precipitation mean temperature and pan evaporation data fig 1 the high quality meteorological data at these 39 stations were released by the china meteorological administration in line with standard quality control methodology the longest available data period is from 1951 to 2016 out of the 39 meteorological stations 23 59 with observed data were built before 1956 and 37 95 stations were built before 1960 due to the high quality of the meteorological data the missing data could be ignored as the regional average values were used in this study the regional climatic variables were calculated using the average of values at each station with available data in the target region the dem data were obtained from the srtm 90 m digital elevation data the land use data was mainly based on landsat tm etm remote sensing images and artificial visual interpretation of six periods 1980 1990 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 this information was obtained from the resources and environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn default aspx of the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research csa the normalized difference vegetation index data for 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 were also obtained from the resources and environment data cloud platform xu 2018 3 methodology 3 1 the mann kendall s test the nonparametric mann kendall s test mann 1945 kendall 1975 developed by mann and kendall is used to detect trends and breakpoints of hydro climatic variables in the myrb this methodology is widely used and has following advantages 1 it can handle non normality and censoring data 2 it has a high asymptotic efficiency fu et al 2004 a hypothesis test based on the mann kendall s statistic u f i for a significance level of α is applied to all variables the following test is done to prove or to disprove an assumption i e is there any statistically significant increasing or decreasing trend for the variable the test statistic u f i is calculated by the following formula zhang et al 2007 1 u f i s i e s i var s i i 1 2 n 2 s k i 1 k r i k 2 3 n 3 r i 1 x i x j 0 x i x j j 1 2 i 1 where xi is the variable which is an independent and identically distributed random variable with sample of n the expected value e s k and variance var s k could be estimated as follows 4 e s i i i 1 4 5 var s i i i 1 2 i 5 72 the null hypothesis h0 meaning that u f i are not statistically significant i e no significant warming cooling or wetting drying trend is accepted if u f i u α 2 where u α 2 is the standard normal deviates alternatively it is accepted that h1 i e u f i are statistically significant if u f i u α 2 a positive u f i value denotes a positive trend and a negative u f i value denotes a negative trend and then according to the inverse time series x n x n 1 x 1 u f i can be calculated again redefine u b i u f i i n n 1 1 plot the curve of u f i and u b i if there is a match point of the 2 curves between the boundary line at significant level α 0 05 the match point is the break point of the time series in addition to assessing the degree of change in the hydro climatic variables the coefficients of the liner regression equation of the time series have been used to identify the increasing decreasing rate 3 2 fu s water balance formula in a catchment the water balance equation can be expressed as 6 p r e δ s where p is precipitation r is streamflow e is evapotranspiration and δ s is the change of water storage on a multi year scale the water storage change can be assumed to be zero then the ratios of streamflow and evapotranspiration to precipitation could indicate the multi year water balance budyko 1974 has constructed a model to simulate the relationship between long term water precipitation and energy potential evaporation according to the hydrological and climatic physical mechanism of the basin the first analytical expression of budyko s hypothesis was constructed by fu 1981 and the multi year evapotranspiration could be estimated as 7 e p 1 e 0 p 1 e 0 p w 1 w where e 0 is potential evaporation w is a parameter that characterizes the natural geographical features of a basin such as vegetation type aridity index topography etc the relationship between parameter w and vegetation change at catchment scale has been detailed discussed by zhang et al 2001 first using long term data for precipitation streamflow and potential evaporation the parameter w is calibrated at the 15 sub catchments above the selected 15 hydrological stations except for three stations at the main reach of the yellow river to simulate the multi year water balance in the 10 sub regions of the myrb a multiple regression equation was used for regionalization of parameter w wilkerson and merwade 2010 seven physical descriptors were used for regionalization including annual precipitation p annual mean temperature t annual potential evaporation e0 aridity index e0 p farmland coverage rate fac forest coverage rate foc and grassland coverage rate gc using calibrated parameter w and seven physical characteristics in the 15 catchments the regression equation can be expressed as 8 w a 0 i 1 7 a i x i where xi are independent variables i e the seven physical descriptors of the catchment and a 0 a 1 a 7 are regression parameters which are calibrated by a widely used criterion the least square of the errors based on the regionalized fu s formula and analysis methodology of attribution of streamflow change bao et al 2012b the contribution of climate variability and human activities could be investigated 4 results 4 1 trends of climatic variables in the myrb the myrb has become much warmer and drier fig 2 during the last 60 years 1956 2016 the annual mean temperature has increased by 0 26 c per decade there is an oscillation in the annual mean temperature before 1996 over the last 60 years 1984 and 2015 are the coldest and hottest years respectively the increasing rate of annual mean temperature after 1997 is much higher than that before 1996 the multi year annual mean temperature is 8 92 c 9 25 c and 10 04 c in 1956 1979 1980 2000 and 2001 2016 respectively the 1980 2000 multi year average temperature is 0 33 warmer than that in 1956 1979 but the 2001 2016 multi year average temperature is 0 79 warmer than that in 1980 2000 the p value 1 04 10 10 of the liner regression equation and mann kendall s test value 5 73 both indicate that the increasing trend of annual mean temperature is statistically significant figs 2 a and 7 the time series of myrb areal precipitation from 1956 to 2016 is shown in fig 2 b there is a decreasing trend in the myrb during the last 60 years it is wetter during 1956 1964 with the highest annual precipitation reaching 768 mm in 1964 and then continues to decrease until 1997 which is the driest year with the annual precipitation only 336 mm then annual precipitation increased in the last 19 years the multi year average annual precipitation is 540 mm 498 mm and 512 mm in 1956 1979 1980 2000 and 2001 2016 respectively the 1980 2000 multi year average annual precipitation is 42 mm less than that in 1956 1979 otherwise the 2001 2016 multi year average annual precipitation is 14 mm higher than that in 1980 2000 during the 60 years the annual precipitation decreased by 66 mm i e the decreasing rate is 10 9 mm per decade statistically the p value 0 0584 of the liner regression equation indicates that the decreasing trend of annual precipitation is insignificant at α 0 05 level fig 2 b otherwise the mann kendall s test value 1 97 shows that the decreasing trend of annual precipitation is significant at α 0 05 level fig 7 therefore the significant level of the annual precipitation change might be uncertain 4 2 land use cover change in the myrb the land use of the myrb for the six periods i e 1980 1990 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 is shown in fig 3 farmland is the biggest usage in the myrb accounting for about 40 of the area it is mainly distributed in the wei river and fen river valleys grassland is next on 34 and forest on 20 the remaining 6 is surface water urban land and unused land the water surface area is the smallest the towns are scattered and the unused land is mainly located in sub regions ii and iii of the northwest mryb compared with 1980 the land use change is small by 2000 but significant by 2015 with a decrease in farmland and an increase in forest fig 4 for example in the myrb the farmland coverage rate increased by 0 1 in 2000 and decreased by 1 1 in 2015 compared to 1980 the forest coverage rate in 2000 is little changed from 1980 but increased by 0 5 in 2015 at the same time the change in grassland area is very small spatially the land use change of each sub region is not consistent with greatest changes in sub regions ii and iii located in the northwest myrb for example compared with 1980 the forest coverage rate in 2015 in sub regions ii and iii increased by 1 and 2 1 respectively which is much higher than other sub regions compared with 1980 the farmland area in all sub regions decreased in 2015 except for region x as it is difficult to accurately reflect the growth of vegetation based on the land use cover the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi change has been analyzed which is an important factor for catchment water balance fig 4 d from 2000 to 2015 the ndvi increased by 0 12 from 0 51 to 0 63 spatially in the 10 sub regions at 2015 the lowest and highest ndvi values were 0 40 and 0 78 in the sub region ii and viii respectively from 2000 to 2015 the largest variation of ndvi was in sub region vii with a change value of 0 15 and the smallest one was in sub region ix with a change of 0 07 4 3 trends in hydrology and water balance in the myrb during the last 60 years the annual mean streamflow has decreased at the toudaoguai tongguan and huayuankou hydrological stations by 7 1 m3 s 15 1 m3 s and 15 1 m3 s per year respectively fig 5 a like precipitation the streamflow begins to increase after 1997 at the three hydrological stations similarly the water resources of the myrb show a decreasing trend during the last 60 years fig 5 b the multi year annual total water resources of the myrb is 29 5 25 9 and 23 9 billion m3 in 1956 1979 1980 2000 and 2001 2016 respectively for the whole period the total water resources of the myrb have decreased by 9 9 billion m3 i e the decreasing rate is 0 162 billion m3 per year the mann kendall s test results show that the decreasing trends of the streamflow at the three hydrological stations and total water resources of the myrb are statistically significant at α 0 01 level fig 7 the water balance of the myrb has changed from 1956 to 2016 with less precipitation generating to streamflow and more water being evaporated fig 6 as shown in figs 6 and 7 there are decreasing and increasing trends for the ratio of streamflow and evapotranspiration to precipitation respectively and the trends are statistically significant at α 0 01 level in 1956 1979 1980 2000 and 2001 2016 the ratio of streamflow to precipitation is 0 151 0 144 and 0 129 respectively that means that for 1980 2000 the relationship of precipitation and streamflow is almost unchanged with a 0 007 decrease in the ratio of streamflow to precipitation otherwise it has a significant decrease after 2000 i e the ratio of streamflow to precipitation decreased by 0 022 the result is consistent with the relationship between annual streamflow and precipitation shown in fig 8 the solid red line and the dotted blue line coincide roughly which indicates the rainfall runoff relationship in 1956 1979 and 1980 2000 respectively but they differ greatly from the solid green line indicating 2000 2016 therefore compared to 1956 1979 with the same precipitation almost the same streamflow could be generated in 1980 2000 but less in 2001 2016 using the mann kendall s test methodology 1980 has been detected as the breakpoint of the streamflow in the myrb the whole period 1956 2016 can be divided into two sub periods 1956 1979 and 1980 2016 the period 1956 1979 can be regarded as the natural period or baseline period in which the hydrological cycle and water resources system keep their natural status and there is less impact of climate variability and human activities the period 1980 2016 is called the impacted period in which there is a statistically significant change of streamflow compared to it in the natural period this is consistent with the climate variability and human activities in the myrb but there are significant increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation after 1980 the 1980 s was the beginning of the reform and opening policy in china and human activities sediment check dams terraces water usage et al had a significant impact on hydrological processes in addition since 1999 the policy of returning farmland to forest and grazing prohibition has been fully implemented in the loess plateau for controlling water and soil erosion meantime precipitation began to increase after 2000 the coverage rate of forest and grassland increased by 20 30 in 1998 2014 a much higher change a 3 9 increase than that in 1978 1998 to analyze the detailed temporal distribution of the impact of climate variability and land use cover change on hydrology the impacted period has been divided into two sub periods 1980 2000 and 2001 2016 therefore three sub periods 1956 1979 1980 2000 and 2001 2016 have been split and used to analyze the impact of climate variability and land use cover change on the water balance in the myrb 4 4 regionalization of the parameter w of fu s formula the long term hydro climatic data were used to estimate the multi year water balance eq 6 at the catchments above the 15 hydrological stations located in the sub reaches of the myrb then the parameter w of the fu s formula i e eq 7 could be calculated for the 15 catchments before regionalization the relationship between the parameter w value and climatic and land cover characteristics in the catchments was analyzed fig 9 generally there is a positive relationship between parameter w and annual precipitation the correlation coefficient is 0 22 and farmland coverage rate the correlation coefficient is 0 47 and a negative relationship between parameter w and annual potential evaporation the correlation coefficient is 0 70 and the aridity index the correlation coefficient is 0 61 otherwise there are no significant correlations between parameter w and annual mean temperature and coverage rate of forest and grassland the scatterplot of the calibrated and regressed values of the parameter w is shown in fig 10 a the result indicates good performance of the multi regression equation for the regionalization of parameter w the correlation coefficient is 0 87 for the calibrated and regressed values the significance f value of the multi regression equation is 0 000909 i e the significance level is 99 9 therefore the multi regression equation is useful to estimate the parameter w value in the 10 subregions the regionalized values of the parameter w for the 10 subregions in three periods 1956 1979 1980 2000 and 2001 2016 are shown in fig 10 b spatially the lowest value of parameter w is in subregion i ii and x the highest value of parameter w is in sub region v and vii temporally the value of the parameter w has increased from 1956 1979 to 2001 2016 for example the values of the parameter w for sub region i are 2 29 2 45 and 2 51 in 1956 1979 1980 2000 and 2001 2016 respectively 4 5 impact of climate variability and land use cover change on water balance with the parameter w indicating the multi year relationship between water and energy the response of water balance i e the ratio of streamflow and evapotranspiration to precipitation to the change of parameter w and aridity index e0 p has been analyzed fig 11 1 with an increase of e0 p or w there is an increase of et p and a decrease of r p i e more water will be evaporated and less water will be generated to streamflow for example if the parameter w is 1 9 the value of et p is 0 67 and 0 78 when e0 p is 1 5 and 2 5 respectively similarly if the value of e0 p is 1 5 the values of et p will increase from 0 67 to 0 92 as the parameter w varies from 1 5 to 3 7 2 the increasing rate of et p decreases with an increase of e0 p for example when the parameter w is 1 9 et p increases by 0 066 from 0 668 to 0 734 as e0 p increases from 1 5 to 2 0 but et p only increases by 0 044 from 0 734 to 0 778 as e0 p increases from 2 0 to 2 5 3 the increasing rate of et p decreases as an increase of w for example when the e0 p is 1 5 et p increases by 0 175 from 0 668 to 0 843 as w increases from 1 9 to 2 8 but et p only increases by 0 073 from 0 843 to 0 916 as w increases from 2 8 to 3 7 based on the regionalized parameter w the multi year water balance of the 10 sub regions has been estimated for three periods 1956 1979 1980 2000 and 2001 2016 fig 12 spatially the highest and lowest et p are located in sub regions iv and x respectively during the last 60 years the et p has increased for the all 10 sub regions with the highest and lowest changes in sub regions ii and x respectively for example in 1956 1979 the et p of sub region ii was 0 846 then increased to 0 888 in 1980 2000 and finally reached 0 940 in 2001 2016 the water balance change for the myrb is shown in fig 13 compared with the value in 1956 1979 the parameter w changed slightly 0 03 in 1980 2000 but changed extensively 0 15 in 2001 2016 that means there are similar water energy relationships between 1956 and 1979 and 1980 2000 but those changed in 2001 2016 compared to the hydro climatic variables in 1956 1979 and in 1980 2000 the precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow have decreased by 42 5 mm 32 6 mm and 9 9 mm respectively table 2 using the parameter w estimated in 1956 1979 the simulated evapotranspiration and streamflow are 423 8 mm and 73 9 mm in 1980 2000 respectively therefore the streamflow decreased by 7 5 mm 81 5 73 9 and 2 4 mm 73 9 71 5 as a result of climate variability and land use cover change respectively due to the change of land use cover 2 4 mm of streamflow changed to evapotranspiration climate variability and land use cover change accounts for 75 8 7 5 9 9 and 24 2 2 4 9 9 of the streamflow decrease in the myrb respectively compared to that in 1956 1979 and 1980 2000 comparing the hydro climatic variables in 1956 1979 and in 2001 2016 the precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow have decreased by 27 7 mm 12 3 mm and 15 5 mm respectively table 2 using the parameter w estimated in 1956 1979 the simulated evapotranspiration and streamflow are 434 8 mm and 77 7 mm in 2001 2016 respectively therefore streamflow decreased by 3 8 mm 81 5 77 7 and 11 7 mm 77 7 66 0 due to climate variability and land use cover change respectively due to the change of land use cover 11 7 mm of streamflow changed to evapotranspiration climate variability and land use cover change accounted for 24 5 3 8 15 5 and 75 5 11 7 15 5 of the streamflow decrease in the myrb respectively between 1956 and 1979 and 2001 2016 compared to 1956 1979 climate variability is the main factor for streamflow decrease in 1980 2000 otherwise land use cover change is the main factor for streamflow decrease in 2001 2016 5 discussion 5 1 the mechanism of precipitation variability the dynamic mechanism of precipitation trends is complex the yellow river precipitation trend is likely due to the el niño southern oscillation enso as measured by the southern oscillation index soi the pacific decadal oscillation pdo the interdecadal pacific oscillation ipo and the magnitude of the east asian monsoon zhu and wang 2002 xue and liu 2008 fu et al 2009 the precipitation is likely to have a positive correlation with soi and a negative relationship with pdo and ipo fig 2 c for example in 1956 1979 the precipitation and soi are positive but the ipo and pdo are negative however in 1980 2000 the precipitation and soi are negative but the ipo and pdo are positive and in 2001 2016 the soi is positive but the ipo and pdo are negative and the precipitation has increased from the long term low value negative soi values are associated with warmer central and eastern tropical pacific ocean temperatures and a decrease in pacific trade winds known as el niño episodes a decrease in precipitation is usually detected in the myrb during negative soi and vice versa lim and kim 2007 the pdo is an indicator of the temperature of the pacific surface water north of 20 n a positive pdo value indicates that the western pacific has cooled and north china will be controlled by high pressure and precipitation decreases yang et al 2005 the ipo is also an indicator of surface water temperature but in both the north and south pacific a positive ipo value means the surface sea water in the tropical eastern pacific is warmer and the location of the sub tropical high pressure system is anomalously north meaning less vapor will be transferred to north china these all lead to the decline of precipitation in north china hao and lu 2006 our results are consistent with these mechanisms 5 2 the link between the rainfall runoff relationship and land use cover as shown in fig 8 there is a similar rainfall runoff relationship between 1956 and 1979 and 1980 2000 but there is a dramatic change in 2001 2016 this is consistent with the change of land use cover in the myrb mainly caused by human activities including sediment check dams terraces returning farmland to forest grazing bans and other soil and water conservation measures even though the sediment check dams and terraces were built in the 1960s the coverage rate of forest and grassland only increased by 3 9 in 1978 1998 because of the long term decrease of precipitation liu et al 2016 since 1999 the policy of returning farmland to forest and grazing bans has been fully implemented on the loess plateau forests can store more water than farmland and decreasing streamflow and increasing evapotranspiration schilling et al 2008 meanwhile the precipitation begins to increase after 1998 the coverage rate of forest and grassland increased by 20 30 in 1998 2014 this can also be investigated by the change of ndvi which increased from 0 51 in 2000 to 0 63 in 2015 fig 4 d the better the vegetation grows the more water is trapped and absorbed by the plants and eventually consumed by evapotranspiration resulting in less streamflow zhang et al 2008 2014 therefore with the same precipitation less streamflow is generated in 2001 2016 compared to 1956 1979 the parameter w also indicates the multi year rainfall runoff relationship the change of parameter w has similar temporal characteristics with the land cover change i e it is similar from 1956 to 1979 and 1980 to 2000 but the change is relatively large from 2001 to 2016 fig 13 there is a positive relationship between the parameter w and ndvi the larger the ndvi the larger the parameter w will be and vice versa this is consistent with the findings by zhang et al 2001 i e the largest value of w is in forest followed by mixed and then pasture 5 3 the combined effect of climate change and land use cover change on water balance climate change and land use cover change have had significant impacts on the water balance in the myrb during the last 60 years the combined effect of climate change and land use cover change cannot be ignored based on the sensitivity analysis as an increase of parameter w there is a decrease of the response of et p to the e0 p increase fig 11 for example as the e0 p increases from 1 5 to 2 5 the et p will increase by 0 111 and 0 061 when the parameter w is 1 9 and 3 7 respectively this is consistent with the results of teutschbein et al 2018 i e there is a strong connection between the extent of forest cover and the sensitivity of hydrology to changing climate at the same time with an increase in e0 p there is a decrease in the response of et p to the parameter w increase for example as the parameter w increases from 1 9 to 3 7 the et p will increase by 0 249 and 0 199 when the e0 p is 1 5 and 2 5 respectively 5 4 comparison with previous studies the decreasing trends of streamflow and precipitation and increasing trend of temperature in the myrb are consistent with previous results yang et al 2004 liang et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 numerous studies have also investigated the impact of climate variability and land use cove change on hydrology in some typical catchments located in the myrb and conclude that the land use cover change by soil conservation is the main reason for streamflow decrease in the myrb over the last several decades li et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 2014 the consistent results have also been investigated in this study as with previous studies the whole period 1956 2016 is divided into two sub periods by the breakpoint of the streamflow compared to the baseline period 1956 1979 the streamflow decreased by 12 3 mm in 1980 2016 in which 5 7 mm 81 5 75 8 and 6 6 mm 75 8 69 2 were caused by climate variability and land use cover change respectively table 2 therefore climate variability and land use cover change accounts for 46 3 5 7 12 3 and 53 7 6 6 12 3 of the streamflow decrease in the myrb respectively the attribution of streamflow change is sensitive to the breakpoint of annual streamflow bao et al 2012b based on the mann kendall test the lines uf and ub are close together during 1972 1988 fig 14 a to investigate the temporal variability of the contribution of climate variability and land use cover change the sensitivity of attribution of streamflow change to the break of the time series has been analyzed fig 14b from 1972 to 1988 the contribution of climate variability and land use cover change for streamflow decrease was sensitive to the breakpoint for example the highest and lowest values of the contribution of climate variability are 67 7 and 38 2 respectively therefore it is essential to analyze this in more detail based on the variability of hydro climatic variables and land cover use change the long term period has been divided into three sub periods of this paper compared to 1956 1979 climate variability was the main factor accounting for 75 8 for streamflow decrease in 1980 2000 while land use cover change was the main factor 75 5 for streamflow decrease in 2001 2016 this is different to the previous studies which divide the long term period into two sub periods by the breakpoint of streamflow using 1956 1979 as the baseline period the precipitation change in 1980 2000 is larger than that in 2001 2016 but the streamflow change is smaller this is because of the change of evapotranspiration which accounts for more than 80 of precipitation in the myrb compared to the baseline period 1956 1979 2 4 mm of streamflow shifted to evapotranspiration in 1980 2000 due to the change of land use cover in 2001 2016 11 7 mm of streamflow was stored in the soil and evaporated the detailed analysis of the temporal variability of the attribution of hydrological regimes change is useful to understand what has happened in the basin and why therefore during the whole period land use cover change is the main reason for water balance change in the myrb especially after 2000 6 conclusions located in semi humid and semi arid regions the myrb has a severe water shortage problem based on the hydro climatic data and land use cover data the changes of precipitation temperature land use cover and water balance have been investigated during the last 60 years using the mann kendall s test methodology based on the parameter w regionalization the response of water balance to climate change and land use cover change and the attribution for streamflow decrease have been analyzed in the 10 sub regions of the myrb the findings are listed as follows 1 during the last 60 years 1956 2016 the myrb has become much warmer and drier with a statistically significant increasing trend of annual mean temperature at α 0 01 level but the significant level of precipitation decrease is uncertain 2 compared with 1980 the land use change in 2000 is small but significant in 2015 with a decrease in farmland and an increase in forest i e an increase of ndvi 3 there are decreasing trends for streamflow and water resources in the myrb the water balance of the myrb has changed from 1956 to 2016 with less precipitation generating to streamflow and more water being stored in the soil and then evaporating especially after 2000 4 based on the analysis of the relationship between the parameter w of the fu s formula and climatic and land use cover characteristics the parameter w is regionalized using a multi regression equation and the result denotes good performance 5 with an increase of e0 p or w there is an increase of et p and a decrease of r p but the increasing rate of et p decreases with an increase of e0 p or w 6 compared with 1956 1979 climate variability and land use cover change accounts for 75 8 and 24 2 of the streamflow decrease in 1980 2000 of the myrb however climate variability and land use cover change account for 24 5 and 75 5 of the streamflow decrease in 2001 2016 respectively therefore climate variability is the main factor for streamflow decrease in 1980 2000 while land use cover change is the main factor for streamflow decrease in 2001 2016 the results are useful for understanding what has happened and what will happen under climate change and land use cover changes for adaptive future water resources management declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this research is funded by
