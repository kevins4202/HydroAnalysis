corresponding author aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor agmbr has emerged with strong potential to overcome membrane fouling there have been no extensive studies on extracellular polymeric substances eps in agmbr the present work aimed at conducting an in depth study of eps and monitoring fouling development in agmbr using a 22 factorial design having hydraulic retention time hrt and total organic carbon toc as independent variables hrt was tested at three levels of 6 8 and 10 h while the toc levels were 104 13 189 17 and 266 27 mg l agmbr exhibited high proteins pn in the tightly bound eps tb eps resulting in high proteins polysaccharides pn ps ratios of 2 16 the pn in the lb eps was low ranging from 0 01 to 1 92 mg g mlvss but the range of pn ps ratio was also of 2 16 despite the high pn ps ratio tmp rise was low water jet easily sloughed off the developed membrane cake layer the elimination of chemicals for membrane cleaning has significant cost savings toc had a

granular sludge ags and membrane filtration for wastewater treatment and reclamation agmbr aims at overcoming the membrane fouling challenge in conventional membrane bioreactors mbrs and enhancing the simultaneous removal of organics and nutrients from wastewater iorhemen et al 2017 liébana et al 2018 bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances eps have been identified as major contributors to membrane fouling lin et al 2014 campo et al 2017 silva et al 2017 the agmbr technology offers a distinct advantage of utilising eps for granule formation and subsequent eps produced after granulation is mostly held within the granular sludge matrix ags is essentially made of bacteria that have been made to agglomerate together under special conditions in the absence of any biocarriers i e microbe to microbe self immobilisation with no medium liu and tay 2004 adav et al 2008 in the aerobic granulation process the flocculent sludge is subjected to high hydrodynamic shear alongside other favourable conditions to self agglomerate into dense microbial consortia packed with different microbial species tay et al 2009 in agmbr ags treats the wastewater pollutants and membrane filtration is employed to separate the treated effluents from the biomass agmbr is suitable for the treatment and reclamation of both municipal and industrial wastewaters as it can produce high quality reclaimed water in a small footprint the large size and rigid structure of the ags expectedly reduces pore blocking and cake layer formation in agmbr iorhemen et al 2016 research on agmbr has been conducted in both typical ags columnar reactor types and conventional mbr reactors iorhemen et al 2017 a study found that membrane permeability in agmbr system was over 50 higher when compared to conventional mbr li et al 2005 tay et al 2007 found that although agmbr and submerged mbr showed similar treatment efficiencies agmbr exhibited much better filtration with membrane permeability loss being only half that of the conventional mbr similarly in a long term study 10 months tu et al 2010 reported higher removal efficiency of pollutants as well as improved membrane performance fouling rate was maintained below 0 1 kpa day at biomass concentration 18 000 mg l agmbr was also found to exhibit stable operation at 20 l m2 h for 61 days with significant filtration improvement wang et al 2013 other studies reported an extension of filtration period by 78 days without physical cleaning thanh et al 2013 and eight fold lower membrane fouling in agmbr compared to mbr in a pilot scale agmbr using municipal wastewater for 220 days sajjad et al 2016 a recent study also found that the rate of fouling in agmbr was 0 490 kpa day which was 50 that of conventional mbr hence reduction in fouling rate and cake resistance truong et al 2018 despite these remarkable results on agmbr there has been no extensive study on eps reported in the literature the present work therefore focused on the study of eps in a submerged agmbr treating municipal wastewater the experiment followed a 22 factorial design with hydraulic retention time hrt and organics concentration as independent variables the organics concentrations were chosen to cover the typical range in municipal wastewater 104 13 300 189 17 550 and 266 27 800 mg l of total organic carbon equivalent chemical oxygen demand the hrt was tested at three levels of 6 8 and 10 h eps was extracted and analysed every 5 10 days within each experimental run the frequency of extraction was to allow for the monitoring of variations in the amount of eps during each run which contrasts with other studies where eps is not consistently extracted the extracted eps was analysed to monitor its distribution in the mixed liquor and the granule matrix at the various organics levels and during each hrt statistical significance of the effect of toc and hrt on the proteins pn and polysaccharides ps components of tightly bound eps tb eps was also investigated findings from this study will expand the knowledge base of agmbr as its development as a compact and efficient wastewater treatment technology progresses 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up a plexiglas cylindrical columnar reactor of inner diameter 30 cm was used for the experiments the reactor was operated at working volumes of 19 8 26 4 and 33 l depending on the hrt air was supplied at the bottom of the reactor by means of stone diffusers as 3 pentair at a superficial upflow air velocity of 1 23 cm s the membrane module contained a flat sheet membrane made of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and had a pore size of 0 15 μm and membrane effective surface area of 0 2640 m2 the membrane module was operated at a constant flux of 12 5 l m2 h with an intermittent suction of 8 min permeation and 2 min relaxation by means of a peristaltic pump the set up was operated without backwashing the reactor was operated at room temperature 20 2 c with influent ph in the range 6 00 7 56 the schematic of the agmbr system is shown in fig 1 the experimental design followed a 22 factorial design with a centre point in the 22 factorial design the hrt and toc were the independent variables the design is illustrated in supplementary material fig si 1 the sequence of the experiment and a summary of the conditions at each run are presented in table 1 2 2 seed sludge and media mature seed granules were obtained from a separate sequencing batch reactor sbr and used to start up the agmbr system the mean size of the granules was 517 28 μm the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration in the reactor was maintained at a mean value of 7941 1702 mg l the corresponding mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentration was 6582 1497 mg l the solids retention time srt was controlled at 25 d the feed solution was prepared using sodium propionate and sodium acetate carbon sources ammonium chloride kh2po4 k2hpo4 cacl2 2h2o mgso4 7h2o and feso4 7h2o micronutrients were prepared from cucl2 h3bo3 alcl3 zncl2 nicl2 mnso4 h2o nh4 6 mo7o24 4h2o and cocl2 6h2o as detailed elsewhere tay et al 2002 the cod n p ratio was fixed at 100 5 1 2 3 analytical methods the tmp development of the agmbr system was monitored as an indication of membrane fouling this was done through a pressure gauge vacuum gauge installed on the permeate line the mlss and mlvss were determined according to standard methods apha awwa wef 2012 the toc was analysed using shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer toc l the total nitrogen tn was analysed using shimadzu total nitrogen measuring unit tnm l ammonia nitrogen nh3 n was analysed using the salicylate method tnt plus 830 ultra low range 831 low range and 832 high range nitrite and nitrate were analysed using metrohm compact ic flex the average particle size was determined by a laser particle size analysis system malvern mastersizer series 2000 2 4 extraction and analysis of extracellular polymeric substances eps the extraction of eps was done according to the protocol described by liang et al 2010 with little modification approximately 10 ml of the reactor mixed liquor was taken from the system and centrifuged at 4 c and 2000g for 15 min liang et al 2010 the supernatant liquor was collected and filtered through 0 22 μm polyethersulfone pes sterile filter to obtain the soluble eps seps the bottom sediments were re suspended to 10 ml volume using reverse osmosis ro water then 60 μl of 37 formamide was added into the suspension the choice of formamide was to enhance the extraction efficiency of tb eps as well as reduce contamination resulting from intracellular substances adav and lee 2008 the suspension was then put in an orbital incubator 20 30 rpm at 4 c for 1 h after 1 h elapsed the suspension was centrifuged at 4 c and 5 000 g for 15 min and the supernatant was collected and filtered through 0 22 μm pes sterile filter to obtain the loosely bound eps lb eps the collected sediments were re suspended once more to 10 ml using an extraction buffer 2 mm na2hpo4 12h2o 4 mm nah2po4 h2o 1 mm kcl 9 mm nacl ph 7 the ph of the suspension was then adjusted to about 11 using 1 m naoh the suspension was put in an orbital incubator 20 30 rpm at 4 c for 3 h after extraction the suspension was centrifuged at 4 c and 10 000 g for 15 min the supernatant was collected and filtered through 0 22 μm pes sterile filter as tb eps the extracted seps lb eps and tb eps were analysed for pn and ps since they are the major components of eps sheng et al 2010 iorhemen et al 2016 the pn content was determined using peterson s modification of the lowry method peterson 1977 the ps content was determined using the phenol sulphuric acid method dubois et al 1956 with glucose as the standard the eps was extracted in the interval of 5 10 d during each experimental run 2 5 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy the 3d eem spectra were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer in eem spectra a series of emission spectra are collected over a range of excitation wavelengths which are then used to identify the fluorescent compounds present in complex mixtures wang et al 2009 the sample was scanned over excitation wavelengths from 200 to 600 nm with 5 nm steps and emission wavelengths from 220 to 600 nm with 5 nm steps the rest of the procedure is as detailed elsewhere liu et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 transmembrane pressure and membrane fouling development the agmbr system exhibited gentle transmembrane pressure tmp rise fouling development as shown in fig 2 the tmp threshold for taking the membrane out for cleaning was set at 50 kpa the tmp rose to 50 kpa during run 1 189 17 mg l toc and 8 h hrt and run 3 104 13 mg l toc and 10 h hrt only in run 1 the tmp rise was gentle in the first two weeks but rose sharply in the third week to reach 50 kpa on day 18 the pn concentration of seps at this stage of the run was 9 75 mg l the membrane was cleaned and put back into operation the rise in tmp was then gentle for the remaining duration of the run similarly the tmp increased sharply in the first one week and reached 30 kpa on day 98 during run 3 however it started declining on day 102 down to 22 kpa on day 107 this can be attributed to the loose fouling cake layer on the membrane where the abrasion provided by ags alongside the shear from aeration allowed for the sloughing of the cake layer the rise in tmp to 28 kpa and 46 kpa on days 111 and 121 respectively is linked to the high pn in seps fig 3 b correspondingly the pn content of tb eps was relatively low on days 111 and 121 fig 3b run 2 266 27 mg l toc and 10 h hrt run 4 104 13 mg l toc and 6 h hrt and run 5 266 27 mg l toc and 6 h hrt went for the entire duration of 45 d without the need for cleaning i e tmp was below 50 kpa run 2 showed a gentle rise of tmp from 2 kpa on day 46 to 8 kpa on day 61 the tmp then stayed constant at 8 kpa until the end of the run similarly run 4 exhibited a very mild rise of tmp from 1 kpa on day 136 to 2 kpa on day 162 the tmp then rose gently from 4 kpa on day 163 to 10 kpa on day 171 then increased sharply from 12 kpa day 172 to 42 kpa at the end of the run run 5 also exhibited a gradual tmp rise attaining a maximum value of 6 kpa across the three runs runs 2 4 and 5 there was low pn concentration in seps negligible pn concentration in lb eps and high pn concentration in tb eps as shown in fig 3b this indicates that most of the eps was tightly held in the granule matrix allowing for smooth filtration the membrane fouling development result obtained in this study is consistent with findings in the literature where it has been variously reported that the tmp of the membrane increases more slowly in agmbr compared to conventional mbr iorhemen et al 2017 truong et al 2018 to further support this previous studies have shown that ags stays suspended and does not settle on the surface of the membrane in the reactor compared to flocculent sludge which settles easily on the membrane thereby increasing the sludge cake layer density tay et al 2007 wang et al 2012 the superficial upflow air velocity of 1 23 cm s in the reactor in this study enabled the granules to be fully fluidised the large size and rigid structure of ags may have produced shear on the membrane in agmbr thus the membrane fouling mitigation observed in this study is also attributable to the hydrodynamic shear produced by the fluidised ags on the membrane surface for membrane cleaning when the tmp exceeded the threshold value of 50 kpa and at the end of each run the membranes were taken out and cleaned using a water jet cleaning the membrane with water completely detached the cake layer without the need for the use of chemicals this can have serious practical implications due to the cost savings arising from non use of chemicals an image of the fouling cake layer on the membrane is shown in fig si 2 of the supplementary information 3 2 eps the distribution of eps in the submerged agmbr system is shown in fig 3 a c the eps was extracted and analysed in the interval of 5 10 d during each experimental run the frequency of extraction was to allow for the monitoring of variations in the course of time during the run as was expected most of the eps was tightly bound to the sludge as can be seen in fig 3 a and b the ps content of seps was very low mostly below 20 mg l and showing a high value of about 120 mg l during run 5 266 27 mg l toc and 6 h hrt a similar trend was observed for pn content of seps where low values below 10 mg l were obtained with a peak of 25 mg l during run 3 104 13 mg l toc and 10 h hrt this corresponds to the period when tmp rise was above 40 kpa as can be seen in fig 2 indicating that high pn in solution correlated well with membrane fouling statistical analyses show a pearson correlation coefficient r of 0 581 as shown in table si 1 of the supplementary material as this value is greater than 0 it implies a positive correlation between seps pn and membrane fouling this agrees with a previous comparative study which found that the concentration of seps in agmbr was threefold lower than that of the mbr and this led to reduced membrane fouling in agmbr in contrast to conventional mbr truong et al 2018 for conventional mbr the values of lb eps and tb eps reported in the literature are summarised in table 2 below in the present study lb eps values were negligible for both ps and pn throughout the experimental duration the ps concentration of lb eps had values below 1 mg g mlvss except for days 206 and 213 during run 5 where 2 5 mg g mlvss were obtained pn exhibited the same trend where values below 2 mg g mlvss were obtained throughout the experiment it has been reported that lb eps has significant stronger correlation with membrane fouling than tb eps wang et al 2009 liu et al 2012 thus low lb eps is an important indication of reduced fouling as can be seen in table 2 the lb eps both ps and pn values in the present study are lower than conventional mbr since lb eps has strong correlation with membrane fouling it is inferred from this study that the extremely low lb eps values obtained for both ps and pn are the reason why membrane fouling rate fouling was low this also links to the ags in the system which held most of the eps as tb eps the concentration of tb eps showed the highest values for both ps and pn run 2 266 27 mg l toc and 10 h hrt and run 5 266 27 mg l toc and 6 h hrt exhibited the highest ps values for tb eps average of 25 49 mg g mlvss and 26 29 mg g mlvss respectively for pn in tb eps run 1 189 17 mg l toc and 8 h hrt run 2 266 27 mg l toc and 10 h hrt and run 5 266 27 mg l toc and 6 h hrt showed the highest values of 119 03 mg g mlvss 171 67 mg g mlvss and 143 86 mg g mlvss respectively runs 2 and 5 which exhibited high tb eps values for both ps and pn showed the lowest rate of tmp rise shown in fig 2 in each of these two runs tmp was below 10 kpa throughout the duration this agrees with the initial hypothesis that ags will trap the eps in its matrix and allow for a reduction in the rate of fouling a previous study demonstrated that tb eps have no obvious relationship to membrane fouling rate wang et al 2009 hence these high tb eps values obtained in this study did not increase fouling rate the pn ps ratio for seps lb eps and tb eps showed irregular results fig 3c while the pn ps ratio for seps was below 2 those of lb eps and tb eps were in the range 0 16 high pn ps ratios for ags have been reported in the literature mcswain et al 2005 adav and lee 2008 it was indicated that pn and dead cells are mainly located at the granule core while cells and α polysaccharides are distributed around the outer layer of granules chen et al 2007 generally a higher pn content in the mixed liquor solution would promote cake layer formation on the membrane due to pn s higher stickiness while it has been indicated that lower pn ps ratio of the eps results in lower fouling propensity tian et al 2012 the agmbr system in this study exhibited low fouling propensity despite having high pn ps ratio this is made possible by the ags in the system statistical analysis conducted using ibm spss statistics version 25 as presented in table si 2 and si 3 of the supplementary material showed that there was a significant main effect of toc on the pn content of the tb eps f 1 17 48 801 p 0 000 at α 0 05 however the hrt did not show a significant effect on the pn content of tb eps at α 0 05 as well there was no interaction between toc and hrt on the pn content of the tb eps similarly the toc concentration showed a significant main effect on the ps content of tb eps content f 1 17 23 391 p 0 000 while hrt did not have a significant effect on the ps content of tb eps the intercept appears to be statistically significant α 0 05 in both cases this implies that regardless of the organics toc concentration the tb eps pn or ps originated from biomass degradation biomass associated products bap while the toc represent the utilisation associated products uap related to pn or ps since the hrt was not statistically significant at α 0 05 for both tb eps pn and tb eps ps it was not considered a significant variable curve estimation was performed for the relationship between tb eps pn or ps and toc as shown in table si 4 si 9 of the supplementary material a quadratic curve best fit the relationship in both cases as shown in fig 4 a and b the model for tb eps pn has r square and adjusted r square values of 0 758 and 0 733 respectively for tb eps ps the r square is 0 64 while the adjusted r square is 0 603 comparing the eps analysis data and membrane fouling tmp profile a trend can be established the increase in toc corresponds with increase in tb eps pn as shown in fig 5 a for hrt an increase from 6 h to 10 h at 104 13 mg l of toc results in a decrease of tb eps pn at toc concentration of 266 27 mg l the change of hrt from 10 h to 6 h did not affect the tb eps pn concentration to relate hrt and membrane fouling there is a general trend at both 104 13 and 266 27 mg l of toc the tmp increases with an increase in hrt this trend is similar to the relationship of seps pn with membrane fouling tmp profile where the increase in seps pn corresponds with increase in membrane fouling at both 104 13 and 266 27 mg l of toc across all the runs seps pn correlated with membrane fouling pearson correlation coefficient r 0 581 3 3 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem of eps the 3d eem spectra of the tb eps in the agmbr are shown in fig 6 below runs 1 2 3 and 4 showed one main peak from the 3d eem fluorescence spectra while run 5 exhibited one main peak and a small peak the peak for run 1 was identified at the excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 310 370 nm this was similar for runs 2 3 and 4 whose peaks were observed at the ex em wavelengths of 310 380 nm 290 370 nm and 290 360 nm respectively for run 5 the main peak was identified at the ex em wavelengths of 340 450 nm while the second peak was observed at the ex em wavelengths of 310 390 nm a summary of the 3d eem peaks of tb eps are presented in table 3 the peaks for runs 1 to 4 lie in the region typically identified as aromatic protein like substances this is same for the second peak of run 5 wang et al 2011 the main peak of run 5 lies in the region of humic acid like substance domínguez et al 2010 this demonstrates that protein like substances were the most abundant in the tb eps with humic acid like substance appearing in run 5 this is consistent with the results of eps analysis shown in section 3 2 above where the amount of pn in the system was high which resulted in high pn ps ratios the 3d eem showed a compositional change of eps during run 5 as shown in fig 6 since the same conditions of operation as previous runs were maintained in the reactor during this run the difference can be attributed to ageing granules as run 5 was the last run of the experiments 3 4 reactor performance 3 4 1 organics removal as shown in fig 7 the agmbr system exhibited stable organics removal indicated by toc throughout the duration of the experiment the toc removal efficiency was 98 1 for the entire experimental period the high organics degradation efficiency attained in the present study agrees with previous findings where organics removal was greater than 96 for both municipal and industrial wastewaters tay et al 2007 tu et al 2010 thanh et al 2013 generally aerobic granulation has been proven to efficiently remove organics adav et al 2008 as the granulation process allows for the concentration of biomass the high mlss concentration of 7941 1702 mg l mlvss 6582 1497 mg l maintained in this study contributed to the high degradation of organics 3 4 2 nitrogen removal the agmbr system achieved nh3 n removal efficiency above 97 with effluent nh3 n concentration consistently below 0 9 mg l for all the runs as shown in fig 8 a the high nh3 n removal efficiency obtained in this study agrees with previous nh3 n treatment performance reported in the literature for agmbr including 85 4 99 7 wang et al 2008 93 1 98 6 tu et al 2010 95 7 li et al 2012 and 99 9 thanh et al 2013 nitrite concentrations were negligible in the effluent as shown in fig 8 b mostly below 1 mg l except for a few days across the runs the low nitrite values in the effluent point to total nitrification occurring in the reactor hence the high removal levels attained for nh3 n for total nitrogen tn a wide range of removal efficiencies was observed as can be seen in fig 8 c it is widely reported that ags has a stratified structure that allows for the existence of aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions within the same granule yilmaz et al 2008 nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 however it appears the continuous operation in this study limited the tn removal capability of the granules the layered structure of ags acted to provide anoxic conditions for denitrification since tn removal in excess of 98 was achieved on some days but there appears to be a limitation as tn removal levels dropped to 1 5 during some periods of the experiment nitrification and denitrification occurred during days 97 108 and 130 in run 3 days 155 180 during run 4 and days 183 and 197 in run 5 which is supported by 84 99 and 94 tn removal respectively on the other hand denitrification did not occur during the remaining period of the study as high amount of nitrates were detected in the effluent as shown in fig 8d the period of high effluent nitrates corresponded with very low tn removal 4 conclusion in this study the ags in submerged agmbr exhibited high pn in the tb eps which resulted in very high pn ps ratios 3d eem also confirmed that pn were the most significant component in the tb eps low seps resulted in acceptable tmp rise where the system ran for 45 days without any form of cleaning during three runs 266 27 mg l toc and 10 h hrt 104 13 mg l toc and 6 h hr 266 27 mg l toc and 6 h hrt the cake layer that developed on the membrane was easy to remove with gentle sloughing using water jet which provides significant cost savings by the elimination of chemicals for membrane cleaning statistical analysis showed that toc concentration had a significant main effect on both pn and ps components of tb eps at α 0 05 the hrt showed no significant effect on either pn or ps components of tb eps ps at α 0 05 tb eps pn increased with increasing toc tb eps pn decreased with increase in hrt from 6 h to 10 h at 104 13 mg l toc but the decrease of hrt from 10 h to 6 h at 266 27 mg l toc did not affect tb eps pn the tmp increased with an increase in hrt at 104 13 and 266 27 mg l toc similarly an increase in seps pn correlated with increase in membrane fouling r 0 581 in terms of performance the system achieved 98 1 99 1 52 33 organics degradation nh3 n removal total nitrogen removal respectively in all the runs declaration of interests none acknowledgement this work was

maintained below 0 1 kpa day at biomass concentration 18 000 mg l agmbr was also found to exhibit stable operation at 20 l m2 h for 61 days with significant filtration improvement wang et al 2013 other studies reported an extension of filtration period by 78 days without physical cleaning thanh et al 2013 and eight fold lower membrane fouling in agmbr compared to mbr in a pilot scale agmbr using municipal wastewater for 220 days sajjad et al 2016 a recent study also found that the rate of fouling in agmbr was 0 490 kpa day which was 50 that of conventional mbr hence reduction in fouling rate and cake resistance truong et al 2018 despite these remarkable results on agmbr there has been no extensive study on eps reported in the literature the present work therefore focused on the study of eps in a submerged agmbr treating municipal wastewater the experiment followed a 22 factorial design with hydraulic retention time hrt and organics concentration as independent variables the organics concentrations were chosen to cover the typical range in municipal wastewater 104 13 300 189 17 550 and 266 27 800 mg l of total organic carbon equivalent chemical oxygen demand the hrt was tested at three levels of 6 8 and 10 h eps was extracted and analysed every 5 10 days within each experimental run the frequency of extraction was to allow for the monitoring of variations in the amount of eps during each run which contrasts with other studies where eps is not consistently extracted the extracted eps was analysed to monitor its distribution in the mixed liquor and the granule matrix at the various organics levels and during each hrt statistical significance of the effect of toc and hrt on the proteins pn and polysaccharides ps components of tightly bound eps tb eps was also investigated findings from this study will expand the knowledge base of agmbr as its development as a compact and efficient wastewater treatment technology progresses 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up a plexiglas cylindrical columnar reactor of inner diameter 30 cm was used for the experiments the reactor was operated at working volumes of 19 8 26 4 and 33 l depending on the hrt air was supplied at the bottom of the reactor by means of stone diffusers as 3 pentair at a superficial upflow air velocity of 1 23 cm s the membrane module contained a flat sheet membrane made of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and had a pore size of 0 15 μm and membrane effective surface area of 0 2640 m2 the membrane module was operated at a constant flux of 12 5 l m2 h with an intermittent suction of 8 min permeation and 2 min relaxation by means of a peristaltic pump the set up was operated without backwashing the reactor was operated at room temperature 20 2 c with influent ph in the range 6 00 7 56 the schematic of the agmbr system is shown in fig 1 the experimental design followed a 22 factorial design with a centre point in the 22 factorial design the hrt and toc were the independent variables the design is illustrated in supplementary material fig si 1 the sequence of the experiment and a summary of the conditions at each run are presented in table 1 2 2 seed sludge and media mature seed granules were obtained from a separate sequencing batch reactor sbr and used to start up the agmbr system the mean size of the granules was 517 28 μm the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration in the reactor was maintained at a mean value of 7941 1702 mg l the corresponding mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentration was 6582 1497 mg l the solids retention time srt was controlled at 25 d the feed solution was prepared using sodium propionate and sodium acetate carbon sources ammonium chloride kh2po4 k2hpo4 cacl2 2h2o mgso4 7h2o and feso4 7h2o micronutrients were prepared from cucl2 h3bo3 alcl3 zncl2 nicl2 mnso4 h2o nh4 6 mo7o24 4h2o and cocl2 6h2o as detailed elsewhere tay et al 2002 the cod n p ratio was fixed at 100 5 1 2 3 analytical methods the tmp development of the agmbr system was monitored as an indication of membrane fouling this was done through a pressure gauge vacuum gauge installed on the permeate line the mlss and mlvss were determined according to standard methods apha awwa wef 2012 the toc was analysed using shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer toc l the total nitrogen tn was analysed using shimadzu total nitrogen measuring unit tnm l ammonia nitrogen nh3 n was analysed using the salicylate method tnt plus 830 ultra low range 831 low range and 832 high range nitrite and nitrate were analysed using metrohm compact ic flex the average particle size was determined by a laser particle size analysis system malvern mastersizer series 2000 2 4 extraction and analysis of extracellular polymeric substances eps the extraction of eps was done according to the protocol described by liang et al 2010 with little modification approximately 10 ml of the reactor mixed liquor was taken from the system and centrifuged at 4 c and 2000g for 15 min liang et al 2010 the supernatant liquor was collected and filtered through 0 22 μm polyethersulfone pes sterile filter to obtain the soluble eps seps the bottom sediments were re suspended to 10 ml volume using reverse osmosis ro water then 60 μl of 37 formamide was added into the suspension the choice of formamide was to enhance the extraction efficiency of tb eps as well as reduce contamination resulting from intracellular substances adav and lee 2008 the suspension was then put in an orbital incubator 20 30 rpm at 4 c for 1 h after 1 h elapsed the suspension was centrifuged at 4 c and 5 000 g for 15 min and the supernatant was collected and filtered through 0 22 μm pes sterile filter to obtain the loosely bound eps lb eps the collected sediments were re suspended once more to 10 ml using an extraction buffer 2 mm na2hpo4 12h2o 4 mm nah2po4 h2o 1 mm kcl 9 mm nacl ph 7 the ph of the suspension was then adjusted to about 11 using 1 m naoh the suspension was put in an orbital incubator 20 30 rpm at 4 c for 3 h after extraction the suspension was centrifuged at 4 c and 10 000 g for 15 min the supernatant was collected and filtered through 0 22 μm pes sterile filter as tb eps the extracted seps lb eps and tb eps were analysed for pn and ps since they are the major components of eps sheng et al 2010 iorhemen et al 2016 the pn content was determined using peterson s modification of the lowry method peterson 1977 the ps content was determined using the phenol sulphuric acid method dubois et al 1956 with glucose as the standard the eps was extracted in the interval of 5 10 d during each experimental run 2 5 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy the 3d eem spectra were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer in eem spectra a series of emission spectra are collected over a range of excitation wavelengths which are then used to identify the fluorescent compounds present in complex mixtures wang et al 2009 the sample was scanned over excitation wavelengths from 200 to 600 nm with 5 nm steps and emission wavelengths from 220 to 600 nm with 5 nm steps the rest of the procedure is as detailed elsewhere liu et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 transmembrane pressure and membrane fouling development the agmbr system exhibited gentle transmembrane pressure tmp rise fouling development as shown in fig 2 the tmp threshold for taking the membrane out for cleaning was set at 50 kpa the tmp rose to 50 kpa during run 1 189 17 mg l toc and 8 h hrt and run 3 104 13 mg l toc and 10 h hrt only in run 1 the tmp rise was gentle in the first two weeks but rose sharply in the third week to reach 50 kpa on day 18 the pn concentration of seps at this stage of the run was 9 75 mg l the membrane was cleaned and put back into operation the rise in tmp was then gentle for the remaining duration of the run similarly the tmp increased sharply in the first one week and reached 30 kpa on day 98 during run 3 however it started declining on day 102 down to 22 kpa on day 107 this can be attributed to the loose fouling cake layer on the membrane where the abrasion provided by ags alongside the shear from aeration allowed for the sloughing of the cake layer the rise in tmp to 28 kpa and 46 kpa on days 111 and 121 respectively is linked to the high pn in seps fig 3 b correspondingly the pn content of tb eps was relatively low on days 111 and 121 fig 3b run 2 266 27 mg l toc and 10 h hrt run 4 104 13 mg l toc and 6 h hrt and run 5 266 27 mg l toc and 6 h hrt went for the entire duration of 45 d without the need for cleaning i e tmp was below 50 kpa run 2 showed a gentle rise of tmp from 2 kpa on day 46 to 8 kpa on day 61 the tmp then stayed constant at 8 kpa until the end of the run similarly run 4 exhibited a very mild rise of tmp from 1 kpa on day 136 to 2 kpa on day 162 the tmp then rose gently from 4 kpa on day 163 to 10 kpa on day 171 then increased sharply from 12 kpa day 172 to 42 kpa at the end of the run run 5 also exhibited a gradual tmp rise attaining a maximum value of 6 kpa across the three runs runs 2 4 and 5 there was low pn concentration in seps negligible pn concentration in lb eps and high pn concentration in tb eps as shown in fig 3b this indicates that most of the eps was tightly held in the granule matrix allowing for smooth filtration the membrane fouling development result obtained in this study is consistent with findings in the literature where it has been variously reported that the tmp of the membrane increases more slowly in agmbr compared to conventional mbr iorhemen et al 2017 truong et al 2018 to further support this previous studies have shown that ags stays suspended and does not settle on the surface of the membrane in the reactor compared to flocculent sludge which settles easily on the membrane thereby increasing the sludge cake layer density tay et al 2007 wang et al 2012 the superficial upflow air velocity of 1 23 cm s in the reactor in this study enabled the granules to be fully fluidised the large size and rigid structure of ags may have produced shear on the membrane in agmbr thus the membrane fouling mitigation observed in this study is also attributable to the hydrodynamic shear produced by the fluidised ags on the membrane surface for membrane cleaning when the tmp exceeded the threshold value of 50 kpa and at the end of each run the membranes were taken out and cleaned using a water jet cleaning the membrane with water completely detached the cake layer without the need for the use of chemicals this can have serious practical implications due to the cost savings arising from non use of chemicals an image of the fouling cake layer on the membrane is shown in fig si 2 of the supplementary information 3 2 eps the distribution of eps in the submerged agmbr system is shown in fig 3 a c the eps was extracted and analysed in the interval of 5 10 d during each experimental run the frequency of extraction was to allow for the monitoring of variations in the course of time during the run as was expected most of the eps was tightly bound to the sludge as can be seen in fig 3 a and b the ps content of seps was very low mostly below 20 mg l and showing a high value of about 120 mg l during run 5 266 27 mg l toc and 6 h hrt a similar trend was observed for pn content of seps where low values below 10 mg l were obtained with a peak of 25 mg l during run 3 104 13 mg l toc and 10 h hrt this corresponds to the period when tmp rise was above 40 kpa as can be seen in fig 2 indicating that high pn in solution correlated well with membrane fouling statistical analyses show a pearson correlation coefficient r of 0 581 as shown in table si 1 of the supplementary material as this value is greater than 0 it implies a positive correlation between seps pn and membrane fouling this agrees with a previous comparative study which found that the concentration of seps in agmbr was threefold lower than that of the mbr and this led to reduced membrane fouling in agmbr in contrast to conventional mbr truong et al 2018 for conventional mbr the values of lb eps and tb eps reported in the literature are summarised in table 2 below in the present study lb eps values were negligible for both ps and pn throughout the experimental duration the ps concentration of lb eps had values below 1 mg g mlvss except for days 206 and 213 during run 5 where 2 5 mg g mlvss were obtained pn exhibited the same trend where values below 2 mg g mlvss were obtained throughout the experiment it has been reported that lb eps has significant stronger correlation with membrane fouling than tb eps wang et al 2009 liu et al 2012 thus low lb eps is an important indication of reduced fouling as can be seen in table 2 the lb eps both ps and pn values in the present study are lower than conventional mbr since lb eps has strong correlation with membrane fouling it is inferred from this study that the extremely low lb eps values obtained for both ps and pn are the reason why membrane fouling rate fouling was low this also links to the ags in the system which held most of the eps as tb eps the concentration of tb eps showed the highest values for both ps and pn run 2 266 27 mg l toc and 10 h hrt and run 5 266 27 mg l toc and 6 h hrt exhibited the highest ps values for tb eps average of 25 49 mg g mlvss and 26 29 mg g mlvss respectively for pn in tb eps run 1 189 17 mg l toc and 8 h hrt run 2 266 27 mg l toc and 10 h hrt and run 5 266 27 mg l toc and 6 h hrt showed the highest values of 119 03 mg g mlvss 171 67 mg g mlvss and 143 86 mg g mlvss respectively runs 2 and 5 which exhibited high tb eps values for both ps and pn showed the lowest rate of tmp rise shown in fig 2 in each of these two runs tmp was below 10 kpa throughout the duration this agrees with the initial hypothesis that ags will trap the eps in its matrix and allow for a reduction in the rate of fouling a previous study demonstrated that tb eps have no obvious relationship to membrane fouling rate wang et al 2009 hence these high tb eps values obtained in this study did not increase fouling rate the pn ps ratio for seps lb eps and tb eps showed irregular results fig 3c while the pn ps ratio for seps was below 2 those of lb eps and tb eps were in the range 0 16 high pn ps ratios for ags have been reported in the literature mcswain et al 2005 adav and lee 2008 it was indicated that pn and dead cells are mainly located at the granule core while cells and α polysaccharides are distributed around the outer layer of granules chen et al 2007 generally a higher pn content in the mixed liquor solution would promote cake layer formation on the membrane due to pn s higher stickiness while it has been indicated that lower pn ps ratio of the eps results in lower fouling propensity tian et al 2012 the agmbr system in this study exhibited low fouling propensity despite having high pn ps ratio this is made possible by the ags in the system statistical analysis conducted using ibm spss statistics version 25 as presented in table si 2 and si 3 of the supplementary material showed that there was a significant main effect of toc on the pn content of the tb eps f 1 17 48 801 p 0 000 at α 0 05 however the hrt did not show a significant effect on the pn content of tb eps at α 0 05 as well there was no interaction between toc and hrt on the pn content of the tb eps similarly the toc concentration showed a significant main effect on the ps content of tb eps content f 1 17 23 391 p 0 000 while hrt did not have a significant effect on the ps content of tb eps the intercept appears to be statistically significant α 0 05 in both cases this implies that regardless of the organics toc concentration the tb eps pn or ps originated from biomass degradation biomass associated products bap while the toc represent the utilisation associated products uap related to pn or ps since the hrt was not statistically significant at α 0 05 for both tb eps pn and tb eps ps it was not considered a significant variable curve estimation was performed for the relationship between tb eps pn or ps and toc as shown in table si 4 si 9 of the supplementary material a quadratic curve best fit the relationship in both cases as shown in fig 4 a and b the model for tb eps pn has r square and adjusted r square values of 0 758 and 0 733 respectively for tb eps ps the r square is 0 64 while the adjusted r square is 0 603 comparing the eps analysis data and membrane fouling tmp profile a trend can be established the increase in toc corresponds with increase in tb eps pn as shown in fig 5 a for hrt an increase from 6 h to 10 h at 104 13 mg l of toc results in a decrease of tb eps pn at toc concentration of 266 27 mg l the change of hrt from 10 h to 6 h did not affect the tb eps pn concentration to relate hrt and membrane fouling there is a general trend at both 104 13 and 266 27 mg l of toc the tmp increases with an increase in hrt this trend is similar to the relationship of seps pn with membrane fouling tmp profile where the increase in seps pn corresponds with increase in membrane fouling at both 104 13 and 266 27 mg l of toc across all the runs seps pn correlated with membrane fouling pearson correlation coefficient r 0 581 3 3 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem of eps the 3d eem spectra of the tb eps in the agmbr are shown in fig 6 below runs 1 2 3 and 4 showed one main peak from the 3d eem fluorescence spectra while run 5 exhibited one main peak and a small peak the peak for run 1 was identified at the excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 310 370 nm this was similar for runs 2 3 and 4 whose peaks were observed at the ex em wavelengths of 310 380 nm 290 370 nm and 290 360 nm respectively for run 5 the main peak was identified at the ex em wavelengths of 340 450 nm while the second peak was observed at the ex em wavelengths of 310 390 nm a summary of the 3d eem peaks of tb eps are presented in table 3 the peaks for runs 1 to 4 lie in the region typically identified as aromatic protein like substances this is same for the second peak of run 5 wang et al 2011 the main peak of run 5 lies in the region of humic acid like substance domínguez et al 2010 this demonstrates that protein like substances were the most abundant in the tb eps with humic acid like substance appearing in run 5 this is consistent with the results of eps analysis shown in section 3 2 above where the amount of pn in the system was high which resulted in high pn ps ratios the 3d eem showed a compositional change of eps during run 5 as shown in fig 6 since the same conditions of operation as previous runs were maintained in the reactor during this run the difference can be attributed to ageing granules as run 5 was the last run of the experiments 3 4 reactor performance 3 4 1 organics removal as shown in fig 7 the agmbr system exhibited stable organics removal indicated by toc throughout the duration of the experiment the toc removal efficiency was 98 1 for the entire experimental period the high organics degradation efficiency attained in the present study agrees with previous findings where organics removal was greater than 96 for both municipal and industrial wastewaters tay et al 2007 tu et al 2010 thanh et al 2013 generally aerobic granulation has been proven to efficiently remove organics adav et al 2008 as the granulation process allows for the concentration of biomass the high mlss concentration of 7941 1702 mg l mlvss 6582 1497 mg l maintained in this study contributed to the high degradation of organics 3 4 2 nitrogen removal the agmbr system achieved nh3 n removal efficiency above 97 with effluent nh3 n concentration consistently below 0 9 mg l for all the runs as shown in fig 8 a the high nh3 n removal efficiency obtained in this study agrees with previous nh3 n treatment performance reported in the literature for agmbr including 85 4 99 7 wang et al 2008 93 1 98 6 tu et al 2010 95 7 li et al 2012 and 99 9 thanh et al 2013 nitrite concentrations were negligible in the effluent as shown in fig 8 b mostly below 1 mg l except for a few days across the runs the low nitrite values in the effluent point to total nitrification occurring in the reactor hence the high removal levels attained for nh3 n for total nitrogen tn a wide range of removal efficiencies was observed as can be seen in fig 8 c it is widely reported that ags has a stratified structure that allows for the existence of aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions within the same granule yilmaz et al 2008 nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 however it appears the continuous operation in this study limited the tn removal capability of the granules the layered structure of ags acted to provide anoxic conditions for denitrification since tn removal in excess of 98 was achieved on some days but there appears to be a limitation as tn removal levels dropped to 1 5 during some periods of the experiment nitrification and denitrification occurred during days 97 108 and 130 in run 3 days 155 180 during run 4 and days 183 and 197 in run 5 which is supported by 84 99 and 94 tn removal respectively on the other hand denitrification did not occur during the remaining period of the study as high amount of nitrates were detected in the effluent as shown in fig 8d the period of high effluent nitrates corresponded with very low tn removal 4 conclusion in this study the ags in submerged agmbr exhibited high pn in the tb eps which resulted in very high pn ps ratios 3d eem also confirmed that pn were the most significant component in the tb eps low seps resulted in acceptable tmp rise where the system ran for 45 days without any form of cleaning during three runs 266 27 mg l toc and 10 h hrt 104 13 mg l toc and 6 h hr 266 27 mg l toc and 6 h hrt the cake layer that developed on the membrane was easy to remove with gentle sloughing using water jet which provides significant cost savings by the elimination of chemicals for membrane cleaning statistical analysis showed that toc concentration had a significant main effect on both pn and ps components of tb eps at α 0 05 the hrt showed no significant effect on either pn or ps components of tb eps ps at α 0 05 tb eps pn increased with increasing toc tb eps pn decreased with increase in hrt from 6 h to 10 h at 104 13 mg l toc but the decrease of hrt from 10 h to 6 h at 266 27 mg l toc did not affect tb eps pn the tmp increased with an increase in hrt at 104 13 and 266 27 mg l toc similarly an increase in seps pn correlated with increase in membrane fouling r 0 581 in terms of performance the system achieved 98 1 99 1 52 33 organics degradation nh3 n removal total nitrogen removal respectively in all the runs declaration of interests none acknowledgement this work was

18911,in boreal regions increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc have been linked to extreme wet years however less is known about the extent to which precipitation events are altering doc concentration and quality we assessed the effects of rain events on a suite of six lakes in maine u s a to better understand how events alter doc quantity and quality doc concentrations and doc quality measured as doc specific absorption coefficients specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 also a 254 a 320 and a 380 were quantified 24 h before and at three time points 24 48 h 5 7 days and 3 weeks after five different precipitation events our results revealed three types of responses across the lakes 1 an initial spike in doc concentrations of 30 133 and in the three quality metrics of 20 86 compared to pre storm levels followed by return to pre storm concentrations 2 a sustained increase in doc concentrations by 4 23 and an increase in the three doc quality metrics by 1 43 through the second post storm sampling with concentrations falling by the third post storm sampling compared to pre storm levels and 3 no change during all sampling periods lake residence time was a key driver of changes in doc concentration and doc quality in response to storm events our research provides evidence that precipitation events contribute to short term abrupt changes in doc quantity and quality that are largely driven by key landscape and lake characteristics these changes in doc may have important implications for management of water utilities including alteration or implementation of treatment strategies graphical abstract image 1 keywords lake water quality dissolved organic carbon drinking water climate change storm events 1 introduction the frequency and severity of extreme precipitation events are increasing across many regions donat et al 2013 easterling et al 2017 groisman et al 1999 jentsch et al 2007 these events may exert a stronger effect on ecosystems than gradual climate change huber and gulledge 2011 and the frequency and severity of these events is predicted to continue to increase jentsch et al 2007 the location of the northeastern u s relative to the flow of the jet stream makes this area more susceptible to increases in extreme precipitation than other areas of the u s and some regions across the globe easterling et al 2000 indeed since 1950 the region has experienced a 70 increase in extreme precipitation events frei et al 2015 huang et al 2017 2018 madsen and figdor 2007 madsen and wilcox 2012 melillo et al 2014 spierre et al 2010 the highest percent increase in the country in boreal regions one of the key concerns with higher rainfall is an increase in the amount of dissolved organic carbon doc that flows into lakes and streams doc is largely derived from terrestrial sources burns et al 2016 mcknight et al 2003 prairie 2008 and enters aquatic ecosystems via surface ground and soil waters moore 2003 roulet and moore 2006 modification in transport by run off from the watershed to lakes and streams from changes in precipitation intensity frequency and duration may contribute to elevated levels of doc delpla et al 2009 whitehead et al 2009 doc concentrations are expected to increase in boreal lakes by as much as 65 by the end of the century as a result of climate change effects on terrestrial ecosystems larson et al 2011 this could have harmful effects on the chemical and biological quality of boreal aquatic ecosystems and drinking water delpla et al 2009 roig et al 2011 doc plays a key role in determining water transparency mixing depth oxygen availability and the bioavailability and processing of nutrients and toxic compounds in lakes williamson et al 1999 additionally rising doc concentrations in water supplies contribute to harmful by products and increased levels of complexed heavy metals and adsorbed organic pollutants matilainen et al 2010 clearly the increased frequency and severity of precipitation events and subsequent increases in doc are a key concern for drinking water quality in boreal lakes landscape features in boreal regions also contribute to elevated doc concentrations within lakes and these features can further modulate the effects of precipitation events for example doc concentration and quality are related to the watershed area lake area ratio wa la schindler 1971 xenopoulos et al 2003 and are influenced by wetlands dillon and molot 1997 temnerud et al 2014 and forested landscapes in the watershed chen et al 2016 nguyen et al 2013 higher precipitation increases the amount and rate of stream groundwater and subsurface inflows into lakes lee et al 2007 thus these landscape features may contribute to the flushing of large amounts of doc from upper soil horizons of watersheds into lakes hinton et al 1997 the lake residence time can also alter the influx and processing of doc in the lake xenopoulos et al 2003 consideration of key landscape features surrounding lakes is important in assessing the impacts of rainfall and subsequent changes in doc recent studies suggest links between increased doc concentrations in surface waters and higher precipitation at various time scales an analysis of a 30 year database of surface water geochemistry and watershed specific landscape data for 84 remote lakes throughout the northeast suggests that during extreme wet years lake doc concentration increases strock et al 2016 in lake mälaren sweden a higher color and increased doc concentration have been associated with extreme precipitation events weyhenmeyer et al 2004 in this lake doc increased by 26 when color increased from 20 to 35 mg pt l 1 both of these studies demonstrate links between doc concentration and precipitation at annual time scales over shorter time scales jennings et al 2012 evaluated changes in seven lakes for 13 weather related episodic events and found increases in doc over a monthly time period in response to precipitation williamson et al 2014 evaluated key doc quality variables to identify lake response to climate and found that these variables all had significant responses to precipitation within 30 75 days the majority of lakes showing the largest responses between 60 and 75 days this work suggests that evaluating lake response to changes in certain doc variables over a longer time period may be important in observing maximum change in contrast raymond et al 2016 used models to evaluate event based delivery of doc from major hydrologic events and suggested that individual events account for a large percentage of annual terrestrial doc input to streams this model suggests important changes in doc likely occur over days supporting the need for further monitoring of the effects of precipitation on doc at short timescales the immediate changes in doc concentration and quality that occur within a day or a week after a precipitation event remain unclear to address the extent to which precipitation events affect boreal drinking water lakes requires a better understanding of the effects of individual storm events on drinking water sources how do doc concentration and quality differ before and after a precipitation event and to what extent are any changes sustained over time to improve understanding of the influence of precipitation events and subsequent changes in doc on boreal drinking water lakes we selected six lakes in maine usa to evaluate changes in the doc concentration and quality metrics before and after five storm events samples at each lake were collected 24 48 h before the storm and 24 48 h 5 7 days and 3 4 weeks after the storm event 2 methods 2 1 site description and lake selection the state of maine is located in the northeastern u s and contains approximately 6000 lakes bedrock across the state of maine varies with northern maine s bedrock largely comprised of metamorphic rocks such as gneiss and schist while southern coastal and western maine contains large areas of granite and central maine is comprised of sedimentary rocks with large amounts of carbonate of the approximately 6000 lakes 45 are used as drinking water resources that provide roughly half of the state s drinking water www maine gov dhhs mecdc environmental health dwp consumers surfacewater shtml six of the 45 lakes in maine that serve as drinking water resources were selected for this study fig 1 lakes were selected based on morphometric and baseline chemical data collected during prior sampling seasons table 1 we chose lakes that varied in size and volume as well as wa la to account for potential landscape effects e g the influence of wetlands on doc concentrations and quality lake sizes measured in area ranged from 0 1 to 121 4 km2 and lake volume ranged from 0 2 106 to 3977 106 m3 doc concentrations for the six selected lakes ranged from less than 2 mg l 1 in jordan pond to almost 5 mg l 1 in nokomis pond table 1 the variation in lake features allowed us to investigate how storms affected different types of aquatic ecosystems 2 2 collection of storm water samples on average over the past several decades the northeastern u s has experienced at least 7 events annually with at least 25 mm of rain falling over a 24 h period spierre et al 2010 by evaluating these events with 25 mm of rain over a 24 h period pertinent water quality information can be provided to drinking water utilities storm water samples were collected from the intake whenever a rain event was predicted between mid may and mid november five storms were evaluated in this study from fall 2015 to fall 2016 table 2 precipitation data were collected from the closest weather station to each lake table 2 every lake did not receive 25 mm of precipitation for all events a plot representing the total rainfall from september 1 2015 to october 31 2016 collected from a weather station near one of the study lakes shows the size of the rain events compared to all precipitation events including snow throughout the duration of the study fig 2 additional information on the amounts of rainfall before and during sampling periods can be found in the supplementary information appendix a samples were collected at each of the six study lakes 24 h before pre 24 48 h after p1 5 7 days after p2 and 3 4 weeks after the precipitation events p3 for each of the six lakes the corresponding water district collected samples from the intake inside the pump house or water treatment plant for each sampling period pre p1 p2 and p3 only raw i e not treated water samples were collected for analysis one opaque 1 l pre rinsed acid washed bottle for analysis of doc total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn nitrate no3 and ammonium nh4 and one brown 1 l pre rinsed soap washed bottle for analysis of chlorophyll a were filled during each of the pre p1 p2 and p3 sampling periods each 1 l bottle was rinsed three times with lake intake water then filled capped and stored in a cool dark place until shipping after collection of the pre p1 and p2 samples bottles were shipped overnight to the university of maine for analysis p3 samples were shipped upon collection and were not collected for storm 3 or for storm 5 upon receipt of samples each was filtered as necessary and separated into bottles for analysis of water quality metrics more detailed methods and results for nutrient and chlorophyll a analyses can be found in the supplementary data appendix a 2 3 analysis of doc concentration and absorbance properties all storm samples were analyzed for doc concentration and quality immediately upon receipt doc samples were filtered through 25 mm whatman gf f filters pre rinsed with deionized water doc concentrations were analyzed on a shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer doc quality was assessed by measuring the absorbance properties within 200 800 nm wavelengths using a varian cary uv vis spectrophotometer a milli q deionized water blank was subtracted from the raw absorbance values to provide corrected absorbance values naperian dissolved absorption coefficients were calculated using the following equation helms et al 2008 kirk 2011 a d 2 303 d r where d is the decadal optical density value from the spectrophotometer and r measured in meters is the path length of the quartz cuvette doc specific absorption coefficients specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 also a 254 a 320 and a 380 and spectral slopes were calculated to evaluate doc quality suva254 a 320 and a 380 were calculated by dividing a d by the doc concentration mg l 1 changes in suva254 are used by many drinking water utilities to assess the aromaticity or reactivity of doc in water which contributes to determining the amount of chemicals used for treatment nguyen et al 2013 changes in a 320 and a 380 can give insights into the source and chemical properties of the doc that aids in assessing drinking water and monitoring biogeochemical trends jaffe et al 2008 changes in doc composition or quality are variable across lakes providing an effective way to evaluate how different lakes may respond to precipitation events relative response rr of doc concentrations suva254 a 320 and a 380 was also calculated p1 p2 and p3 samples were each normalized to the pre sample rr postx pre 1 where x is the post1 post2 or post3 rr values less than zero indicate a decrease in that parameter positive values indicate an increase and zero indicates no change to calculate spectral slopes over the 275 295 nm range s 275 295 linear regression was used to estimate the slope of the relationship between ln a d and wavelength expressed as a positive number following williamson et al 2014 doc related climate forcing optical indices cf were calculated using the ratio a 320 s 275 295 larger numbers are indicative of wetter and cooler conditions for each sampling period pre p1 p2 p3 a 320 and s 275 295 were each averaged across the five storms cf gives insight into the relationship between precipitation and temperature dependence of doc concentrations williamson et al 2014 these indices reveal that doc quality might be more responsive to precipitation events than doc quantity helms et al 2008 williamson et al 2014 2 4 comparison of lake surface water and intake samples to determine if samples collected from the intake were representative of the lake we collected surface water samples in the middle of the lake at some of the sites on the same or similar day that samples were collected from the intake table 3 samples were collected in the opaque and brown 1 l bottles the same as collection from the intake and identical analyses were performed using the same methods more detailed methods and results for nutrient and chlorophyll a analyses for lake and intake comparisons can be found in the supplementary data appendix a 2 5 landscape watershed data landscape and lake morphometry data for each lake were collected from the lakes of maine website www lakesofmaine org which archives data from the maine department of environmental protection maine inland fisheries and wildlife and the maine office of gis specific data collected included wa la as well as the percent impervious cover agriculture and developed areas in the watershed table 4 additional land cover data including percent mixed forest and scrub shrub were collected using 2011 national gap analysis land cover data from the united states geological survey table 4 the average slope of the watershed was calculated using digital elevation models collected from the maine office of gis table 4 percent wetland coverage in the watershed was calculated using the united states fish and wildlife service wetlands mapper www fws gov wetlands data mapper html table 4 residence time was calculated as the inverse of the flushing rate which was measured as times per year table 4 many of the lake and landscape variables in this study varied across the six lakes wa la ranged from 3 9 for nokomis pond to 20 for chases pond residence time ranged from 0 2 to 6 7 years and total percent wetland ranged from 2 to 80 of the watershed area table 4 the slope was also variable across the six lakes ranging from 6 7 at sebago lake to 47 5 at jordan pond table 4 mixed forest cover dominates the watersheds of most lakes with the exception of young lake that is predominantly covered by wetland table 4 the type of forest cover is similar across most lakes qualitative analysis of maine vegetation suggests young lake and nokomis pond have slightly more deciduous cover and equal percent coverage of coniferous and mixed forests jordan pond has more coniferous cover and equal percent coverage of deciduous and mixed forest and floods pond chases pond and sebago lake have equal percent coverage of deciduous coniferous and mixed forest cover the percent coverage of agricultural land impervious cover and developed areas within the lake watersheds were relatively similar table 4 2 6 data analysis to assess if the sampling period or the storm event affected doc collectively across all lakes a linear mixed effects model was used for the doc metrics data were log transformed to meet assumptions of constant variance and normality and relationships where p 0 05 were considered significant within each lake we assessed whether storms altered the doc concentrations suva254 a 320 and a 380 and if any changes were sustained by using a randomized block design to conduct a repeated measures analysis of variance anova test rain events were treated as blocks and pre p1 and p2 were the treatments a significance level of p 0 05 was used and the greenhouse geiser correction was used to test for the assumption of sphericity post hoc analysis was conducted using a bonferroni correction this test evaluated differences before and after all storm events for each lake and also identified whether or not any changes were sustained to evaluate if storms 1 through 5 resulted in different responses within each lake a one way anova was used to compare the mean doc concentrations and doc quality metrics of all sampling periods for each storm this allowed us to evaluate if storms with different precipitation amounts or at different times of year influenced the doc response a significance level of p 0 05 was used and levene s test for homogeneity and shapiro wilks normality test were used to test for the assumptions of anova to determine which means were significantly different from one another tukey s honestly significant differences post hoc test was used simple linear regression was used to assess whether wa la residence time slope or total percent wetland coverage affected the mean percent change in doc concentration suva254 and a 320 to storms mean percent change is the average percent change between pre storm samples and the p2 storm samples collected six days after the precipitation event for each lake relationships where p 0 05 were considered significant all statistical analyses were conducted using r software version 3 3 2 the r core team 2016 3 results 3 1 precipitation events at each study site the amount of precipitation was greatest for storm 1 across all sites except at chases pond where storm 5 was the largest table 2 storm 1 was the second largest storm for chases pond storm 3 or storm 4 had the least amount of precipitation across all sites table 2 for a few events not all sites received at least 25 mm of precipitation floods pond nokomis pond and jordan pond received 25 mm of precipitation during storm 3 and young lake floods pond nokomis pond and jordan pond received 25 mm of precipitation for storm 4 table 2 3 2 response of doc metrics across all lakes to storm event and period sampled when assessed collectively across all six lakes doc concentration differed between sampling periods and storms p 0 05 but there was no interactive effect between the period sampled and the storm table 5 doc concentration increased from the pre to the p1 sampling period and doc concentrations were different across the lakes for each of the five storms p 0 05 for suva254 and a 320 there were no significant effects of the period sampled the storm event or the interactive effect between them across all lakes however a 380 was either collectively higher or lower during different storms p 0 05 table 5 3 3 relative response of doc metrics within each lake to storm events the rr of doc concentrations varied across lakes and storm events fig 3 with three response patterns emerging among lakes an immediate relatively large but short lived increase occurred in young lake doc concentrations spiked during p1 sampling followed by an immediate decrease by p2 young lake rr for p1 ranged from 0 30 for storm 4 to 1 33 for storm 1 fig 3 a gradual moderate and sometimes sustained increase occurred in floods and nokomis ponds on average across all storms the rr of doc increased from the pre to the p1 sampling and again from the p1 to the p2 sampling the change in rr for the five storms in these lakes ranged from 0 to 0 17 for the pre to p1 sampling and from 0 to 0 23 for the pre to p2 sampling fig 3 little or no change occurred in chases pond jordan pond and sebago lake these lakes had the lowest rr values for all storms and showed little or no change between pre p1 and p2 samplings with the rr response for these periods across the three lakes ranging from 0 04 to 0 09 fig 3 the rr for p3 was variable across all lakes typically decreasing to or below pre storm values fig 3 generally the largest rr values occurred for the largest storm at each site storm 1 for all lakes except chases pond where storm 5 was the largest fig 3 responses of doc quality metrics suva254 a 320 and a 380 were more variable in each lake compared to doc concentrations for both the sampling period and storm while there was more variability particularly in the response of each lake to the different storm events similar patterns to the doc concentration responses emerged for the doc quality metrics fig 4 young lake again had a relatively large but short lived increase in the rr of the doc quality metrics the three metrics spiked during p1 sampling followed by a decrease by p2 rr from pre to p1 ranged from 0 02 to 0 37 for suva254 0 06 to 0 72 for a 320 and 0 07 to 0 86 for a 380 in floods and nokomis ponds a gradual and sometimes sustained increase in all metrics occurred similar to doc concentration on average across all storms the rr of all doc metrics increased from the pre to the p1 sampling and again from the p1 to the p2 sampling rr in floods pond from pre to p2 ranged from 0 07 to 0 07 for suva254 0 03 to 0 16 for a 320 and 0 04 to 0 20 for a 380 rr in nokomis pond from pre to p2 ranged from 0 01 to 0 11 for suva254 0 01 to 0 27 for a 320 and 0 01 to 0 43 for a 380 fig 4 chases pond jordan pond and sebago lake were variable and either increased or decreased from pre to p1 or p2 fig 4 little change occurred in chases pond except during storm 5 where rr from pre to p1 increased by 0 17 for suva254 by 0 35 for a 320 and by 0 45 for a 380 fig 4 in jordan pond from pre to p1 the three doc quality metrics increased during storms 2 and 3 and decreased during storms 1 and 5 followed by a return toward pre storm levels during p2 fig 4 little or no change in rr occurred in sebago lake fig 4 young lake floods pond and nokomis pond had the highest rr during storm 1 for all three quality metrics similar to the doc response fig 4 3 4 effect of period and storm event within each lake young lake was the only lake in which the timing of sampling or the period had a significant effect on doc response however storm event did not have a significant effect this reflects the consistently positive response of all doc metrics at p1 after all storms young lake was highly responsive to precipitation doc concentration p 0 05 suva254 and a 320 increased from pre to p1 p 0 10 this is in contrast to the other five lakes in which the sampling period had no significant effect but the magnitude of the doc response varied across storms floods and nokomis ponds demonstrated a few similar patterns of rr in doc concentration and quality metrics in floods pond doc concentration for all sampling periods were higher during storm 1 compared to storms 2 4 and 5 p 0 05 in nokomis pond the response of doc concentration was higher during storm 1 compared to storm 5 p 0 05 there were no significant differences for doc quality metrics in floods or nokomis ponds the response of doc concentration during storm events in chases pond jordan pond and sebago lake were not significantly different p 0 05 and quality metrics varied slightly in chases pond storm 5 quality metrics were higher compared to storm 4 p 0 05 in jordan pond for all doc quality metrics storm 3 values were higher than storm 1 p 0 05 in sebago lake there were no significant differences across all doc metrics p 0 05 3 5 climate forcing optical index the mean response mean standard error of the cf index for each sampling period averaged across all of the storms resulted in the same three patterns that emerged from the rr of doc concentration with the exception of chases pond fig 5 in young lake the cf index spiked from pre to p1 and immediately decreased by p2 and sustained the decrease by p3 the cf indices were 143 17 during the pre storm period 230 21 by p1 197 16 by p2 and 159 21 by p3 fig 5 in young lake this was a significant response p 0 05 and had the highest r2 value of 0 96 fig 5 again a gradual moderate and sometimes sustained increase occurred in floods and nokomis ponds floods pond cf indices ranged from 128 8 during the pre storm period to 143 5 by p3 fig 5 nokomis pond cf indices ranged from 117 17 during the pre storm period to141 7 by p3 fig 5 chases pond responded similarly to young lake with an increase in the cf index from pre to p1 and a decrease thereafter the cf indices in chases pond were 86 12 for pre storm 96 9 for p1 94 10 for p2 and 91 7 for p3 fig 5 the cf index for jordan pond decreased from 72 9 during pre storm conditions to 61 8 by p3 the opposite of young lake floods pond and nokomis pond fig 5 sebago lake had little to no change in the cf indices 3 6 relationship between lake and landscape variables and doc metrics percent wetland coverage in the watershed was positively correlated with mean percent change in doc mean percent change in suva254 and mean percent change in a 320 p 0 05 fig 6 however this relationship is driven by young lake residence time had a negative effect on the mean percent change in a 320 p 0 05 mean percent change in doc and mean percent change in suva254 also had negative slopes however they were not significant fig 6 there were no significant relationships between mean percent change in doc suva254 or a 320 with respect to wa la fig 6 there were no significant relationships between slope and percent change in doc p 0 53 suva254 p 0 39 or a 320 p 0 74 4 discussion our results suggest that the role of precipitation events in controlling lake doc concentration and quality varies among lakes with the strength and duration of the response to these events shaped by landscape and lake morphometric features three patterns of doc response emerged from the lakes in our study fig 7 with each of the lakes falling into one of the following three categories 1 a spike in doc concentration and suva254 a 320 and a 380 values immediately after a storm event followed by a rapid return to pre storm conditions 2 a gradual and sometimes sustained increase in doc concentration and suva254 a 320 and a 380 values and 3 little to no change in doc concentrations with variable responses in suva254 a 320 and a 380 values residence time plays a key role in determining the type of response each lake will exhibit this information provides important insights to help water managers assess the potential implications of future storm events while water treatment processes and methods vary utilities face common challenges from rain events and appropriate management responses are likely to vary with landscape and lake morphometric features the spike pattern in doc concentration and quality is predominantly attributed to short residence time the response of doc in young lake is indicative of a rapid delivery of water into the lake and a rapid exit in young lake doc concentration suva254 a 320 and a 380 respond very similarly to one another supporting the importance of short residence time as a driver of changes in this system precipitation events could exacerbate effects of short residence time in lake ecosystems as increased runoff from the events may lead to even shorter water residence time and the increased flows increase doc concentrations at various time points tranvik and downing 2009 drinking water utilities using lakes that exhibit rapid increases in doc concentrations with precipitation events may need to make strong temporary adjustments to treatment strategies such as increases in select chemicals used to treat the particular water resource the second observed pattern of a moderate sometimes sustained increase in doc concentrations suva254 a 320 and a 380 results from moderate 1 2 year residence times in which the doc is being retained for a period floods pond and nokomis pond have varying lake depths and volumes however they have several similarities that are drivers of observed change in doc from precipitation events these include similar residence times wa la ratios and initial doc concentrations doc flowing into lakes and streams from precipitation events is likely terrestrially derived curtis and schindler 1997 doc concentrations typically increase with increasing catchment size inamdar and mitchell 2006 thus the similar response of floods and nokomis ponds may be attributed to the similar wa la ratios as well as similar initial doc concentrations which are higher than those of other lakes in this study therefore these similarities between the two lakes suggest that residence time is a key driver of the sustained doc response to precipitation events and wa la could also be a contributing factor compared to lakes with the spike pattern lakes that exhibit a pattern of sustained increase in doc may require milder treatments but for a longer period of time or could prompt alterations to treatment facilities these management responses include temporarily less costly adaptations such as increased addition of chemicals i e aluminum or ferric salts or longer term and initially more expensive treatment options such as installation of an ozone treatment system the third pattern of little to no change in doc concentration and variable responses in suva254 a 320 and a 380 results from several factors while these lakes exhibited similar responses the landscape and lake morphometric attributes contributing to any change varied chases pond has a relatively high wa la ratio and a short residence time which is suggestive of larger doc fluctuations chases pond has several inflows where a pulse of doc may be detected however this may alter the doc quality more than the concentration hood et al 2006 hruska et al 2001 which is evident in the greater variability of doc quality in chases pond jordan pond and sebago lake have some similar landscape and morphometric features they are both deep clear lakes with low baseline doc concentrations and longer residence times compared to the other lakes in this study these features and the large volume of these lakes likely contribute to the minimal change in doc during precipitation events similar to chases pond changes in suva254 a 320 and a 380 in jordan pond and sebago lake are more variable than the changes in doc concentration changes in quality are also important for water quality managers to monitor as for example increases in suva254 often indicate more aromatic carbon fu et al 2006 weishaar et al 2003 which is often less bioavailable in lakes perdue et al 1998 suva254 and other uv absorbance values are important for identifying the quality of doc and also the treatability of the drinking water ritson et al 2014 thus monitoring changes in water quality following weather events is an important consideration for water management authorities we have attributed several important distinctions among lake response to landscape features importantly percentage of wetlands in the watershed and lake residence time this relationship between residence time and the mean percent change in doc concentration suva254 and a 320 is a strong predictor variable in understanding doc response relationships have previously been documented between doc concentration and quality and wetlands dillon and molot 1997 gergel et al 1999 kortelainen 1993 while we note a strong relationship with the percent wetland and the mean percent change in doc concentration suva254 and a 320 it is important to note that this relationship is strongly driven by the large extent of wetlands around and large change in doc concentration in young lake young lake and nokomis pond have larger percentages of wetlands than the other lakes which could also be contributing to the higher doc concentrations while residence time is the main driver of doc change in floods pond it is possible that hidden or cryptic wetlands may influence the fluctuations in doc concentration and the quality of the doc cryptic wetlands are areas of the watershed that have low slope and may have inundated soils but there is no visible wetland habitat on the surface winn et al 2009 they are hidden under forest canopy and can be large contributors to doc export from forested catchments creed et al 2003 additionally it is important to acknowledge that there has been significant research that discusses the importance of within lake processes contributing to loss of doc bertilsson and tranvik 2000 von wachenfeldt et al 2008 based on the residence times of floods and nokomis ponds however these processes are not rapid enough for the loss of doc through in lake processes to be more than the inflow of terrestrial doc canham et al 2004 it is difficult to discern specific drivers of doc change wetlands appear to be a strong predictor however this response is driven by the response of young lake thus residence time is the strongest predictor of changes in doc concentration and quality from precipitation events in this study the same three patterns emerged when evaluating the cf index compared to the doc responses and residence time and wa la modify how lakes plot along these climate indices the cf index is most responsive in the lakes with larger wa la ratios and shorter residence times and doc inputs have little influence on the lakes with smaller wa la ratios and longer residence times suggesting that photobleaching is dominant the cf index evaluates lake response across timescales williamson et al 2014 and these indices can tell us about the source of the doc and the subsequent quality for example doc with a lower s 275 295 and higher a 320 is typically terrestrially derived and more colored and less bioavailable helms et al 2008 which may influence photosynthesis or aquatic food webs jones et al 2012 and have further implications uv absorbance and doc have been used as indicators of the presence of organic matter in drinking water thomas and burgess 2007 the cf index allows for evaluation of ecosystem changes across lakes which could support decisions regarding adaptations or revisions to existing management strategies over the course of this study samples from only one spring storm were collected compared to four from fall storms this may affect doc response however while doc concentration may fluctuate seasonally research suggests that the seasonal variability is minor relative to the variability among lakes gergel et al 1999 seasonal effects on doc quality warrant further research our research underscores the complexity of changes in doc concentrations and quality during precipitation events and gives insight into patterns of change that persist across lake and landscape types thus establishing a baseline for implications to water treatment systems and for establishing adaptive management strategies fulvic and humic constituents of doc are important precursors for dbps rook 1974 such as the trihalomethanes thms which have carcinogenic effects christman et al 1990 doc in drinking water that is treated by alum or iron is directly related to the thm formation potential van leeuwen et al 2005 uyak and toroz 2007 further allochthonous doc flowing into drinking water resources from storm events can contribute to increased dbps when oxidized pagano et al 2014 these relationships suggest water treatments will likely need to be altered with increasing doc from precipitation events 5 conclusion three key patterns emerged from the results of our study an immediate spike a sustained increase and no change in doc concentrations in response to precipitation events these same patterns were evident in the response of suva254 a 320 and a 380 with increased variability for the lakes in which doc concentrations did not change residence time was a key driver of the observed changes in determining lake response identifying these patterns and evaluating doc quality metrics in addition to doc concentration will be critical for monitoring modifying and adapting management strategies in light of these events this study provides key insights to preemptively alter management strategies to ensure consistent high water quality for drinking

18911,in boreal regions increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc have been linked to extreme wet years however less is known about the extent to which precipitation events are altering doc concentration and quality we assessed the effects of rain events on a suite of six lakes in maine u s a to better understand how events alter doc quantity and quality doc concentrations and doc quality measured as doc specific absorption coefficients specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 also a 254 a 320 and a 380 were quantified 24 h before and at three time points 24 48 h 5 7 days and 3 weeks after five different precipitation events our results revealed three types of responses across the lakes 1 an initial spike in doc concentrations of 30 133 and in the three quality metrics of 20 86 compared to pre storm levels followed by return to pre storm concentrations 2 a sustained increase in doc concentrations by 4 23 and an increase in the three doc quality metrics by 1 43 through the second post storm sampling with concentrations falling by the third post storm sampling compared to pre storm levels and 3 no change during all sampling periods lake residence time was a key driver of changes in doc concentration and doc quality in response to storm events our research provides evidence that precipitation events contribute to short term abrupt changes in doc quantity and quality that are largely driven by key landscape and lake characteristics these changes in doc may have important implications for management of water utilities including alteration or implementation of treatment strategies graphical abstract image 1 keywords lake water quality dissolved organic carbon drinking water climate change storm events 1 introduction the frequency and severity of extreme

gradual climate change huber and gulledge 2011 and the frequency and severity of these events is predicted to continue to increase jentsch et al 2007 the location of the northeastern u s relative to

the region has experienced a 70 increase in extreme precipitation events frei et al 2015 huang et al 2017 2018 madsen and figdor 2007 madsen and wilcox 2012 melillo et al 2014 spierre et al 2010 the highest percent increase in the country in boreal regions one of the key concerns with higher rainfall is an increase in the amount of dissolved organic carbon doc that flows into lakes and streams doc is largely derived from terrestrial sources burns et al 2016 mcknight et al 2003 prairie 2008 and enters aquatic ecosystems via surface ground and soil waters moore 2003 roulet and moore 2006 modification in transport by run off from the watershed to lakes and streams from changes in precipitation intensity frequency and duration may contribute to elevated levels of doc delpla et al 2009 whitehead et al 2009 doc concentrations are expected to increase in boreal lakes by as much as 65 by the end of the century as a result of climate change effects on terrestrial ecosystems larson et al 2011 this could have harmful effects on the chemical and biological quality of boreal aquatic ecosystems and drinking water delpla et al 2009 roig et al 2011 doc plays a key role in determining water transparency mixing depth oxygen availability and the bioavailability and processing of nutrients and toxic compounds in lakes williamson et al 1999 additionally rising doc concentrations in water supplies contribute to harmful by products and increased levels of complexed heavy metals and adsorbed organic pollutants matilainen et al 2010 clearly the increased frequency and severity of precipitation events and subsequent increases in doc are a key concern for drinking water quality in boreal lakes landscape features in boreal regions also contribute to elevated doc concentrations within lakes and these features can further modulate the effects of precipitation events for example doc concentration and quality are related to the watershed area lake area ratio wa la schindler 1971 xenopoulos et al 2003 and are influenced by wetlands dillon and molot 1997 temnerud et al 2014 and forested landscapes in the watershed chen et al 2016 nguyen et al 2013 higher precipitation increases the amount and rate of stream groundwater and subsurface inflows into lakes lee et al 2007 thus these landscape features may contribute to the flushing of large amounts of doc from upper soil horizons of watersheds into lakes hinton et al 1997 the lake residence time can also alter the influx and processing of doc in the lake xenopoulos et al 2003 consideration of key landscape features surrounding lakes is important in assessing the impacts of rainfall and subsequent changes in doc recent studies suggest links between increased doc concentrations in surface waters and higher precipitation at various time scales an analysis of a 30 year database of surface water geochemistry and watershed specific landscape data for 84 remote lakes throughout the northeast suggests that during extreme wet years lake doc concentration increases strock et al 2016 in lake mälaren sweden a higher color and increased doc concentration have been associated with extreme precipitation events weyhenmeyer et al 2004 in this lake doc increased by 26 when color increased from 20 to 35 mg pt l 1 both of these studies demonstrate links between doc concentration and precipitation at annual time scales over shorter time scales jennings et al 2012 evaluated changes in seven lakes for 13 weather related episodic events and found increases in doc over a monthly time period in response to precipitation williamson et al 2014 evaluated key doc quality variables to identify lake response to climate and found that these variables all had significant responses to precipitation within 30 75 days the majority of lakes showing the largest responses between 60 and 75 days this work suggests that evaluating lake response to changes in certain doc variables over a longer time period may be important in observing maximum change in contrast raymond et al 2016 used models to evaluate event based delivery of doc from major hydrologic events and suggested that individual events account for a large percentage of annual terrestrial doc input to streams this model suggests important changes in doc likely occur over days supporting the need for further monitoring of the effects of precipitation on doc at short timescales the immediate changes in doc concentration and quality that occur within a day or a week after a precipitation event remain unclear to address the extent to which precipitation events affect boreal drinking water lakes requires a better understanding of the effects of individual storm events on drinking water sources how do doc concentration and quality differ before and after a precipitation event and to what extent are any changes sustained over time to improve understanding of the influence of precipitation events and subsequent changes in doc on boreal drinking water lakes we selected six lakes in maine usa to evaluate changes in the doc concentration and quality metrics before and after five storm events samples at each lake were collected 24 48 h before the storm and 24 48 h 5 7 days and 3 4 weeks after the storm event 2 methods 2 1 site description and lake selection the state of maine is located in the northeastern u s and contains

provide roughly half of the state s drinking water www maine gov dhhs mecdc environmental health dwp consumers surfacewater shtml six of the 45 lakes in maine that serve as drinking water resources were selected for this study fig 1 lakes were selected based on morphometric and baseline chemical data collected during prior sampling seasons table 1 we chose lakes that varied in size and volume as well as wa la to account for potential landscape effects e g the influence of wetlands on doc concentrations and quality lake sizes measured in area ranged from 0 1 to 121 4 km2 and lake volume ranged from 0 2 106 to 3977 106 m3 doc concentrations for the six selected lakes ranged from less than 2 mg l 1 in jordan pond to almost 5 mg l 1 in nokomis pond table 1 the variation in lake features allowed us to investigate how storms affected different types of aquatic ecosystems 2 2 collection of storm water samples on average over the past several decades the northeastern u s has experienced at least 7 events annually with at least 25 mm of rain falling over a 24 h period spierre et al 2010 by evaluating these events with 25 mm of rain over a 24 h period pertinent water quality information can be provided to drinking water utilities storm water samples were collected from the intake whenever a rain event was predicted between mid may and mid november five storms were evaluated in this study from fall 2015 to fall 2016 table 2 precipitation data were collected from the closest weather station to each lake table 2 every lake did not receive 25 mm of precipitation for all events a plot representing the total rainfall from september 1 2015 to october 31 2016 collected from a weather station near one of the study lakes shows the size of the rain events compared to all precipitation events including snow throughout the duration of the study fig 2 additional information on the amounts of rainfall before and during sampling periods can be found in the supplementary information appendix a samples were collected at each of the six study lakes 24 h before pre 24 48 h after p1 5 7 days after p2 and 3 4 weeks after the precipitation events p3 for each of the six lakes the corresponding water district collected samples from the intake inside the pump house or water treatment plant for each sampling period pre p1 p2 and p3 only raw i e not treated water samples were collected for analysis one opaque 1 l pre rinsed acid washed bottle for analysis of doc total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn nitrate no3 and ammonium nh4 and one brown 1 l pre rinsed soap washed bottle for analysis of chlorophyll a were filled during each of the pre p1 p2 and p3 sampling periods each 1 l bottle was rinsed three times with lake intake water then filled capped and stored in a cool dark place until shipping after collection of the pre p1 and p2 samples bottles were shipped overnight to the university of maine for analysis p3 samples were shipped upon collection and were not collected for storm 3 or for storm 5 upon receipt of samples each was filtered as necessary and separated into bottles for analysis of water quality metrics more detailed methods and results for nutrient and chlorophyll a analyses can be found in the supplementary data appendix a 2 3 analysis of doc concentration and absorbance properties all storm samples were analyzed for doc concentration and quality immediately upon receipt doc samples were filtered through 25 mm whatman gf f filters pre rinsed with deionized water doc concentrations were analyzed on a shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer doc quality was assessed by measuring the absorbance properties within 200 800 nm wavelengths using a varian cary uv vis spectrophotometer a milli q deionized water blank was subtracted from the raw absorbance values to provide corrected absorbance values naperian dissolved absorption coefficients were calculated using the following equation helms et al 2008 kirk 2011 a d 2 303 d r where d is the decadal optical density value from the spectrophotometer and r measured in meters is the path length of the quartz cuvette doc specific absorption coefficients specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 also a 254 a 320 and a 380 and spectral slopes were calculated to evaluate doc quality suva254 a 320 and a 380 were calculated by dividing a d by the doc concentration mg l 1 changes in suva254 are used by many drinking water utilities to assess the aromaticity or reactivity of doc in water which contributes to determining the amount of chemicals used for treatment nguyen et al 2013 changes in a 320 and a 380 can give insights into the source and chemical properties of the doc that aids in assessing drinking water and monitoring biogeochemical trends jaffe et al 2008 changes in doc composition or quality are variable across lakes providing an effective way to evaluate how different lakes may respond to precipitation events relative response rr of doc concentrations suva254 a 320 and a 380 was also calculated p1 p2 and p3 samples were each normalized to the pre sample rr postx pre 1 where x is the post1 post2 or post3 rr values less than zero indicate a decrease in that parameter positive values indicate an increase and zero indicates no change to calculate spectral slopes over the 275 295 nm range s 275 295 linear regression was used to estimate the slope of the relationship between ln a d and wavelength expressed as a positive number following williamson et al 2014 doc related climate forcing optical indices cf were calculated using the ratio a 320 s 275 295 larger numbers are indicative of wetter and cooler conditions for each sampling period pre p1 p2 p3 a 320 and s 275 295 were each averaged across the five storms cf gives insight into the relationship between precipitation and temperature dependence of doc concentrations williamson et al 2014 these indices reveal that doc quality might be more responsive to precipitation events than doc quantity helms et al 2008 williamson et al 2014 2 4 comparison of lake surface water and intake samples to determine if samples collected from the intake were representative of the lake we collected surface water samples in the middle of the lake at some of the sites on the same or similar day that samples were collected from the intake table 3 samples were collected in the opaque and brown 1 l bottles the same as collection from the intake and identical analyses were performed using the same methods more detailed methods and results for nutrient and chlorophyll a analyses for lake and intake comparisons can be found in the supplementary data appendix a 2 5 landscape watershed data landscape and lake morphometry data for each lake were collected from the lakes of maine website www lakesofmaine org which archives data from the maine department of environmental protection maine inland fisheries and wildlife and the maine office of gis specific data collected included wa la as well as the percent impervious cover agriculture and developed areas in the watershed table 4 additional land cover data including percent mixed forest and scrub shrub were collected using 2011 national gap analysis land cover data from the united states geological survey table 4 the average slope of the watershed was calculated using digital elevation models collected from the maine office of gis table 4 percent wetland coverage in the watershed was calculated using the united states fish and wildlife service wetlands mapper www fws gov wetlands data mapper html table 4 residence time was calculated as the inverse of the flushing rate which was measured as times per year table 4 many of the lake and landscape variables in this study varied across the six lakes wa la ranged from 3 9 for nokomis pond to 20 for chases pond residence time ranged from 0 2 to 6 7 years and total percent wetland ranged from 2 to 80 of the watershed area table 4 the slope was also variable across the six lakes ranging from 6 7 at sebago lake to 47 5 at jordan pond table 4 mixed forest cover dominates the watersheds of most lakes with the exception of young lake that is predominantly covered by wetland table 4 the type of forest cover is similar across most lakes qualitative analysis of maine vegetation suggests young lake and nokomis pond have slightly more deciduous cover and equal percent coverage of coniferous and mixed forests jordan pond has more coniferous cover and equal percent coverage of deciduous and mixed forest and floods pond chases pond and sebago lake have equal percent coverage of deciduous coniferous and mixed forest cover the percent coverage of agricultural land impervious cover and developed areas within the lake watersheds were relatively similar table 4 2 6 data analysis to assess if the sampling period or the storm event affected doc collectively across all lakes a linear mixed effects model was used for the doc metrics data were log transformed to meet assumptions of constant variance and normality and relationships where p 0 05 were considered significant within each lake we assessed whether storms altered the doc concentrations suva254 a 320 and a 380 and if any changes were sustained by using a randomized block design to conduct a repeated measures analysis of variance anova test rain events were treated as blocks and pre p1 and p2 were the treatments a significance level of p 0 05 was used and the greenhouse geiser correction was used to test for the assumption of sphericity post hoc analysis was conducted using a bonferroni correction this test evaluated differences before and after all storm events for each lake and also identified whether or not any changes were sustained to evaluate if storms 1 through 5 resulted in different responses within each lake a one way anova was used to compare the mean doc concentrations and doc quality metrics of all sampling periods for each storm this allowed us to evaluate if storms with different precipitation amounts or at different times of year influenced the doc response a significance level of p 0 05 was used and levene s test for homogeneity and shapiro wilks normality test were used to test for the assumptions of anova to determine which means were significantly different from one another tukey s honestly significant differences post hoc test was used simple linear regression was used to assess whether wa la residence time slope or total percent wetland coverage affected the mean percent change in doc concentration suva254 and a 320 to storms mean percent change is the average percent change between pre storm samples and the p2 storm samples collected six days after the precipitation event for each lake relationships where p 0 05 were considered significant all statistical analyses were conducted using r software version 3 3 2 the r core team 2016 3 results 3 1 precipitation events at each study site the amount of precipitation was greatest for storm 1 across all sites except at chases pond where storm 5 was the largest table 2 storm 1 was the second largest storm for chases pond storm 3 or storm 4 had the least amount of precipitation across all sites table 2 for a few events not all sites received at least 25 mm of precipitation floods pond nokomis pond and jordan pond received 25 mm of precipitation during storm 3 and young lake floods pond nokomis pond and jordan pond received 25 mm of precipitation for storm 4 table 2 3 2 response of doc metrics across all lakes to storm event and period sampled when assessed collectively across all six lakes doc concentration differed between sampling periods and storms p 0 05 but there was no interactive effect between the period sampled and the storm table 5 doc concentration increased from the pre to the p1 sampling period and doc concentrations were different across the lakes for each of the five storms p 0 05 for suva254 and a 320 there were no significant effects of the period sampled the storm event or the interactive effect between them across all lakes however a 380 was either collectively higher or lower during different storms p 0 05 table 5 3 3 relative response of doc metrics within each lake to storm events the rr of doc concentrations varied across lakes and storm events fig 3 with three response patterns emerging among lakes an immediate relatively large but short lived increase occurred in young lake doc concentrations spiked during p1 sampling followed by an immediate decrease by p2 young lake rr for p1 ranged from 0 30 for storm 4 to 1 33 for storm 1 fig 3 a gradual moderate and sometimes sustained increase occurred in floods and nokomis ponds on average across all storms the rr of doc increased from the pre to the p1 sampling and again from the p1 to the p2 sampling the change in rr for the five storms in these lakes ranged from 0 to 0 17 for the pre to p1 sampling and from 0 to 0 23 for the pre to p2 sampling fig 3 little or no change occurred in chases pond jordan pond and sebago lake these lakes had the lowest rr values for all storms and showed little or no change between pre p1 and p2 samplings with the rr response for these periods across the three lakes ranging from 0 04 to 0 09 fig 3 the rr for p3 was variable across all lakes typically decreasing to or below pre storm values fig 3 generally the largest rr values occurred for the largest storm at each site storm 1 for all lakes except chases pond where storm 5 was the largest fig 3 responses of doc quality metrics suva254 a 320 and a 380 were more variable in each lake compared to doc concentrations for both the sampling period and storm while there was more variability particularly in the response of each lake to the different storm events similar patterns to the doc concentration responses emerged for the doc quality metrics fig 4 young lake again had a relatively large but short lived increase in the rr of the doc quality metrics the three metrics spiked during p1 sampling followed by a decrease by p2 rr from pre to p1 ranged from 0 02 to 0 37 for suva254 0 06 to 0 72 for a 320 and 0 07 to 0 86 for a 380 in floods and nokomis ponds a gradual and sometimes sustained increase in all metrics occurred similar to doc concentration on average across all storms the rr of all doc metrics increased from the pre to the p1 sampling and again from the p1 to the p2 sampling rr in floods pond from pre to p2 ranged from 0 07 to 0 07 for suva254 0 03 to 0 16 for a 320 and 0 04 to 0 20 for a 380 rr in nokomis pond from pre to p2 ranged from 0 01 to 0 11 for suva254 0 01 to 0 27 for a 320 and 0 01 to 0 43 for a 380 fig 4 chases pond jordan pond and sebago lake were variable and either increased or decreased from pre to p1 or p2 fig 4 little change occurred in chases pond except during storm 5 where rr from pre to p1 increased by 0 17 for suva254 by 0 35 for a 320 and by 0 45 for a 380 fig 4 in jordan pond from pre to p1 the three doc quality metrics increased during storms 2 and 3 and decreased during storms 1 and 5 followed by a return toward pre storm levels during p2 fig 4 little or no change in rr occurred in sebago lake fig 4 young lake floods pond and nokomis pond had the highest rr during storm 1 for all three quality metrics similar to the doc response fig 4 3 4 effect of period and storm event within each lake young lake was the only lake in which the timing of sampling or the period had a significant effect on doc response however storm event did not have a significant effect this reflects the consistently positive response of all doc metrics at p1 after all storms young lake was highly responsive to precipitation doc concentration p 0 05 suva254 and a 320 increased from pre to p1 p 0 10 this is in contrast to the other five lakes in which the sampling period had no significant effect but the magnitude of the doc response varied across storms floods and nokomis ponds demonstrated a few similar patterns of rr in doc concentration and quality metrics in floods pond doc concentration for all sampling periods were higher during storm 1 compared to storms 2 4 and 5 p 0 05 in nokomis pond the response of doc concentration was higher during storm 1 compared to storm 5 p 0 05 there were no significant differences for doc quality metrics in floods or nokomis ponds the response of doc concentration during storm events in chases pond jordan pond and sebago lake were not significantly different p 0 05 and quality metrics varied slightly in chases pond storm 5 quality metrics were higher compared to storm 4 p 0 05 in jordan pond for all doc quality metrics storm 3 values were higher than storm 1 p 0 05 in sebago lake there were no significant differences across all doc metrics p 0 05 3 5 climate forcing optical index the mean response mean standard error of the cf index for each sampling period averaged across all of the storms resulted in the same three patterns that emerged from the rr of doc concentration with the exception of chases pond fig 5 in young lake the cf index spiked from pre to p1 and immediately decreased by p2 and sustained the decrease by p3 the cf indices were 143 17 during the pre storm period 230 21 by p1 197 16 by p2 and 159 21 by p3 fig 5 in young lake this was a significant response p 0 05 and had the highest r2 value of 0 96 fig 5 again a gradual moderate and sometimes sustained increase occurred in floods and nokomis ponds floods pond cf indices ranged from 128 8 during the pre storm period to 143 5 by p3 fig 5 nokomis pond cf indices ranged from 117 17 during the pre storm period to141 7 by p3 fig 5 chases pond responded similarly to young lake with an increase in the cf index from pre to p1 and a decrease thereafter the cf indices in chases pond were 86 12 for pre storm 96 9 for p1 94 10 for p2 and 91 7 for p3 fig 5 the cf index for jordan pond decreased from 72 9 during pre storm conditions to 61 8 by p3 the opposite of young lake floods pond and nokomis pond fig 5 sebago lake had little to no change in the cf indices 3 6 relationship between lake and landscape variables and doc metrics percent wetland coverage in the watershed was positively correlated with mean percent change in doc mean percent change in suva254 and mean percent change in a 320 p 0 05 fig 6 however this relationship is driven by young lake residence time had a negative effect on the mean percent change in a 320 p 0 05 mean percent change in doc and mean percent change in suva254 also had negative slopes however they were not significant fig 6 there were no significant relationships between mean percent change in doc suva254 or a 320 with respect to wa la fig 6 there were no significant relationships between slope and percent change in doc p 0 53 suva254 p 0 39 or a 320 p 0 74 4 discussion our results suggest that the role of precipitation events in controlling lake doc concentration and quality varies among lakes with the strength and duration of the response to these events shaped by landscape and lake morphometric features three patterns of doc response emerged from the lakes in our study fig 7 with each of the lakes falling into one of the following three categories 1 a spike in doc concentration and suva254 a 320 and a 380 values immediately after a storm event followed by a rapid return to pre storm conditions 2 a gradual and sometimes sustained increase in doc concentration and suva254 a 320 and a 380 values and 3 little to no change in doc concentrations with variable responses in suva254 a 320 and a 380 values residence time plays a key role in determining the type of response each lake will exhibit this information provides important insights to help water managers assess the potential implications of future storm events while water treatment processes and methods vary utilities face common challenges from rain events and appropriate management responses are likely to vary with landscape and lake morphometric features the spike pattern in doc concentration and quality is predominantly attributed to short residence time the response of doc in young lake is indicative of a rapid delivery of water into the lake and a rapid exit in young lake doc concentration suva254 a 320 and a 380 respond very similarly to one another supporting the importance of short residence time as a driver of changes in this system precipitation events could exacerbate effects of short residence time in lake ecosystems as increased runoff from the events may lead to even shorter water residence time and the increased flows increase doc concentrations at various time points tranvik and downing 2009 drinking water utilities using lakes that exhibit rapid increases in doc concentrations with precipitation events may need to make strong temporary adjustments to treatment strategies such as increases in select chemicals used to treat the particular water resource the second observed pattern of a moderate sometimes sustained increase in doc concentrations suva254 a 320 and a 380 results from moderate 1 2 year residence times in which the doc is being retained for a period floods pond and nokomis pond have varying lake depths and volumes however they have several similarities that are drivers of observed change in doc from precipitation events these include similar residence times wa la ratios and initial doc concentrations doc flowing into lakes and streams from precipitation events is likely terrestrially derived curtis and schindler 1997 doc concentrations typically increase with increasing catchment size inamdar and mitchell 2006 thus the similar response of floods and nokomis ponds may be attributed to the similar wa la ratios as well as similar initial doc concentrations which are higher than those of other lakes in this study therefore these similarities between the two lakes suggest that residence time is a key driver of the sustained doc response to precipitation events and wa la could also be a contributing factor compared to lakes with the spike pattern lakes that exhibit a pattern of sustained increase in doc may require milder treatments but for a longer period of time or could prompt alterations to treatment facilities these management responses include temporarily less costly adaptations such as increased addition of chemicals i e aluminum or ferric salts or longer term and initially more expensive treatment options such as installation of an ozone treatment system the third pattern of little to no change in doc concentration and variable responses in suva254 a 320 and a 380 results from several factors while these lakes exhibited similar responses the landscape and lake morphometric attributes contributing to any change varied chases pond has a relatively high wa la ratio and a short residence time which is suggestive of larger doc fluctuations chases pond has several inflows where a pulse of doc may be detected however this may alter the doc quality more than the concentration hood et al 2006 hruska et al 2001 which is evident in the greater variability of doc quality in chases pond jordan pond and sebago lake have some similar landscape and morphometric features they are both deep clear lakes with low baseline doc concentrations and longer residence times compared to the other lakes in this study these features and the large volume of these lakes likely contribute to the minimal change in doc during precipitation events similar to chases pond changes in suva254 a 320 and a 380 in jordan pond and sebago lake are more variable than the changes in doc concentration changes in quality are also important for water quality managers to monitor as for example increases in suva254 often indicate more aromatic carbon fu et al 2006 weishaar et al 2003 which is often less bioavailable in lakes perdue et al 1998 suva254 and other uv absorbance values are important for identifying the quality of doc and also the treatability of the drinking water ritson et al 2014 thus monitoring changes in water quality following weather events is an important consideration for water management authorities we have attributed several important distinctions among lake response to landscape features importantly percentage of wetlands in the watershed and lake residence time this relationship between residence time and the mean percent change in doc concentration suva254 and a 320 is a strong predictor variable in understanding doc response relationships have previously been documented between doc concentration and quality and wetlands dillon and molot 1997 gergel et al 1999 kortelainen 1993 while we note a strong relationship with the percent wetland and the mean percent change in doc concentration suva254 and a 320 it is important to note that this relationship is strongly driven by the large extent of wetlands around and large change in doc concentration in young lake young lake and nokomis pond have larger percentages of wetlands than the other lakes which could also be contributing to the higher doc concentrations while residence time is the main driver of doc change in floods pond it is possible that hidden or cryptic wetlands may influence the fluctuations in doc concentration and the quality of the doc cryptic wetlands are areas of the watershed that have low slope and may have inundated soils but there is no visible wetland habitat on the surface winn et al 2009 they are hidden under forest canopy and can be large contributors to doc export from forested catchments creed et al 2003 additionally it is important to acknowledge that there has been significant research that discusses the importance of within lake processes contributing to loss of doc bertilsson and tranvik 2000 von wachenfeldt et al 2008 based on the residence times of floods and nokomis ponds however these processes are not rapid enough for the loss of doc through in lake processes to be more than the inflow of terrestrial doc canham et al 2004 it is difficult to discern specific drivers of doc change wetlands appear to be a strong predictor however this response is driven by the response of young lake thus residence time is the strongest predictor of changes in doc concentration and quality from precipitation events in this study the same three patterns emerged when evaluating the cf index compared to the doc responses and residence time and wa la modify how lakes plot along these climate indices the cf index is most responsive in the lakes with larger wa la ratios and shorter residence times and doc inputs have little influence on the lakes with smaller wa la ratios and longer residence times suggesting that photobleaching is dominant the cf index evaluates lake response across timescales williamson et al 2014 and these indices can tell us about the source of the doc and the subsequent quality for example doc with a lower s 275 295 and higher a 320 is typically terrestrially derived and more colored and less bioavailable helms et al 2008 which may influence photosynthesis or aquatic food webs jones et al 2012 and have further implications uv absorbance and doc have been used as indicators of the presence of organic matter in drinking water thomas and burgess 2007 the cf index allows for evaluation of ecosystem changes across lakes which could support decisions regarding adaptations or revisions to existing management strategies over the course of this study samples from only one spring storm were collected compared to four from fall storms this may affect doc response however while doc concentration may fluctuate seasonally research suggests that the seasonal variability is minor relative to the variability among lakes gergel et al 1999 seasonal effects on doc quality warrant further research our research underscores the complexity of changes in doc concentrations and quality during precipitation events and gives insight into patterns of change that persist across lake and landscape types thus establishing a baseline for implications to water treatment systems and for establishing adaptive management strategies fulvic and humic constituents of doc are important precursors for dbps rook 1974 such as the trihalomethanes thms which have carcinogenic effects christman et al 1990 doc in drinking water that is treated by alum or iron is directly related to the thm formation potential van leeuwen et al 2005 uyak and toroz 2007 further allochthonous doc flowing into drinking water resources from storm events can contribute to increased dbps when oxidized pagano et al 2014 these relationships suggest water treatments will likely need to be altered with increasing doc from precipitation events 5 conclusion three key patterns emerged from the results of our study an immediate spike a sustained increase and no change in doc concentrations in response to precipitation events these same patterns were evident in the response of suva254 a 320 and a 380 with increased variability for the lakes in which doc concentrations did not change residence time was a key driver of the observed changes in determining lake response identifying these patterns and evaluating doc quality metrics in addition to doc concentration will be critical for monitoring modifying and adapting management strategies in light of these events this study provides key insights to preemptively alter management strategies to ensure consistent high water quality for drinking

18912,this work aimed to evaluate the ability of four regulatory sampling protocols to accurately determine weekly water lead levels wlls of exposure at the kitchen tap in twenty nine households with or without a lead service line lsl proportional sampling was used as the gold standard to which the other protocols 5 min flush 30 min stagnation 6 h stagnation and random daytime were compared random daytime samples provided mean wlls closest to true exposure in the households monitored overall compared to other sampling protocols strikingly mean wlls after 5 min of flushing underestimated lead exposure by 47 supporting these observations water usage patterns revealed that full flushing only occurs in 3 4 of usage events within the service line and in 0 26 at the tap the time between usage events in the service line was approximately 30 min but the 30 min protocol tended to slightly underestimate wlls these differences were explained by flushing prior to the 30 min stagnation sampling which limited the contribution of the lsl to wlls furthermore the average stagnation at the kitchen time was 106 min and usage events rarely exceeded the water volume within premise plumbing 1 1 l mean wlls after 6 h of stagnation without flushing overestimated exposure by 29 but provided a conservative indicator of wlls of exposure keywords lead exposure regulatory sampling proportional tap mean exposure at the tap water consumption patterns 1 introduction the neurotoxic effects of lead are most pronounced in young children pregnant women and fetuses jusko et al 2008 a blood lead level bll of 5 μg dl is the current reference level considered to be high relative to the general population however blls 5 μg dl can contribute to the decline of children s iq scores and cause delayed neuro behavioral development health canada 2013 drinking water remains a significant source of lead exposure in households with lead service lines lsls lead solders and brass fittings brown et al 2011 hanna attisha et al 2016 regardless of the sampling protocol used for evaluating water lead levels wlls in households the reference wll at the tap is typically set at 10 μg l which at the time of its definition corresponded to a health based level calculated considering formula fed infants and past reference blood lead level bll threshold of 10 μg dl considering that i reference wlls are based on their potential impact on children s health blls ii regulated sampling protocols may not accurately provide wlls representative of exposure and that ii wlls measured through regulated sampling have been used in the us to quantify the contribution of tap water to blls zartarian et al 2018 it appears essential that decision makers can confidently extrapolate true exposure to lead using wlls regulated sampling protocols used to measure wlls vary between countries and regions for example wlls are measured using the first draw after at least 6 h of stagnation without a pre flush in the united states according to the lead and copper rule lcr usepa 2007 in ontario canada the first 2 l after 30 min stagnation preceded by flushing are used to measure wlls government of ontario 2002 while the legislation in both quebec canada mddelcc 2014 and australia as nzs 56 667 5 1998 require 2 5 min of flushing prior to collection finally a random daytime rdt 1 l sample without pre set stagnation is prescribed across europe and was recently recommended by health canada european commission 2003 2015 health canada 2017 these protocols can be used to meet various sampling objectives such as estimating exposure confirming compliance verifying corrosion control efficacy and detecting lead sources in contrast to the aforementioned sampling protocols proportional sampling involves fitting specialized taps to kitchen faucets thereby diverting a portion of the flow to a sample bottle over a period of about one week van den hoven and slaats 2006 because the european drinking water directive calls specifically for a protocol that is indicative of weekly customer exposure at the tap official journal of the european communities 1998 large field studies completed in the 90 s compared wlls from rdt sampling after 30 min of stagnation and after 5 min of flushing to those measured by proportional composite sampling hoekstra et al 2009 van den hoven and slaats 2006 based on results in seven countries they concluded that the 30 min stagnation protocol provided estimates closest to mean weekly wlls as measured by proportional tap sampling the rdt slightly overestimated mean weekly wlls but was only accurate if a larger number of samples were collected the likelihood of water with elevated lead reaching the tap is determined by water usage patterns and plumbing configuration plumbing configuration and the origin of the water within the distribution system prior to sampling lsl or premise plumbing have been shown to affect wlls at the tap deshommes et al 2016b the type of household single vs multiple dwellings also strongly influence the risk of exposure to elevated wlls deshommes et al 2013 levallois et al 2013 ngueta et al 2014 clement et al 2000 conducted proportional tap sampling in nine french households to evaluate daily lead intakes they report that the variability in wlls results was highly dependent on the household consumption habits and the plumbing configuration in the u s and parts of canada drinking water consumption patterns revealed that 19 of the water is used at faucets 43 of which corresponds to cold water wrf 2016 water consumption patterns are highly variable and depend on different factors such as the size of the houses monitored the number of inhabitants the season etc consumption peaks i e during weekends and holidays typically occur after long stagnations xue et al 2017 although stagnation time in lsls is known to impact wlls stagnation upflow of the kitchen tap may also play an important role on lead exposure but has not yet been investigated as lead standards become more stringent there is a need to determine which sampling protocols can actually provide a reliable estimate of mean wlls of exposure at the tap the concept of an acceptable household exposure level at the tap has gained support although proportional sampling is undoubtedly the gold standard to estimate true exposure at the tap it is only feasible as a research tool therefore there is an urgent need to establish which protocols can provide a reliable estimate to guide revised sampling requirements proportional tap investigations conducted in the 90 s in europe are unlikely to be representative of current north american consumption patterns and of exposure to lead at the tap furthermore the 6 h first draw sampling used in the u s has never been compared to proportional tap results to address these knowledge gaps the main objectives of this project are to 1 apply proportional sampling to evaluate mean weekly wlls at the tap of north american households with and without a lsl and 2 compare the mean weekly exposure estimates to wlls measured using regulatory sampling protocols to determine if these protocols can effectively protect consumers as a secondary objective we monitored water use dynamics in households by comparing water use drawn in the service line and at the kitchen tap volumes and stagnation times and relating it to the wlls measured at the tap as elevated wlls are driven by stagnation in the lsls it is important to understand how these elevated wlls can be transported to the kitchen tap 2 materials and methods 2 1 households sampled and monitoring periods twenty nine households were monitored in montreal canada between june 2017 and july 2018 about 53 000 households built before 1970 are supplied with water with a public side lsl in this distribution system 2018 estimation the average ph and alkalinity of the distributed water are 8 0 and 90 mg caco3 l respectively single family homes built prior to 1970 were selected as they have a high probability of presence of a lsl and constitute the most at risk households for lead exposure deshommes et al 2013 2016b moreover it is much easier to implement use restrictions to ensure controlled stagnation with a single household connected to the lsl wlls at the tap n 7 households or drinking water consumption patterns n 8 households or both wlls and drinking water patterns n 14 households were monitored table s1 in supporting information si out of the 21 households monitored for wlls 14 were served by a lsl while 83 of the samples 376 454 were collected in the summer 15 c 17 of the samples 78 454 were collected during winter 0 15 c the summer season was targeted for sampling wlls considering the higher wlls in this system at warm temperatures deshommes et al 2013 within the 22 households monitored for drinking water consumption patterns 11 were monitored in the summer june september and the remaining 11 in the fall and winter table s1 during the first visit to each household a profile sampling consisting of collecting at least 8 consecutive liters of water after 30 min stagnation and a detailed premise plumbing evaluation length and volume of piping were performed as described in deshommes et al 2016b to establish the presence of a lsl also we verified the compatibility of the proportional sampling tap with the kitchen tap in the household 2 2 water lead level sampling fig 1 presents a schematic of the proportional sampling tap designed for this study it consists of a special pvc faucet splitting the water flow into two outlets one of the outlets is a typical kitchen tap containing a stainless steel aerator calibrated to provide 95 of the flow to be used by the consumer as usual the second outlet receives 5 of the flow that is discharged to a 5 l sampling bottle through plastic tubing a manual shutdown valve was installed on the tubing connecting the proportional tap to the sampling bottle so that water used for dish or hand washing was not sampled an aerator screen was installed at the device inlet prior to flow splitting to retain particles two 5 l sampling bottles were provided per week the typical flow rate at the kitchen tap was 4 8 l min during sampling the proportional tap was installed for one to 2 weeks at the kitchen tap used for drinking water or cooking participants were asked not to modify their consumption habits during the study and to open the manual valve leading to the proportional tap sampling bottle when using water for drinking or cooking in addition to proportional tap sampling n 2 to 4 composite samples for two weeks of participation the following 1 l samples were collected at the kitchen tap first draw samples after at least 6 h stagnation with no pre flush 6hs two consecutive samples after 30 min stagnation preceded by 5 min of flushing 30ms1 30ms2 samples after 5 min of flushing 5 mf and random daytime samples rdt the 30ms1 30ms2 and 5 mf samples were collected by the project team during the first visit and at the beginning of each sampling week i e n 2 for one week n 3 for two weeks for each sample type the 6hs n 1 per week and rdt samples n 2 per week as defined in this study were collected by the participant to whom tutorial documents and a support phone number were provided the rdt samples were collected at different time points over the week corresponding to drinking water consumption periods samples were collected in wide neck polypropylene bottles prewashed with nitric acid for metals sampling the bottles were then acidified with 0 5 nitric acid for at least 24 h and analyzed for total metals with icp ms according to the usepa 200 8 method in order to assess the contribution of the different parts of household piping to wlls additional profiles were completed by collecting 10 12 consecutive liters at the kitchen tap of two households after 1 2 4 and 6 h of stagnation preceded by a 5 min pre flush as opposed to the 6hs 1 l sample that was collected without a pre flush flushing prior to stagnation provides a clearer estimate of the relative contribution of the premise plumbing and lsl to the wll if pre flushing is conducted the 1st liter collected after 6 h stagnation represents the contribution of the piping immediately upstream of the faucet and the background contribution from the lsl during flow grevatt 2016 katner et al 2016 conversely a 6hs 1st draw with no pre flush includes an additional random contribution from the lsl and or premise plumbing depending on water use prior to stagnation 2 3 online monitoring of water consumption water drawn from the service line and used at the kitchen tap were monitored using two devices the first device was a data logger thermometer or temperature sensor model rdx l4sd omega the electrode of the device is fixed to the outer pipe surface and records temperature variations measurements were taken at 5 s intervals temperature sensors were installed on the service line and on the cold water piping immediately upstream of the kitchen tap when the piping was accessible and in the presence of a power outlet fig 2 the second device was an ultrasonic transit time flowmeter externally mounted on 0 5 in or 0 75 in copper pipes models fdt 31 c and fdt 32 c respectively omega the flowmeter required space around the pipe and was designed for specific diameters which limited its installation to a few households table s1 measurements were taken at 1 s intervals the stagnation periods and water volumes used at the tap or in the service line were provided by the flowmeters which in turn were used to calibrate the temperature sensor readings an excel vba macro was developed to analyze the temperature sensors data and to automatically display stagnation times for the entire monitoring period fig 2 fig s1 the vba macro processed data were validated in the laboratory in the field and using an ansys thermodynamic study as detailed in the supporting information si given that data processing by the temperature sensor is challenging in summer consumption data collected using this device were mainly gathered during the beginning and the end of summer june and september fall and winter see si for details 2 4 integrated exposure uptake biokinetic ieubk modeling the blls of 0 7 year old children were determined using the ieubk model with adjusted input parameters for soil dust air and diet and a water intake of 0 742 0 910 l day deshommes et al 2018 similarly to deshommes et al 2018 complementary modeling was performed using lower daily water intakes of 0 285 0 385 l day to represent the overall population of children using a distribution system that drink small to large volumes of tap water the geometric mean gm of blls and the fraction of children with blls exceeding 5 μg dl were estimated using the mean and the 90th percentile wlls measured with each sampling protocol in the households 3 results and discussion 3 1 exposure to lead in water measured through regulatory sampling fig 3 presents the wlls measured using proportional prop and regulatory sampling protocols in households with or without a lsl depending on the sampling protocol mean wlls range from 5 5 to 14 μg l in households with a lsl fig 3a in contrast mean wlls in households not serviced by a lsl are between 1 0 and 3 8 μg l for both types of households the highest wlls were measured using 6hs first draw samples after 6 h stagnation with no pre flush rdt random daytime and prop sampling while the lowest wlls were measured after 5 mf 5 min of flushing sampling the 10th 90th percentile of wlls in households with a lsl are 4 3 17 1 μg l and 6 2 22 1 μg l measured by rdt and 6hs sampling respectively the 5 mf 30ms1 first sample after a 30 min stagnation preceded by 5 min of flushing and 30ms2 second sample after a 30 min stagnation preceded by 5 min of flushing samplings were less variable with 10th 90th percentiles of 2 1 8 6 3 4 10 2 and 3 5 10 2 μg l as flushing helps to produce repeatable results cartier et al 2011 van den hoven and slaats 2006 water lead levels measured by proportional sampling of households with a lsl were less variable relative to those measured by 6hs and rdt sampling proportional samples are a combination of the more reproducible 30ms and 5 mf samples in addition to the random contribution of the lsl in the sampling represented by rdt and 6hs sampling indeed the two latter sampling protocols would measure a larger variability in wlls considering variable consumption habits and plumbing configurations between households in households with a lsl fig 3a the mean wll measured with the proportional tap is 10 5 μg l and the 10th 90th percentile values range from 6 2 to 15 4 μg l the wlls detected using rdt sampling are quite close to prop sampling results with mean wlls of 10 4 μg l 0 1 μg l difference and 10th 90th percentile values of 4 3 17 1 μg l 1 7 1 9 μg l difference the minimum mean weekly wll measured in a household with a lsl was found to be 4 9 μg l in fact almost all wlls measured by prop sampling in households with a lsl exceeded the new canadian recommendation of 5 μg l in households without a lsl the wlls measured by 30ms2 are especially low as compared to results from other sampling protocols fig 3b this trend is not observed in households with a lsl as water after the 1st liter may originate from the lsl containing higher wll than premise plumbing as a consequence the 2nd liter typically presents higher wlls as compared to the 1st liter in lsl households deshommes et al 2016b although the mean wlls of 3 3 μg l measured by proportional sampling in households without a lsl was lower than in households with a lsl it still approaches the new proposed threshold of 5 μg l notably one of the household without a lsl reached up to 9 1 μg l exceeding mean weekly concentrations in some lsl households such wlls indicate a significant contribution of lead from the premise plumbing one out of the seven kitchen taps presented systematically high wlls in the first liter collected after 30ms 31 3 μg l or 6hs 63 μg l indicating a large contribution from the faucet and its immediate piping connection after stagnation the contribution of premise plumbing to wlls in this system was investigated using rdt and high flow rate sampling and indicated a significant but sporadic contribution of particulate lead from solders and brass fitting fixtures deshommes et al 2010 the wlls were however typically lower in households without a lsl as compared to households with a lsl deshommes et al 2013 levallois et al 2013 observations in this study suggest a significant background exposure to lead from multiple sources in premise plumbing even in households without a lsl extended stagnation upstream of the kitchen tap will promote lead leaching from premise plumbing remediating this lead release could be achieved through the removal of lead containing materials brass solders etc the implementation of corrosion control complementing lsl replacement and as a temporary solution flushing of the premise plumbing before consumption proportional sampling is considered to be the best estimate of true lead exposure the mean wlls from 30ms samples in households with a lsl tends to underestimate prop wlls by 16 30ms2 to 25 30ms1 as opposed to 6hs samples that overestimate them by 29 fig 3 the mean wlls derived from rdt sampling is equal to that from prop 0 8 while 5 mf sampling results are drastically lower 47 wilcoxon matched pairs tests comparing one by one the households paired wlls prop vs regulated sampling protocol partly confirm these trends as wlls measured after 5 mf 30ms1 and 30ms2 are significantly lower than wlls from proportional sampling p 0 05 in the same household conversely wlls derived from rdt or 6hs 1 l samples were similar to prop wlls p 0 05 suggesting therefore that these samples are closer to exposure the trends for rdt and 5 mf samplings are consistent with previous reports hoekstra et al 2009 van den hoven and slaats 2006 however these authors found that 30ms1 and 30ms2 sampling results were correlated to proportional sampling results r2 0 50 0 63 correlations between prop and other sampling results in the same households with and without a lsl were investigated as in the european studies and are presented in si proportional sampling results in our study were weakly correlated to rdt 6hs and 30ms2 results r2 0 20 0 29 compared to 5 mf and 30ms1 results r2 0 45 0 53 fig s2 these weak correlations were attributed to the relatively small number of samples collected and households sampled indeed the present study sampled 21 households n 34 72 paired samples 1 3 samples per sampling protocol per household in contrast the european study used 294 households n 294 paired samples 3 samples per sampling protocol per household the improved correlation for 5 mf and 30ms1 samples in our study may be explained by their intrinsic higher repeatability because of the constancy of their application flow through 5 mf or fixed duration of stagnation 30ms with pre flush other factors explaining the differences observed in the present study and the european ones include differences in location specific water use patterns changes to drinking water consumption habits over years and premise plumbing configurations single family homes in our study vs all types of households 3 2 fraction of samples exceeding wlls of 5 or 10 μg l when considering the value of various sampling protocols several factors should be considered their ability to estimate true exposure in a single household avoiding false negatives but also the ability to evaluate system wide compliance to target wlls this in turn helps direct consumer protection interventions in the present study the fraction of samples exceeding the 10 μg l health based wll standard or the new recommended level of 5 μg l can be seen on fig 4 excluding the three spikes from one problematic tap in one household wlls never exceeded 10 μg l in households without a lsl regardless of the sampling protocol used in contrast up to 63 of the samples collected after stagnation exceeded 10 μg l in households with a lsl as expected all samples collected after 5 mf were below 10 μg l even when a lsl was present it must be noted that flushed samples are collected to assess compliance in canada and australia only 1 16 of the 30ms samples 1st and 2nd liter exceeded 10 μg l in lsl households higher fractions of samples exceeded 10 μg l with other protocols 46 using rdt 63 using 6hs and 47 using proportional sampling excluding 5 mf results 6 32 of the samples depending on the sampling protocol used collected in households without a lsl exceeded a wll of 5 μg l interestingly 30ms sampling produced similar results to prop 7 while rdt 32 and 6hs 30 sampling showed a higher exceedance rate the differences between households with and without lsls may be attributed to the significant contribution of lead by faucets and the immediate connecting piping which is better captured after extended stagnation by 6hs or rdt sampling cartier et al 2012 these observations highlight the need to remove or control the leaching of lead from all sources in premise plumbing in order to avoid high level sporadic exposure deshommes et al 2010 in houses with a lsl the samples exceeding the 5 μg l threshold wll was 62 96 regardless of sampling protocols in this case 6hs 96 and rdt 82 samplings provided assessments closest to values given by proportional sampling 94 thereby suggesting that system wide compliance is better estimated using rdt and 6hs sampling protocols in households fed by lsls finally it is important to keep in mind that our observations apply to a system without corrosion control it is likely that the differences between the sampling protocols are minimized in a system with effective corrosion control deshommes et al 2018 in this study we elected to define a household at risk of elevated lead exposure as a household with a prop wll 10 μg l the ability of a protocol to detect specific households at risk for lead exposure as opposed to system wide exposure can therefore be assessed by verifying if this protocol and its corresponding reference level e g maximum acceptable concentration are able to detect households with weekly mean exposure prop 10 μg l if a 5 μg l reference level is used the regulated sampling protocols under investigation were able to identify households with a mean weekly wll i e prop 10 μg l 92 100 of the time table s2 the number of false positives regulatory sample 5 μg l when prop is 10 μg l varies between 25 5 mf to 91 92 rdt and 6hs it is approximately 50 for 30ms samplings the number of false negatives is quite low and constant for all protocols regulatory sample 5 μg l and prop is 10 μg l and is approximately 8 except for the 6hs first draw sampling for which there were no false negatives recorded table s2 consequently lowering the reference threshold of current regulated sampling protocols from 10 to 5 μg l would increase the identification of households at risk of high lead exposure i e prop 10 μg l 3 3 contribution of the lead service line to water lead levels as shown on fig 3 wlls measured using rdt or 6hs first draw sampling present more variability than other protocols this is expected as these wlls are representative of a wider range of stagnation durations water age is determined by the water use in the home prior to sample collection rdt or prior to the determined stagnation period 6hs furthermore 6hs sampling without any pre flush includes a random contribution from the lsl and premise plumbing and a local contribution from the piping immediately upstream of the kitchen tap grevatt 2016 katner et al 2016 to quantify the actual contribution of the lsl in 6hs samples profiles were collected after 1 2 4 and 6 h of stagnation preceded by 5 min flushing in two households fig 5 a and b according to these profiles and pipe volume measurements in both households it was possible to determine the wlls within premise plumbing and the lsl fig 5c and fig s3 clearly the contributions of the lsl during flow and premise plumbing to wlls are stable after 1 2 4 or 6 h of stagnation in this system 11 13 μg l while the contribution of the lsl increases with increasing stagnation resulting in wlls ranging from 45 to 80 μg l fig 5c consequently a 6hs sampling collected without prior flushing would include the contribution of the premise piping after 6 h stagnation approximately 11 13 μg l as well as a contribution from the lsl which would vary between 5 5 μg l mean wll after 5 mf i e background flushed wlls to 80 μg l mean wll from the lsl after 6hs the lsl contribution may increase depending on the water use prior to stagnation the variability of plumbing configurations and water usage patterns is consistent with rdt and 6hs results being closest to the proportional sampling results in this study as compared to other sampling protocols tested 3 4 drinking water consumption patterns the time between each water usage event and the volume of water consumed per usage event were monitored at the kitchen tap and in the service line to support the interpretation of wlls measured through proportional sampling fig 6 and fig 7 overall inter use stagnation times at the kitchen tap are typically less than 45 min 68 of events and 47 of these stagnation events are less than 15 min these short stagnations are even more frequent in the service line as 60 of the stagnation times are less than 15 min while 21 last 15 45 min fig 6a however stagnations 6 h are relatively frequent at the kitchen tap 10 of the stagnation events compared to the service line 2 of the events consistent with this mean and 90th percentile values of inter use stagnations are 106 min 1 76 h and 394 min 6 57 h at the kitchen tap and 36 and 72 min in the service line respectively this data confirms that inter use time in the service line is not representative of the long stagnations occurring upstream at the kitchen tap it is noteworthy that a 0 45 min inter use in the service line is not necessarily indicative of a full flushing of the lsl every 0 45 min as it is dependent on the volume of water drawn for each use monitoring water consumption revealed that the volumes drawn at the kitchen tap are typically very small with 3 l consumed per use 92 of the time and 1 l 50 of the time fig 7 in comparison the volume drawn in the service line per use is 1 l 19 of the time and 3 l 46 of the time moreover volumes of 6 12 l are drawn in approximately 30 of consumption events in the service line corresponding to toilet flushing whereas 22 l are drawn in about 6 of consumption use events corresponding to a shower or to a washer cycle therefore larger volumes extracted from the service line would not necessarily correspond to drinking water use at the kitchen tap in summary small volumes 3 l are typically consumed at the kitchen tap and to a lesser degree from the service line the water volumes per use are smaller than the piping volumes reported in single family homes used in the present study table s1 deshommes et al 2016b reported also that between 7 7 l median and 16 l 90th percentile would be required to flush the premise plumbing and the service line in single family homes in the same system as such the long inter use stagnation times measured at the kitchen tap and the small volumes of water consumed at the tap per use can explain why samples collected after long stagnations at the kitchen tap are close to exposure prop results and much higher than 5 mf results finally the sequence of water use in households e g kitchen tap used before after the toilet is flushed and the location of the kitchen tap in relation to the other taps of the household can also explain the elevated wlls at the tap using proportional sampling the households monitored in this system typically have a kitchen tap at the back of the house consequently if the kitchen tap is the first tap to be used after a long stagnation water with elevated wlls will be brought upstream of the kitchen tap and not flushed even if other taps are subsequently used within the house the small volumes of water drawn at the kitchen tap reflect the short durations of consumption events at the kitchen tap according to fig 8 the mean consumption duration is around 18 s while the 90th percentile is 34 s moreover 96 of the consumption events last less than 1 min and one half of these last less than 10 s considering an average flow rate of 7 l min at the kitchen tap a usage event that lasts 10 s or approximately 1 min would result in water volumes of 1 l and 7 l respectively thereby corroborating the water volume data discussed above finally only 0 26 of the consumption events last at least 5 min consistent with wll underestimation using 5 mf sampling fig 3 these results provide evidence that the 5 mf sampling protocol is inadequate to represent true exposure as it rarely corresponds to a consumption event at the kitchen tap figs 6 and 8 3 5 impact of sampling protocols on the estimation of blls in young children putative blls of young children 0 7 year old were modeled using the wlls measured through prop 30ms1 30ms2 6hs rdt and 5 mf samplings fig 9 the ieubk model was used to calculate blls although these regulatory sampling protocols are not designed to estimate consumers exposure they have been used for this purpose since proportional sampling results are challenging to obtain deshommes et al 2013 2016a zartarian et al 2018 it is therefore important to understand the extent to which blls modeled using wlls derived from standardized samplings would compare to blls from proportional sampling children drinking tap water as opposed to bottled water consume approximately 0 742 0 910 l of tap water per day values used to estimate blls deshommes et al 2013 european commission 2011 jones et al 2006 the arithmetic mean and the 90th percentile of wlls for each sampling protocol are considered to provide household estimates of wlls the bll from environmental sources other than tap water are predicted to result in a geometric mean gm of 1 1 μg dl 0 0 with blls 5 μg dl fig 9a when the contribution of tap water to exposure is added in the model the gm bll increases to 2 7 μg dl and 3 4 μg dl considering the mean and 90th percentile wll respectively and the proportion of blls 5 μg dl rise to 9 1 and 20 respectively as proportional sampling is most likely to represent true exposure the contribution of wlls is expected to increase gm of the bll by 1 6 2 3 μg dl in households with a lsl consistent with the sampling results blls modeled using rdt concentrations fit well with the blls modeled with proportional sampling while those modeled with 6hs sampling overestimate the blls by 0 4 1 μg dl and the fraction of children with a bll 5 μg dl by 7 18 modeling with mean or 90th percentile water lead levels from 30ms to 5 mf samplings underestimated the blls modeled using proportional sampling 0 8 1 0 μg dl difference in bll with 90th percentile values and the fraction of children estimated with a bll 5 μg dl fig 9b it is therefore important to carefully consider the use of wlls derived from regulated sampling protocols for bll modeling and to interpret the ieubk results cautiously the present study estimated the gm of blls to be 2 7 μg dl based on mean wlls measured by proportional sampling this is significant considering that the new cdc reference bll is 5 μg dl an earlier epidemiological study on children between the ages of 1 6 years old living in montreal households with a lsl reported a gm of bll to be 1 5 μg dl levallois et al 2013 the discrepancy between the levallois et al 2013 study and the data presented here may be due to seasonality the previous study conducted during the winter season when wlls are at their lowest furthermore sampling was mainly conducted in multi unit households where the exposure is lower than in single family homes deshommes et al 2013 2016b ngueta et al 2014 moreover the mean daily intake of tap water by children was considered to be 0 295 0 385 l day in the 2013 study as some children among the population studied were not drinking exclusively tap water using the lower water consumption values from levallois et al 2013 the ieubk model estimates the gm of the bll to be 1 7 μg dl fig s4 corroborating the previously reported blls increasing the consumption of tap water is now a major public health initiative to prevent obesity as such it is important to consider increasing tap water consumption rates when determining blls 3 6 implications for decision makers this study provides insights on how wlls determined by regulatory sampling methods compare to those measured through proportional sampling we also investigated the ability of regulatory sampling considering a 5 or a 10 μg l reference level to detect households at risk of lead exposure i e prop sample exceeding the current health based value of 10 μg l at the kitchen tap the limitations to the present study are as follows i the number of households monitored and samples collected are relatively small ii the water usage patterns and wlls were not always monitored in the same households and during the same seasons and iii the distribution system studied did not have corrosion control nevertheless the data gathered from this work provide evidence that water usage patterns are determinant factors on wlls and that rdt and 6hs sampling protocols are better predictors of consumer exposure compared to other regulatory sampling protocols in contrast to rdt and 6hs the 5 mf and 30ms protocols require flushing prior to sampling the 5 mf grossly underestimated exposure at the tap and therefore should not be used to determine wlls the hong kong public inquiry on excess lead in tap water recently issued a stark reprimand stating that use of a flushed protocol is inadequate providing a false sense of public protection coi and hong kong government 2016 the 30ms1 or 30ms2 protocols underestimated the mean weekly wlls in households with a lsl which contradicts prior findings of european investigations conducted in the 90 s hoekstra et al 2009 we attribute the different trends to varying water usage patterns at the kitchen tap which does not include a full flushing typically long stagnations 30 min and small volumes drawn per use were observed at the kitchen tap any form of pre flushing before sampling limits capturing of the lsl contribution to wlls grevatt 2016 katner et al 2016 in contrast the 90th percentile from 30ms sampling was close to the mean weekly wll determined by proportional sampling therefore a 30ms regulated sampling used with a reference 90th percentile action level could be considered as protective throughout the distribution system the timing of the rdt sampling should ideally be random throughout the day which may prove a challenge if sampling is conducted by utility personnel since sampling can only be performed when homeowners are available in this study homeowners were asked to collect the rdt samples at the time they were drinking water we purposefully did not issue any guidance on how to proceed before or after the sampling although sample collection by homeowners may not appear desirable for quality control reasons it may better represent the random nature of exposure at the tap the 6hs sampling according to the current lcr overestimated mean weekly exposure in households with and without a lsl this was explained in part by the stable contribution of lead from premise plumbing observed with profile sampling regardless of stagnation duration combined with the random contribution of the lsl to the wlls at the tap the 6hs sampling protocol with no pre flush was not meant to provide an estimate of exposure but was selected to determine if corrosion control and other protective actions must be initiated to lower wlls because the system is not flushed before stagnation this type of sampling may catch elevated wlls from the premise plumbing and service line depending on prior water usage in the household indeed the flint mi crisis demonstrated that flushing prior to stagnation significantly decreases first draw wlls after extended stagnation in this system the 6hs protocol was found to be protective however utilities do not endorse this protocol as it is difficult to recruit participants and ensure that the protocol is applied correctly grevatt 2016 katner et al 2016 finally the national drinking water advisory council report and recent european directives have opted for protocols that provide some assessment of exposure and allow for the detection of households with elevated wlls in agreement with recent recommendations rdt sampling was most suited to determine overall lead exposure in the households monitored in this study however the 30ms protocol despite underestimating exposure in this case offers greater potential to identify sources of lead and treatment efficacy at the household level dwi 2001 epa ndwac 2015 european commission 2018 hoekstra et al 2009 4 conclusion this study provides insights on the ability of sampling protocols to measure lead exposure different trends were identified by water use monitoring when the stagnation time between water use events volume and use patterns are taken into account the following key messages were concluded as a result of the study stagnation times at the kitchen tap were elevated and the volumes drawn were much smaller than anticipated resulting in high water age and high mean wlls the 30ms sampling 1st and 2nd liter underestimated lead exposure especially in households with lsls the 90th percentile wlls calculated using this sampling protocol would however be protective as would the use of a lower reference level 5 μg l the 5 mf sampling protocol should not be used as it severely underestimates exposure and cannot identify households at risk of elevated lead at the tap the 6hs sampling without prior flushing overestimated the mean weekly consumer exposure in a group of lsl households by approximately 29 it provided a wider range of exposure wlls in the households studied reflecting a wide range of stagnation periods prior to sampling the 6hs sampling can be considered protective for the consumer although it is known to be difficult to implement in practice mean wlls from rdt sampling in the households monitored were the closest to mean weekly exposure wlls measured by proportional sampling this is consistent with prior studies showing its ability to provide a system wide evaluation of compliance and exposure however it may not provide a good estimate at the household level unless repeated because of the method s inherent variability caused by the range of stagnation periods prior to sampling the wlls measured in households without a lsl confirmed a significant contribution from the solders and brass fittings to wlls and exposure considering the absence of a safe threshold of exposure to wlls corrosion control may be justified even in some systems without a lsl more sampling protocol comparisons including proportional sampling are needed to validate findings in various systems with different water qualities moreover additional monitoring of the water usage patterns at the kitchen tap while simultaneously monitoring wlls s highly desirable declaration of interests

daytime samples provided mean wlls closest to true exposure in the households monitored overall compared to other sampling protocols strikingly mean wlls after 5 min of flushing underestimated lead exposure by 47 supporting these observations water usage patterns revealed that full flushing only occurs in 3 4 of usage events within the service line and in 0 26 at the tap the time between usage events in the service line was approximately 30 min but the 30 min protocol tended to slightly underestimate wlls these differences were explained by flushing prior to the 30 min stagnation sampling which limited the contribution of the lsl to wlls furthermore the average stagnation at the kitchen time was 106 min and usage events rarely exceeded the water volume within premise plumbing 1 1 l mean wlls after 6 h of stagnation without flushing overestimated exposure by 29 but provided a conservative indicator of wlls of exposure keywords lead exposure regulatory sampling proportional tap mean exposure at the tap water consumption patterns 1 introduction the neurotoxic effects of lead are most pronounced in young children pregnant women and fetuses jusko et al 2008 a blood lead level bll of 5 μg dl is the current reference level considered to be high relative to the general population however blls 5 μg dl can contribute to the decline of children s iq scores and cause delayed neuro behavioral development health canada 2013 drinking water remains a significant source of lead exposure in households with lead service lines lsls lead solders and brass fittings brown et al 2011 hanna attisha et al 2016 regardless of the sampling protocol used for evaluating water lead levels wlls in households the reference wll at the tap is typically set at 10 μg l which at the time of its definition corresponded to a health based level calculated considering formula fed infants and past reference blood lead level bll threshold of 10 μg dl considering that i reference wlls are based on their potential impact on children s health blls ii regulated sampling protocols may not accurately provide wlls representative of exposure and that ii wlls measured through regulated sampling have been used in the us to quantify the contribution of tap water to blls zartarian et al 2018 it appears essential that decision makers can confidently extrapolate true exposure to lead using wlls regulated sampling protocols used to measure wlls vary between countries and regions for example wlls are measured using the first draw after at least 6 h of stagnation without a pre flush in the united states according to the lead and copper rule lcr usepa 2007 in ontario canada the first 2 l after 30 min stagnation preceded by flushing are used to measure wlls government of ontario 2002 while the legislation in both quebec canada mddelcc 2014 and australia as nzs 56 667 5 1998 require 2 5 min of flushing prior to collection finally a random daytime rdt 1 l sample without pre set stagnation is prescribed across europe and was recently recommended by health canada european commission 2003 2015 health canada 2017 these protocols can be used to meet various sampling objectives such as estimating exposure confirming compliance verifying corrosion control efficacy and detecting lead sources in contrast to the aforementioned sampling protocols proportional sampling involves fitting specialized taps to kitchen faucets thereby diverting a portion of the flow to a sample bottle over a period of about one week van den hoven and slaats 2006 because the european drinking water directive calls specifically for a protocol that is indicative of weekly customer exposure at the tap official journal of the european communities 1998 large field studies completed in the 90 s compared wlls from rdt sampling after 30 min of stagnation and after 5 min of flushing to those measured by proportional composite sampling hoekstra et al 2009 van den hoven and slaats 2006 based on results in seven countries they concluded that the 30 min stagnation protocol provided estimates closest to mean weekly wlls as measured by proportional tap sampling the rdt slightly overestimated mean weekly wlls but was only accurate if a larger number of samples were collected the likelihood of water with elevated lead reaching the tap is determined by water usage patterns and plumbing configuration plumbing configuration and the origin of the water within the distribution system prior to sampling lsl or premise plumbing have been shown to affect wlls at the tap deshommes et al 2016b the type of household single vs multiple dwellings also strongly influence the risk of exposure to elevated wlls deshommes et al 2013 levallois et al 2013 ngueta et al 2014 clement et al 2000 conducted proportional tap sampling in nine french households to evaluate daily lead intakes they report that the variability in wlls results was highly dependent on the household consumption habits and the plumbing configuration in the u s and parts of canada drinking water consumption patterns revealed that 19 of the water is used at faucets 43 of which corresponds to cold water wrf 2016 water consumption patterns are highly variable and depend on different factors such as the size of the houses monitored the number of inhabitants the season etc consumption peaks i e during weekends and holidays typically occur after long stagnations xue et al 2017 although stagnation time in lsls is known to impact wlls stagnation upflow of the kitchen tap may also play an important role on lead exposure but has not yet been investigated as lead standards become more stringent there is a need to determine which sampling protocols can actually provide a reliable estimate of mean wlls of exposure at the tap the concept of an acceptable household exposure level at the tap has gained support although proportional sampling is undoubtedly the gold standard to estimate true exposure at the tap it is only feasible as a research tool therefore there is an urgent need to establish which protocols can provide a reliable estimate to guide revised sampling requirements proportional tap investigations conducted in the 90 s in europe are unlikely to be representative of current north american consumption patterns and of exposure to lead at the tap furthermore the 6 h first draw sampling used in the u s has never been compared to proportional tap results to address these knowledge gaps the main objectives of this project are to 1 apply proportional sampling to evaluate mean weekly wlls at the tap of north american households with and without a lsl and 2 compare the mean weekly exposure estimates to wlls measured using regulatory sampling protocols to determine if these protocols can effectively protect consumers as a secondary objective we monitored water use dynamics in households by comparing water use drawn in the service line and at the kitchen tap volumes and stagnation times and relating it to the wlls measured at the tap as elevated wlls are driven by stagnation in the lsls it is important to understand how these elevated wlls can be transported to the kitchen tap 2 materials and methods 2 1 households sampled and monitoring periods twenty nine households were monitored in montreal canada between june 2017 and july 2018 about 53 000 households built before 1970 are supplied with water with a public side lsl in this distribution system 2018 estimation the average ph and alkalinity of the distributed water are 8 0 and 90 mg caco3 l respectively single family homes built prior to 1970 were selected as they have a high probability of presence of a lsl and constitute the most at risk households for lead exposure deshommes et al 2013 2016b moreover it is much easier to implement use restrictions to ensure controlled stagnation with a single household connected to the lsl wlls at the tap n 7 households or drinking water consumption patterns n 8 households or both wlls and drinking water patterns n 14 households were monitored table s1 in supporting information si out of the 21 households monitored for wlls 14 were served by a lsl while 83 of the samples 376 454 were collected in the summer 15 c 17 of the samples 78 454 were collected during winter 0 15 c the summer season was targeted for sampling wlls considering the higher wlls in this system at warm temperatures deshommes et al 2013 within the 22 households monitored for drinking water consumption patterns 11 were monitored in the summer june september and the remaining 11 in the fall and winter table s1 during the first visit to each household a profile sampling consisting of collecting at least 8 consecutive liters of water after 30 min stagnation and a detailed premise plumbing evaluation length and volume of piping were performed as described in deshommes et al 2016b to establish the presence of a lsl also we verified the compatibility of the proportional sampling tap with the kitchen tap in the household 2 2 water lead level sampling fig 1 presents a schematic of the proportional sampling tap designed for this study it consists of a special pvc faucet splitting the water flow into two outlets one of the outlets is a typical kitchen tap containing a stainless steel aerator calibrated to provide 95 of the flow to be used by the consumer as usual the second outlet receives 5 of the flow that is discharged to a 5 l sampling bottle through plastic tubing a manual shutdown valve was installed on the tubing connecting the proportional tap to the sampling bottle so that water used for dish or hand washing was not sampled an aerator screen was installed at the device inlet prior to flow splitting to retain particles two 5 l sampling bottles were provided per week the typical flow rate at the kitchen tap was 4 8 l min during sampling the proportional tap was installed for one to 2 weeks at the kitchen tap used for drinking water or cooking participants were asked not to modify their consumption habits during the study and to open the manual valve leading to the proportional tap sampling bottle when using water for drinking or cooking in addition to proportional tap sampling n 2 to 4 composite samples for two weeks of participation the following 1 l samples were collected at the kitchen tap first draw samples after at least 6 h stagnation with no pre flush 6hs two consecutive samples after 30 min stagnation preceded by 5 min of flushing 30ms1 30ms2 samples after 5 min of flushing 5 mf and random daytime samples rdt the 30ms1 30ms2 and 5 mf samples were collected by the project team during the first visit and at the beginning of each sampling week i e n 2 for one week n 3 for two weeks for each sample type the 6hs n 1 per week and rdt samples n 2 per week as defined in this study were collected by the participant to whom tutorial documents and a support phone number were provided the rdt samples were collected at different time points over the week corresponding to drinking water consumption periods samples were collected in wide neck polypropylene bottles prewashed with nitric acid for metals sampling the bottles were then acidified with 0 5 nitric acid for at least 24 h and analyzed for total metals with icp ms according to the usepa 200 8 method in order to assess the contribution of the different parts of household piping to wlls additional profiles were completed by collecting 10 12 consecutive liters at the kitchen tap of two households after 1 2 4 and 6 h of stagnation preceded by a 5 min pre flush as opposed to the 6hs 1 l sample that was collected without a pre flush flushing prior to stagnation provides a clearer estimate of the relative contribution of the premise plumbing and lsl to the wll if pre flushing is conducted the 1st liter collected after 6 h stagnation represents the contribution of the piping immediately upstream of the faucet and the background contribution from the lsl during flow grevatt 2016 katner et al 2016 conversely a 6hs 1st draw with no pre flush includes an additional random contribution from the lsl and or premise plumbing depending on water use prior to stagnation 2 3 online monitoring of water consumption water drawn from the service line and used at the kitchen tap were monitored using two devices the first device was a data logger thermometer or temperature sensor model rdx l4sd omega the electrode of the device is fixed to the outer pipe surface and records temperature variations measurements were taken at 5 s intervals temperature sensors were installed on the service line and on the cold water piping immediately upstream of the kitchen tap when the piping was accessible and in the presence of a power outlet fig 2 the second device was an ultrasonic transit time flowmeter externally mounted on 0 5 in or 0 75 in copper pipes models fdt 31 c and fdt 32 c respectively omega the flowmeter required space around the pipe and was designed for specific diameters which limited its installation to a few households table s1 measurements were taken at 1 s intervals the stagnation periods and water volumes used at the tap or in the service line were provided by the flowmeters which in turn were used to calibrate the temperature sensor readings an excel vba macro was developed to analyze the temperature sensors data and to automatically display stagnation times for the entire monitoring period fig 2 fig s1 the vba macro processed data were validated in the laboratory in the field and using an ansys thermodynamic study as detailed in the supporting information si given that data processing by the temperature sensor is challenging in summer consumption data collected using this device were mainly gathered during the beginning and the end of summer june and september fall and winter see si for details 2 4 integrated exposure uptake biokinetic ieubk modeling the blls of 0 7 year old children were determined using the ieubk model with adjusted input parameters for soil dust air and diet and a water intake of 0 742 0 910 l day deshommes et al 2018 similarly to deshommes et al 2018 complementary modeling was performed using lower daily water intakes of 0 285 0 385 l day to represent the overall population of children using a distribution system that drink small to large volumes of tap water the geometric mean gm of blls and the fraction of children with blls exceeding 5 μg dl were estimated using the mean and the 90th percentile wlls measured with each sampling protocol in the households 3 results and discussion 3 1 exposure to lead in water measured through regulatory sampling fig 3 presents the wlls measured using proportional prop and regulatory sampling protocols in households with or without a lsl depending on the sampling protocol mean wlls range from 5 5 to 14 μg l in households with a lsl fig 3a in contrast mean wlls in households not serviced by a lsl are between 1 0 and 3 8 μg l for both types of households the highest wlls were measured using 6hs first draw samples after 6 h stagnation with no pre flush rdt random daytime and prop sampling while the lowest wlls were measured after 5 mf 5 min of flushing sampling the 10th 90th percentile of wlls in households with a lsl are 4 3 17 1 μg l and 6 2 22 1 μg l measured by rdt and 6hs sampling respectively the 5 mf 30ms1 first sample after a 30 min stagnation preceded by 5 min of flushing and 30ms2 second sample after a 30 min stagnation preceded by 5 min of flushing samplings were less variable with 10th 90th percentiles of 2 1 8 6 3 4 10 2 and 3 5 10 2 μg l as flushing helps to produce repeatable results cartier et al 2011 van den hoven and slaats 2006 water lead levels measured by proportional sampling of households with a lsl were less variable relative to those measured by 6hs and rdt sampling proportional samples are a combination of the more reproducible 30ms and 5 mf samples in addition to the random contribution of the lsl in the sampling represented by rdt and 6hs sampling indeed the two latter sampling protocols would measure a larger variability in wlls considering variable consumption habits and plumbing configurations between households in households with a lsl fig 3a the mean wll measured with the proportional tap is 10 5 μg l and the 10th 90th percentile values range from 6 2 to 15 4 μg l the wlls detected using rdt sampling are quite close to prop sampling results with mean wlls of 10 4 μg l 0 1 μg l difference and 10th 90th percentile values of 4 3 17 1 μg l 1 7 1 9 μg l difference the minimum mean weekly wll measured in a household with a lsl was found to be 4 9 μg l in fact almost all wlls measured by prop sampling in households with a lsl exceeded the new canadian recommendation of 5 μg l in households without a lsl the wlls measured by 30ms2 are especially low as compared to results from other sampling protocols fig 3b this trend is not observed in households with a lsl as water after the 1st liter may originate from the lsl containing higher wll than premise plumbing as a consequence the 2nd liter typically presents higher wlls as compared to the 1st liter in lsl households deshommes et al 2016b although the mean wlls of 3 3 μg l measured by proportional sampling in households without a lsl was lower than in households with a lsl it still approaches the new proposed threshold of 5 μg l notably one of the household without a lsl reached up to 9 1 μg l exceeding mean weekly concentrations in some lsl households such wlls indicate a significant contribution of lead from the premise plumbing one out of the seven kitchen taps presented systematically high wlls in the first liter collected after 30ms 31 3 μg l or 6hs 63 μg l indicating a large contribution from the faucet and its immediate piping connection after stagnation the contribution of premise plumbing to wlls in this system was investigated using rdt and high flow rate sampling and indicated a significant but sporadic contribution of particulate lead from solders and brass fitting fixtures deshommes et al 2010 the wlls were however typically lower in households without a lsl as compared to households with a lsl deshommes et al 2013 levallois et al 2013 observations in this study suggest a significant background exposure to lead from multiple sources in premise plumbing even in households without a lsl extended stagnation upstream of the kitchen tap will promote lead leaching from premise plumbing remediating this lead release could be achieved through the removal of lead containing materials brass solders etc the implementation of corrosion control complementing lsl replacement and as a temporary solution flushing of the premise plumbing before consumption proportional sampling is considered to be the best estimate of true lead exposure the mean wlls from 30ms samples in households with a lsl tends to underestimate prop wlls by 16 30ms2 to 25 30ms1 as opposed to 6hs samples that overestimate them by 29 fig 3 the mean wlls derived from rdt sampling is equal to that from prop 0 8 while 5 mf sampling results are drastically lower 47 wilcoxon matched pairs tests comparing one by one the households paired wlls prop vs regulated sampling protocol partly confirm these trends as wlls measured after 5 mf 30ms1 and 30ms2 are significantly lower than wlls from proportional sampling p 0 05 in the same household conversely wlls derived from rdt or 6hs 1 l samples were similar to prop wlls p 0 05 suggesting therefore that these samples are closer to exposure the trends for rdt and 5 mf samplings are consistent with previous reports hoekstra et al 2009 van den hoven and slaats 2006 however these authors found that 30ms1 and 30ms2 sampling results were correlated to proportional sampling results r2 0 50 0 63 correlations between prop and other sampling results in the same households with and without a lsl were investigated as in the european studies and are presented in si proportional sampling results in our study were weakly correlated to rdt 6hs and 30ms2 results r2 0 20 0 29 compared to 5 mf and 30ms1 results r2 0 45 0 53 fig s2 these weak correlations were attributed to the relatively small number of samples collected and households sampled indeed the present study sampled 21 households n 34 72 paired samples 1 3 samples per sampling protocol per household in contrast the european study used 294 households n 294 paired samples 3 samples per sampling protocol per household the improved correlation for 5 mf and 30ms1 samples in our study may be explained by their intrinsic higher repeatability because of the constancy of their application flow through 5 mf or fixed duration of stagnation 30ms with pre flush other factors explaining the differences observed in the present study and the european ones include differences in location specific water use patterns changes to drinking water consumption habits over years and premise plumbing configurations single family homes in our study vs all types of households 3 2 fraction of samples exceeding wlls of 5 or 10 μg l when considering the value of various sampling protocols several factors should be considered their ability to estimate true exposure in a single household avoiding false negatives but also the ability to evaluate system wide compliance to target wlls this in turn helps direct consumer protection interventions in the present study the fraction of samples exceeding the 10 μg l health based wll standard or the new recommended level of 5 μg l can be seen on fig 4 excluding the three spikes from one problematic tap in one household wlls never exceeded 10 μg l in households without a lsl regardless of the sampling protocol used in contrast up to 63 of the samples collected after stagnation exceeded 10 μg l in households with a lsl as expected all samples collected after 5 mf were below 10 μg l even when a lsl was present it must be noted that flushed samples are collected to assess compliance in canada and australia only 1 16 of the 30ms samples 1st and 2nd liter exceeded 10 μg l in lsl households higher fractions of samples exceeded 10 μg l with other protocols 46 using rdt 63 using 6hs and 47 using proportional sampling excluding 5 mf results 6 32 of the samples depending on the sampling protocol used collected in households without a lsl exceeded a wll of 5 μg l interestingly 30ms sampling produced similar results to prop 7 while rdt 32 and 6hs 30 sampling showed a higher exceedance rate the differences between households with and without lsls may be attributed to the significant contribution of lead by faucets and the immediate connecting piping which is better captured after extended stagnation by 6hs or rdt sampling cartier et al 2012 these observations highlight the need to remove or control the leaching of lead from all sources in premise plumbing in order to avoid high level sporadic exposure deshommes et al 2010 in houses with a lsl the samples exceeding the 5 μg l threshold wll was 62 96 regardless of sampling protocols in this case 6hs 96 and rdt 82 samplings provided assessments closest to values given by proportional sampling 94 thereby suggesting that system wide compliance is better estimated using rdt and 6hs sampling protocols in households fed by lsls finally it is important to keep in mind that our observations apply to a system without corrosion control it is likely that the differences between the sampling protocols are minimized in a system with effective corrosion control deshommes et al 2018 in this study we elected to define a household at risk of elevated lead exposure as a household with a prop wll 10 μg l the ability of a protocol to detect specific households at risk for lead exposure as opposed to system wide exposure can therefore be assessed by verifying if this protocol and its corresponding reference level e g maximum acceptable concentration are able to detect households with weekly mean exposure prop 10 μg l if a 5 μg l reference level is used the regulated sampling protocols under investigation were able to identify households with a mean weekly wll i e prop 10 μg l 92 100 of the time table s2 the number of false positives regulatory sample 5 μg l when prop is 10 μg l varies between 25 5 mf to 91 92 rdt and 6hs it is approximately 50 for 30ms samplings the number of false negatives is quite low and constant for all protocols regulatory sample 5 μg l and prop is 10 μg l and is approximately 8 except for the 6hs first draw sampling for which there were no false negatives recorded table s2 consequently lowering the reference threshold of current regulated sampling protocols from 10 to 5 μg l would increase the identification of households at risk of high lead exposure i e prop 10 μg l 3 3 contribution of the lead service line to water lead levels as shown on fig 3 wlls measured using rdt or 6hs first draw sampling present more variability than other protocols this is expected as these wlls are representative of a wider range of stagnation durations water age is determined by the water use in the home prior to sample collection rdt or prior to the determined stagnation period 6hs furthermore 6hs sampling without any pre flush includes a random contribution from the lsl and premise plumbing and a local contribution from the piping immediately upstream of the kitchen tap grevatt 2016 katner et al 2016 to quantify the actual contribution of the lsl in 6hs samples profiles were collected after 1 2 4 and 6 h of stagnation preceded by 5 min flushing in two households fig 5 a and b according to these profiles and pipe volume measurements in both households it was possible to determine the wlls within premise plumbing and the lsl fig 5c and fig s3 clearly the contributions of the lsl during flow and premise plumbing to wlls are stable after 1 2 4 or 6 h of stagnation in this system 11 13 μg l while the contribution of the lsl increases with increasing stagnation resulting in wlls ranging from 45 to 80 μg l fig 5c consequently a 6hs sampling collected without prior flushing would include the contribution of the premise piping after 6 h stagnation approximately 11 13 μg l as well as a contribution from the lsl which would vary between 5 5 μg l mean wll after 5 mf i e background flushed wlls to 80 μg l mean wll from the lsl after 6hs the lsl contribution may increase depending on the water use prior to stagnation the variability of plumbing configurations and water usage patterns is consistent with rdt and 6hs results being closest to the proportional sampling results in this study as compared to other sampling protocols tested 3 4 drinking water consumption patterns the time between each water usage event and the volume of water consumed per usage event were monitored at the kitchen tap and in the service line to support the interpretation of wlls measured through proportional sampling fig 6 and fig 7 overall inter use stagnation times at the kitchen tap are typically less than 45 min 68 of events and 47 of these stagnation events are less than 15 min these short stagnations are even more frequent in the service line as 60 of the stagnation times are less than 15 min while 21 last 15 45 min fig 6a however stagnations 6 h are relatively frequent at the kitchen tap 10 of the stagnation events compared to the service line 2 of the events consistent with this mean and 90th percentile values of inter use stagnations are 106 min 1 76 h and 394 min 6 57 h at the kitchen tap and 36 and 72 min in the service line respectively this data confirms that inter use time in the service line is not representative of the long stagnations occurring upstream at the kitchen tap it is noteworthy that a 0 45 min inter use in the service line is not necessarily indicative of a full flushing of the lsl every 0 45 min as it is dependent on the volume of water drawn for each use monitoring water consumption revealed that the volumes drawn at the kitchen tap are typically very small with 3 l consumed per use 92 of the time and 1 l 50 of the time fig 7 in comparison the volume drawn in the service line per use is 1 l 19 of the time and 3 l 46 of the time moreover volumes of 6 12 l are drawn in approximately 30 of consumption events in the service line corresponding to toilet flushing whereas 22 l are drawn in about 6 of consumption use events corresponding to a shower or to a washer cycle therefore larger volumes extracted from the service line would not necessarily correspond to drinking water use at the kitchen tap in summary small volumes 3 l are typically consumed at the kitchen tap and to a lesser degree from the service line the water volumes per use are smaller than the piping volumes reported in single family homes used in the present study table s1 deshommes et al 2016b reported also that between 7 7 l median and 16 l 90th percentile would be required to flush the premise plumbing and the service line in single family homes in the same system as such the long inter use stagnation times measured at the kitchen tap and the small volumes of water consumed at the tap per use can explain why samples collected after long stagnations at the kitchen tap are close to exposure prop results and much higher than 5 mf results finally the sequence of water use in households e g kitchen tap used before after the toilet is flushed and the location of the kitchen tap in relation to the other taps of the household can also explain the elevated wlls at the tap using proportional sampling the households monitored in this system typically have a kitchen tap at the back of the house consequently if the kitchen tap is the first tap to be used after a long stagnation water with elevated wlls will be brought upstream of the kitchen tap and not flushed even if other taps are subsequently used within the house the small volumes of water drawn at the kitchen tap reflect the short durations of consumption events at the kitchen tap according to fig 8 the mean consumption duration is around 18 s while the 90th percentile is 34 s moreover 96 of the consumption events last less than 1 min and one half of these last less than 10 s considering an average flow rate of 7 l min at the kitchen tap a usage event that lasts 10 s or approximately 1 min would result in water volumes of 1 l and 7 l respectively thereby corroborating the water volume data discussed above finally only 0 26 of the consumption events last at least 5 min consistent with wll underestimation using 5 mf sampling fig 3 these results provide evidence that the 5 mf sampling protocol is inadequate to represent true exposure as it rarely corresponds to a consumption event at the kitchen tap figs 6 and 8 3 5 impact of sampling protocols on the estimation of blls in young children putative blls of young children 0 7 year old were modeled using the wlls measured through prop 30ms1 30ms2 6hs rdt and 5 mf samplings fig 9 the ieubk model was used to calculate blls although these regulatory sampling protocols are not designed to estimate consumers exposure they have been used for this purpose since proportional sampling results are challenging to obtain deshommes et al 2013 2016a zartarian et al 2018 it is therefore important to understand the extent to which blls modeled using wlls derived from standardized samplings would compare to blls from proportional sampling children drinking tap water as opposed to bottled water consume approximately 0 742 0 910 l of tap water per day values used to estimate blls deshommes et al 2013 european commission 2011 jones et al 2006 the arithmetic mean and the 90th percentile of wlls for each sampling protocol are considered to provide household estimates of wlls the bll from environmental sources other than tap water are predicted to result in a geometric mean gm of 1 1 μg dl 0 0 with blls 5 μg dl fig 9a when the contribution of tap water to exposure is added in the model the gm bll increases to 2 7 μg dl and 3 4 μg dl considering the mean and 90th percentile wll respectively and the proportion of blls 5 μg dl rise to 9 1 and 20 respectively as proportional sampling is most likely to represent true exposure the contribution of wlls is expected to increase gm of the bll by 1 6 2 3 μg dl in households with a lsl consistent with the sampling results blls modeled using rdt concentrations fit well with the blls modeled with proportional sampling while those modeled with 6hs sampling overestimate the blls by 0 4 1 μg dl and the fraction of children with a bll 5 μg dl by 7 18 modeling with mean or 90th percentile water lead levels from 30ms to 5 mf samplings underestimated the blls modeled using proportional sampling 0 8 1 0 μg dl difference in bll with 90th percentile values and the fraction of children estimated with a bll 5 μg dl fig 9b it is therefore important to carefully consider the use of wlls derived from regulated sampling protocols for bll modeling and to interpret the ieubk results cautiously the present study estimated the gm of blls to be 2 7 μg dl based on mean wlls measured by proportional sampling this is significant considering that the new cdc reference bll is 5 μg dl an earlier epidemiological study on children between the ages of 1 6 years old living in montreal households with a lsl reported a gm of bll to be 1 5 μg dl levallois et al 2013 the discrepancy between the levallois et al 2013 study and the data presented here may be due to seasonality the previous study conducted during the winter season when wlls are at their lowest furthermore sampling was mainly conducted in multi unit households where the exposure is lower than in single family homes deshommes et al 2013 2016b ngueta et al 2014 moreover the mean daily intake of tap water by children was considered to be 0 295 0 385 l day in the 2013 study as some children among the population studied were not drinking exclusively tap water using the lower water consumption values from levallois et al 2013 the ieubk model estimates the gm of the bll to be 1 7 μg dl fig s4 corroborating the previously reported blls increasing the consumption of tap water is now a major public health initiative to prevent obesity as such it is important to consider increasing tap water consumption rates when determining blls 3 6 implications for decision makers this study provides insights on how wlls determined by regulatory sampling methods compare to those measured through proportional sampling we also investigated the ability of regulatory sampling considering a 5 or a 10 μg l reference level to detect households at risk of lead exposure i e prop sample exceeding the current health based value of 10 μg l at the kitchen tap the limitations to the present study are as follows i the number of households monitored and samples collected are relatively small ii the water usage patterns and wlls were not always monitored in the same households and during the same seasons and iii the distribution system studied did not have corrosion control nevertheless the data gathered from this work provide evidence that water usage patterns are determinant factors on wlls and that rdt and 6hs sampling protocols are better predictors of consumer exposure compared to other regulatory sampling protocols in contrast to rdt and 6hs the 5 mf and 30ms protocols require flushing prior to sampling the 5 mf grossly underestimated exposure at the tap and therefore should not be used to determine wlls the hong kong public inquiry on excess lead in tap water recently issued a stark reprimand stating that use of a flushed protocol is inadequate providing a false sense of public protection coi and hong kong government 2016 the 30ms1 or 30ms2 protocols underestimated the mean weekly wlls in households with a lsl which contradicts prior findings of european investigations conducted in the 90 s hoekstra et al 2009 we attribute the different trends to varying water usage patterns at the kitchen tap which does not include a full flushing typically long stagnations 30 min and small volumes drawn per use were observed at the kitchen tap any form of pre flushing before sampling limits capturing of the lsl contribution to wlls grevatt 2016 katner et al 2016 in contrast the 90th percentile from 30ms sampling was close to the mean weekly wll determined by proportional sampling therefore a 30ms regulated sampling used with a reference 90th percentile action level could be considered as protective throughout the distribution system the timing of the rdt sampling should ideally be random throughout the day which may prove a challenge if sampling is conducted by utility personnel since sampling can only be performed when homeowners are available in this study homeowners were asked to collect the rdt samples at the time they were drinking water we purposefully did not issue any guidance on how to proceed before or after the sampling although sample collection by homeowners may not appear desirable for quality control reasons it may better represent the random nature of exposure at the tap the 6hs sampling according to the current lcr overestimated mean weekly exposure in households with and without a lsl this was explained in part by the stable contribution of lead from premise plumbing observed with profile sampling regardless of stagnation duration combined with the random contribution of the lsl to the wlls at the tap the 6hs sampling protocol with no pre flush was not meant to provide an estimate of exposure but was selected to determine if corrosion control and other protective actions must be initiated to lower wlls because the system is not flushed before stagnation this type of sampling may catch elevated wlls from the premise plumbing and service line depending on prior water usage in the household indeed the flint mi crisis demonstrated that flushing prior to stagnation significantly decreases first draw wlls after extended stagnation in this system the 6hs protocol was found to be protective however utilities do not endorse this protocol as it is difficult to recruit participants and ensure that the protocol is applied correctly grevatt 2016 katner et al 2016 finally the national drinking water advisory council report and recent european directives have opted for protocols that provide some assessment of exposure and allow for the detection of households with elevated wlls in agreement with recent recommendations rdt sampling was most suited to determine overall lead exposure in the households monitored in this study however the 30ms protocol despite underestimating exposure in this case offers greater potential to identify sources of lead and treatment efficacy at the household level dwi 2001 epa ndwac 2015 european commission 2018 hoekstra et al 2009 4 conclusion this study provides insights on the ability of sampling protocols to measure lead exposure different trends were identified by water use monitoring when the stagnation time between water use events volume and use patterns are taken into account the following key messages were concluded as a result of the study stagnation times at the kitchen tap were elevated and the volumes drawn were much smaller than anticipated resulting in high water age and high mean wlls the 30ms sampling 1st and 2nd liter underestimated lead exposure especially in households with lsls the 90th percentile wlls calculated using this sampling protocol would however be protective as would the use of a lower reference level 5 μg l the 5 mf sampling protocol should not be used as it severely underestimates exposure and cannot identify households at risk of elevated lead at the tap the 6hs sampling without prior flushing overestimated the mean weekly consumer exposure in a group of lsl households by approximately 29 it provided a wider range of exposure wlls in the households studied reflecting a wide range of stagnation periods prior to sampling the 6hs sampling can be considered protective for the consumer although it is known to be difficult to implement in practice mean wlls from rdt sampling in the households monitored were the closest to mean weekly exposure wlls measured by proportional sampling this is consistent with prior studies showing its ability to provide a system wide evaluation of compliance and exposure however it may not provide a good estimate at the household level unless repeated because of the method s inherent variability caused by the range of stagnation periods prior to sampling the wlls measured in households without a lsl confirmed a significant contribution from the solders and brass fittings to wlls and exposure considering the absence of a safe threshold of exposure to wlls corrosion control may be justified even in some systems without a lsl more sampling protocol comparisons including proportional sampling are needed to validate findings in various systems with different water qualities moreover additional monitoring of the water usage patterns at the kitchen tap while simultaneously monitoring wlls s highly desirable declaration of interests

18913,nitrifying biologically active filters bafs have been found to be high emitters of nitrous oxide n2o a powerful greenhouse gas contributing to ozone layer depletion while recent models have greatly improved our understanding of the triggers of n2o emissions from suspended growth processes less is known about n2o emissions from full scale biofilm processes tertiary nitrifying bafs have been modeled at some occasions but considering strong simplifications on the description of gas liquid exchanges which are not appropriate for n2o prediction in this work a tertiary nitrifying baf model including the main n2o biological pathways was developed and confronted to full scale data from seine aval the largest wastewater resource recovery facility in europe a mass balance on the gaseous compounds was included in order to correctly describe the n2o gas liquid partition thus n2o emissions preliminary modifications of the model structure were made to include the gas phase as a compartment of the model which significantly affected the prediction of nitrification in particular considering gas hold up influenced the prediction of the hydraulic retention time thus nitrification performances a 3 5 gas fraction reduced ammonium removal by 13 as the liquid volume small in such systems is highly sensitive to the gas presence finally the value of the volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient was adjusted to successfully predict both nitrification and n2o emissions graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofilm full scale gas liquid transfer modelling nitrification n2o

the biological conversion of carbon ammonium and or nitrate since the early eighties they have been successfully used to treat a variety of urban and industrial wastewaters owing to their compactness flexibility and reliability bafs have been widely developed in europe especially in large urbanized areas where available space is scarce mendoza espinosa and stephenson 1999 recent monitoring campaigns suggest that nitrifying bafs are important sources of nitrous oxide n2o a potent greenhouse gas contributing to global warming and ozone depletion in china wang et al 2016 monitored nitrifying bafs over a period of 12 months and reported emissions ranging from 0 02 to 1 26 of influent total nitrogen load in france the two monitoring campaigns performed in tertiary nitrifying bafs of the seine aval plant the largest plant in europe reported higher emission factor values 1 77 of n nh4 removed in summer and 3 11 in winter bollon et al 2016 based on the results of the winter campaign authors estimated that n2o emissions contributed to almost 80 of the carbon footprint of the biological nitrogen removal stage of the plant filali et al 2017 modelling may represent a very useful tool in view of a better understanding of n2o production mechanisms and can serve to comprehend the effect of different operational conditions and define mitigation strategies to this end existing activated sludge models asm were extended to include no and n2o formation during autotrophic nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification n2o is an obligate intermediate of the heterotrophic denitrification chain and the end product of two main biological pathways by ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and archaea aoa schreiber et al 2012 in the first pathway nitrifier nitrification or nn pathway n2o is generated as a by product of incomplete oxidation of hydroxylamine nh2oh to nitrite no2 in the second pathway nitrifier denitrification or nd pathway n2o is generated upon the reduction of no2 several models have been proposed to describe either one of these pathways but failed to predict n2o emissions in contrasted conditions especially when transient conditions of dissolved oxygen do or no2 occurred spérandio et al 2016 hence recent models coupling multiple n2o pathways were proposed to describe and extrapolate the emissions for a wide broad of operating conditions a detailed review of these models can be found in the literature massara et al 2017 ni and yuan 2015 among them the model of pocquet et al 2016 which couples the two n2o biological production pathways by aobs has been validated on extensive lab scale datasets it was found able to predict n2o emissions for contrasted do and no2 conditions and also the respective contributions of nn and nd pathways to the total production of n2o lang et al 2016 on the other hand few models have been proposed to describe the behavior of nitrifying bafs bernier et al 2014 vigne et al 2010 hidaka and tsuno 2004 behrendt 1999 viotti et al 2002 they are mainly one dimensional and differ in the number of mechanisms simulated and in the level of complexity considered in their description gas liquid mass transfer of oxygen is one of the mechanisms that received the least attention probably because of the difficulty to obtain experimental data and of the lack of standardized measurement methods biofilm reactors being mass transfer limited a good representation of oxygen gas liquid mass transfer is usually essential to correctly predict nitrification performances however little is known about gas liquid mass transfer in fixed bed reactors some studies investigated the impact of operating conditions and media properties on oxygen transfer and mostly at lab or pilot scales and with a clean media bed maldonado et al 2008 leung et al 2006 pérez et al 2006 gillot et al 2005 behrendt 1999 deront et al 1998 in some occasions oxygen supply in bafs was described in a simplified manner i e assuming a constant non limiting do concentration through the filter height vigne et al 2010 viotti et al 2002 whereas in others an aeration model was considered to predict the oxygen supply variation with the airflow rate and the profiles of do throughout the filter bernier et al 2014 hidaka and tsuno 2004 however several simplifications were made the gas phase was not considered as a compartment of the reactor i e the gas volume was not included in the calculation of the working volume and the evolution of the gas phase composition was neglected if this representation of gas liquid exchanges was found sufficient to describe nitrification performances it may not be appropriate for no and n2o prediction it has to be noted that few modelling studies considered the gas phase as a compartment when describing nitrification in lab scale poughon et al 1999 and pilot scale behrendt 1999 fixed bed reactors both studies included oxygen transfer as their final objective was to investigate nitrification but provided little information about this parameter moreover n2o was not addressed in these studies and n2o emissions from full scale nitrifying bafs were never modeled so far the increasing concern about greenhouse gas emissions and the sensitivity of plant s carbon footprint to n2o emissions call for an upgrade of full plant baf models to include n2o production pathways to this aim the model proposed by bernier et al 2014 calibrated and validated on long term data from full scale tertiary nitrifying bafs of the seine aval plant was extended to describe n2o emissions monitored on this site beforehand it was necessary to assess the relevance of gas liquid transfer hypotheses for n2o prediction in this paper different successive options related to gas liquid transfer hypotheses are considered and implemented for a better description of physical characteristics of bafs and associated mass transfer gas hold up was included to estimate a gas volume the working volume was estimated considering the gas volume and a mass balance was added on the gas phase to describe the evolution of the gas phase composition their relevance is discussed and the newly developed model is evaluated by comparing modeling results with experimental data finally recommendations of experiments are provided in order to better characterize gas liquid mass transfer in full scale bafs 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental data data were collected during a 14 day measuring campaign in winter 2015 on a biostyr unit of the tertiary nitrification stage of the seine aval plant bollon et al 2016 the unitary surface was 173 m2 and the media bed composed of 4 mm polystyrene beads was 3 5 m high data used for modeling included online measurements of inlet nh4 and no3 outlet nh4 no3 do ph temperature and outlet dissolved n2o measured in the water zone above the media called the overflow one off measures of effluent no2 were also performed gas emissions were collected in the middle of the overflow with a floating hood the main operating conditions of the baf are displayed in table 1 with the estimated n2o production and emission rates the winter period was preferred to the summer period for the following reasons i the duration of the monitoring was longer ii it is characterized by a higher variability of the loading rate the temperature and the n2o gas liquid partition more details about the measurement procedure and the results can be found in bollon et al 2016 average values presented in table 1 are slightly different from the original publication as influent interruptions occurring during backwashing periods were not considered in order to avoid computational issues during these 30 min backwashing events the filter was considered to be operated at usual influent flow and concentration conditions but was characterized by a higher detachment rate of particles a detailed description of the baf reactor and model inputs are provided in appendix a 2 2 mathematical model preliminary modifications made to the model proposed by bernier et al 2014 referred as the base model were related to i the biokinetic model and ii the gas liquid transfer representation the biokinetic model was extended in order to include the main biological n2o production and consumption pathways related to nitrification and denitrification a stripping term was added on n2o and other nitrogen compounds these preliminary modifications are presented thereafter followed by the modifications made to assess the model sensitivity to gas liquid transfer hypotheses 2 2 1 biochemical and biofilm model the proposed model is based on an existing co current up flow filter model built on the simulink toolbox of matlab mathworks to describe the functioning of tertiary nitrifying biostyr filters of the seine aval plant bernier et al 2014 the main features of the base model are recalled hereafter a detailed description is provided in appendix b hydrodynamics in the baf are described by a series of seven reactors of equal volume representing the active zone where biological conversions occur each reactor is composed of a biologically inactive bulk zone composed of a gas and a liquid compartment an inert media volume and two biofilm layers fig 1 it should be noted that the gas compartment was not included in the base model the biofilm model includes soluble material diffusion biofilm growth and particular exchange between biofilm layers as well as attachment and detachment on top of this zone an additional cstr representing the overflow is implemented because it has low biomass concentrations in comparison with the underneath zone only resulting from the detachment no biofilm layer it is considered passive for simplification the 1 4 m water zone beneath the media bed was not represented in the model because i the concentration of biomass is low and ii oxygen gas liquid transfer is low considering that the influent entering this zone has a do concentration of 8 mgo2 l biokinetic reactions are computed within the two biofilm layers the model previously describing nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification as two step reactions was extended to include the main n2o pathways no and n2o were added as intermediates of heterotrophic denitrification with parameters from the original publication of hiatt and grady 2008 the two pathway model proposed by pocquet et al 2016 was included to describe n2o production by aobs sets of parameters were taken from the second case study of lang et al 2016 who worked at nh4 and no2 concentrations close to the ones measured on the seine aval plant appendix c and d present the gujer matrix of the extended model and the list of parameters respectively 2 2 2 gas liquid mass transfer model 2 2 2 1 general description of gas liquid mass transfer the base model included a gas liquid transfer equation for oxygen in each reactor in this study it was implemented for all gases considered i o2 n2o no and n2 according to eq 1 mass transfer limitations being localized at the liquid side for all gases all having a low solubility their volumetric transfer coefficient was estimated from the one of oxygen eq 2 in application of the penetration theory higbie 1935 as done in other studies lizarralde et al 2018 vaneeckhaute et al 2018 the volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient was defined as a function of the superficial gas velocity and temperature maldonado et al 2008 pérez et al 2006 gillot et al 2005 fujie et al 1992 eq 3 the equilibrium concentration with the gas phase was estimated from the partial pressure of the compound i calculated itself considering its gas molar fraction the corresponding henry s law constant

in the gas phase mol mol and p total the pressure in a given reactor atm indices i and n stand for the compound and the reactor in series respectively the transfer rate in the passive zone was reduced by a factor fr compared to the rate in the active zone the value of this factor used in the present model was calibrated in previous work to 0 032 to adjust the simulated effluent do concentration with the measured one the value lies within ranges proposed by amiel 2002 which is 0 008 0 04 of the total mass of oxygen transferred in the reactor 2 2 2 2 implementation of a mass balance on the gas phase simulations 4 and 5 the base model assumed the same gas composition over the baf height with o2 molar fraction set to 0 21 in all reactors atmospheric value in this study a mass balance on the gas phase was added to describe the evolution of the gas composition eq 5 its implementation required several modifications of the model inclusion of a gas volume first to calculate the actual air water proportion employed for total pressure estimation set arbitrarily to 5 95 in the base model then to estimate the working volume and modification of klao2 accordingly modification of klao2 calculation to make it consistent with the gas hold up therefore preliminary simulations were performed simulations 1 to 3 to assess their impact on nitrification and n2o predictions which are described in the next sections mass balance was first added on o2 only to assess its single impact on simulation results simulation 4 and then it was implemented for all gases simulation 5 5 v g n c i

the volumetric oxygen transfer rate with the superficial gas velocity simulation 1 the base model of bernier et al 2014 used klao2 values and airflow evolution curves taken from the experiments of gillot et al 2005 who investigated oxygen transfer in a pilot scale biofilter operated in similar conditions as those simulated the main difference being that the pilot scale study was performed in clean water and with unseeded media the application of the correlation proposed by gillot et al 2005 resulted in severe underestimation of nitrification consequently authors increased klao2 values to meet effluent ammonium concentration in this study we decided to get back to the correlation from gillot et al 2005 because it quantified the effect of increased superficial gas velocity both on gas hold up and oxygen transfer rate evolution both parameters being considered in our model a first simulation was performed using these data 1 and results were compared to the base model predictions 0 2 2 2 4 modification of the pressure calculation considering a variable gas hold up simulation 2 in the base model pressure inside the baf was calculated considering the pressure exerted by a 5 95 air water volume in this work the partition between mobile phases was calculated from their actual fractions in the baf according to eq 6 for the gas fraction the relation from gillot et al 2005 which positively correlates the gas hold up to the superficial gas velocity eq 7 was chosen as it was obtained under similar operating conditions the gas hold up was considered as homogenous in the baf for simplification the liquid fraction was deduced from the others the sum of air liquid media and biofilm fractions being equal to one eq 8 the biofilm fraction was estimated from the biofilm thickness according to eq 9 the latter is a function of filtration detachment and biomass growth consequently the biofilm fraction varies with time and along the baf height the media fraction is a fixed value equal to 0 64 which was considered homogeneous in the baf for simplification 6 p total n gh n ε g ε g ε l n ρ g ε l n ε g ε l n ρ l 10 3 101325 7 ε g 2 9 10 2 4 1 10 4 u g 6 8 10 5 u g 2 8 ε l n 1 ε g

calculation considering the gas volume simulation 3 the liquid volume i e the working volume is commonly assumed to be the interstitial volume due to the reactor porosity in bafs this working volume is actually occupied by an air water mixture as both are injected into the system consequently the liquid volume should be calculated considering the gas volume eq 10 which is deduced from the gas hold up eq 11 10 v l n v r n v m n v b n v g n 11 v g n ε g v r n where v r v m and v b are the total media and biofilm volumes m3 2 2 3 synthesis of the performed simulations the impact of each hypothesis on the prediction of nitrification performances and n2o gas liquid partition was tested in a series of simulations modifications were implemented step by step as described in table 2 an additional simulation 6 was performed after calibrating the klao2 value while keeping biokinetic parameters unchanged it has to be noted that this paper is not intended to discuss into details the mechanisms of n2o production in bafs it is focused on the evaluation of the impact of gas liquid mass transfer representation on n2o gas liquid partition thus on predicted off gas n2o concentrations each dynamic simulation was preceded by a 100 day pseudo steady state using average constant inputs from table 1 and data describing the influent composition more details can be found in appendix a only dynamic predictions are presented in the paper if average is indicated it stands for an average of the dynamic simulation outputs for the period model outputs were compared to effluent characteristics measured on the studied baf over 14 days appendix a 2 3 calculation of n2o emissions and factors the n2o production rate was calculated considering the sum of the production rate by aobs and the net production rate by heterotrophs the n2o emission rate is calculated as the sum of fluxes stripped in each reactor eq 12 as long as the mass balance on gaseous n2o had not been added simulations 0 to 4 it was the only way to calculate this emission rate afterwards it could also be calculated as the product of the off gas n2o concentration and the airflow rate both calculations gave the exact same result for a given simulation verified on simulations 5 and 6 the n2o emission and production factors are respectively calculated by dividing the emission and production rates by the ammonium removal rate according to eq 13 and 14 12 f n 2 o g n 1 8 f n 2 o g l n 13 n 2 o ef f n 2 o g f nh 4 removed 14 n 2 o pf f n 2 o f nh 4 removed where f n 2 o and f n 2 o g are

respectively of n nh4 removed and f nh 4 removed the ammonium removal rate gn d 3 results 3 1 simulation results obtained with the base model simulation 0 a simulation run was performed with the base model simulation 0 table 2 for which the results are presented in appendix e on average predicted and observed effluent nh4 and no3 concentrations were 4 9 and 28 0 mgn l against 5 7 and 27 7 mgn l nitrite concentration was correctly predicted 0 65 against 0 64 mgn l measured as well as effluent do concentration 7 3 against 7 1 mgo2 l measured in addition the model was also found able to catch the main dynamics of effluent concentrations do ammonium nitrate and nitrite n2o production was overestimated by 30 39 1 against 30 0 kgn d but most importantly the model was not able to describe the partition of n2o between the gas and liquid phases n2o emission rate was overestimated by 89 while the dissolved n2o was underestimated by 88 all in all the emitted to produced n2o ratio was 97 while the measured one was 65 questioning the performance of the gas liquid transfer model on the other hand the oxygen transfer prediction was satisfying as nitrification rate was correctly predicted as well as effluent do concentration 3 2 impact of gas liquid transfer hypotheses implementation table 3 presents a summary of model predictions in terms of nitrification performance n2o production rate and its gas liquid partition for each simulation results are detailed in the following sections 3 2 1 evolution of the volumetric oxygen transfer rate with the superficial gas velocity simulation 1 for an average superficial gas velocity of 299 nm3 m2 d the klao2 was 91 h 1 with the initial model after modifying the klao2 to ug s correlation eq 7 it decreased to 65 h 1 consequently the mass of o2 transferred to the liquid phase dropped substantially which negatively impacted nitrification performances ammonium removal rate passed from 587 to 449 kgn d n2o production rate decreased in a lower extent from 39 1 to 34 1 kgn d resulting in an increase of predicted n2o pf from 6 7 to 7 6 according to the model the net n2o production by aobs decreased by 11 kgn d and its proportion consumed by heterotrophic bacteria remained constant 53 i e 6 kgn d resulting in a lower net n2o production rate the emitted to produced n2o ratio decreased from 97 to 93 as klan2o decreased with klao2 reducing n2o transfer to the gas phase 3 2 2 modification of the pressure calculation considering a variable gas hold up simulation 2 in simulation 2 the gas hold up was estimated according to eq 7 the gas hold up was used to calculate the gas saturation i e the proportion of gas in the gas liquid mixture and the reactor pressure according to eq 6 a 5 gas saturation was set arbitrarily in simulations 0 and 1 depending on the superficial gas velocity the gas hold up was 3 5 on average during the 14 day period this resulted in a mean gas saturation of 13 in the active zone fig 2 which was about three times higher than the previously imposed value the decrease of gas saturation over the filter height was related to the thinner biofilm which induced higher liquid volume while gas hold up was considered as homogeneous in the baf in the passive zone gas saturation was directly equal to gas hold up since there was no media consequently gas saturation considered in simulations 0 and 1 was higher in this zone the modifications did not significantly affect pressure values in the baf 1 on average which resulted in similar nitrification performance 444 and 449 kgn d after and before modification respectively and n2o production rates 34 0 and 34 1 kgn d respectively likewise emitted to total n2o ratio was similar 93 0 against 93 1 3 2 3 modification of the working volume calculation considering the gas volume simulation 3 the repartition of media biofilm liquid and gas volumes in the active zone is presented on fig 3 left panel whereas the evolution of the hydraulic retention time hrt is presented on the right panel accounting for the gas volume 21 m3 on average reduced the liquid volume from 160 to 140 m3 the hrt was therefore reduced in the same proportion 13 which resulted in lower mass of autotrophic biomass stabilized in the baf and reduced nitrification performances ammonium removal rate passed from 444 to 390 kgn d total hrt in the baf was 29 9 and 27 9 min before 2 and after 3 including gas hold up to calculate the remaining liquid volume for simplification gas hold up was considered homogeneous over space on the other hand the biofilm fraction was not homogeneously distributed in agreement with experimental observations azimi et al 2010 vigne 2007 the model predicted a decrease of the biofilm thickness over the height that followed the evolution of nitrogen removal consequently the volume available for water thus nh4 removal was more affected at the bottom of the reactor ammonium removal rate 21 and 8 at the bottom and the top of the baf respectively 3 2 4 implementation of a mass balance on the gas phase simulations 4 and 5 fig 4 displays the evolution of o2 left panel no and n2o right panel gas molar fractions over the baf height simulation results indicated a depletion of o2 as it was transferred to the liquid phase o2 gas fraction decreased from 0 21 to 0 18 on average this reduced the concentration gradient at the gas liquid interface by 8 on average in the active zone lowering the o2 transfer rate consequently ammonium removal rate was reduced from 390 to 359 kgn d 8 at the contrary the n2o gas molar fraction increased over the baf height as it got stripped from the liquid on average its fraction increased from 3 10 7 to 1 3 10 4 and its concentration in the off gas was 298 ppm i e almost 103 times the atmospheric concentration 328 ppb this enrichment decreased the gradient concentration at the gas liquid interface for stripping and the associated total n2o flux from liquid to gas the results were similar for no in a lower extent 5 ppm in the off gas models 1 to 4 highly overestimated the emitted to produced n2o ratio over 90 predicted against 65 measured after integrating the gas enrichment in no and n2o the predicted ratio for simulation 5 71 was closer to full scale data the no and n2o gas fraction profiles were related to their production within the filter the latter increased over the reactor height as no and n2o were produced during nitrification the associated transfer rates from the bulk to the gas phase therefore increased over the baf height which explained the accumulation of no and n2o in the gas phase finally their small evolutions between 3 5 and 4 25 m were due to the lower gas liquid transfer rates in the passive zone the same net n2o production by aobs was modelled in simulations 4 and 5 however the available dissolved n2o to be reduced by heterotrophs was higher in simulation 5 which induced a higher consumption rate i e a lower net n2o production consequently the net n2o production rate was 26 3 against 28 0 kgn d in simulation 4 3 3 simultaneous prediction of nitrification performances and n2o emissions model calibration simulation 6 in order to recover nitrification performances klao2 values were increased from 65 to 117 h 1 on average by increasing the a constant of eq 3 from 43 to 81 simulation 6 fig 5 represents measured and predicted effluent nh4 no3 do concentrations emitted to produced n2o ratio as well as airflow rate and effluent temperature predicted and measured average effluent concentrations were very similar 5 4 vs 5 7 mgn l for nh4 27 6 vs 27 7 mgn l for no3 6 5 vs 7 1 mg l for do and 0 71 vs 0 64 mgn l for no2 not shown on fig 5 respectively their dynamics were also well described by the model the modification of klao2 increased klan2o eq 2 thus increasing the emitted to produced n2o ratio from 71 to 74 the n2o emission factor was however closer to experimental data 4 5 vs 5 2 before calibration as the nh4 removal rate was better described table 3 the predicted ratio followed the main trends as experimental data its value is well predicted from days 0 3 and days 8 14 the drop from day 3 to day 8 was due to an increase of the airflow rate related to a peak of ammonium load and to a decrease of temperature measures reported a drop of the emitted to produced n2o ratio more pronounced than model predictions the effect of temperature on henry s constants was included in the model according to the literature sander 2015 the difference of the emitted to produced n2o ratio between observations and model predictions is due to an overestimation of n2o production which is much more pronounced at this period 44 compared to the rest of the period 4 model results suggested an increase of n2o production by aobs and a decrease of n2o consumption by heterotrophs related to high o2 transfer rates after calibrating klao2 value and without any calibration of n2o parameters simulation results were closer to experimental data than predictions from the initial model n2o concentrations were 407 ppm and 0 44 mgn l in the off gas and the effluent respectively against 318 ppm and 0 50 mgn l measured 4 discussion 4 1 considering gas enrichment is essential to predict n2o emissions whereas the plug flow behavior of the liquid phase is usually considered in baf models it has rarely been taken into account for the gas phase bernier et al 2014 vigne et al 2010 hidaka and tsuno 2004 viotti et al 2002 with the exception of some studies performed at small scale on oxygen gas liquid mass transfer cruvellier et al 2017 poughon et al 1999 to our best knowledge the baf model developed in this study is to date the only one describing both oxygen and n2o gas liquid mass transfer and moreover at full scale results of this study highlighted significant differences in model predictions when considering a constant well mixed hypothesis or a variable gas composition with a constant gas composition corresponding to that of ambient air simulation 0 the model was able to predict nitrification performances but failed to describe the emitted to produced n2o ratio as it overestimated n2o stripping see table 3 it was only when a mass balance on the gas phase was included that the model correctly described the emitted to produced n2o ratio gas enrichment along the baf height from bottom to top 300 ppb to 298 ppm in simulation 5 highly decreased the driven potential of n2o transfer eq 1 allowing a larger fraction of n2o to remain soluble the inclusion of this mass balance impacted much more no and n2o than o2 transfer simulation 4 it induced gas depletion in o2 by 8 only lowering nitrification performances to a small extend 8 between simulations 3 and 4 even when klao2 and klan2o were increased by the same proportion in simulation 6 the impact was more pronounced for n2o outflow molar fraction 36 compared to the one of o2 7 this result is explained by the fact that oxygen is respectively 2 and 19 times less soluble than no and n2o kh o2 1 5 10 5 kh no 2 3 10 5 kh n2o 2 8 10 4 mol m3 atm at 15 c and its content in the ambient air is much higher in sum modelling the gas phase as a plug flow reactor similarly to the liquid phase appears to be essential to model gas liquid n2o exchanges otherwise predicted n2o off gas concentration would be highly underestimated and n2o stripping overestimated if dissolved n2o concentration is not measured which is often the case this could lead to unnecessary calibration of the biokinetic model parameters to fit measured off gas n2o concentration this result is in accordance with other studies dealing with gases of higher solubility than o2 like co2 sperandio and paul 1997 this recommendation stands not only for bafs but also for any process having a plug flow behavior of the gas phase such as activated sludge processes with bubble aeration 4 2 considering gas hold up largely impacted nitrification prediction modifications have been made to the initial baf model to take into account the minimum physical phenomena that allow a proper description of n2o emissions these affected predictions of nitrification performances in particular the consideration of the gas phase as a compartment of the model the gas phase was added as a compartment of the baf by including gas hold up according to eq 8 which was 3 5 of the active volume on average results indicated that it highly decreased nitrification performances when considered to calculate the working volume 13 this result may seem surprising given the small gas fraction however it should be reminded that the baf system is mostly filled with polystyrene materials 64 of the reactor volume in the active zone unlike suspended growth systems such as conventional activated sludge the working volume in bafs cannot be considered to be the reactor volume the volume available for water is relatively small about 26 of the active zone considering that 10 is occupied by the biofilm on average making the liquid fraction very sensitive to gas variations such feature could help improving the prediction of nitrogen removal in case of hydraulic peak loads or episodes of high aeration rates both operational parameters reported as requiring additional calibration of the baf model parameters vigne et al 2010 the sum of all modifications resulted in a large underestimation of ammonium removal rate 39 which required a calibration given the capacity of the initial model to describe nitrification with biokinetic parameters from the literature simulation 0 it seemed more adapted to calibrate transfer model parameters only 4 3 calibration procedure and recommendations the extended model was calibrated after modification of the gas liquid transfer coefficient to recover average nitrification performances similarly to bernier et al 2014 our approach was to increase klao2 considering that gas liquid exchanges should be higher in a functioning baf compared to a clean media bed unseeded and working with clean water which has been observed in previous studies reiber and stensel 1985 stenstrom et al 2008 we did not however modify the correlation between gas hold up and superficial gas velocity eq 6 the main elements supporting these assumptions are the differences in terms of fixed bed properties and hydraulics this is discussed hereinafter with our current understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in such systems and supported by simulation results and a literature review 4 3 1 slight evolution of global gas hold up a functioning baf differs from a clean media bed by the effluent composition which could affect the surface tension gunde et al 1992 sridhar and rami reddy 1984 but also by lower bed porosity due to the development of the biofilm on the media increasing particle size and within the media bed interstices likewise based on a set point value of the headloss bafs are regularly backwashed to avoid too much biofilm and particles accumulation bernier et al 2016 in a pilot baf study stenstrom et al 2008 attributed the higher oxygen transfer efficiency observed in process water to an increase of gas hold up this assumption was based on a naked eye observation through an observation port on the column which revealed that gas bubbles were retained by the media for a few seconds before being washed away previous work on lab scale fixed beds operated in co current upflow mode and in clean conditions has shown that gas hold up was negatively correlated with packing size collins et al 2017 maldonado et al 2008 kies et al 2005 and negatively with bed porosity collins et al 2017 maldonado et al 2008 according to collins et al 2017 and maldonado et al 2008 the increase of gas hold up is mainly due to a higher static gas fraction also called stagnant gas hold up which is attributed to increased gas to particles contact area and higher surface tension forces however it is likely that the increase of the static gas fraction is less pronounced in a functioning backed bed system compared to a clean water system due to the lower liquid surface tension and associated capillarity forces this latter is expected to favor the deformation of bubbles and their breakup considering that bubbles size was found to be calibrated by the pores size chen et al 2017 bordas et al 2006 a distribution with lower bubble sizes is to be found in a functioning baf thanks to their reduced size bubbles should have the ability to evolve more easily within the bed deshpande et al 2018 thus reducing the static gas fraction and compensating the increase of the dynamic gas hold up to evaluate the hypothesis based on a slight evolution of global gas hold up an additional simulation was performed results not shown by increasing gas hold up along with klao2 this led to a severe reduction of ammonium removal rate as the hrt highly decreased see section 4 2 in order to achieve correct ammonium removal 81 klao2 had to be increased to 162 h 1 which corresponded to an average gas hold up of 8 6 these high values far beyond literature ranges in clean systems increased the emitted to produced n2o ratio from 74 to 75 moving it further away from experimental data 65 this result supports the hypothesis of a less pronounced evolution of global gas hold up in a functioning baf compared to a clean media bed however experimental validation is necessary it would require characterizing the evolution of the different gas fractions static and dynamic and bubbles size with water composition such as surface tension and backed bed properties such as bed porosity application of new characterization methods such as tomography could be very useful collins et al 2017 chen et al 2017 4 3 2 evolution of oxygen transfer coefficient the main elements supporting a higher gas liquid transfer rate in a functioning baf compared to a clean media bed are as mentioned above a slight evolution of gas hold up coupled with a reduction of the distribution of bubbles size would increase the interfacial area the decrease of the bed porosity due to the biofilm coupled with a slight evolution of gas hold up would increase the gas to liquid volume ratio according to the present model the biofilm fills about 9 of the active zone this would theoretically increase the gas to liquid volume ratio from 0 097 to 0 130 the reduced liquid volume would induce a higher local liquid velocity in the bed therefore increasing the slip velocity between liquid and bubbles and consequently the liquid side mass transfer coefficient kl maldonado et al 2008 lower bed porosity is expected to influence bubbles movement in the void fraction inducing increased turbulence in the bubble wake and consequently increased kl kherbeche et al 2013 in summary the mechanisms affecting mass transfer parameters in full scale bafs are not fully understood especially the combined effect of bed porosity and particle size changes in the gas hold up and oxygen transfer needs to be evaluated in this study klao2 and gas hold up were both found to highly impact nitrification performances and gas to liquid partition of n2o it was chosen to partially decorrelate those parameters as we kept the gas hold up corresponding to that of a clean media bed gillot et al 2005 while increasing the value of klao2 this way it was possible to correctly predict both the mass transfer of oxygen with nitrification performances and effluent do concentration being well predicted and n2o as its gas to liquid partition was well predicted however experiments are necessary to validate these hypotheses gas liquid transfer measurements with a clean media bed against a colonized one at different colonization degrees i e progressive reduction of the bed porosity would provide useful information for model calibration the experimental design should also evaluate the evolution of bubble s size and shape for dissociating the impact of the presence of the biofilm on the liquid side mass transfer coefficient kl and on the interfacial area a furthermore experiments should also be performed in full scale bafs to assess the gas distribution within the media bed and global klao2 for various superficial gas velocities 5 conclusion in this work a tertiary nitrifying baf model previously validated on long term data of the seine aval plant was extended to include the main biological production and consumption pathways of n2o hypotheses related to gas liquid exchanges were successively implemented in the model in order to assess their relevance to describe nitrification and n2o emissions model predictions were confronted to experimental data from a 14 day measuring campaign on seine aval the main conclusions are without considering the mass balance on the gas phase the model was able to successfully describe nitrification and the order of magnitude of n2o production rate it was however unable to predict the n2o gas liquid partition highly overestimating the emitted to produced n2o ratio over 90 against 65 including the mass balance for the gas phase allowed the model to describe n2o emissions predicting gas enrichment over the baf height 300 ppb 298 ppm preliminary modifications of the model heavily impacted the prediction of nitrifying performances in particular the inclusion of a gas compartment decreased the liquid volume i e the hrt and consequently ammonium removal by 13 in the absence of experimental data on gas liquid transfer in full scale bafs the model was calibrated by increasing klao2 from 65 to 117 h 1 the calibrated model successfully described nitrification and n2o production and emissions in future work the extended model will be confronted to a second dataset and evaluated on its ability to predict nitrification and n2o emissions for contrasted operating conditions after validation it will be used to get a further insight into the mechanisms leading to high n2o emissions in full scale nitrifying bafs acknowledgments this phd work is part of the n2otrack project anr 15 ce04 0014 02 funded by the french national research agency authors would also like

18913,nitrifying biologically active filters bafs have been found to be high emitters of nitrous oxide n2o a powerful greenhouse gas contributing to ozone layer depletion while recent models have greatly improved our understanding of the triggers of n2o emissions from suspended growth processes less is known about n2o emissions from full scale biofilm processes tertiary nitrifying bafs have been modeled at some occasions but considering strong simplifications on the description of gas liquid exchanges which are not appropriate for n2o prediction in this work a tertiary nitrifying baf model including the main n2o biological pathways was developed and confronted to full scale data from seine aval the largest wastewater resource recovery facility in europe a mass balance on the gaseous compounds was included in order to correctly describe the n2o gas liquid partition thus n2o emissions preliminary modifications of the model structure were made to include the gas phase as a compartment of the model which significantly affected the prediction of nitrification in particular considering gas hold up influenced the prediction of the hydraulic retention time thus nitrification performances a 3 5 gas fraction reduced ammonium removal by 13 as the liquid volume small in such systems is highly sensitive to the gas presence finally the value of the volumetric oxygen transfer

the biological conversion of carbon ammonium and or nitrate since the early eighties they have been successfully used to treat a variety of urban and industrial wastewaters owing to their compactness flexibility and reliability bafs have been widely developed in europe especially in large urbanized areas where available space is scarce mendoza espinosa and stephenson 1999 recent monitoring campaigns suggest that nitrifying bafs are important sources of nitrous oxide n2o a potent greenhouse gas contributing to global warming and ozone depletion in china wang et al 2016 monitored nitrifying bafs over a period of 12 months and reported emissions ranging from 0 02 to 1 26 of influent total nitrogen load in france the two monitoring campaigns performed in tertiary nitrifying bafs of the seine aval plant the largest plant in europe reported higher emission factor values 1 77 of n nh4 removed in summer and 3 11 in winter bollon et al 2016 based on the results of the winter campaign authors estimated that n2o emissions contributed to almost 80 of the carbon footprint of the biological nitrogen removal stage of the plant filali et al 2017 modelling may represent a very useful tool in view of a better understanding of n2o production mechanisms and can serve to comprehend the effect of different operational conditions and define mitigation strategies to this end existing activated sludge models asm were extended to include no and n2o formation during autotrophic nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification n2o is an obligate intermediate of the heterotrophic denitrification chain and the end product of two main biological pathways by ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and archaea aoa schreiber et al 2012 in the first pathway nitrifier nitrification or nn pathway n2o is generated as a by product of incomplete oxidation of hydroxylamine nh2oh to nitrite no2 in the second pathway nitrifier denitrification or nd pathway n2o is generated upon the reduction of no2 several models have been proposed to describe either one of these pathways but failed to predict n2o emissions in contrasted conditions especially when transient conditions of dissolved oxygen do or no2 occurred spérandio et al 2016 hence recent models coupling multiple n2o pathways were proposed to describe and extrapolate the emissions for a wide broad of operating conditions a detailed review of these models can be found in the literature massara et al 2017 ni and yuan 2015 among them the model of pocquet et al 2016 which couples the two n2o biological production pathways by aobs has been validated on extensive lab scale datasets it was found able to predict n2o emissions for contrasted do and no2 conditions and also the respective contributions of nn and nd pathways to the total production of n2o lang et al 2016 on the other hand few models have been proposed to describe the behavior of nitrifying bafs bernier et al 2014 vigne et al 2010 hidaka and tsuno 2004 behrendt 1999 viotti et al 2002 they are mainly one dimensional and differ in the number of mechanisms simulated and in the level of complexity considered in their description gas liquid mass transfer of oxygen is one of the mechanisms that received the least attention probably because of the difficulty to obtain experimental data and of the lack of standardized measurement methods biofilm reactors being mass transfer limited a good representation of oxygen gas liquid mass transfer is usually essential to correctly predict nitrification performances however little is known about gas liquid mass transfer in fixed bed reactors some studies investigated the impact of operating conditions and media properties on oxygen transfer and mostly at lab or pilot scales and with a clean media bed maldonado et al 2008 leung et al 2006 pérez et al 2006 gillot et al 2005 behrendt 1999 deront et al 1998 in some occasions oxygen supply in bafs was described in a simplified manner i e assuming a constant non limiting do concentration through the filter height vigne et al 2010 viotti et al 2002 whereas in others an aeration model was considered to predict the oxygen supply variation with the airflow rate and the profiles of do throughout the filter bernier et al 2014 hidaka and tsuno 2004 however several simplifications were made the gas phase was not considered as a compartment of the reactor i e the gas volume was not included in the calculation of the working volume and the evolution of the gas phase composition was neglected if this representation of gas liquid exchanges was found sufficient to describe nitrification performances it may not be appropriate for no and n2o prediction it has to be noted that few modelling studies considered the gas phase as a compartment when describing nitrification in lab scale poughon et al 1999 and pilot scale behrendt 1999 fixed bed reactors both studies included oxygen transfer as their final objective was to investigate nitrification but provided little information about this parameter moreover n2o was not addressed in these studies and n2o emissions from full scale nitrifying bafs were never modeled so far the increasing concern about greenhouse gas emissions and the sensitivity of plant s carbon footprint to n2o emissions call for an upgrade of full plant baf models to include n2o production pathways to this aim the model proposed by bernier et al 2014 calibrated and validated on long term data from full scale tertiary nitrifying bafs of the seine aval plant was extended to describe n2o emissions monitored on this site beforehand it was necessary to assess the relevance of gas liquid transfer hypotheses for n2o prediction in this paper different successive options related to gas liquid transfer hypotheses are considered and implemented for a better description of physical characteristics of bafs and associated mass transfer gas hold up was included to estimate a gas volume the working volume was estimated considering the gas volume and a mass balance was added on the gas phase to describe the evolution of the gas phase composition their relevance is discussed and the newly developed model is evaluated by comparing modeling results with experimental data finally recommendations of experiments are provided in order to better characterize gas liquid mass transfer in full scale bafs 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental data data were collected during a 14 day measuring campaign in winter 2015 on a biostyr unit of the tertiary nitrification stage of the seine aval plant bollon et al 2016 the unitary surface was 173 m2 and the media bed composed of 4 mm polystyrene beads was 3 5 m high data used for modeling included online measurements of inlet nh4 and no3 outlet nh4 no3 do ph temperature and outlet dissolved n2o measured in the water zone above the media called the overflow one off measures of effluent no2 were also performed gas emissions were collected in the middle of the overflow with a floating hood the main operating conditions of the baf are displayed in table 1 with the estimated n2o production and emission rates the winter period was preferred to the summer period for the following reasons i the duration of the monitoring was longer ii it is characterized by a higher variability of the loading rate the temperature and the n2o gas liquid partition more details about the measurement procedure and the results can be found in bollon et al 2016 average values presented in table 1 are slightly different from the original publication as influent interruptions occurring during backwashing periods were not considered in order to avoid computational issues during these 30 min backwashing events the filter was considered to be operated at usual influent flow and concentration conditions but was characterized by a higher detachment rate of particles a detailed description of the baf reactor and model inputs are provided in appendix a 2 2 mathematical model preliminary modifications made to the model proposed by bernier et al 2014 referred as the base model were related to i the biokinetic model and ii the gas liquid transfer representation the biokinetic model was extended in order to include the main biological n2o production and consumption pathways related to nitrification and denitrification a stripping term was added on n2o and other nitrogen compounds these preliminary modifications are presented thereafter followed by the modifications made to assess the model sensitivity to gas liquid transfer hypotheses 2 2 1 biochemical and biofilm model the proposed model is based on an existing co current up flow filter model built on the simulink toolbox of matlab mathworks to describe the functioning of tertiary nitrifying biostyr filters of the seine aval plant bernier et al 2014 the main features of the base model are recalled hereafter a detailed description is provided in appendix b hydrodynamics in the baf are described by a series of seven reactors of equal volume representing the active zone where biological conversions occur each reactor is composed of a biologically inactive bulk zone composed of a gas and a liquid compartment an inert media volume and two biofilm layers fig 1 it should be noted that the gas compartment was not included in the base model the biofilm model includes soluble material diffusion biofilm growth and particular exchange between biofilm layers as well as attachment and detachment on top of this zone an additional cstr representing the overflow is implemented because it has low biomass concentrations in comparison with the underneath zone only resulting from the detachment no biofilm layer it is considered passive for simplification the 1 4 m water zone beneath the media bed was not represented in the model because i the concentration of biomass is low and ii oxygen gas liquid transfer is low considering that the influent entering this zone has a do concentration of 8 mgo2 l biokinetic reactions are computed within the two biofilm layers the model previously describing nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification as two step reactions was extended to include the main n2o pathways no and n2o were added as intermediates of heterotrophic denitrification with parameters from the original publication of hiatt and grady 2008 the two pathway model proposed by pocquet et al 2016 was included to describe n2o production by aobs sets of parameters were taken from the second case study of lang et al 2016 who worked at nh4 and no2 concentrations close to the ones measured on the seine aval plant appendix c and d present the gujer matrix of the extended model and the list of parameters respectively 2 2 2 gas liquid mass transfer model 2 2 2 1 general description of gas liquid mass transfer the base model included a gas liquid transfer equation for oxygen in each reactor in this study it was implemented for all gases considered i o2 n2o no and n2 according to eq 1 mass transfer limitations being localized at the liquid side for all gases all having a low solubility their volumetric transfer coefficient was estimated from the one of oxygen eq 2 in application of the penetration theory higbie 1935 as done in other studies lizarralde et al 2018 vaneeckhaute et al 2018 the volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient was defined as a function of the superficial gas velocity and temperature maldonado et al 2008 pérez et al 2006 gillot et al 2005 fujie et al 1992 eq 3

by a factor fr compared to the rate in the active zone the value of this factor used in the present model was calibrated in previous work to 0 032 to adjust the simulated effluent do concentration with the measured one the value lies within ranges proposed by amiel 2002 which is 0 008 0 04 of the total mass of oxygen transferred in the reactor 2 2 2 2 implementation of a mass balance on the gas phase simulations 4 and 5 the base model assumed the same gas composition over the baf height with o2 molar fraction set to 0 21 in all reactors atmospheric value in this study a mass balance on the gas phase was added to describe the evolution of the gas composition eq 5 its implementation required several modifications of the model inclusion of a gas volume first to calculate the actual air water proportion employed for total pressure estimation set arbitrarily to 5 95 in the base model then to estimate the working volume and modification of klao2 accordingly modification of klao2 calculation to make it consistent with the gas hold up therefore preliminary simulations were performed simulations 1 to 3 to assess their impact on nitrification and n2o predictions which are described in the next sections mass balance was first added on o2 only to assess its single impact on simulation results simulation 4 and then it was implemented for all gases simulation 5 5 v g n c i

the volumetric oxygen transfer rate with the superficial gas velocity simulation 1 the base model of bernier et al 2014 used klao2 values and airflow evolution curves taken from the experiments of gillot et al 2005 who investigated oxygen transfer in a pilot scale biofilter operated in similar conditions as those simulated the main difference being that the pilot scale study was performed in clean water and with unseeded media the application of the correlation proposed by gillot et al 2005 resulted in severe underestimation of nitrification consequently authors increased klao2 values to meet effluent ammonium concentration in this study we decided to get back to the correlation from gillot et al 2005 because it quantified the effect of increased superficial gas velocity both on gas hold up and oxygen transfer rate evolution both parameters being considered in our model a first simulation was performed using these data 1 and results were compared to the base model predictions 0 2 2 2 4 modification of the pressure calculation considering a variable gas hold up simulation 2 in the base model pressure inside the baf was calculated considering the pressure exerted by a 5 95 air water volume in this work the partition between mobile phases was calculated from their actual fractions in the baf according to eq 6 for the gas fraction the relation from gillot et al 2005 which positively correlates the gas hold up to the superficial gas velocity eq 7 was chosen as it was obtained under similar operating conditions the gas hold up was considered as homogenous in the baf for simplification the liquid fraction was deduced from the others the sum of air liquid media and biofilm fractions being equal to one eq 8 the biofilm fraction was estimated from the biofilm thickness according to eq 9 the latter is a function of filtration detachment and biomass growth consequently the biofilm fraction varies with time and along the baf height the media fraction is a fixed value equal to 0 64 which was considered homogeneous in the baf for simplification 6 p total n gh n ε g ε g ε l n ρ g ε l n ε g ε l n ρ l 10 3 101325 7 ε g 2 9 10 2 4 1 10 4 u g 6 8 10 5 u g 2 8 ε l n 1 ε g

calculation considering the gas volume simulation 3 the liquid volume i e the working volume is commonly assumed to be the interstitial volume due to the reactor porosity in bafs this working volume is actually occupied by an air water mixture as both are injected into the system consequently the liquid volume should be calculated considering the gas volume eq 10 which is deduced from the gas

hypothesis on the prediction of nitrification performances and n2o gas liquid partition was tested in a series of simulations modifications were implemented step by step as described in table 2 an additional simulation 6 was performed after calibrating the klao2 value while keeping biokinetic parameters unchanged it has to be noted that this paper is not intended to discuss into details the mechanisms of n2o production in bafs it is focused on the evaluation of the impact of gas liquid mass transfer representation on n2o gas liquid partition thus on predicted off gas n2o concentrations each dynamic simulation was preceded by a 100 day pseudo steady state using average constant inputs from table 1 and data describing the influent composition more details can be found in appendix a only dynamic predictions are presented in the paper if average is indicated it stands for an average of the dynamic simulation outputs for the period model outputs were compared to effluent characteristics measured on the studied baf over 14 days appendix a 2 3 calculation of n2o emissions and factors the n2o production rate was calculated considering the sum of the production rate by aobs and the net production rate by heterotrophs the n2o emission rate is calculated as the sum of fluxes stripped in each reactor eq 12 as long as the mass balance on gaseous n2o had not been added simulations 0 to 4 it was the only way to calculate this emission rate afterwards it could also be calculated as the product of the off gas n2o concentration and the airflow rate both calculations gave the exact same result for a given simulation verified on simulations 5 and 6 the n2o emission and production factors are respectively calculated by dividing the emission and production rates by

model simulation 0 table 2 for which the results are presented in appendix e on average predicted and observed effluent nh4 and no3 concentrations were 4 9 and 28 0 mgn l against 5 7 and 27 7 mgn l nitrite concentration was correctly predicted 0 65 against 0 64 mgn l measured as well as effluent do concentration 7 3 against 7 1 mgo2 l measured in addition the model was also found able to catch the main dynamics of effluent concentrations do ammonium nitrate and nitrite n2o production was overestimated by 30 39 1 against 30 0 kgn d but most importantly the model was not able to describe the partition of n2o between the gas and liquid phases n2o emission rate was overestimated by 89 while the dissolved n2o was underestimated by 88 all in all the emitted to produced n2o ratio was 97 while the measured one was 65 questioning the performance of the gas liquid transfer model on the other hand the oxygen transfer prediction was satisfying as nitrification rate was correctly predicted as well as effluent do concentration 3 2 impact of gas liquid transfer hypotheses implementation table 3 presents a summary of model predictions in terms of nitrification performance n2o production rate and its gas liquid partition for each simulation results are detailed in the following sections 3 2 1 evolution of the volumetric oxygen transfer rate with the superficial gas velocity simulation 1 for an average superficial gas velocity of 299 nm3 m2 d the klao2 was 91 h 1 with the initial model after modifying the klao2 to ug s correlation eq 7 it decreased to 65 h 1 consequently the mass of o2 transferred to the liquid phase dropped substantially which negatively impacted nitrification performances ammonium removal rate passed from 587 to 449 kgn d n2o production rate decreased in a lower extent from 39 1 to 34 1 kgn d resulting in an increase of predicted n2o pf from 6 7 to 7 6 according to the model the net n2o production by aobs decreased by 11 kgn d and its proportion consumed by heterotrophic bacteria remained constant 53 i e 6 kgn d resulting in a lower net n2o production rate the emitted to produced n2o ratio decreased from 97 to 93 as klan2o decreased with klao2 reducing n2o transfer to the gas phase 3 2 2 modification of the pressure calculation considering a variable gas hold up simulation 2 in simulation 2 the gas hold up was estimated according to eq 7 the gas hold up was used to calculate the gas saturation i e the proportion of gas in the gas liquid mixture and the reactor pressure according to eq 6 a 5 gas saturation was set arbitrarily in simulations 0 and 1 depending on the superficial gas velocity the gas hold up was 3 5 on average during the 14 day period this resulted in a mean gas saturation of 13 in the active zone fig 2 which was about three times higher than the previously imposed value the decrease of gas saturation over the filter height was related to the thinner biofilm which induced higher liquid volume while gas hold up was considered as homogeneous in the baf in the passive zone gas saturation was directly equal to gas hold up since there was no media consequently gas saturation considered in simulations 0 and 1 was higher in this zone the modifications did not significantly affect pressure values in the baf 1 on average which resulted in similar nitrification performance 444 and 449 kgn d after and before modification respectively and n2o production rates 34 0 and 34 1 kgn d respectively likewise emitted to total n2o ratio was similar 93 0 against 93 1 3 2 3 modification of the working volume calculation considering the gas volume simulation 3 the repartition of media biofilm liquid and gas volumes in the active zone is presented on fig 3 left panel whereas the evolution of the hydraulic retention time hrt is presented on the right panel accounting for the gas volume 21 m3 on average reduced the liquid volume from 160 to 140 m3 the hrt was therefore reduced in the same proportion 13 which resulted in lower mass of autotrophic biomass stabilized in the baf and reduced nitrification performances ammonium removal rate passed from 444 to 390 kgn d total hrt in the baf was 29 9 and 27 9 min before 2 and after 3 including gas hold up to calculate the remaining liquid volume for simplification gas hold up was considered homogeneous over space on the other hand the biofilm fraction was not homogeneously distributed in agreement with experimental observations azimi et al 2010 vigne 2007 the model predicted a decrease of the biofilm thickness over the height that followed the evolution of nitrogen removal consequently the volume available for water thus nh4 removal was more affected at the bottom of the reactor ammonium removal rate 21 and 8 at the bottom and the top of the baf respectively 3 2 4 implementation of a mass balance on the gas phase simulations 4 and 5 fig 4 displays the evolution of o2 left panel no and n2o right panel gas molar fractions over the baf height simulation results indicated a depletion of o2 as it was transferred to the liquid phase o2 gas fraction decreased from 0 21 to 0 18 on average this reduced the concentration gradient at the gas liquid interface by 8 on average in the active zone lowering the o2 transfer rate consequently ammonium removal rate was reduced from 390 to 359 kgn d 8 at the contrary the n2o gas molar fraction increased over the baf height as it got stripped from the liquid on average its fraction increased from 3 10 7 to 1 3 10 4 and its concentration in the off gas was 298 ppm i e almost 103 times the atmospheric concentration 328 ppb this enrichment decreased the gradient concentration at the gas liquid interface for stripping and the associated total n2o flux from liquid to gas the results were similar for no in a lower extent 5 ppm in the off gas models 1 to 4 highly overestimated the emitted to produced n2o ratio over 90 predicted against 65 measured after integrating the gas enrichment in no and n2o the predicted ratio for simulation 5 71 was closer to full scale data the no and n2o gas fraction profiles were related to their production within the filter the latter increased over the reactor height as no and n2o were produced during nitrification the associated transfer rates from the bulk to the gas phase therefore increased over the baf height which explained the accumulation of no and n2o in the gas phase finally their small evolutions between 3 5 and 4 25 m were due to the lower gas liquid transfer rates in the passive zone the same net n2o production by aobs was modelled in simulations 4 and 5 however the available dissolved n2o to be reduced by heterotrophs was higher in simulation 5 which induced a higher consumption rate i e a lower net n2o production consequently the net n2o production rate was 26 3 against 28 0 kgn d in simulation 4 3 3 simultaneous prediction of nitrification performances and n2o emissions model calibration simulation 6 in order to recover nitrification performances klao2 values were increased from 65 to 117 h 1 on average by increasing the a constant of eq 3 from 43 to 81 simulation 6 fig 5 represents measured and predicted effluent nh4 no3 do concentrations emitted to produced n2o ratio as well as airflow rate and effluent temperature predicted and measured average effluent concentrations were very similar 5 4 vs 5 7 mgn l for nh4 27 6 vs 27 7 mgn l for no3 6 5 vs 7 1 mg l for do and 0 71 vs 0 64 mgn l for no2 not shown on fig 5 respectively their dynamics were also well described by the model the modification of klao2 increased klan2o eq 2 thus increasing the emitted to produced n2o ratio from 71 to 74 the n2o emission factor was however closer to experimental data 4 5 vs 5 2 before calibration as the nh4 removal rate was better described table 3 the predicted ratio followed the main trends as experimental data its value is well predicted from days 0 3 and days 8 14 the drop from day 3 to day 8 was due to an increase of the airflow rate related to a peak of ammonium load and to a decrease of temperature measures reported a drop of the emitted to produced n2o ratio more pronounced than model predictions the effect of temperature on henry s constants was included in the model according to the literature sander 2015 the difference of the emitted to produced n2o ratio between observations and model predictions is due to an overestimation of n2o production which is much more pronounced at this period 44 compared to the rest of the period 4 model results suggested an increase of n2o production by aobs and a decrease of n2o consumption by heterotrophs related to high o2 transfer rates after calibrating klao2 value and without any calibration of n2o parameters simulation results were closer to experimental data than predictions from the initial model n2o concentrations were 407 ppm and 0 44 mgn l in the off gas and the effluent respectively against 318 ppm and 0 50 mgn l measured 4 discussion 4 1 considering gas enrichment is essential to predict n2o emissions whereas the plug flow behavior of the liquid phase is usually considered in baf models it has rarely been taken into account for the gas phase bernier et al 2014 vigne et al 2010 hidaka and tsuno 2004 viotti et al 2002 with the exception of some studies performed at small scale on oxygen gas liquid mass transfer cruvellier et al 2017 poughon et al 1999 to our best knowledge the baf model developed in this study is to date the only one describing both oxygen and n2o gas liquid mass transfer and moreover at full scale results of this study highlighted significant differences in model predictions when considering a constant well mixed hypothesis or a variable gas composition with a constant gas composition corresponding to that of ambient air simulation 0 the model was able to predict nitrification performances but failed to describe the emitted to produced n2o ratio as it overestimated n2o stripping see table 3 it was only when a mass balance on the gas phase was included that the model correctly described the emitted to produced n2o ratio gas enrichment along the baf height from bottom to top 300 ppb to 298 ppm in simulation 5 highly decreased the driven potential of n2o transfer eq 1 allowing a larger fraction of n2o to remain soluble the inclusion of this mass balance impacted much more no and n2o than o2 transfer simulation 4 it induced gas depletion in o2 by 8 only lowering nitrification performances to a small extend 8 between simulations 3 and 4 even when klao2 and klan2o were increased by the same proportion in simulation 6 the impact was more pronounced for n2o outflow molar fraction 36 compared to the one of o2 7 this result is explained by the fact that oxygen is respectively 2 and 19 times less soluble than no and n2o kh o2 1 5 10 5 kh no 2 3 10 5 kh n2o 2 8 10 4 mol m3 atm at 15 c and its content in the ambient air is much higher in sum modelling the gas phase as a plug flow reactor similarly to the liquid phase appears to be essential to model gas liquid n2o exchanges otherwise predicted n2o off gas concentration would be highly underestimated and n2o stripping overestimated if dissolved n2o concentration is not measured which is often the case this could lead to unnecessary calibration of the biokinetic model parameters to fit measured off gas n2o concentration this result is in accordance with other studies dealing with gases of higher solubility than o2 like co2 sperandio and paul 1997 this recommendation stands not only for bafs but also for any process having a plug flow behavior of the gas phase such as activated sludge processes with bubble aeration 4 2 considering gas hold up largely impacted nitrification prediction modifications have been made to the initial baf model to take into account the minimum physical phenomena that allow a proper description of n2o emissions these affected predictions of nitrification performances in particular the consideration of the gas phase as a compartment of the model the gas phase was added as a compartment of the baf by including gas hold up according to eq 8 which was 3 5 of the active volume on average results indicated that it highly decreased nitrification performances when considered to calculate the working volume 13 this result may seem surprising given the small gas fraction however it should be reminded that the baf system is mostly filled with polystyrene materials 64 of the reactor volume in the active zone unlike suspended growth systems such as conventional activated sludge the working volume in bafs cannot be considered to be the reactor volume the volume available for water is relatively small about 26 of the active zone considering that 10 is occupied by the biofilm on average making the liquid fraction very sensitive to gas variations such feature could help improving the prediction of nitrogen removal in case of hydraulic peak loads or episodes of high aeration rates both operational parameters reported as requiring additional calibration of the baf model parameters vigne et al 2010 the sum of all modifications resulted in a large underestimation of ammonium removal rate 39 which required a calibration given the capacity of the initial model to describe nitrification with biokinetic parameters from the literature simulation 0 it seemed more adapted to calibrate transfer model parameters only 4 3 calibration procedure and recommendations the extended model was calibrated after modification of the gas liquid transfer coefficient to recover average nitrification performances similarly to bernier et al 2014 our approach was to increase klao2 considering that gas liquid exchanges should be higher in a functioning baf compared to a clean media bed unseeded and working with clean water which has been observed in previous studies reiber and stensel 1985 stenstrom et al 2008 we did not however modify the correlation between gas hold up and superficial gas velocity eq 6 the main elements supporting these assumptions are the differences in terms of fixed bed properties and hydraulics this is discussed hereinafter with our current understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in such systems and supported by simulation results and a literature review 4 3 1 slight evolution of global gas hold up a functioning baf differs from a clean media bed by the effluent composition which could affect the surface tension gunde et al 1992 sridhar and rami reddy 1984 but also by lower bed porosity due to the development of the biofilm on the media increasing particle size and within the media bed interstices likewise based on a set point value of the headloss bafs are regularly backwashed to avoid too much biofilm and particles accumulation bernier et al 2016 in a pilot baf study stenstrom et al 2008 attributed the higher oxygen transfer efficiency observed in process water to an increase of gas hold up this assumption was based on a naked eye observation through an observation port on the column which revealed that gas bubbles were retained by the media for a few seconds before being washed away previous work on lab scale fixed beds operated in co current upflow mode and in clean conditions has shown that gas hold up was negatively correlated with packing size collins et al 2017 maldonado et al 2008 kies et al 2005 and negatively with bed porosity collins et al 2017 maldonado et al 2008 according to collins et al 2017 and maldonado et al 2008 the increase of gas hold up is mainly due to a higher static gas fraction also called stagnant gas hold up which is attributed to increased gas to particles contact area and higher surface tension forces however it is likely that the increase of the static gas fraction is less pronounced in a functioning backed bed system compared to a clean water system due to the lower liquid surface tension and associated capillarity forces this latter is expected to favor the deformation of bubbles and their breakup considering that bubbles size was found to be calibrated by the pores size chen et al 2017 bordas et al 2006 a distribution with lower bubble sizes is to be found in a functioning baf thanks to their reduced size bubbles should have the ability to evolve more easily within the bed deshpande et al 2018 thus reducing the static gas fraction and compensating the increase of the dynamic gas hold up to evaluate the hypothesis based on a slight evolution of global gas hold up an additional simulation was performed results not shown by increasing gas hold up along with klao2 this led to a severe reduction of ammonium removal rate as the hrt highly decreased see section 4 2 in order to achieve correct ammonium removal 81 klao2 had to be increased to 162 h 1 which corresponded to an average gas hold up of 8 6 these high values far beyond literature ranges in clean systems increased the emitted to produced n2o ratio from 74 to 75 moving it further away from experimental data 65 this result supports the hypothesis of a less pronounced evolution of global gas hold up in a functioning baf compared to a clean media bed however experimental validation is necessary it would require characterizing the evolution of the different gas fractions static and dynamic and bubbles size with water composition such as surface tension and backed bed properties such as bed porosity application of new characterization methods such as tomography could be very useful collins et al 2017 chen et al 2017 4 3 2 evolution of oxygen transfer coefficient the main elements supporting a higher gas liquid transfer rate in a functioning baf compared to a clean media bed are as mentioned above a slight evolution of gas hold up coupled with a reduction of the distribution of bubbles size would increase the interfacial area the decrease of the bed porosity due to the biofilm coupled with a slight evolution of gas hold up would increase the gas to liquid volume ratio according to the present model the biofilm fills about 9 of the active zone this would theoretically increase the gas to liquid volume ratio from 0 097 to 0 130 the reduced liquid volume would induce a higher local liquid velocity in the bed therefore increasing the slip velocity between liquid and bubbles and consequently the liquid side mass transfer coefficient kl maldonado et al 2008 lower bed porosity is expected to influence bubbles movement in the void fraction inducing increased turbulence in the bubble wake and consequently increased kl kherbeche et al 2013 in summary the mechanisms affecting mass transfer parameters in full scale bafs are not fully understood especially the combined effect of bed porosity and particle size changes in the gas hold up and oxygen transfer needs to be evaluated in this study klao2 and gas hold up were both found to highly impact nitrification performances and gas to liquid partition of n2o it was chosen to partially decorrelate those parameters as we kept the gas hold up corresponding to that of a clean media bed gillot et al 2005 while increasing the value of klao2 this way it was possible to correctly predict both the mass transfer of oxygen with nitrification performances and effluent do concentration being well predicted and n2o as its gas to liquid partition was well predicted however experiments are necessary to validate these hypotheses gas liquid transfer measurements with a clean media bed against a colonized one at different colonization degrees i e progressive reduction of the bed porosity would provide useful information for model calibration the experimental design should also evaluate the evolution of bubble s size and shape for dissociating the impact of the presence of the biofilm on the liquid side mass transfer coefficient kl and on the interfacial area a furthermore experiments should also be performed in full scale bafs to assess the gas distribution within the media bed and global klao2 for various superficial gas velocities 5 conclusion in this work a tertiary nitrifying baf model previously validated on long term data of the seine aval plant was extended to include the main biological production and consumption pathways of n2o hypotheses related to gas liquid exchanges were successively implemented in the model in order to assess their relevance to describe nitrification and n2o emissions model predictions were confronted to experimental data from a 14 day measuring campaign on seine aval the main conclusions are without considering the mass balance on the gas phase the model was able to successfully describe nitrification and the order of magnitude of n2o production rate it was however unable to predict the n2o gas liquid partition highly overestimating the emitted to produced n2o ratio over 90 against 65 including the mass balance for the gas phase allowed the model to describe n2o emissions predicting gas enrichment over the baf height 300 ppb 298 ppm preliminary modifications of the model heavily impacted the prediction of nitrifying performances in particular the inclusion of a gas compartment decreased the liquid volume i e the hrt and consequently ammonium removal by 13 in the absence of experimental data on gas liquid transfer in full scale bafs the model was calibrated by increasing klao2 from 65 to 117 h 1 the calibrated model successfully described nitrification and n2o production and emissions in future work the extended model will be confronted to a second dataset and evaluated on its ability to predict nitrification and n2o emissions for contrasted operating conditions after validation it will be used to get a further insight into the mechanisms leading to high n2o emissions in full scale nitrifying bafs acknowledgments this phd work is part of the n2otrack project anr 15 ce04 0014 02 funded by the french national research agency authors would also like

curves have two phases an initial phase with faster kinetics and a second phase with slower kinetics the initial phase had a clear dose effect with inactivation rate increasing with dose following exposure to 2 mg l sodium hypochlorite less than 13 of cells were killed after 5 min however following exposure to 8 mg l sodium hypochlorite more than 90 of cells were killed within 5 min the ld50 of sodium hypochlorite was determined to be 4 mg l at 20 min of exposure injury to cells was also dose dependent and also exhibited two phases an initial phase with faster kinetics and a second phase with slower kinetics the injury rate was dose dependent during the initial phase with the injury rate increasing with dose there was significant difference between the percentages of injured bacteria under the various doses p 0 05 after exposure to 2 mg l sodium hypochlorite for 20 min only 25 of cells were injured after exposure to 4 mg l or 8 mg l for 20 min 49 or 56 of viable bacteria were injured respectively to investigate the contributors to mic of antibiotics during the exposure of 4 mg l sodium hypochlorite the potential correlations between bacterial composition and mic for antibiotics were studied by the spearman analyses table 1 it showed that only chlorine injured bacteria produced from the exposure with lethality rate 50 was positively correlated with resistance to chl caz and amp otherwise uninjured bacteria were not significantly correlated with resistance to any antibiotics p 0 05 this suggests that bacteria injured from exposure to ld50 levels of sodium hypochlorite may exhibit increased antibiotic resistance 3 3 enhanced antibiotics resistance in cultivable chlorine injured p aeruginosa was not heritable cultivable chlorine injured p aeruginosa could revert to a metabolically active state and proliferate if conditions were adequate to test if its enhanced antibiotics resistance could be inhered into next generation subcultured generation of chlorine injured p aeruginosa was further tested their mics against chl caz and amp the results showed there was no significant difference between subcultured chlorine injured p aeruginosa and the uninjured control suggesting enhanced antibiotic resistance in injured p aeruginosa not transferred to subsequent generations therefore promotion of antibiotics resistance in cultivable chlorine injured bacteria is a temporary physiological state that disappears after bacterial cells split 3 4 over expression of drug efflux pump and porin genes may help promote antibiotic resistance following chlorine exposure global transcriptional analyses revealed 1050 genes that were differentially expressed following exposure to 4 mg l sodium hypochlorite for 20 min this included 672 genes whose expression was up regulated and 378 genes whose expression was down regulated there were 25 efflux pumps genes and one antibiotic resistant protein gene whose expression was up regulated table s2 s3 the expression levels of the multidrug efflux genes mexe mexf and oprn which belong to the resistance nodulation cell division rnd multidrug efflux pump mexef oprn were up regulated by 15 34 fold this indicated that overexpression of the mexef oprn efflux pump which mediates the efflux of diverse antibiotics e g tetracyclines fluoroquinolones β lactams chloramphenicol macrolides novobiocin trimethoprim and sulfonamides lister and wolter djhanson 2009 may be involved in the increase in antibiotic resistance following chlorine exposure it has been reported that activation of the mexef oprn efflux pump leads to resistance to chloramphenicol fluoroquinolones and triclosan lamarche and déziel 2011 in addition to the rnd family gene expression for efflux pumps belonging to the major facilitator superfamily mfs and atp binding cassette family abc was also up regulated these included 2 18 fold increases in expression for six kinds of mfs transporters and 2 3 fold increases in expression for six kinds of abc transporters in additions expression of opro and oprp phosphate or pyrophosphate specific outer membrane porin genes were up regulated by 29 and 17 fold respectively opro and to a lesser degree oprp have high permeability to fosfomycin citak et al 2018 therefore over expression of drug efflux pump and porin genes in p aeruginosa following chlorine exposure may help promote antibiotic resistance it has been shown that the up regulation of efflux genes may be responsible for broad spectrum persistence in chlorine treated vbnc cells lin et al 2017 additionally exposure of e coli to the antidepressant fluoxetine induces resistance to multiple antibiotics resulting from an increase in the activity of the acrab tolc pump which exports the antibiotics out of the cell jin et al 2018 to further validate if above genes were over expressed in p aeruginosa the expression level of seven genes including oprp mexe mexf oprn czcc pstb and pona were monitored by qpcr during exposure to 4 mg l sodium hypochlorite table 2 surprisingly only mexe was up regulated 1 5 fold after exposure for 20 min this suggests that the mexef oprn efflux pump plays a key role in generation of antibiotic resistance in p aeruginosa following chlorine exposure 3 5 oxidative stress in chlorine injured p aeruginosa antioxidant enzymes including cat gpx and sod are used to protect bacteria from reactive kxygen species ros following sodium hypochlorite exposure 4 mg l the expression of gpx and sod was significantly up regulated fig 3 p 0 05 these results were confirmed by the transcription of antioxidant enzymes mrna expression of the catalase genes kata and katb was up regulated by 3 and 244 fold respectively after chlorine exposure 20 min expression of the sodm and pa2826 genes which encode for sog and gpx was up regulated by 5 11 fold table s4 these results indicate that ros production leads to oxidative stress in chlorine treated p aeruginosa bactericidal antibiotics can also stimulate the production of ros sub lethal concentrations of antibiotics induce mutagenesis by stimulating the production of ros leading to multidrug resistance ma et al 2010 ros also promotes the expression of mexxy components of the mexxy oprm multidrug efflux system and aminoglycoside resistance fraud and poole 2011 therefore oxidative stress in chlorine injured bacteria leads to ros production which promotes the over expression of drug efflux pump and porin for protection from free radical toxicity these results indicate that oxidative stress may be the cause of increased antibiotic resistance in chlorine injured p aeruginosa 4 conclusions cultivable chlorine injured p aeruginosa temporarily improved antibiotic resistance over expression of the mexef oprn efflux pump is responsible for enhanced antibiotic resistance in chlorine injured p aeruginosa injured pathogens can survive from antibiotic exposure by temporary induction of antibiotic resistance

18914,adaption to adverse environments plays an important role in bacterial survival and is receiving increasing globe attention now here cultivable chlorine injured pseudomonas aeruginosa produced on the chlorination process was investigated about their resistance to antibiotics then global transcriptional analyses quantitative pcr qpcr validation and antioxidant enzymes measurement were performed to explore the underlying mechanisms the results showed that chlorine injury enhanced antibiotic resistance in p aeruginosa and cultivable chlorine injured p aeruginosa exposed to 4 mg l sodium hypochlorite half of the lethal dose improved antibiotic resistance against ceftazidime chloramphenicol and ampicillin by 1 4 5 6 fold this increase in antibiotic resistance was not hereditable and over expression of the mexef oprn efflux pump resulting from oxidative stress contributed to it these results demonstrate temporal physiological persistence to antibiotics in cultivable chlorine injured pathogens suggesting their survival from adverse environments with antibiotic exposure and thereby posing lasting hazards to human health graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistant bacteria arb chlorination chlorine injured bacteria mexef oprn 1 introduction infections caused by multi drug resistant pathogens pose a serious public health threat harms et al 2016 and the global transmission of microbes is quickening the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistant genes args zhu et al 2017 multidrug resistant superbugs have been isolated from environmental water skariyachan et al 2013 and aquatic ecosystems which are reservoirs for arb and args baquero et al 2008 xiong et al 2015 and play an important role in promoting antibiotic resistance therefore it is essential to determine the mechanism s of pathogen survival and args transmission in aquatic environments disinfection processes used in water treatment systems are used to control pathogens berry et al 2006 gassie and englehardt 2017 however recent reports have shown increases in antibiotic resistance throughout the water treatment process bai et al 2015 xi et al 2009 xu et al 2016 and in recent years disinfection technology has been found to accelerate the transmission of args via co selection horizontal gene transfer and chromosomal mutations khan et al 2016 lu et al 2018 chlorine tolerant bacteria are more likely to be antibiotic resistant and chlorination may play a role in bacterial antibiotic resistance khan et al 2016 additionally chlorine disinfection

2018 uv disinfection and chlorination can promote conjugative arg transfer guo et al 2015 sub inhibitory concentrations of disinfectants promote horizontal transfer of multidrug resistance genes both within and across genera zhang et al 2017 possible antibiotic resistance inducers such as heavy metals zhang et al 2018 disinfectant byproducts lv et al 2014 and chemical pollutants may also play roles in environmental arb transmission recently it has been found that the induction of viable but non culturable vbnc bacteria by chlorination increases their resistance to antibiotics lin et al 2017 as such bacteria in physiologically dormant or low metabolic states are receiving increasing globe attention for antibiotic resistance and their survival in adverse environments disinfection injured bacteria are physiologically unhealthy and suffer from reversible damage s as a consequence of partial or inappropriate disinfection mcfeters et al 1986 they may account for as much as 90 of all indicator bacteria present after disinfection bissonnette et al 1975 these organisms may pose hazards for downstream applications due to the reversibility of these phenotypes bolster et al 2005 preez et al 1995 generally disinfection injured bacteria are viable but undetectable using specific selective media and as a result their presence is likely underestimated li et al 2017 disinfection injured bacteria include at least two populations vbnc bacteria which have been shown to be antibiotic persistent lin et al 2017 and other organisms that can be cultured in nutritionally rich media the resistance of this second population to antibiotics remains poorly understood here we cultured chlorine induced antibiotic resistant p aeruginosa a representative nosocomial pathogen and examined the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance using global transcriptional analyses quantitative pcr qpcr and antioxidant enzyme measurements we show temporal physiological persistence to antibiotics in cultivable chlorine injured pathogens the results of this study serve to advance our understanding of injured pathogen survival in adverse environments with antibiotics 2 materials and methods 2 1
