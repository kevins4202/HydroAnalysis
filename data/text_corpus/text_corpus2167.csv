volume of each plot was controlled by a water counter before bacteria inoculation the uniform seeds were surface sterilized with 1 5 naocl for 10 min to avoid fungal invasion followed by washing with

cultured with test tube 60 ml on nutrient agar 0 5 as zigzag and incubated at 27 for 48 h subsequently the bacteria were transferred to a tryptic soybean broth tsb fluid medium and placed in a shaker incubator at 37 for 48 h next the culture medium containing the strains was centrifuged at about 7 000 rpm for 5 min until bacteria precipitate bacterial suspensions were adjusted to an absorbance at

software sas institute cary nc usa means were compared by least significant difference lsd at the 1 probability level 3 results the results of the analysis of variance showed that the main effect irrigation regimes on all measured traits were significant while the main effect of bacteria and the interaction effect of irrigation and bacteria were significant on all traits except row number per ear and seed number per row in no bacteria and all strains inoculation reducing irrigation level from i100 to i60 of plant requirements reduced yield components including row number per ear seed number per row and seed number per ear figs 2 and 3 these effects were observed in both years with some differences water deficit at i80 had no significant effect on seed number per row fig 2 only in the first year and thousand seed weight fig 3 in both years while i60 water deficit decreased all yield components in both years table 3 inoculation with p fluorescens p1 and p8 in the first and p8 in the second year increased row number per ear however none of the strain had a significant effect on seed number per row fig 2 in all watering regimes the highest seed number per ear was observed in p fluorescens p1 and p8 in the first year and p8 in the second year fig 3 in the first year all strains enhanced thousand seed weight in all three watering regimes however inoculated sweet corn plants with all strains except p14 had higher grain weight the highest positive effect on thousand seed weight belonged to p1 and p8 in all watering regimes in both fig 3 in both years and in all watering regimes bacteria inoculation had a positive effect on yield components especially seed number per ear and thousand seed weight fig 3 in addition to impacting yield components the bacteria especially p1 and p8 ameliorated the negative effects of water deficit on sweet corn plants as a result water deficit at i60 decreased seed number per ear compared to no stress by 24 0 in no bacteria and by 19 5 26 0 20 0 and 22 5 in p1 p3 p8 and p14 respectively in the first year these values in the second year were 39 5 in no bacteria and 41 0 37 5 39 0 and 37 0 in p1 p3 p8 and p14 respectively besides thousand seed weight was lower in water deficit stressed sweet corn plants than no stress by 20 5 in no bacteria conditions and 16 0 14 5 12 0 and 16 0 in p1 p3 p8 and p14 respectively in the first year in the second year these differences were 17 5 16 5 15 0 11 5 and 16 5 in no bacteria p1 p3 p8 and p14 respectively water deficit at i60 decreased root length and root dry weight at both years root length and root dry weight were lower in i60 than i100 by 20 3 and 15 5 in the first and 33 0 and 14 0 in the second year respectively table 4 in the second year both water deficit stressed regimes i80 and i60 increased root length density by 14 2 and 27 2 respectively in comparison inoculation with p fluorescens strains except p14 improved root growth assessed by root length and root dry weight increases with greatest in corn inoculated with strain p1 in the first year and with strains p1 and p8 in the second year also root length density was the highest in p14 inoculated plants table 4 overall water deficit decreased canned seed yield and ear yield fig 4 and biological yield fig 5 while it increased harvest index fig 5 as a result canned seed yield ear yield and biological yield were less in i60 than i100 conditions by 20 5 15 5 and 26 0 in the first and by 23 0 15 0 and 23 5 in the second year respectively inoculation with all strains of p fluorescens resulted in higher canned seed yield ear yield and biological yield and increased harvest index the highest yields and harvest index were obtained in p1 and p8 strains inoculated plants respectively figs 4 and 5 in both years the higher canned seed yield ear yield and biological yield were observed in p1 and p8 strains inoculation treatments under all three watering regimes in the second year no stressed plants inoculated with p1 strain had the highest canned seed yield 635 50 g m 2 and biological yield 3650 g m 2 whereas the highest ear yield was obtained in plants inoculated with p1 strain under i80 watering 1713 g m 2 the results also showed that reduction due to water deficit stress was decreased in p fluorescens inoculated plants especially in p1 followed by p8 strains for example water deficit at i60 was associated with 23 0 and 27 0 reduction in canned seed yield in no bacteria 17 5 and 20 0 in p1 inoculation and 17 5 and 21 5 in p8 inoculation treatments in the first and second years respectively both levels of water deficit stress increased water use efficiency wue while decreased relative water content rwc in both years fig 6 water deficit stresses at i80 and i60 compared to i100 were associated with 19 44 and 20 0 increase in wue in the first year and 21 0 and 23 0 in the second year respectively in comparison i60 water deficit stress was associated with 28 7 and 26 8 reductions in rwc in the first and second years respectively all plants inoculated with all bacteria treatments had higher wue and rwc however p fluorescens p1 followed by p8 strains had a higher promoting impact in all watering regimes in both years fig 6 4 discussion the decrease in watering regimes from i100 to i80 and i60 was associated with reductions in yield components however in many cases there was no significant difference between i100 and i80 treatments lower yield components reduced canned seed yield and ear yield also this reduction and reduction in plant foliage led to a lower biological yield the occurrence of drought stress during the corn growth cycle may impede the nitrogen and water use efficiencies and lead to significant yield losses ashraf et al 2016 water deficit stress affects almost all aspects of plants including physiology biochemistry and growth metabolism thus it reduces yield most decisively as sufficient availability of water is very critical to the growth and development of plants shao et al 2008 inoculation with p fluorescens increased yield components especially seed number per ear and thousand seed weight which led to higher canned seed yield inoculated sweet corn plants also had higher ear yield and biological yield the increase in ear yield was more than biological yield resulted in a higher harvest index in inoculated plants low nutrients availability limits crop production in soils semi arid regions p fluorescens may improve crop growth due to their ability to enhance nutrients availability eftekhari et al 2009 the main reason for such higher yield components in p fluorescens inoculation probability is related to their vital role in promoting of plant growth by release accumulation and translocation of nutrients such as phosphorus p and iron fe to plant roots another reason could be the decrease in the ethylene levels by hydrolysis of 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid acc the immediate precursor of ethylene in plants zahir et al 2008 ethylene is often considered an aging hormone due to its role in accelerating such developmental processes as ripening senescence and abscission moreover it leads to stunting of growth dodd et al 2010 to consider a bacterium as a suitable pgpr the activity of its acc deaminase should be more than 20 nmol α ketobutyrate mg 1 ha 1 akhgar et al 2011 hence p fluorescens strains used in the current research had the considerable activity of acc deaminase table 2 and could have a growth promoting role another reason for enhancing the role of p fluorescens is probability related to higher photosynthesis rate since delaying aging and consequently higher green stay shinde and thakur 2015 and improved photosynthetic pigments singh and shinde 2017 have been reported in inoculated plants this effect also is related to inducing synthesized auxin as a result of p fluorescens strains inoculation vardharajula et al 2011 indicated that improved water deficit stress tolerance of inoculated plants might be related to accumulated proline and sugars and decreased electrolyte leakage and permeability of membranes furthermore gou et al 2015 believed that the p fluorescens strains were involved in the regulation of osmotic adjustment via accumulations of choline and subsequent glycine betaine resulting in improvement of water relations and water deficit stress tolerance of plants this also can be attributed to pgprs mediated synthesis of auxin and cytokines as well as the synthesis of some antioxidant enzymes and non enzymatic antioxidants such as ascorbic acid gou et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 root growth was considerably impeded by water deficit stress although lower than aboveground parts when water is short shoot growth in many species is more inhibited than root growth also in some cases the absolute biomass of roots has been shown to increase relative to well watered controls water deficit has a more negative effect on root length than root dry weight and thus increases root length density in maize roots continue to grow at low water potentials that cause complete inhibition of shoot growth saab et al 1990 this different effect could be attributed to aba activity it is believed that the accumulation of endogenous aba at low water potentials acts differentially to maintain primary root growth and inhibit shoot growth zhao et al 2015 our results also showed that the above ground part was more sensitive to water deficit stress this different response is attributed to the action of non hydraulic regulatory signals from those roots exposed to dry soil while at the same time the remainder of the root system supplies adequate water to maintain the shoot water status sharp and lenoble 2002 root growth assessed by length and dry weight were also more elevated by p fluorescens especially p1 followed by p8 strains in maize it was reported that inoculation with exopolysaccharides producing bacterial strains improved soil moisture contents and root growth naseem and bano 2014 the pa2 strain isolate was the most potent pgpr under water deficit stress relative water content was reduced as water deficit stress was applied and intensified however inoculation of bacteria especially p1 and p8 could ameliorate this negative effect the higher relative water content might be due to the concentration of plant hormones such as auxin and abscisic acid aba in the leaf of sweet corn therefore it has been reported that bacteria inoculated maize casanovas et al 2002 or wheat creus et al 2004 had higher rwc under stress condition because of bacterial aba that induces stomatal closure and mitigates drought stress although all tested p fluorescens strains significantly influenced yield components yields root growth and water use efficiency p1 and p8 had a more significant effect compared to other strains diverse effects of different strains could be because of the difference in synthesized auxin activity of acc deaminase ability to solubilize phosphate and siderophore production between the strains table 2 p1 and p8 strains affect root growth characteristics with having moderate acc deaminase and auxin synthesis activity and also they can increase nutrients availability such as phosphorus and iron with having the most ability to solubilize phosphate by producing organic and inorganic acids and reducing ph and siderophore production with formation of iron siderophore complex as a result lead to yields improvement due to increase in photosynthetic assimilates production the highest synthesized auxin found in f14 strain can lead to more acc as the main precursor of ethylene process less root growth and consequently less yield akhgar et al 2011 the lower root growth is associated with reduced yield through less absorbed resources such as nutrient and water sharp and lenoble 2002 moreover experimental evidence indicated that the activity of acc deaminase was the key factor in the ability of pgpr to stimulate the elongation of plant roots glick et al 1998 the moderate activity of acc deaminase results in a balance between acc deaminase activity and root growth akhgar et al 2011 5 conclusions sweet corn shoot and root growth and yield were significantly reduced in i60 watering regimes however in many cases there was no significant difference between i100 and i80 treatments inoculation with p fluorescens strains not only promoted growth and yield but also ameliorated the adverse impact of water deficit stress strains p1 and p8 were most effective these two strains with having moderate acc deaminase and auxin synthesis activity and the most ability to solubilize phosphate and siderophore production increased plant growth by reducing ethylene stress growth hormones production such as auxin and increasing availability of nutrients such as phosphorus and iron watering inoculated sweet corn at i80 is recommended for further investigations acknowledgments the project was financed by a

the first year and thousand seed weight fig 3 in both years while i60 water deficit decreased all yield components in both years table 3 inoculation with p fluorescens p1 and p8 in the first and p8 in the second year increased row number per ear however none of the strain had a significant effect on seed number per row fig 2 in all watering regimes the highest seed number per ear was observed in p fluorescens p1 and p8 in the first year and p8 in the second year fig 3 in the first year all strains enhanced thousand seed weight in all three watering regimes however inoculated sweet corn plants with all strains except p14 had higher grain weight the highest positive effect on thousand seed weight belonged to p1 and p8 in all watering regimes in both fig 3 in both years and in all watering regimes bacteria inoculation had a positive effect on yield components especially seed number per ear and thousand seed weight fig 3 in addition to impacting yield components the bacteria especially p1 and p8 ameliorated the negative effects of water deficit on sweet corn plants as a result water deficit at i60 decreased seed number per ear compared to no stress by 24 0 in no bacteria and by 19 5 26 0 20 0 and 22 5 in p1 p3 p8 and p14 respectively in the first year these values in the second year were 39 5 in no bacteria and 41 0 37 5 39 0 and 37 0 in p1 p3 p8 and p14 respectively besides thousand seed weight was lower in water deficit stressed sweet corn plants than no stress by 20 5 in no bacteria conditions and 16 0 14 5 12 0 and 16 0 in p1 p3 p8 and p14 respectively in the first year in the second year these differences were 17 5 16 5 15 0 11 5 and 16 5 in no bacteria p1 p3 p8 and p14 respectively water deficit at i60 decreased root length and root dry weight at both years root length and root dry weight were lower in i60 than i100 by 20 3 and 15 5 in the first and 33 0 and 14 0 in the second year respectively table 4 in the second year both water deficit stressed regimes i80 and i60 increased root length density by 14 2 and 27 2 respectively in comparison inoculation with p fluorescens strains except p14 improved root growth assessed by root length and root dry weight increases with greatest in corn inoculated with strain p1 in the first year and with strains p1 and p8 in the second year also root length density was the highest in p14 inoculated plants table 4 overall water deficit decreased canned seed yield and ear yield fig 4 and biological yield fig 5 while it increased harvest index fig 5 as a result canned seed yield ear yield and biological yield were less in i60 than i100 conditions by 20 5 15 5 and 26 0 in the first and by 23 0 15 0 and 23 5 in the second year respectively inoculation with all strains of p fluorescens resulted in higher canned seed yield ear yield and biological yield and increased harvest index the highest yields and harvest index were obtained in p1 and p8 strains inoculated plants respectively figs 4 and 5 in both years the higher canned seed yield ear yield and biological yield were observed in p1 and p8 strains inoculation treatments under all three watering regimes in the second year no stressed plants inoculated with p1 strain had the highest canned seed yield 635 50 g m 2 and biological yield 3650 g m 2 whereas the highest ear yield was obtained in plants inoculated with p1 strain under i80 watering 1713 g m 2 the results also showed that reduction due to water deficit stress was decreased in p fluorescens inoculated plants especially in p1 followed by p8 strains for example water deficit at i60 was associated with 23 0 and 27 0 reduction in canned seed yield in no bacteria 17 5 and 20 0 in p1 inoculation and 17 5 and 21 5 in p8 inoculation treatments in the first and second years respectively both levels of water deficit stress increased water use efficiency wue while decreased relative water content rwc in both years fig 6 water deficit stresses at i80 and i60 compared to i100 were associated with 19 44 and 20 0 increase in wue in the first year and 21 0 and 23 0 in the second year respectively in comparison i60 water deficit stress was associated with 28 7 and 26 8 reductions in rwc in the first and second years respectively all plants inoculated with all bacteria treatments had higher wue and rwc however p fluorescens p1 followed by p8 strains had a higher promoting impact in all watering regimes in both years fig 6 4 discussion the decrease in watering regimes from i100 to i80 and i60 was associated with reductions in yield components however in many cases there was no significant difference between i100 and i80 treatments lower yield components reduced canned seed yield and ear yield also this reduction and reduction in plant foliage led to a lower biological yield the occurrence of drought stress during the corn growth cycle may impede the nitrogen and water use efficiencies and lead to significant yield losses ashraf et al 2016 water deficit stress affects almost all aspects of plants including physiology biochemistry and growth metabolism thus it reduces yield most decisively as sufficient availability of water is very critical to the growth and development of plants shao et al 2008 inoculation with p fluorescens increased yield components especially seed number per ear and thousand seed weight which led to higher canned seed yield inoculated sweet corn plants also had higher ear yield and biological yield the increase in ear yield was more than biological yield resulted in a higher harvest index in inoculated plants low nutrients availability limits crop production in soils semi arid regions p fluorescens may improve crop growth due to their ability to enhance nutrients availability eftekhari et al 2009 the main reason for such higher yield components in p fluorescens inoculation probability is related to their vital role in promoting of plant growth by release accumulation and translocation of nutrients such as phosphorus p and iron fe to plant roots another reason could be the decrease in the ethylene levels by hydrolysis of 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid acc the immediate precursor of ethylene in plants zahir et al 2008 ethylene is often considered an aging hormone due to its role in accelerating such developmental processes as ripening senescence and abscission moreover it leads to stunting of growth dodd et al 2010 to consider a bacterium as a suitable pgpr the activity of its acc deaminase should be more than 20 nmol α ketobutyrate mg 1 ha 1 akhgar et al 2011 hence p fluorescens strains used in the current research had the considerable activity of acc deaminase table 2 and could have a growth promoting role another reason for enhancing the role of p fluorescens is probability related to higher photosynthesis rate since delaying aging and consequently higher green stay shinde and thakur 2015 and improved photosynthetic pigments singh and shinde 2017 have been reported in inoculated plants this effect also is related to inducing synthesized auxin as a result of p fluorescens strains inoculation vardharajula et al 2011 indicated that improved water deficit stress tolerance of inoculated plants might be related to accumulated proline and sugars and decreased electrolyte leakage and permeability of membranes furthermore gou et al 2015 believed that the p fluorescens strains were involved in the regulation of osmotic adjustment via accumulations of choline and subsequent glycine betaine resulting in improvement of water relations and water deficit stress tolerance of plants this also can be attributed to pgprs mediated synthesis of auxin and cytokines as well as the synthesis of some antioxidant enzymes and non enzymatic antioxidants such as ascorbic acid gou et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 root growth was considerably impeded by water deficit stress although lower than aboveground parts when water is short shoot growth in many species is more inhibited than root growth also in some cases the absolute biomass of roots has been shown to increase relative to well watered controls water deficit has a more negative effect on root length than root dry weight and thus increases root length density in maize roots continue to grow at low water potentials that cause complete inhibition of shoot growth saab et al 1990 this different effect could be attributed to aba activity it is believed that the accumulation of endogenous aba at low water potentials acts differentially to maintain primary root growth and inhibit shoot growth zhao et al 2015 our results also showed that the above ground part was more sensitive to water deficit stress this different response is attributed to the action of non hydraulic regulatory signals from those roots exposed to dry soil while at the same time the remainder of the root system supplies adequate water to maintain the shoot water status sharp and lenoble 2002 root growth assessed by length and dry weight were also more elevated by p fluorescens especially p1 followed by p8 strains in maize it was reported that inoculation with exopolysaccharides producing bacterial strains improved soil moisture contents and root growth naseem and bano 2014 the pa2 strain isolate was the most potent pgpr under water deficit stress relative water content was reduced as water deficit stress was applied and intensified however inoculation of bacteria especially p1 and p8 could ameliorate this negative effect the higher relative water content might be due to the concentration of plant hormones such as auxin and abscisic acid aba in the leaf of sweet corn therefore it has been reported that bacteria inoculated maize casanovas et al 2002 or wheat creus et al 2004 had higher rwc under stress condition because of bacterial aba that induces stomatal closure and mitigates drought stress although all tested p fluorescens strains significantly influenced yield components yields root growth and water use efficiency p1 and p8 had a more significant effect compared to other strains diverse effects of different strains could be because of the difference in synthesized auxin activity of acc deaminase ability to solubilize phosphate and siderophore production between the strains table 2 p1 and p8 strains affect root growth characteristics with having moderate acc deaminase and auxin synthesis activity and also they can increase nutrients availability such as phosphorus and iron with having the most ability to solubilize phosphate by producing organic and inorganic acids and reducing ph and siderophore production with formation of iron siderophore complex as a result lead to yields improvement due to increase in photosynthetic assimilates production the highest synthesized auxin found in f14 strain can lead to more acc as the main precursor of ethylene process less root growth and consequently less yield akhgar et al 2011 the lower root growth is associated with reduced yield through less absorbed resources such as nutrient and water sharp and lenoble 2002 moreover experimental evidence indicated that the activity of acc deaminase was the key factor in the ability of pgpr to stimulate the elongation of plant roots glick et al 1998 the moderate activity of acc deaminase results in a balance between acc deaminase activity and root growth akhgar et al 2011 5 conclusions sweet corn shoot and root growth and yield were significantly reduced in i60 watering regimes however in many cases there was no significant difference between i100 and i80 treatments inoculation with p fluorescens strains not only promoted growth and yield but also ameliorated the adverse impact of water deficit stress strains p1 and p8 were most effective these two strains with having moderate acc deaminase and auxin synthesis activity and the most ability to solubilize phosphate and siderophore production increased plant growth by reducing ethylene stress growth hormones production such as auxin and increasing availability of nutrients such as phosphorus and iron watering inoculated sweet corn at i80 is recommended for further investigations acknowledgments the project was financed by a

10836,the vast majority of farmers in sub saharan africa depend on rainfed agriculture for food production and livelihood various factors including but not limited to rainfall variability land degradation and low soil fertility constrain agricultural productivity in the region the objectives of this study were to 1 estimate the water resources potential to sustain small scale irrigation ssi in ethiopia during the dry season so as to expand food supply by growing vegetables and 2 understand the gaps and constraints of vegetable production the case studies were conducted in the robit and dangishta watersheds of the upper blue nile basin ethiopia to document farmers cropping practices field level data were collected from 36 households who had been cultivating tomato solanum lycopersicum l and onion allium cepa l during the dry season november april two components of the integrated decision support system idss the soil and water assessment tool swat and agricultural policy environmental extender apex were respectively used to assess impacts of ssi at the watershed and field scale levels results suggest that there is a substantial amount of surface runoff and shallow groundwater recharge at the watershed scale the field scale analysis in the robit watershed indicated that optimal tomato yield could be obtained with 500 mm of water and 200 to 250 kg ha of urea applied with 50 kg ha of diammonium phosphate dap in dangishta optimum onion yield can be obtained with 400 mm of water and 120 to 180 kg ha of urea applied with 50 kg ha of dap the field scale simulation indicated that the average shallow groundwater recharge after accounting for other groundwater users such as household and livestock use was not sufficient to meet tomato and onion water demand in the dry season october to april the field scale analysis also indicated that soil evaporation attributed a significant proportion of evapotranspiration 60 for onion and 40 for tomato use of mulching or other soil and water conservation interventions could optimize irrigation water for vegetable production by reducing soil evaporation and thereby increasing water availability in the crop

2011 this study aims at identifying the water resource potential constraints and gaps in tomato and onion production in the robit and dahgishta watersheds in the lake tana sub basin of the upper blue nile basin ethiopia the gaps and constraints of tomato and onion production were evaluated by randomly selecting 36 farmers to grow tomato and onion in robit and dahgishta watersheds half of the farmers grew a tomato in robit while the other half grew onion in dangishta field level data were collected from the 36 households to document farmers cropping practices two components of the integrated decision support system idss clarke et al 2016 worqlul et al 2018c were used to evaluate the water resource potential and the impacts of fertilizer and irrigation water on tomato and onion

simulations of the water resource potential irrigation and fertilizer responses of onion and tomato in robit and dahgishta were presented 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study watersheds robit and dangishta are located in the lake tana sub basin of the blue nile basin ethiopia robit watershed is located east of lake tana between 11 37 00 n 37 26 00 e and 11 42 00 n 37 31 00 e and the dangishta watershed is located between 11 13 54 1 n 36 50 24 9 e and 11 20 15 9 n 36 53 54 48 e fig 1 the areas at the watersheds outlets are approximately 15 km2 and 30 km2 for robit and dangishta respectively the watersheds elevation extracted from a 30 m digital elevation model dem ranges between 1795 and 2045 m for robit and 2036 and 2206 m for dangishta robit watershed has an average slope of 8 while that of dangishta is 5 both watersheds possess a relatively higher groundwater potential in the lake tana basin and farmers have experience with smallholder irrigation water lifting technologies to draw water from shallow wells in the study sites range from motor pumps to manual water lifting devices 2 2 methods in this study to understand the water resource potential gaps and constraints of agricultural practices in the upper blue nile basin the study was undertaken in four stages a field data on tomato and onion production that included information on soils weather cultural practices inputs and yield were collected from 36 randomly selected farmers in robit and dahgishta watersheds half of the farmers grew a tomato in robit while the other half grew onion in dangishta the collected data were analyzed to identify constraints and gaps in tomato and onion production in addition the collected data were used to parameterize the swat and apex models while rainfall data were used to characterize the rainfall pattern of the two watersheds b the swat model was used to investigate the water resource potentials of the robit and dangishta watersheds including rainfall distribution patterns and totals shallow groundwater recharge and surface runoff c the apex model was calibrated using predicted swat streamflow and field data to capture the measured tomato and onion yield d finally the calibrated apex model was used to determine the optimum water and fertilizer amounts to maximize tomato and onion yield see section 2 1 4 2 2 1 field experiments and data collection details of the collected field data are presented in nakawuka et al 2017 schmitter et al 2016 and used to set up the apex model data were collected at robit and dangishta field sites by faculty scientists and students of bahir dar university bdu and the international water management institute iwmi addis ababa the field dataset included 18 farmer households in each watershed growing vegetables in the dry season using irrigation water from shallow groundwater wells in robit watershed farmers grew tomato while in dangishta farmers grew onion water was withdrawn using a rope and washer rwp and rope with pulley and bucket rp pumps the majority of the farmers in robit used rwp 11 farmers but in dangishta they were divided equally the method of irrigation scheduling varied among households in robit ten of the households scheduled irrigation by measuring soil moisture with a time domain reflectometer tdr delta t devices ltd see appendix 1 while others applied irrigation based on their traditional knowledge farmer s traditional practice ftp in dangishta all farmers managed irrigation by measuring the soil moisture half of the households scheduled irrigation using tdr while the other half used wetting front detectors wfd fullstop see appendix 1 the use of the wfd and tdr was meant to improve water use efficiency in the vegetable plots the field sizes varied from 100 to 230 m2 the tomato variety grown was shanty pm and the onion variety was allium cepa plant population irrigation and fertilizer amounts and application dates soil moisture plant height and yield were recorded following planting fertilizer amounts and application dates are shown in table 1 for onion diammonium phosphate dap was applied immediately after planting for tomato urea was applied was applied about a month from planting table 1 soil samples collected from the top 30 cm were processed to determine the physical and chemical properties of the soil compiled soil properties include information on texture field capacity organic matter ph total nitrogen available phosphorus and electric conductivity 2 2 2 rainfall data analysis of robit and dangishta watersheds the watersheds are equipped with an automatic rain gauge station since 2014 two nearby weather stations bahir dar robit watershed and dangila dangishta watershed operated by metrological agency of ethiopia mae have collected daily weather data since 1960s the annual rainfall from 1994 to 2016 varies between 1100 to 1900 mm in robit with a standard deviation of 190 mm in dangishta rainfall varies between 1200 to 2000 mm with a standard deviation of 240 mm daily rainfall data of the two nearby towns along with the rainfall data collected at the field sites were used to analyze the rainfall pattern of the two watersheds from 1994 to 2016 the average monthly rainfall and number of raining days were calculated to estimate rainfall contribution during the vegetable growing period we also used the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 svoboda et al 2012 to characterize meteorological drought during the irrigation period detailed information on the mathematical computations of the spi can be obtained from the world meteorological organization bonaccorso et al 2015 in summary the growing season precipitation data were fitted to a probability distribution which was then transformed into a normal distribution because the spi is normalized the index can capture both dry and wet events in the same computation svoboda et al 2012 spi value refers to the number of standard deviation that the growing season rainfall would deviate from the long term average precipitation spi value ranges between 1 and 1 represent a near normal season while spi values between 1 and 2 represent moderately wet conditions and spi greater than 2 represents an extremely wet season spi values between 1 and 2 represent moderately dry conditions while spi less than 2 represents extremely dry conditions 2 2 3 watershed and field scale simulation simulation models can be used as a research tool to help improve the current understanding of the hydrology basic physiology of crop growth development and yield hunt et al 1998 for optimum results the model should ideally be calibrated and validated with observed data for this study streamflow agronomic and yield data collected at the robit and dangishta field sites were used for swat and apex model calibration and validation 2 2 3 1 swat and apex models although swat and apex models differ substantially they share many common attributes including the ability to simulate the effect of crop management practices on agricultural production and the environment arnold et al 1994 gassman et al 1998 williams et al 1998 the swat model is a basin scale distributed hydrological model in swat a watershed can be divided into multiple sub watersheds and further into multiple hydrologic response units hrus the hrus are assumed to have homogeneous land use soil and slope combinations soil water content nutrient cycles surface runoff and sediment yield are simulated at hru level and then aggregated to each sub basin before being routed through the stream network further to the outlet neitsch et al 2005 apex is a field or small watershed scale model in apex a sub watershed is assumed to have a single hru and is called a subarea unlike hrus in swat apex subareas have a spatial relationship and can be routed in a specified order saleh et al 2008 apex is capable of simulating detailed field conditions including crop management and growth nutrient and pesticide fate hydrology soil temperature erosion sedimentation as well as costs and returns of the various management practices saleh and gallego 2007 wang et al 2011 worqlul et al 2018a both swat and apex operate on a daily time step swat and apex share similar spatial input data including digital elevation model dem soil and land use the dem used to characterize the watersheds in this study has a spatial resolution of 30 m the soil data contains physical and chemical properties for swat the land use and soil spatial data were obtained from the ethiopia ministry of water irrigation and electricity emwie while for apex soil and land use information was collected at the field sites the main streamflow calibration parameters for both swat and apex were identified based on the literature review bitew and gebremichael 2010 mengistu and sorteberg 2012 2 2 3 2 swat and apex model setup calibration and validation streamflow at the outlets of the robit and dangishta watersheds has been monitored from june 2015 to september 2016 to better capture the water balance components of the watersheds observed long term streamflow data of the nearby watersheds of gumara for robit and gilgel abay for dangishta were used to calibrate the swat model observed streamflow of gumara and gilgel abay were obtained from the emwie for the period 1994 to 2016 swat model was calibrated using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm under the swat calibration uncertainty procedures swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 the streamflow simulation periods of swat for gumara and gilgel abay watersheds were divided into warm up 1994 calibration 1995 to 2010 and validation 2011 to 2016 periods the calibrated swat model parameters were transferred to the respective robit and dangishta watersheds based on the assumption that catchments proxy to each other will likely have similar runoff regime leading to similar model parameters which are used to initialize robit and dangishata swat model set ups wale et al 2009 worqlul et al 2018a the transferred parameters were further fine tuned to adequately capture the observed streamflow of the robit and dangishta watersheds the purpose of the swat simulation at the watershed scale was to access the spatial and temporal distribution of available surface runoff and shallow groundwater potential at the smallest hydrological response units hrus the apex model set up calibration and validation were achieved using the information on soils weather cultural practices and management data gathered in the farmers fields adjustments with respect to default crop parameters for tomato and onion were minor model calibration was achieved using auto calibration and uncertainty estimator apex cute wang et al 2014 the apex crop yield calibration was based on 2015 2016 field data the calibrated apex model was used to develop tomato and onion input production functions on water and fertilizer to understand constraints and gaps of vegetable production in the robit and dangishta watersheds a detailed discussion of the water and fertilizer production functions is given under section 2 1 4 table 2 shows the list of selected parameters and their respective model parameter space used to calibrate the swat and apex models 2 2 3 3 swat and apex model performance evaluation the simulated daily streamflow and vegetable yield were compared with the observed data and the simulation performance was evaluated with multiple statistics that include coefficient of determination r squared root mean square error rmse percent bias pbias and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse r square evaluates the degree of linear association between simulated and observed variable while pbias measures the relative volume difference between simulated and observed variables nse is the normalized statistic that describes the relative magnitude of residual variance compared to the observed streamflow variance 2 2 4 water and fertilizer production function appropriate irrigation water management is important to preserve water resources and to minimize a farmer s workload while optimizing crop productivity the water use efficiency of onion and tomato were developed by running the calibrated apex model multiple times over a 22 year period 1995 to 2016 while varying the irrigation amounts at two day intervals the two day irrigation interval used in the model was to match the practices by the farmers in the field studies for farmers the two day irrigation interval allowed them to have sufficient water to recharge the shallow groundwater wells the irrigation scenario was developed for a total amounts of water ranging from 100 to 700 mm at 100 mm intervals i e 100 200 300 400 500 600 and 700 mm irrigation amounts that were applied throughout the growing period for example for tomato which has a 170 day growing period 8 33 mm of water was applied every two days for a total irrigation of 700 mm the optimal amount of water was associated with the volume of water producing the maximum yield similarly the fertilizer production function i e the response of onion and tomato yield to the amount of fertilizer applied was developed by running the calibrated apex model at the optimal applied water level estimated with the water production function and applying different amounts of urea and diammonium phosphate dap again the timing of fertilizer application was the same as in the farmer managed field studies with dap applied at seeding and urea applied one month from planting for onion and multiple times for tomato urea used in the field studies contains 46 percent nitrogen dap is used commonly in ethiopia and it is the source of phosphorus and nitrogen containing 46 percent and 18 percent respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 field data analysis out of the 36 plots irrigation amounts and yield were successfully recorded on 27 plots 16 onion and 11 tomato plots the remaining plots were damaged by pest or grazed by animals or irrigation was stopped due to water shortage in robit farmers using tdr to manage irrigation applied water more frequently approximately every 1 8 days compared to farmers that used ftp on average water was applied every 2 1 days higher variability was found for the applied irrigation water in ftp compared to tdr practice with a coefficient of variation of 27 1 and 15 5 respectively tomato yield between the two management practices was significantly different p 0 05 on average yields of the ftp managed plots were half of the tdr managed plots in dangishta the total number of irrigation days between wfd and tdr managed field plots were not significantly different the field data also indicated that wfd managed plots were irrigated with a lower coefficient of variability 23 0 compared to tdr practice 36 0 onion yields between the two irrigation management treatments were not significantly different overall the field data did not show a significant linear relationship between total water applied and yield for both vegetables and water management practices except in robit where the traditional farmers practice indicated a significant inverse linear relationship between the amount of water applied and yield with a correlation coefficient of 0 62 tomato is a deep rooted crop with roots reaching up to 60 to 90 cm therefore irrigation management with the tdr which only measures soil moisture in the top 20 cm of soil could not be effective at later growth stages of the crop when the crop had developed much deeper roots however for onion which has a root depth varying between 30 and 45 cm the tdr irrigation management practice can be effective while monitoring of soil moisture dynamics of agricultural land is vital to improve water productivity it is important to measure additionally the deeper soil moisture layers aside from the topsoil horizon furthermore the field data indicated that pests and diseases were the main constraints on tomato production as 38 of the 18 plots failed at different times during the growing period in addition in robit water use competition between the commonly grown cash crop catha eduli khat and tomato was reported khat a perennial tree crop which has a high return on investment has become an irresistible investment for farmers 3 2 water resource assessment 3 2 1 rainfall data analysis the long term average monthly rainfall and the average number of raining days for robit and dangishta watersheds are shown in fig 2 1994 to 2016 both watersheds show a similar unimodal rainfall pattern receiving 60 to 94 of the annual rainfall in the major rainfall season june through september on average the number of raining days exceeds 18 days per month during the major rainfall season june to september with a higher percentage of rain every two days fig 2 months before and after the major rainfall season may and october indicated an average of more than 8 raining days the dry season extends from november through april during this period the number of raining days and the rainfall amount are insufficient to support vegetable production the average rainfall during tomato and onion growing periods is approximately 122 and 60 mm respectively with standard deviations of 60 and 38 mm respectively 1994 to 2016 most of the rainfall during this period comes at the end of the growing period the rainfall pattern for the vegetable growing season for the period 1994 2016 was further analyzed to evaluate the severity of meteorological drought using the standardized precipitation index fig 3 the spi shows that 86 and 77 of the study period in robit and dangishta watersheds respectively received above normal rainfall whereas the other years were identified as moderately dry the analysis does not indicate a strong rainfall contribution in the dry season furthermore higher rainfall variability is observed in robit with a coefficient of variation of 57 compared to 49 for dangishta watershed 3 2 2 watershed scale analysis the performance of swat model in simulating streamflow for gumara and gilgel abay watershed was reasonably good with a nash sutcliff efficiencies nse of 0 80 and 0 83 respectively and percent bias pbias of 5 4 and 6 4 respectively for the calibration period 1995 to 2010 similar model performance was also reported in worqlul et al 2018b adem et al 2014 and setegn et al 2010 the model was validated from 2011 to 2016 and the performance was acceptable with nse of 0 78 and 0 80 and pbias of 6 4 and 5 6 for gumara and gilgel abay watersheds respectively the calibrated and validated model parameters were transferred to the robit and dangishta watersheds the parameters were further fine tuned to adequately capture the observed streamflow of robit and dangishta watersheds june 2015 to sep 2016 fig 4 shows the performance of the swat model in simulating monthly streamflow of dangishta watershed the simulation also indicated the spatial distribution of groundwater recharge and surface runoff of robit and dangishta watersheds fig 5 a d in robit the average annual surface runoff varies between 440 and 535 mm fig 5a and the annual average groundwater recharge varies between 250 and 320 mm in dangishta surface runoff and groundwater recharge vary between 195 300 and 285 456 mm respectively fig 5c and d the availability of water resource both as surface and shallow groundwater recharge suggests that small scale irrigation ssi technologies could be utilized to grow crops in the dry season 3 3 field scale simulation 3 3 1 apex crop yield simulation the apex model was set up for the seven onion and nine tomato undisturbed field plots in dangishta and robit watersheds respectively the selected field plots had adequate datasets for the apex model set up the remaining field plots did not have soil physical and chemical properties to set up the apex model the performance of the apex model in simulating crop yield in the two watersheds is shown in fig 6 a and b the model adequately captured the observed tomato and onion yields for tomato 89 of the yield variability was captured by the model with a rmse of 5 3 t ha for the onion the apex model captured 93 of the yield variability with a rmse of 0 89 t ha however the apex model was unable to adequately predict observed high yields 3 3 2 water use efficiency of tomato and onion irrigation scheduling with the right amount and timing is critical for sustainable and optimal use of scarce water resources results of the 22 year apex simulation of tomato yield and number of water stress days for irrigation input amounts ranging from 100 to 700 mm are shown in fig 7 a and b the number of water stress days were estimated by comparing the available amount of soil water in the root zone and daily demand required for optimal growth for example the number of water stress days is estimated at 0 1 days if the root zone readily available soil moisture meets only 90 of the optimal crop water requirement in robit when tomato was grown with 100 mm of water the yield was limited by water stress with an average of 25 stress days when the irrigation amount increased to 200 mm the number of water stress days declined by 24 and consequently yield increased by 20 as irrigation approached 500 mm and beyond yields did not significantly increase p value 0 05 the irrigation production function indicated that tomato yield was maximized when an average amount of 500 mm of water was applied indicating an average of 3 water stress days throughout the growing period fig 7a for dangishta 400 mm was the optimal amount of water for onion production fig 7b the optimal irrigation water required to grow tomato and onion estimated with the field scale apex model was close to the shallow groundwater recharge however all of the recharge is not available for cropping as groundwater must also provide for the smallholder farmer s domestic and livestock needs while needs vary amongst smallholders altchenko and villholth 2014 and pavelic et al 2013 estimate that smallholder farmers use 20 30 of the groundwater to support their domestic and livestock needs which potentially limits the amount of water available for irrigating crops while groundwater recharge and surface runoff during the wet season can supplement rainfall capturing and retaining runoff for use during the dry season remains a challenge the water balance components including actual evapotranspiration aet plant transpiration trs runoff q percolation below the root zone prk potential evapotranspiration pet and rainfall prcp for the growing season were estimated using the apex model for tomato and onion fig 8 shows the different water balance components of the 200 400 and 600 mm of irrigation amounts in all cases the evapotranspiration demand could not be met when 200 mm of water was applied as a result very little runoff was generated actual evaporation eta was satisfied when an irrigation of 400 mm was applied in robit however runoff generated for 400 mm of irrigation did not differ significantly compared to 200 mm of irrigation when the irrigation increased from 400 to 600 mm and above more water was lost through percolation below the root zone in dangishta and as surface runoff in robit the results also illustrate that for onion production a significant amount of water was lost through soil evaporation actual evapotranspiration minus transpiration approximately 60 to 65 of the actual evapotranspiration was lost as soil evaporation resulting from low leaf area coverage fig 8b the soil evaporation component for tomato was approximately 30 to 40 of the total evapotranspiration hence adding a protective layer to cover the soil such as organic mulch and net shading to protect the soil from incoming solar radiation or using efficient water application techniques such as drip irrigation to minimize soil evaporation could extend the limited amounts of shallow groundwater for vegetable production in the dry season 3 3 3 fertilizer use efficiency of tomato and onion optimal fertilizer application is necessary to maximize crop yield surveys conducted by the central statistical authority csa and the livestock and irrigation value chains for ethiopian smallholders lives indicated that fertilizer applied for most crops in ethiopia is far below the recommended rate awulachew et al 2005 zerfu and larson 2010 it is estimated that only 30 40 of smallholders use fertilizer rashid et al 2013 insufficient fertilizer application stifles productivity and depletes soil nutrients and organic matter using the apex model a fertilizer production function for tomato and onion was developed to determine the fertilizer amount required for optimal production in the study sites the fertilizer production function was developed by applying the optimal amount of water estimated under section 3 3 2 and different combinations of urea and dap apex simulated results of the fertilizer production function are shown in fig 9 a and b when the tomato was grown with no fertilizer a low fresh yield of approximately 2 5 t ha was obtained similarly when onion was grown with no fertilizer a very low fresh yield of approximately 0 12 t ha was obtained for both crops yield response to increased n urea was low when dap was not applied the fertilizer production function indicates that for both crops yield increases when urea and dap application rates increase however the yield response to increased fertilizer application above the optimal amount was insignificant fig 9a and b in robit optimal tomato yield could be obtained when 200 to 250 kg ha of urea with 50 kg ha of dap is applied while in dangishta optimum onion yield can be obtained when 120 to 180 kg ha of urea with 50 kg ha of dap is applied however in both study sites farmers applied higher amounts of fertilizer a practice detrimental to the environment the excess nutrients from fertilizer can be washed away into the river system or contaminate groundwater through leaching 4 conclusion the field data collected in the 36 farmers managed plots in robit and dangishta watersheds coupled with the swat and apex simulation model results revealed the water resource potential gaps constraints and opportunities of vegetable production in ethiopia the hydro meteorological data analysis indicated a potentially large availability of groundwater to support irrigation in the dry season despite the limited rainfall of 60 mm over the growing period the rainfall distribution pattern also indicated a great deal of variability with a coefficient of variation of 49 and 63 in robit and dangishta respectively the temporal variability manifested in terms of variable mean seasonal distribution patterns would cause a severe crop failure to support vegetable production in the dry season the apex predicted optimal water required to grow tomato and onion were close to the shallow groundwater recharge however all of the recharge is not available for cropping as groundwater must also provide for the smallholder s domestic and livestock needs indicating that water could be a constraint for intensification of dry season irrigation on both sites on top of this the other constraint for vegetable production in robit was water use competition of khat with other vegetable crops that grew in the dry season and the need to control pests and diseases that claimed a large proportion of tomato plots resulting in productivity failures the field data and observations revealed significant differences and gaps in knowledge of farmers and their understanding of managing irrigation fertilization and pest control traditional or common irrigation practices used by farmers were highly variable in the timing and amounts of water applied however when farmers used soil moisture monitoring instruments to schedule irrigation water applications became more consistent and yield improved the study also revealed that even though monitoring the soil moisture dynamics of agricultural land is vital to improve the water productivity it is important to select appropriate soil moisture measuring devices to monitor soil moisture dynamics across the crop root depth deep rooted crop such as tomatoes soil moisture was successfully monitored with wfd while tdr supported soil moisture based irrigation of shallow rooted vegetable the apex simulation revealed the adverse environmental impact of over irrigation applying irrigation exceeding the optimal crop water requirement increased surface runoff and leaching resulting in nutrient losses the fertilizer production function indicated that tomato and onion are optimized when urea was applied in combination with dap given the country rising income level and rapidly growing population and considering tomato and onion are the basic constituents

10836,the vast majority of farmers in sub saharan africa depend on rainfed agriculture for food production and livelihood various factors including but not limited to rainfall variability land degradation and low soil fertility constrain agricultural productivity in the region the objectives of this study were to 1 estimate the water resources potential to sustain small scale irrigation ssi in ethiopia during the dry season so as to expand food supply by growing vegetables and 2 understand the gaps and constraints of vegetable production the case studies were conducted in the robit and dangishta watersheds of the upper blue nile basin ethiopia to document farmers cropping practices field level data were collected from 36 households who had been cultivating tomato solanum lycopersicum l and onion allium cepa l during the dry season november april two components of the integrated decision support system idss the soil and water assessment tool swat and agricultural policy environmental extender apex were respectively used to assess impacts of ssi at the watershed and field scale levels results suggest that there is a substantial amount of surface runoff and shallow groundwater recharge at the watershed scale the field scale analysis in the robit watershed indicated that optimal tomato yield could be obtained with 500 mm of water and 200 to 250 kg ha of urea applied with 50 kg ha of diammonium phosphate dap in dangishta optimum onion yield can be obtained with 400 mm of water and 120 to 180 kg ha of urea applied with 50 kg ha of dap the field scale simulation indicated that the average shallow groundwater recharge after accounting for other groundwater users such as household and livestock use was not sufficient to meet tomato and onion water demand in the dry season october to april the field scale analysis also indicated that soil evaporation attributed a significant proportion of evapotranspiration 60 for onion and 40 for tomato use of mulching or other soil and water conservation interventions could optimize irrigation water for vegetable production by reducing soil evaporation and thereby increasing water availability in the crop

high potential for tomato and onion production because of various factors favorable to growing these crops including topography climate and soil hunde 2017 however the current production is very low due to agronomic institutional and market constraints sustainable tomato and onion production would require overcoming these constraints by improving agricultural inputs such as water and fertilizer

2011 this study aims at identifying the water resource potential constraints and gaps in tomato and onion production in the robit and dahgishta watersheds in the lake tana sub basin of the upper blue nile basin ethiopia the gaps and constraints of tomato and onion production were evaluated by randomly selecting 36 farmers to grow tomato and onion in robit and dahgishta watersheds half of the farmers grew a tomato in robit while the other half grew onion in dangishta field level data were collected from the 36 households to document farmers cropping practices two components of the integrated decision support system idss clarke et al 2016 worqlul et al 2018c were used to evaluate the water resource potential and the impacts of fertilizer and irrigation water on tomato and onion

simulations of the water resource potential irrigation and fertilizer responses of onion and tomato in robit and dahgishta were presented 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study watersheds robit and dangishta are located in the lake tana sub basin of the blue nile basin ethiopia robit watershed is located east of lake tana between 11 37 00 n 37 26 00 e and 11 42 00 n 37 31 00 e and the dangishta watershed is located between 11 13 54 1 n 36 50 24 9 e and 11 20 15 9 n 36 53 54 48 e fig 1 the areas at the watersheds outlets are approximately 15 km2 and 30 km2 for robit and dangishta respectively the watersheds elevation extracted from a 30 m digital elevation model dem ranges between 1795 and 2045 m for robit and 2036 and 2206 m for dangishta robit watershed has an average slope of 8 while that of dangishta is 5 both watersheds possess a relatively higher groundwater potential in the lake tana basin and farmers have experience with smallholder irrigation water lifting technologies to draw water from shallow wells in the study sites range from motor pumps to manual water lifting devices 2 2 methods in this study to understand the water resource potential gaps and constraints of agricultural practices in the upper blue nile basin the study was undertaken in four stages a field data on tomato and onion production that included information on soils weather cultural practices inputs and yield were collected from 36 randomly selected farmers in robit and dahgishta watersheds half of the farmers grew a tomato in robit while the other half grew onion in dangishta the collected data were analyzed to identify constraints and gaps in tomato and onion production in addition the collected data were used to parameterize the swat and apex models while rainfall data were used to characterize the rainfall pattern of the two watersheds b the swat model was used to investigate the water resource potentials of the robit and dangishta watersheds including rainfall distribution patterns and totals shallow groundwater recharge and surface runoff c the apex model was calibrated using predicted swat streamflow and field data to capture the measured tomato and onion yield d finally the calibrated apex model was used to determine the optimum water and fertilizer amounts to maximize tomato and onion yield see section 2 1 4 2 2 1 field experiments and data collection details of the collected field data are presented in nakawuka et al 2017 schmitter et al 2016 and used to set up the apex model data were collected at robit and dangishta field sites by faculty scientists and students of bahir dar university bdu and the international water management institute iwmi addis ababa the field dataset included 18 farmer households in each watershed growing vegetables in the dry season using irrigation water from shallow groundwater wells in robit watershed farmers grew tomato while in dangishta farmers grew onion water was withdrawn using a rope and washer rwp and rope with pulley and bucket rp pumps the majority of the farmers in robit used rwp 11 farmers but in dangishta they were divided equally the method of irrigation scheduling varied among households in robit ten of the households scheduled irrigation by measuring soil moisture with a time domain reflectometer tdr delta t devices ltd see appendix 1 while others applied irrigation based on their traditional knowledge farmer s traditional practice ftp in dangishta all farmers managed irrigation by measuring the soil moisture half of the households scheduled irrigation using tdr while the other half used wetting front detectors wfd fullstop see appendix 1 the use of the wfd and tdr was meant to improve water use efficiency in the vegetable plots the field sizes varied from 100 to 230 m2 the tomato variety grown was shanty pm and the onion variety was allium cepa plant population irrigation and fertilizer amounts and application dates soil moisture plant height and yield were recorded following planting fertilizer amounts and application dates are shown in table 1 for onion diammonium phosphate dap was applied immediately after planting for tomato urea was applied was applied about a month from planting table 1 soil samples collected from the top 30 cm were processed to determine the physical and chemical properties of the soil

dangishta watersheds the watersheds are equipped with an automatic rain gauge station since 2014 two nearby weather stations bahir dar robit watershed and dangila dangishta watershed operated by metrological agency of ethiopia mae have collected daily weather data since 1960s the annual rainfall from 1994 to 2016 varies between 1100 to 1900 mm in robit with a standard deviation of 190 mm in dangishta rainfall varies between 1200 to 2000 mm with a standard deviation of 240 mm daily rainfall data of the two nearby towns along with the rainfall data collected at the field sites were used to analyze the rainfall pattern of the two watersheds from 1994 to 2016 the average monthly rainfall and number of raining days were calculated to estimate rainfall contribution during the vegetable growing period we also used the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 svoboda et al 2012 to characterize meteorological drought during the irrigation period detailed information on the mathematical computations of the spi can be obtained from the world meteorological organization bonaccorso et al 2015 in summary the growing season precipitation data were fitted to a probability distribution which was then transformed into a normal distribution because the spi is normalized the index can capture both dry and wet events in the same computation svoboda et al 2012 spi value refers to the number of standard deviation that the growing season rainfall would deviate from the long term average precipitation spi value ranges between 1 and 1 represent a near normal season while spi values between 1 and 2 represent moderately wet conditions and spi greater than 2 represents an extremely wet season spi values between 1 and 2 represent moderately dry conditions while spi less than 2 represents extremely dry conditions 2 2 3 watershed and field scale simulation simulation models can be used as a research tool to help improve the current understanding of the hydrology basic physiology of crop growth development and yield hunt et al 1998 for optimum results the model should ideally be calibrated and validated with observed data for this study streamflow agronomic and yield data collected at the robit and dangishta field sites were used for swat and apex model calibration and validation 2 2 3 1 swat and apex models although swat and apex models differ substantially they share many common attributes including the ability to simulate the effect of crop management practices on agricultural production and the environment arnold et al 1994 gassman et al 1998 williams et al 1998 the swat model is a basin scale distributed hydrological model in swat a watershed can be divided into multiple sub watersheds and further into multiple hydrologic response units hrus the hrus are assumed to have homogeneous land use soil and slope combinations soil water content nutrient cycles surface runoff and sediment yield are simulated at hru level and then aggregated to each sub basin before being routed through the stream network further to the outlet neitsch et al 2005 apex is a field or small watershed scale model in apex a sub watershed is assumed to have a single hru and is called a subarea unlike hrus in swat apex subareas have a spatial relationship and can be routed in a specified order saleh et al 2008 apex is capable of simulating detailed field conditions including crop management and growth nutrient and pesticide fate hydrology soil temperature erosion sedimentation as well as costs and returns of the various management practices saleh and gallego 2007 wang et al 2011 worqlul et al 2018a both swat and apex operate on a daily time step swat and apex share similar spatial input data including digital elevation model dem soil and land use the dem used to characterize the watersheds in this study has a spatial resolution of 30 m the soil data contains physical and chemical properties for swat the land use and soil spatial data were obtained from the ethiopia ministry of water irrigation and electricity emwie while for apex soil and land use information was collected at the field sites the main streamflow calibration parameters for both swat and apex were identified based on the literature review bitew and gebremichael 2010 mengistu and sorteberg 2012 2 2 3 2 swat and apex model setup calibration and validation streamflow at the outlets of the robit and dangishta watersheds has been monitored from june 2015 to september 2016 to better capture the water balance components of the watersheds observed long term streamflow data of the nearby watersheds of gumara for robit and gilgel abay for dangishta were used to calibrate the swat model observed streamflow of gumara and gilgel abay were obtained from the emwie for the period 1994 to 2016 swat model was calibrated using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm under the swat calibration uncertainty procedures swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 the streamflow simulation periods of swat for gumara and gilgel abay watersheds were divided into warm up 1994 calibration 1995 to 2010 and validation 2011 to 2016 periods the calibrated swat model parameters were transferred to the respective robit and dangishta watersheds based on the assumption that catchments proxy to each other will likely have similar runoff regime leading to similar model parameters which are used to initialize robit and dangishata swat model set ups wale et al 2009 worqlul et al 2018a the transferred parameters were further fine tuned to adequately capture the observed streamflow of the robit and dangishta watersheds the purpose of the swat simulation at the watershed scale was to access the spatial and temporal distribution of available surface runoff and shallow groundwater potential at the smallest hydrological response units hrus the apex model set up calibration and validation were achieved using the information on soils weather cultural practices and management data gathered in the farmers fields adjustments with respect to default crop parameters for tomato and onion were minor model calibration was achieved using auto calibration and uncertainty estimator apex cute wang et al 2014 the apex crop yield calibration was based on 2015 2016 field data the calibrated apex model was used to develop tomato and onion input production functions on water and fertilizer to understand constraints and gaps of vegetable production in the robit and dangishta watersheds a detailed discussion of the water and fertilizer production functions is given under section 2 1 4 table 2 shows the list of selected parameters and their respective model parameter space used to calibrate the swat and apex models 2 2 3 3 swat and apex model performance evaluation the simulated daily streamflow and vegetable yield were compared with the observed data and the simulation performance was evaluated with multiple statistics that include coefficient of determination r squared root mean square error rmse percent bias pbias and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse r square evaluates the degree of linear association between simulated and observed variable while pbias measures the relative volume difference between simulated and observed variables nse is the normalized statistic that describes the relative magnitude of residual variance compared to the observed streamflow variance 2 2 4 water and fertilizer production function appropriate irrigation water management is important to preserve water resources and to minimize a farmer s workload while optimizing crop productivity the water use efficiency of onion and tomato were developed by running the calibrated apex model multiple times over a 22 year period 1995 to 2016 while varying the irrigation amounts at two day intervals the two day irrigation interval used in the model was to match the practices by the farmers in the field studies for farmers the two day irrigation interval allowed them to have sufficient water to recharge the shallow groundwater wells the irrigation scenario was developed for a total amounts of water ranging from 100 to 700 mm at 100 mm intervals i e 100 200 300 400 500 600 and 700 mm irrigation amounts that were applied throughout the growing period for example for tomato which has a 170 day growing period 8 33 mm of water was applied every two days for a total irrigation of 700 mm the optimal amount of water was associated with the volume of water producing the maximum yield similarly the fertilizer production function i e the response of onion and tomato yield to the amount of fertilizer applied was developed by running the calibrated apex model at the optimal applied water level estimated with the water production function and applying different amounts of urea and diammonium phosphate dap again the timing of fertilizer application was the same as in the farmer managed field studies with dap applied at seeding and urea applied one month from planting for onion and multiple times for tomato urea used in the field studies contains 46 percent nitrogen dap is used commonly in ethiopia and it is the source of phosphorus and nitrogen containing 46 percent and 18 percent respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 field data analysis out of the 36 plots irrigation amounts and yield were successfully recorded on 27 plots 16 onion and 11 tomato plots the remaining plots were damaged by pest or grazed by animals or irrigation was stopped due to water shortage in robit farmers using tdr to manage irrigation applied water more frequently approximately every 1 8 days compared to farmers that used ftp on average water was applied every 2 1 days higher variability was found for the applied irrigation water in ftp compared to tdr practice with a coefficient of variation of 27 1 and 15 5 respectively tomato yield between the two management practices was significantly different p 0 05 on average yields of the ftp managed plots were half of the tdr managed plots in dangishta the total number of irrigation days between wfd and tdr managed field plots were not significantly different the field data also indicated that wfd managed plots were irrigated with a lower coefficient of variability 23 0 compared to tdr practice 36 0 onion yields between the two irrigation management treatments were not significantly different overall the field data did not show a significant linear relationship between total water applied and yield for both vegetables and water management practices except in robit where the traditional farmers practice indicated a significant inverse linear relationship between the amount of water applied and yield with a correlation coefficient of 0 62 tomato is a deep rooted crop with roots reaching up to 60 to 90 cm therefore irrigation management with the tdr which only measures soil moisture in the top 20 cm of soil could not be effective at later growth stages of the crop when the crop had developed much deeper roots however for onion which has a root depth varying between 30 and 45 cm the tdr irrigation management practice can be effective while monitoring of soil moisture dynamics of agricultural land is vital to improve water productivity it is important to measure additionally the deeper soil moisture layers aside from the topsoil horizon furthermore the field data indicated that pests and diseases were the main constraints on tomato production as 38 of the 18 plots failed at different times during the growing period in addition in robit water use competition between the commonly grown cash crop catha eduli khat and tomato was reported khat a perennial tree crop which has a high return on investment has become an irresistible investment for farmers 3 2 water resource assessment 3 2 1 rainfall data analysis the long term average monthly rainfall and the average number of raining days for robit and dangishta watersheds are shown in fig 2 1994 to 2016 both watersheds show a similar unimodal rainfall pattern receiving 60 to 94 of the annual rainfall in the major rainfall season june through september on average the number of raining days exceeds 18 days per month during the major rainfall season june to september with a higher percentage of rain every two days fig 2 months before and after the major rainfall season may and october indicated an average of more than 8 raining days the dry season extends from november through april during this period the number of raining days and the rainfall amount are insufficient to support vegetable production the average rainfall during tomato and onion growing periods is approximately 122 and 60 mm respectively with standard deviations of 60 and 38 mm respectively 1994 to 2016 most of the rainfall during this period comes at the end of the growing period the rainfall pattern for the vegetable growing season for the period 1994 2016 was further analyzed to evaluate the severity of meteorological drought using the standardized precipitation index fig 3 the spi shows that 86 and 77 of the study period in robit and dangishta watersheds respectively received above normal rainfall whereas the other years were identified as moderately dry the analysis does not indicate a strong rainfall contribution in the dry season furthermore higher rainfall variability is observed in robit with a coefficient of variation of 57 compared to 49 for dangishta watershed 3 2 2 watershed scale analysis the performance of swat model in simulating streamflow for gumara and gilgel abay watershed was reasonably good with a nash sutcliff efficiencies nse of 0 80 and 0 83 respectively and percent bias pbias of 5 4 and 6 4 respectively for the calibration period 1995 to 2010 similar model performance was also reported in worqlul et al 2018b adem et al 2014 and setegn et al 2010 the model was validated from 2011 to 2016 and the performance was acceptable with nse of 0 78 and 0 80 and pbias of 6 4 and 5 6 for gumara and gilgel abay watersheds respectively the calibrated and validated model parameters were transferred to the robit and dangishta watersheds the parameters were further fine tuned to adequately capture the observed streamflow of robit and dangishta watersheds june 2015 to sep 2016 fig 4 shows the performance of the swat model in simulating monthly streamflow of dangishta watershed the simulation also indicated the spatial distribution of groundwater recharge and surface runoff of robit and dangishta watersheds fig 5 a d in robit the average annual surface runoff varies between 440 and 535 mm fig 5a and the annual average groundwater recharge varies between 250 and 320 mm in dangishta surface runoff and groundwater recharge vary between 195 300 and 285 456 mm respectively fig 5c and d the availability of water resource both as surface and shallow groundwater recharge suggests that small scale irrigation ssi technologies could be utilized to grow crops in the dry season 3 3 field scale simulation 3 3 1 apex crop yield simulation the apex model was set up for the seven onion and nine tomato undisturbed field plots in dangishta and robit watersheds respectively the selected field plots had adequate datasets for the apex model set up the remaining field plots did not have soil physical and chemical properties to set up the apex model the performance of the apex model in simulating crop yield in the two watersheds is shown in fig 6 a and b the model adequately captured the observed tomato and onion yields for tomato 89 of the yield variability was captured by the model with a rmse of 5 3 t ha for the onion the apex model captured 93 of the yield variability with a rmse of 0 89 t ha however the apex model was unable to adequately predict observed high yields 3 3 2 water use efficiency of tomato and onion irrigation scheduling with the right amount and timing is critical for sustainable and optimal use of scarce water resources results of the 22 year apex simulation of tomato yield and number of water stress days for irrigation input amounts ranging from 100 to 700 mm are shown in fig 7 a and b the number of water stress days were estimated by comparing the available amount of soil water in the root zone and daily demand required for optimal growth for example the number of water stress days is estimated at 0 1 days if the root zone readily available soil moisture meets only 90 of the optimal crop water requirement in robit when tomato was grown with 100 mm of water the yield was limited by water stress with an average of 25 stress days when the irrigation amount increased to 200 mm the number of water stress days declined by 24 and consequently yield increased by 20 as irrigation approached 500 mm and beyond yields did not significantly increase p value 0 05 the irrigation production function indicated that tomato yield was maximized when an average amount of 500 mm of water was applied indicating an average of 3 water stress days throughout the growing period fig 7a for dangishta 400 mm was the optimal amount of water for onion production fig 7b the optimal irrigation water required to grow tomato and onion estimated with the field scale apex model was close to the shallow groundwater recharge however all of the recharge is not available for cropping as groundwater must also provide for the smallholder farmer s domestic and livestock needs while needs vary amongst smallholders altchenko and villholth 2014 and pavelic et al 2013 estimate that smallholder farmers use 20 30 of the groundwater to support their domestic and livestock needs which potentially limits the amount of water available for irrigating crops while groundwater recharge and surface runoff during the wet season can supplement rainfall capturing and retaining runoff for use during the dry season remains a challenge the water balance components including actual evapotranspiration aet plant transpiration trs runoff q percolation below the root zone prk potential evapotranspiration pet and rainfall prcp for the growing season were estimated using the apex model for tomato and onion fig 8 shows the different water balance components of the 200 400 and 600 mm of irrigation amounts in all cases the evapotranspiration demand could not be met when 200 mm of water was applied as a result very little runoff was generated actual evaporation eta was satisfied when an irrigation of 400 mm was applied in robit however runoff generated for 400 mm of irrigation did not differ significantly compared to 200 mm of irrigation when the irrigation increased from 400 to 600 mm and above more water was lost through percolation below the root zone in dangishta and as surface runoff in robit the results also illustrate that for onion production a significant amount of water was lost through soil evaporation actual evapotranspiration minus transpiration approximately 60 to 65 of the actual evapotranspiration was lost as soil evaporation resulting from low leaf area coverage fig 8b the soil evaporation component for tomato was approximately 30 to 40 of the total evapotranspiration hence adding a protective layer to cover the soil such as organic mulch and net shading to protect the soil from incoming solar radiation or using efficient water application techniques such as drip irrigation to minimize soil evaporation could extend the limited amounts of shallow groundwater for vegetable production in the dry season 3 3 3 fertilizer use efficiency of tomato and onion optimal fertilizer application is necessary to maximize crop yield surveys conducted by the central statistical authority csa and the livestock and irrigation value chains for ethiopian smallholders lives indicated that fertilizer applied for most crops in ethiopia is far below the recommended rate awulachew et al 2005 zerfu and larson 2010 it is estimated that only 30 40 of smallholders use fertilizer rashid et al 2013 insufficient fertilizer application stifles productivity and depletes soil nutrients and organic matter using the apex model a fertilizer production function for tomato and onion was developed to determine the fertilizer amount required for optimal production in the study sites the fertilizer production function was developed by applying the optimal amount of water estimated under section 3 3 2 and different combinations of urea and dap apex simulated results of the fertilizer production function are shown in fig 9 a and b when the tomato was grown with no fertilizer a low fresh yield of approximately 2 5 t ha was obtained similarly when onion was grown with no fertilizer a very low fresh yield of approximately 0 12 t ha was obtained for both crops yield response to increased n urea was low when dap was not applied the fertilizer production function indicates that for both crops yield increases when urea and dap application rates increase however the yield response to increased fertilizer application above the optimal amount was insignificant fig 9a and b in robit optimal tomato yield could be obtained when 200 to 250 kg ha of urea with 50 kg ha of dap is applied while in dangishta optimum onion yield can be obtained when 120 to 180 kg ha of urea with 50 kg ha of dap is applied however in both study sites farmers applied higher amounts of fertilizer a practice detrimental to the environment the excess nutrients from fertilizer can be washed away into the river system or contaminate groundwater through leaching 4 conclusion the field data collected in the 36 farmers managed plots in robit and dangishta watersheds coupled with the swat and apex simulation model results revealed the water resource potential gaps constraints and opportunities of vegetable production in ethiopia the hydro meteorological data analysis indicated a potentially large availability of groundwater to support irrigation in the dry season despite the limited rainfall of 60 mm over the growing period the rainfall distribution pattern also indicated a great deal of variability with a coefficient of variation of 49 and 63 in robit and dangishta respectively the temporal variability manifested in terms of variable mean seasonal distribution patterns would cause a severe crop failure to support vegetable production in the dry season the apex predicted optimal water required to grow tomato and onion were close to the shallow groundwater recharge however all of the recharge is not available for cropping as groundwater must also provide for the smallholder s domestic and livestock needs indicating that water could be a constraint for intensification of dry season irrigation on both sites on top of this the other constraint for vegetable production in robit was water use competition of khat with other vegetable crops that grew in the dry season and the need to control pests and diseases that claimed a large proportion of tomato plots resulting in productivity failures the field data and observations revealed significant differences and gaps in knowledge of farmers and their understanding of managing irrigation fertilization and pest control traditional or common irrigation practices used by farmers were highly variable in the timing and amounts of water applied however when farmers used soil moisture monitoring instruments to schedule irrigation water applications became more consistent and yield improved the study also revealed that even though monitoring the soil moisture dynamics of agricultural land is vital to improve the water productivity it is important to select appropriate soil moisture measuring devices to monitor soil moisture dynamics across the crop root depth deep rooted crop such as tomatoes soil moisture was successfully monitored with wfd while tdr supported soil moisture based irrigation of shallow rooted vegetable the apex simulation revealed the adverse environmental impact of over irrigation applying irrigation exceeding the optimal crop water requirement increased surface runoff and leaching resulting in nutrient losses the fertilizer production function indicated that tomato and onion are optimized when urea was applied in combination with dap given the country rising income level and rapidly growing population and considering tomato and onion are the basic constituents

10837,estimating reference evapotranspiration eto in 24 h timesteps has been considered sufficiently accurate for a long time however recent advances in weather data acquisition has made it feasible to apply the hourly procedures in eto computation hourly timesteps can improve eto estimates accuracy for data averaged daily may misrepresent evaporative power during parts of the day only a few studies have assessed vast databases yet studies considering tropical regions are basically inexistent the objective of the present study was to assess the differences between daily eto computations performed on 24 h etod and hourly etoh timesteps for the brazilian territory daily and hourly eto computations were performed according to the standardized asce american society of civil engineers penman monteith equation large daily weather variations of meteorological parameters resulted in etod generally underestimating etoh while lower variations resulted in etod overestimating overall etod overestimated etoh in 0 7 with monthly percentage bias ranging from 3 9 to 2 9 this study considered one year of data from 567 automatic weather stations and despite acknowledging the existence of interannual climate variability findings strongly agreed with relevant literature etod predominantly overestimated etoh during wet periods in warm regions thus this behavior is observed almost year round for the tropical monsoon and rainforest climate in the amazon and pantanal biome for the tropical savannah and semi arid climate etod overestimated etoh during wetter periods main crop harvest but underestimated along the dry season second harvest on the other hand etod predominately underestimated etoh for colder regions such as the pampa humid sub tropical climate regardless of rainfall the cerrado and caatinga are likely to be affected most for etoh is underestimated in periods of lower water availability making adequate irrigation techniques fundamental keywords asce standardized irrigation management penman monteith water resources 1 introduction crop evapotranspiration is considered one of the major components of hydrological cycle djaman et al 2018b over recent decades evapotranspiration increases due to climatic change have been observed in many regions across the globe zhang et al 2016 these trends are responsible for further increasing conflicts among water users especially in agricultural areas pires et al 2016 to reduce future conflicts over water use in such areas water should be used precisely dinpashoh et al 2019 irrigation activities need to be more efficient which can be achieved through irrigation management techniques chukalla et al 2015 geerts and raes 2009 that depends on more reliable evapotranspiration estimates a popular irrigation management technique is the deficit irrigation which consists on irrigating during the growth stages that the crop is sensitive to water deficit and limiting water in the other phenological stages many researchers have found that deficit irrigation techniques are decisive to increase water use efficiency and achieve sustainable water use fabeiro et al 2001 geerts and raes 2009 goldhamer and fereres 2017 tari 2016 however to obtain the correct values of crop water demand has long been a challenge especially due to the fact that direct crop evapotranspiration measuring is not only costly but laborious and difficult to implement in real management in order to surpass these limitations evapotranspiration has been estimated indirectly based on climatic data in this context computing reference evapotranspiration eto in 24 h timesteps has been considered sufficiently accurate for designing planning and managing irrigation yet advances in data acquisition from weather stations in recent years have made it feasible to apply evapotranspiration procedures on an hourly basis the difference associated to eto computation using daily or hourly averaged data is unpredictable and varies with location and weather conditions irmak et al 2005 for instance some studies have reported on the differences between eto estimates for different timesteps under different climatic conditions irmak et al 2005 assessed 9 sites in humid coastal and semiarid temperate climates and observed daily to sum of hourly ratios ranging from 0 97 to 1 09 ji et al 2017 assessed eto computations in the chinese arid climatic conditions and found the daily eto to overestimate their corresponding sum of hourly eto from 5 to 7 djaman et al 2018b reported sum of hourly eto estimation to have from 0 2 up to 16 6 higher annual eto in arid and semi arid regions of new mexico itenfisu et al 2003 presented a study performed in 45 sites but mostly for arid semi arid and humid sub tropical climates the only study found considering tropical climatic conditions was performed by perera et al 2015 where only two of 40 sites were classified within this climatic zone according to allen et al 2000 hourly or shorter timesteps have the advantage of improving eto estimates accuracy in locations where large diurnal changes in meteorological parameters present different patterns than for the locations in which they were developed in arid and semi arid regions where diurnal temperature amplitude is large daily eto computations are well documented to overestimate sum of hourly eto djaman et al 2018a b irmak et al 2005 ji et al 2017 tropical regions have climatic conditions very distinct from arid and semi arid regions but have also been documented to present substantial differences in diurnal cycles yang and slingo 2001 despite the diversity of studies the improvements of calculating eto in hourly timesteps has not been thoroughly investigated for the tropical regions in this context brazil one of the world s largest country and food producers has its climatic conditions classified as tropical across most of its territory alvares et al 2013 and despite of its economic importance studies assessing the differences of sum of hourly and daily eto for extensive areas under tropical climate are basically inexistent understanding the differences between daily and hourly eto estimates across the brazilian territory can contribute to improve irrigation water use and reduce water conflicts in some strategic regions of brazil thus the objective of this study was to investigate differences between sum of hourly and daily eto estimates in the brazilian territory 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area with a population of almost 210 million people brazil is the largest country in south america fig 1 and fifth largest in the world covering approximately 8 52 million km2 brazil has an average surface water discharge of approximately 260 000 m³ s 1 and accounts for 12 of the world s fresh water reserves ana 2017b its agriculture covers about 0 65 million km2 of its territory miranda 2018 being the world s largest cattle sugarcane orange coffee and fibre crops producer second largest soybean producer and standing out in the production of a diverse number of other fruits and grains fao 2019 with an irrigated area of approximately seven million hectares irrigation is responsible for 67 of brazil s total consumptive water use also irrigated areas are expected to expand up to 45 until 2030 which would represent a rise of 42 in consumptive water use ana 2017a disputes over water use are fairly common in many regions of brazil carvalho and magrini 2006 and are expected to further increase due to climate changes chou et al 2014 pires et al 2016 and increase in water demand alvares et al 2013 has classified brazil according to the köppen climate classification köppen 1936 into three climatic zones a zone tropical climate 81 b zone semi arid climate 5 and c zone humid sub tropical climate 14 brazil also presents rich biodiversity in its 6 biomes fig 1 amazon rainforest 49 atlantic rainforest 13 savanna cerrado 24 caatinga 10 pantanal 2 and southern plains pampa 2 the amazon cerrado and pantanal present predominant tropical climate while caatinga presents predominant semi arid climate pampa is within humid subtropical climate zone and atlantic rainforest is divided in tropical and humid sub tropical climate zones 2 2 data sources and integrity the reference evapotranspiration computations were performed using hourly meteorological data obtained from the brazilian national institute of meteorology inmet networks of automatic weather stations has increased in brazil in the last years but the available quantity of meteorological data is still low and varies a lot among regions due to this fact this study was conducted for the period from 01 02 2018 to 31 01 2019 and focused on the regional variability of eto instead of its temporal variation the brazilian s climates and biomes heterogeneity provide a broad variability of meteorological conditions which will further increase the knowledge of sum of hourly and daily eto estimates agreement over different conditions the inmet adopts the model maws 301 as the standard surface automatic weather station aws a station provided by the finnish company vaisala and installed according to the world meteorological organization standards inmet 2011 inmet s network contemplates 567 aws across the brazilian territory fig 2 recording hourly data of temperature relative humidity wind speed solar radiation atmospheric pressure and rainfall the quantity of aws is lower in the northwest region of brazil 341 aws are located inside climatic zone a 36 in b and 190 in c the stations density within biomes is higher in the atlantic rainforest 0 187 stations 1 000 km2 and pampa 0 142 stations 1 000 km2 intermediate for caatinga 0 095 stations 1 000 km2 and cerrado 0 081 stations 1 000 km2 and lower for pantanal 0 027 stations 1 000 km2 and amazon 0 020 stations 1 000 km2 hourly weather data that presented days with missing or faulty data were eliminated screening procedures to eliminate faulty data were relative humidity values outside the range 5 100 were flagged and corresponding daily data eliminated gavilán et al 2008 solar radiation measurements above global radiation had corresponding daily data eliminated allen 1996 stations with equal values for maximum and minimum temperature were also eliminated shafer et al 2000 final results of evapotranspiration estimates were also assessed in order to eliminate stations with unreasonable spatial incoherence between its neighbor stations after data screening stations reliability was assessed by the percentage of time they presented data considered fit for further analysis in the study period that is passing the criteria used in screening procedure allen 1996 gavilán et al 2008 shafer et al 2000 2 3 reference evapotranspiration computation hourly and daily reference evapotranspiration computations were performed according to the methodology presented by allen et al 2006 known as the standardized asce american society of civil engineers penman monteith allen et al 2006 recommended the use of a different parametrization of surface resistance when the fao56 penman monteith eto equation is applied to hourly or shorter basis computations the asce s reference evapotranspiration is calculated as follows 1 eto 0 408 rn g γ cn t 273 u2 e s e a δ γ 1 cd u2 where eto reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 or mm hr 1 rn net radiation mj m 2 d 1 or mj m 2 hr 1 g soil heat flux positive if soil is warming mj m 2 d 1 or mj m 2 hr 1 t average daily or hourly

timesteps during daytime and nighttime respectively and cn numerator constant for grass reference surface dependent on calculation timestep equal to 900 c mm s3 mg 1 d 1 for 24h time step and equal to 37 c mm s3 mg 1 h 1 for hourly timesteps wind speed values were measured at 10 m height and were converted to values at 2 m height u2 allen et al 1998 all the other variables were also assumed or calculated according to fao56 the stefan boltzmann constant was taken as 4 901 10 9 mj k 4 m 2 d 1 and 2 043 10 10 mj k 4 m 2 hr 1 for 24 h and hourly time step respectively the specific heat at constant temperature was set to 1 013 10 3 mj kg 1 c 1 latent heat of vaporization was equal to 2 45 mj kg 1 and the ratio of molecular weight of water vapor to dry air equals to 0 622 though soil heat flux is simplified for eto calculations in 24 h time step gd 0 it is important for hourly calculations and should not be overlooked for hourly timesteps ghr was considered equal to 0 1 rn during daylight defined as when rs 0 and 0 5 rn during nighttime the ratio between solar radiation and clear sky solar radiation rs rso was used to represent cloud cover in the rn computation and was limited to less than or equal to 1 0 during all periods during nighttime rs rso calculated between 2 3 hours before sunset was adopted eto computations performed in hourly timesteps were summed over 24 h periods and is denominated etoh whereas eto computations performed on 24 h time step is named etod 2 4 effect of meteorological parameters diurnal changes on different evapotranspiration timesteps rainfall occurrence may directly relate to diurnal changes in wind speed cloudiness and vapor pressure which in its turn interfere directly on how well etod and etoh agrees allen et al 2000 in order to better understand these interactions the relations between rainfall diurnal changes of meteorological parameters and differences between eto estimates etod etoh were assessed the diurnal changes of meteorological parameters were represented by the standard deviation of its hourly values these standard deviations directly relate to the range of within day observations which has a strong influence in eto estimation and may not be well represented by daily averages for example a high standard deviation of relative humidity for a given day would indicate a large range between minimum and maximum relative humidity values this means that at some point during that day relative humidity has registered values much larger and or much lower than the average which could result in high evaporative power thus adopting daily averages would lead to the misrepresentation of eto 2 5 performance and statistical analysis the asce etoh computations were used as basis for comparison and assessment of etod the reason for selecting the etoh method as the basis was because several studies have pointed out that diurnal changes in meteorological parameters can cause 24 h means to misrepresent the daily eto allen et al 1994 pruitt and doorenbos 1977 snyder and pruitt 1985 and recommended the use of hourly data for its estimation allen et al 2000 gavilán et al 2007 irmak et al 2005 pruitt and lourence 1966 tanner and pelton 1960 the statistical indices used to quantify the agreement between equations were the mean bias deviation mbd percentage bias pbias mean absolute deviation mbd and root mean squared deviation rmsd 2 mbd 1 n i 1 n eto d i eto h i 3 pbias mbd mean eto h 100 4 mad 1 n i 1 n eto d i eto h i 5 rmsd 1 n i 1 n eto d i eto h i 2 where n the number of observations rmsd indicates the variance from 1 1 line and is commonly used to judge the accuracy of methods mad is an indication of how widely the etod values diverged from etoh on average while mbd and pbias provide a general overview whether etod over 0 or underestimates 0 etoh the fit line between both estimates was also plotted along with the 1 1 line in order to assess if systematical under or overprediction would occur for lower or higher values of eto 3 results 3 1 data after the quality and integrity analysis of the weather data obtained from inmet the final dataset was composed by 3 769 440 pairs of hourly meteorological observations the aws network covers a diverse number of regions and ecosystems which are subject to different terrain environmental and climatic settings providing a very rich database for a broad evaluation figs 1 and 2 the statistical description of all meteorological parameters and evapotranspiration is presented in table 1 hourly mean air temperature ranged from 4 70 to 44 40 c a difference of 49 10 c while daily mean air temperature showed a difference of only 35 20 c wind speed presented a range of hourly values up to 33 7 larger than for daily averages relative humidity rh showed similar range for both time periods etoh ranged from 0 23 to 10 16 mm a variation similar to etod 0 38 to 10 17 mm the t rs and u2 were positively correlated with etoh while rh was negatively correlated the correlation coefficients obtained were 0 59 t 0 62 rh 0 92 rs and 0 29 u2 the correlations with etod were equal to 0 60 t 0 64 rh 0 91 rs and 0 28 u2 the variability and amplitude of meteorological parameters across the months is presented for each climatic zone in the appendix 1 in this supplementary material a brief description is given for the meteorological parameters as well as reference evapotranspiration and monthly rainfall it is also observed in the figure a 1 the wet seasons periods which was established for months when rainfall was greater than 60 mm peel et al 2007 meteorological stations reliability was also assessed fig 3 by computing the percentage of time they provided complete daily data during the studied period overall reliability was 84 with approximately 78 442 of stations presenting reliable data over 75 of the time and 57 321 over 90 of the time fig 3b and 3c 3 2 evapotranspiration timesteps comparison an initial evapotranspiration analysis and comparison between hourly and daily calculations considering the entire study period is presented in fig 4 etoh presented its higher values in the semi arid with similar annual averages for the tropical and humid sub tropical regions in general etoh and etod presented good agreement with r2 and slope of fit line near 1 the positive intercept and slope just below 1 indicates that etod tends to overestimate lower values of etoh mad and rmsd presented low values equal to 0 17 and 0 22 mm d 1 although with good agreement etod showed a small tendency to overestimate etoh across the brazilian territory with mbd equal to 0 03 mm d 1 and pbias equal to 0 7 such overestimations are more noticeable in the semi arid region and most of the tropical region in the amazon stations where etod tended to underestimate etoh were mostly located in the humid sub tropical region and more specifically in the pampa in a more detailed analysis monthly average mbd for each station is shown in fig 5 in general etod in the amazon region showed steady overestimation of etoh pantanal caatinga atlantic rainforest and cerrado regions presented similar behavior with etod underestimating etoh during the dry season and overestimating during the wet season in the southern region etod moderately underestimated etoh throughout the year with only few weather stations presenting overestimates by the end and in the beginning of the year it is also noted in fig 5 for the tropical and semi arid regions that periods with higher volumes of rainfall coincide with etod larger overestimations of etoh for the humid sub tropical regions this is not necessarily true colder regions like the pampa in the south seem to underestimate etoh despite the rainfall incidence these observations strongly relate with what was discussed on topic 2 4 where rainfall patterns in certain regions are expected to interfere on how well etoh and etod agrees the regression between eto estimates for each biome fig 6 presented strong agreement with coefficient of determination r2 values close to 1 and low metrics for mad and rmsd the amazon presented the least desired fit line relation with intercept equal to 0 41 and slope with 0 92 although slope values were fairly close to 1 for the other biomes intercept positive values for the scatterplots between eto estimates is evidence that etod tends to overestimate lower values of etoh despite showing larger deviation from 1 1 line amazon showed overall better agreement between eto estimates when compared to pampa and pantanal for its mad and rmsd were lower pampa and pantanal presented the least favorable agreement between eto estimates with mad equal to 0 20 and 0 21 mm d 1 and rmsd equal to 0 25 and 0 26 mm d 1 respectively the agreement observed for all the other biomes presented mad ranging from 0 17 to 0 18 mm d 1 and rmsd ranging from 0 21 to 0 22 mm d 1 the monthly averages percentage bias for brazil and its biomes are shown in table 2 where it is possible to have a better understanding of evapotranspiration regional deviations in general etod overestimated etoh average pbias 0 7 monthly pbias ranged from 3 9 in july to 2 9 in november with higher underestimations from may to august which corresponds to in a large part of brazil the dry season the cerrado biome presented overall good agreement between eto estimates average annual pbias 0 2 followed by atlantic rainforest average annual pbias 0 3 caatinga average annual pbias 0 7 pampa average annual pbias 1 6 pantanal average annual pbias 2 9 and amazon pbias 3 9 the low pbias observed in the cerrado and atlantic rainforest biomes representing both almost 66 of the brazilian aws network attenuated the bias between eto estimates when considering the entire territory 3 3 causes for differences between evapotranspiration estimates fig 7 presents the influence of rainfall on daily standard deviation of meteorological hourly values and in fig 8 the role of these standard deviation on possible differences between eto estimates rainfall had a negative correlation to daily standard deviation of rs t and rh hourly values fig 7 that is as rainfall values increase the within day range of meteorological parameters are expected to decrease in consequence a lower range between daily maximum and minimum values resulted in etod overestimating etoh while higher standard deviations resulted in etod underpredicting etoh fig 8 overall diurnal changes in rs t rh and u2 presented a correlation to differences between eto estimates of 0 30 0 48 0 42 and 0 18 respectively 4 discussion it was observed in fig 5 that etoh is overestimated by etod in a large part of brazil during its main crop season october to april despite of this season coinciding with the rainy season drought periods may occur and irrigators might not only supply crop a larger amount of water than needed but increase their electric energy expenses it was also observed in fig 5 that etod has generally underestimated etoh during periods with low rainfall occurrence such as dry seasons this increases the relevance on the difference between eto estimates because during these periods satisfying crop water demand depends almost exclusively on irrigation and crop water productivity relies on providing the right amount of water at certain stages regarding the biomes table 2 pampa presenting larger values of monthly pbias has low relevance for irrigation management purposes the pampa s rainfall is well distributed throughout the year and low etoh values were observed during the months with higher underestimation on the other hand underestimating becomes extremely relevant in other biomes such as the caatinga and cerrado caatinga presents semi arid climate with irregular rainfall distribution while cerrado presents tropical savannah climate with two well defined seasons rainy and dry a number of regions within these biomes present high agricultural contribution to economy and strongly rely on irrigation practices rodrigues and domingues 2017 tabarelli et al 2017 thus as previously discussed underestimating etoh in larger magnitudes may result in inadequate water supply to crop at specific stages reducing its water productivity and profitability even recognizing the interannual climate variability that exists the results reported here strongly relate to many other relevant studies for instance etod generally overestimating etoh in the semi arid is a similar result to what was reported by irmak et al 2005 and djaman et al 2018b in semi arid regions in usa and by djaman et al 2018a for the semi arid in senegal irmak et al 2005 also reported better agreement between daily and sum of hourly eto for humid regions which was observed in most of the brazilian humid sub tropical region atlantic rainforest and southern cerrado fig 4 and table 2 as for the tropical region perera et al 2015 has reported good agreement for two stations assessed in the australian tropical region the region assessed by these authors present savannah climate with dry winter aw and showed similar results as seen for the northern cerrado also aw climate type on the other hand the amazon covering most of the brazilian territory presents tropical monsoon am and tropical rainforest climate af types which to the authors knowledge have no studies reporting on the difference between their eto estimates looking at fig 4 and table 2 the conclusion that may be drawn is the clear tendency of etod to overestimate etoh in such tropical regions given the bioclimatic diversity of the brazilian territory the findings of this study are strong indicators of the eto behavior in other tropical regions of the world as long as their conditions are close to the observed as also pointed out by djaman et al 2018b the majority of differences between eto estimates observed outcomes from variables 24 h averages misrepresenting eto under conditions of considerable daily weather changes for instance in fig 8 larger amplitudes of mean air temperature seem to have a stronger effect on etod underestimating etoh in the semi arid region on the other hand larger diurnal changes in solar radiation and relative humidity have stronger effect in underestimating etoh for the tropical regions the humid sub tropical region seems to be less sensitive to diurnal changes in wind speed this behavior in humid sub tropical may result from higher relative humidity figure a 4 mitigating the aerodynamic effects on evapotranspiration rendering eto changes more susceptible to changes in radiation aside the weather variation throughout the day characterized by the standard deviation of hourly values the period of the day when higher or lower values occur may also interfere on how eto estimates deviate for instance high values of wind speed occurring during nighttime will have a different impact on etoh calculations when compared to high values occurring during daytime etod overall overestimating etoh has an awfully large impact on environmental studies for instance zhang et al 2016 have shown a significant eto trend for a large part of south america and brazil over past decades where transpiration from vegetation represents more than 70 of total evapotranspiration however eto computations in environmental and climate change studies is in most cases based on daily or longer periods averages chou et al 2014 coulibaly et al 2018 oliveira et al 2017 which is intended to reduce the already large amount of time invested in processing such extensive database this type of study is reasonable for planning but not for daily management purposes specifically for irrigation irrigation plays a key role in matching expected food demand by 2050 godfray et al 2010 however increasing irrigation may rise water demand in critical regions that can intensify water conflicts thus it is necessary to improve management techniques and evapotranspiration estimates for instance the main crop is sowed during november in some regions of the cerrado when etod overestimates etoh by 3 8 this overestimation represents an exceeding volume equal to 155 8 m³ d 1 for one center pivot system covering an area of 100 ha in order to reduce uncertainties and avoid the introduction of unnecessary error in eto estimation adopting hourly timesteps computation is a must djaman et al 2018b gavilán et al 2008 irmak et al 2005 also for irrigation systems to achieve the socio economic benefits of its investment effective use of irrigation management practices is fundamental for it increases sustainable production and profitability as well as reduces the need to expand agriculture over new areas 5 conclusion the present study based on a vast and heterogenous database reports on the implications of computing reference evapotranspiration adopting hourly or daily average meteorological parameters in summar using daily averages resulted in consistent eto overestimation for the tropical monsoon and tropical rainforest climate types amazon while for the tropical savannah cerrado daily averages showed better agreement to sum of hourly estimates along the year adopting daily instead of hourly timesteps for estimating eto will lead to overestimations during brazil s main crop season while to an expressive underestimation during the drought periods regions where agriculture presents high relevance in the brazilian economy such as the cerrado and caatinga are likely to be affected most by these underestimations agreement between eto estimates computed under different timesteps largely depends on the standard deviation of meteorological parameters hourly values larger standard deviations relate to abrupt diurnal changes and are likely to result in underestimations from eto based on daily averages when compared to sum of hourly eto eto based on daily averages will better agree to sum of hourly eto in periods of moderate standard deviation of meteorological parameters hourly values or overestimate in conditions of lower standard deviation conditions which are related to rainy seasons declaration of competing interest

10837,estimating reference evapotranspiration eto in 24 h timesteps has been considered sufficiently accurate for a long time however recent advances in weather data acquisition has made it feasible to apply the hourly procedures in eto computation hourly timesteps can improve eto estimates accuracy for data averaged daily may misrepresent evaporative power during parts of the day only a few studies have assessed vast databases yet studies considering tropical regions are basically inexistent the objective of the present study was to assess the differences between daily eto computations performed on 24 h etod and hourly etoh timesteps for the brazilian territory daily and hourly eto computations were performed according to the standardized asce american society of civil engineers penman monteith equation large daily weather variations of meteorological parameters resulted in etod generally underestimating etoh while lower variations resulted in etod overestimating overall etod overestimated etoh in 0 7 with monthly percentage bias ranging from 3 9 to 2 9 this study considered one year of data from 567 automatic weather stations and despite acknowledging the existence of interannual climate variability findings strongly agreed with relevant literature etod predominantly overestimated etoh during wet periods in warm regions thus this behavior is observed almost year round for the tropical monsoon and rainforest climate in the amazon and pantanal biome for the tropical savannah and semi arid climate etod overestimated etoh during wetter periods main crop harvest but underestimated along the dry season second harvest on the other hand etod predominately underestimated etoh for colder regions such as the pampa humid sub tropical climate regardless of rainfall the cerrado and caatinga are likely to be affected most for etoh is underestimated in periods of lower water availability making adequate irrigation techniques fundamental keywords asce standardized irrigation management penman monteith water resources 1 introduction crop evapotranspiration is considered one of the major components of hydrological cycle djaman et al 2018b over recent decades evapotranspiration increases due to climatic change have been observed in many regions across the globe zhang et al 2016 these trends are responsible for further increasing conflicts among water users especially in agricultural areas pires et al 2016 to reduce future conflicts over water use in such areas water should be used precisely dinpashoh et al 2019 irrigation activities need to be more efficient which can be achieved through irrigation management techniques chukalla et al 2015 geerts and raes 2009 that depends on more reliable evapotranspiration estimates a popular irrigation management technique is the deficit irrigation which consists on irrigating during the growth stages that the crop is sensitive to water deficit and limiting water in the other phenological stages many researchers have found that deficit irrigation techniques are decisive to increase water use efficiency and achieve sustainable water use fabeiro et al 2001 geerts and raes 2009 goldhamer and fereres 2017 tari 2016 however to obtain the correct values of crop water demand has long been a challenge especially due to the fact that direct crop evapotranspiration measuring is not only costly but laborious and difficult to implement in real management in order to surpass these limitations evapotranspiration has been estimated indirectly based on climatic data in this context computing reference evapotranspiration eto in 24 h timesteps has been considered sufficiently accurate for designing planning and managing irrigation yet advances in data acquisition from weather stations in recent years have made it feasible to apply evapotranspiration procedures on an hourly basis the difference associated to eto computation using daily or hourly averaged data is unpredictable and varies with location and weather conditions irmak et al 2005 for instance some studies have reported on the differences between eto estimates for different timesteps under different climatic conditions irmak et al 2005 assessed 9 sites in humid coastal and semiarid temperate climates and observed daily to sum of hourly ratios ranging from 0 97 to 1 09 ji et al 2017 assessed eto computations in the chinese arid climatic conditions and found the daily eto to overestimate their corresponding sum of hourly eto from 5 to 7 djaman et al 2018b reported sum of hourly eto estimation to have from 0 2 up to 16 6 higher annual eto in arid and semi arid regions of new mexico itenfisu et al 2003 presented a study performed in 45 sites but mostly for arid semi arid and humid sub tropical climates the only study found considering tropical climatic conditions was performed by perera et al 2015 where only two of 40 sites were classified within this climatic zone according to allen et al 2000 hourly or shorter timesteps have the advantage of improving eto estimates accuracy in locations where large diurnal changes in meteorological parameters present different patterns than for the locations in which they were developed in arid and semi arid regions where diurnal temperature amplitude is large daily eto computations are well documented to overestimate sum of hourly eto djaman et al 2018a b irmak et al 2005 ji et al 2017 tropical regions have climatic conditions very distinct from arid and semi arid regions but have also been documented to present substantial differences in diurnal cycles yang and slingo 2001 despite the diversity of studies the improvements of calculating eto in hourly timesteps has not been thoroughly investigated for the tropical regions in this context brazil one of the world s largest country and food producers has its climatic conditions classified as tropical across most of its territory alvares et al 2013 and despite of its economic importance studies assessing the differences of sum of hourly and daily eto for extensive areas under tropical climate are basically inexistent understanding the differences between daily and hourly eto estimates across the brazilian territory can contribute to improve irrigation water use and reduce water conflicts in some strategic regions of brazil thus the objective of this study was to investigate differences between sum of hourly and daily eto estimates in the brazilian territory 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area with a population of almost 210 million people brazil is the largest country in south america fig 1 and fifth largest in the world covering approximately 8 52 million km2 brazil has an average surface water discharge of approximately 260 000 m³ s 1 and accounts for 12 of the world s fresh water reserves ana 2017b its agriculture covers about 0 65 million km2 of its territory miranda 2018 being the world s largest cattle sugarcane orange coffee and fibre crops producer second largest soybean producer and standing out in the production of a diverse number of other fruits and grains fao 2019 with an irrigated area of approximately seven million hectares irrigation is responsible for 67 of brazil s total consumptive water use also irrigated areas are expected to expand up to 45 until 2030 which would represent a rise of 42 in consumptive water use ana 2017a disputes over water use are fairly common in many regions of brazil carvalho and magrini 2006 and are expected to further increase due to climate changes chou et al 2014 pires et al 2016 and increase in water demand alvares et al 2013 has classified brazil according to the köppen climate classification köppen 1936 into three climatic zones a zone tropical climate 81 b zone semi arid climate 5 and c zone humid sub tropical climate 14 brazil also presents rich biodiversity in its 6 biomes fig 1 amazon rainforest 49 atlantic rainforest 13 savanna cerrado 24 caatinga 10 pantanal 2 and southern plains pampa 2 the amazon cerrado and pantanal present predominant tropical climate while caatinga presents predominant semi arid climate pampa is within humid subtropical climate zone and atlantic rainforest is divided in tropical and humid sub tropical climate zones 2 2 data sources and integrity the reference evapotranspiration computations were performed using hourly meteorological data obtained from the brazilian national institute of meteorology inmet networks of automatic weather stations has increased in brazil in the last years but the available quantity of meteorological data is still low and varies a lot among regions due to this fact this study was conducted for the period from 01 02 2018 to 31 01 2019 and focused on the regional variability of eto instead of its temporal variation the brazilian s climates and biomes heterogeneity provide a broad variability of meteorological conditions which will further increase the knowledge of sum of hourly and daily eto estimates agreement over different conditions the inmet adopts the model maws 301 as the standard surface automatic weather station aws a station provided by the finnish company vaisala and installed according to the world meteorological organization standards inmet 2011 inmet s network contemplates 567 aws across the brazilian territory fig 2 recording hourly data of temperature relative humidity wind speed solar radiation atmospheric pressure and rainfall the quantity of aws is lower in the northwest region of brazil 341 aws are located inside climatic zone a 36 in b and 190 in c the stations density within biomes is higher in the atlantic rainforest 0 187 stations 1 000 km2 and pampa 0 142 stations 1 000 km2 intermediate for caatinga 0 095 stations 1 000 km2 and cerrado 0 081 stations 1 000 km2 and lower for pantanal 0 027 stations 1 000 km2 and amazon 0 020 stations 1 000 km2 hourly weather data that presented days with missing or faulty data were eliminated screening procedures to eliminate faulty data were relative humidity values outside the range 5 100 were flagged and corresponding daily data eliminated gavilán et al 2008 solar radiation measurements above global radiation had corresponding daily data eliminated allen 1996 stations with equal values for maximum and minimum temperature were also eliminated shafer et al 2000 final results of evapotranspiration estimates were also assessed in order to eliminate stations with unreasonable spatial incoherence between its neighbor stations after data screening stations reliability was assessed by the percentage of time they presented data considered fit for further analysis in the study period that is passing the criteria used in screening procedure allen 1996 gavilán et al 2008 shafer et al 2000 2 3 reference evapotranspiration computation hourly and daily reference evapotranspiration computations were performed according to the methodology presented by allen et al 2006 known as the standardized asce american society of civil engineers penman monteith allen et al 2006 recommended the use of a different parametrization of surface resistance when the fao56 penman monteith eto equation is applied to hourly or shorter basis computations the asce s reference evapotranspiration is calculated as follows 1 eto 0 408 rn g γ cn t 273 u2 e s e a δ γ 1 cd u2 where eto reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 or mm hr 1 rn net radiation mj m 2 d 1 or mj m 2 hr 1 g soil heat flux positive if soil is warming mj m 2 d 1 or mj m 2 hr 1 t average daily or hourly

psychrometric constant kpa c 1 cd denominator constant for grass reference surface dependent on calculation timestep equal to 0 34 s m 1 for 24h time step and equal to 0 24 and 0 96 s m 1 for hourly timesteps during daytime and nighttime respectively and cn numerator constant for grass reference surface dependent on calculation timestep equal to 900 c mm s3 mg 1 d 1 for 24h time step and equal to 37 c mm s3 mg 1 h 1 for hourly timesteps wind speed values were measured at 10 m height and were converted to values at 2 m height u2 allen et al 1998 all the other variables were also assumed or calculated according to fao56 the stefan boltzmann constant was taken as 4 901 10 9 mj k 4 m 2 d 1 and 2 043 10 10 mj k 4 m 2 hr 1 for 24 h and hourly time step respectively the specific heat at constant temperature was set to 1 013 10 3 mj kg 1 c 1 latent heat of vaporization was equal to 2 45 mj kg 1 and the ratio of molecular weight of water vapor to dry air equals to 0 622 though soil heat flux is simplified for eto calculations in 24 h time step gd 0 it is important for hourly calculations and should not be overlooked for hourly timesteps ghr was considered equal to 0 1 rn during daylight defined as when rs 0 and 0 5 rn during nighttime the ratio between solar radiation and clear sky solar radiation rs rso was used to represent cloud cover in the rn computation and was limited to less than or equal to 1 0 during all periods during nighttime rs rso calculated between 2 3 hours before sunset was adopted eto computations performed in hourly timesteps were summed over 24 h periods and is denominated etoh whereas eto computations performed on 24 h time step is named etod 2 4 effect of meteorological parameters diurnal changes on different evapotranspiration timesteps rainfall occurrence may directly relate to diurnal changes in wind speed cloudiness and vapor pressure which in its turn interfere directly on how well etod and etoh agrees allen et al 2000 in order to better understand these interactions the relations between rainfall diurnal changes of meteorological parameters and differences between eto estimates etod etoh were assessed the diurnal changes of meteorological parameters were represented by the standard deviation of its hourly values these standard deviations directly relate to the range of within day observations which has a strong influence in eto estimation and may not be well represented by daily averages for example a high standard deviation of relative humidity for a given day would indicate a large range between minimum and maximum relative humidity values this means that at some point during that day relative humidity has registered values much larger and or much lower than the average which could result in high evaporative power thus adopting daily averages would lead to the misrepresentation of eto 2 5 performance and statistical analysis the asce etoh computations were used as basis for comparison and assessment of etod the reason for selecting the etoh method as the basis was because several studies have pointed out that diurnal changes in meteorological parameters can cause 24 h means to misrepresent the daily eto allen et al 1994 pruitt and doorenbos 1977 snyder and pruitt 1985 and recommended the use of hourly data for its estimation allen et al 2000 gavilán et al 2007 irmak et al 2005 pruitt and lourence 1966 tanner and pelton 1960 the statistical indices used to quantify the agreement between equations were the mean bias deviation mbd percentage bias pbias mean absolute deviation mbd and root mean squared deviation rmsd 2 mbd 1 n i 1 n eto d i eto h i 3 pbias mbd mean eto h 100 4 mad 1 n i 1 n eto d i eto h i 5 rmsd 1 n i 1 n eto d i eto h i 2 where n the number of observations rmsd indicates the variance from 1 1 line and is commonly used to judge the accuracy of methods mad is an indication of how widely the etod values diverged from etoh on average while mbd and pbias provide a general overview whether etod over 0 or underestimates 0 etoh the fit line between both estimates was also plotted along with the 1 1 line in order to assess if systematical under or overprediction would occur for lower or higher values of eto 3 results 3 1 data after the quality and integrity analysis of the weather data obtained from inmet the final dataset was composed by 3 769 440 pairs of hourly meteorological observations the aws network covers a diverse number of regions and ecosystems which are subject to different terrain environmental and climatic settings providing a very rich database for a broad evaluation figs 1 and 2 the statistical description of all meteorological parameters and evapotranspiration is presented in table 1 hourly mean air temperature ranged from 4 70 to 44 40 c a difference of 49 10 c while daily mean air temperature showed a difference of only 35 20 c wind speed presented a range of hourly values up to 33 7 larger than for daily averages relative humidity rh showed similar range for both time periods etoh ranged from 0 23 to 10 16 mm a variation similar to etod 0 38 to 10 17 mm the t rs and u2 were positively correlated with etoh while rh was negatively correlated the correlation coefficients obtained were 0 59 t 0 62 rh 0 92 rs and 0 29 u2 the correlations with etod were equal to 0 60 t 0 64 rh 0 91 rs and 0 28 u2 the variability and amplitude of meteorological parameters across the months is presented for each climatic zone in the appendix 1 in this supplementary material a brief description is given for the meteorological parameters as well as reference evapotranspiration and monthly rainfall it is also observed in the figure a 1 the wet seasons periods which was established for months when rainfall was greater than 60 mm peel et al 2007 meteorological stations reliability was also assessed fig 3 by computing the percentage of time they provided complete daily data during the studied period overall reliability was 84 with approximately 78 442 of stations presenting reliable data over 75 of the time and 57 321 over 90 of the time fig 3b and 3c 3 2 evapotranspiration timesteps comparison an initial evapotranspiration analysis and comparison between hourly and daily calculations considering the entire study period is presented in fig 4 etoh presented its higher values in the semi arid with similar annual averages for the tropical and humid sub tropical regions in general etoh and etod presented good agreement with r2 and slope of fit line near 1 the positive intercept and slope just below 1 indicates that etod tends to overestimate lower values of etoh mad and rmsd presented low values equal to 0 17 and 0 22 mm d 1 although with good agreement etod showed a small tendency to overestimate etoh across the brazilian territory with mbd equal to 0 03 mm d 1 and pbias equal to 0 7 such overestimations are more noticeable in the semi arid region and most of the tropical region in the amazon stations where etod tended to underestimate etoh were mostly located in the humid sub tropical region and more specifically in the pampa in a more detailed analysis monthly average mbd for each station is shown in fig 5 in general etod in the amazon region showed steady overestimation of etoh pantanal caatinga atlantic rainforest and cerrado regions presented similar behavior with etod underestimating etoh during the dry season and overestimating during the wet season in the southern region etod moderately underestimated etoh throughout the year with only few weather stations presenting overestimates by the end and in the beginning of the year it is also noted in fig 5 for the tropical and semi arid regions that periods with higher volumes of rainfall coincide with etod larger overestimations of etoh for the humid sub tropical regions this is not necessarily true colder regions like the pampa in the south seem to underestimate etoh despite the rainfall incidence these observations strongly relate with what was discussed on topic 2 4 where rainfall patterns in certain regions are expected to interfere on how well etoh and etod agrees the regression between eto estimates for each biome fig 6 presented strong agreement with coefficient of determination r2 values close to 1 and low metrics for mad and rmsd the amazon presented the least desired fit line relation with intercept equal to 0 41 and slope with 0 92 although slope values were fairly close to 1 for the other biomes intercept positive values for the scatterplots between eto estimates is evidence that etod tends to overestimate lower values of etoh despite showing larger deviation from 1 1 line amazon showed overall better agreement between eto estimates when compared to pampa and pantanal for its mad and rmsd were lower pampa and pantanal presented the least favorable agreement between eto estimates with mad equal to 0 20 and 0 21 mm d 1 and rmsd equal to 0 25 and 0 26 mm d 1 respectively the agreement observed for all the other biomes presented mad ranging from 0 17 to 0 18 mm d 1 and rmsd ranging from 0 21 to 0 22 mm d 1 the monthly averages percentage bias for brazil and its biomes are shown in table 2 where it is possible to have a better understanding of evapotranspiration regional deviations in general etod overestimated etoh average pbias 0 7 monthly pbias ranged from 3 9 in july to 2 9 in november with higher underestimations from may to august which corresponds to in a large part of brazil the dry season the cerrado biome presented overall good agreement between eto estimates average annual pbias 0 2 followed by atlantic rainforest average annual pbias 0 3 caatinga average annual pbias 0 7 pampa average annual pbias 1 6 pantanal average annual pbias 2 9 and amazon pbias 3 9 the low pbias observed in the cerrado and atlantic rainforest biomes representing both almost 66 of the brazilian aws network attenuated the bias between eto estimates when considering the entire territory 3 3 causes for differences between evapotranspiration estimates fig 7 presents the influence of rainfall on daily standard deviation of meteorological hourly values and in fig 8 the role of these standard deviation on possible differences between eto estimates rainfall had a negative correlation to daily standard deviation of rs t and rh hourly values fig 7 that is as rainfall values increase the within day range of meteorological parameters are expected to decrease in consequence a lower range between daily maximum and minimum values resulted in etod overestimating etoh while higher standard deviations resulted in etod underpredicting etoh fig 8 overall diurnal changes in rs t rh and u2 presented a correlation to differences between eto estimates of 0 30 0 48 0 42 and 0 18 respectively 4 discussion it was observed in fig 5 that etoh is overestimated by etod in a large part of brazil during its main crop season october to april despite of this season coinciding with the rainy season drought periods may occur and irrigators might not only supply crop a larger amount of water than needed but increase their electric energy expenses it was also observed in fig 5 that etod has generally underestimated etoh during periods with low rainfall occurrence such as dry seasons this increases the relevance on the difference between eto estimates because during these periods satisfying crop water demand depends almost exclusively on irrigation and crop water productivity relies on providing the right amount of water at certain stages regarding the biomes table 2 pampa presenting larger values of monthly pbias has low relevance for irrigation management purposes the pampa s rainfall is well distributed throughout the year and low etoh values were observed during the months with higher underestimation on the other hand underestimating becomes extremely relevant in other biomes such as the caatinga and cerrado caatinga presents semi arid climate with irregular rainfall distribution while cerrado presents tropical savannah climate with two well defined seasons rainy and dry a number of regions within these biomes present high agricultural contribution to economy and strongly rely on irrigation practices rodrigues and domingues 2017 tabarelli et al 2017 thus as previously discussed underestimating etoh in larger magnitudes may result in inadequate water supply to crop at specific stages reducing its water productivity and profitability even recognizing the interannual climate variability that exists the results reported here strongly relate to many other relevant studies for instance etod generally overestimating etoh in the semi arid is a similar result to what was reported by irmak et al 2005 and djaman et al 2018b in semi arid regions in usa and by djaman et al 2018a for the semi arid in senegal irmak et al 2005 also reported better agreement between daily and sum of hourly eto for humid regions which was observed in most of the brazilian humid sub tropical region atlantic rainforest and southern cerrado fig 4 and table 2 as for the tropical region perera et al 2015 has reported good agreement for two stations assessed in the australian tropical region the region assessed by these authors present savannah climate with dry winter aw and showed similar results as seen for the northern cerrado also aw climate type on the other hand the amazon covering most of the brazilian territory presents tropical monsoon am and tropical rainforest climate af types which to the authors knowledge have no studies reporting on the difference between their eto estimates looking at fig 4 and table 2 the conclusion that may be drawn is the clear tendency of etod to overestimate etoh in such tropical regions given the bioclimatic diversity of the brazilian territory the findings of this study are strong indicators of the eto behavior in other tropical regions of the world as long as their conditions are close to the observed as also pointed out by djaman et al 2018b the majority of differences between eto estimates observed outcomes from variables 24 h averages misrepresenting eto under conditions of considerable daily weather changes for instance in fig 8 larger amplitudes of mean air temperature seem to have a stronger effect on etod underestimating etoh in the semi arid region on the other hand larger diurnal changes in solar radiation and relative humidity have stronger effect in underestimating etoh for the tropical regions the humid sub tropical region seems to be less sensitive to diurnal changes in wind speed this behavior in humid sub tropical may result from higher relative humidity figure a 4 mitigating the aerodynamic effects on evapotranspiration rendering eto changes more susceptible to changes in radiation aside the weather variation throughout the day characterized by the standard deviation of hourly values the period of the day when higher or lower values occur may also interfere on how eto estimates deviate for instance high values of wind speed occurring during nighttime will have a different impact on etoh calculations when compared to high values occurring during daytime etod overall overestimating etoh has an awfully large impact on environmental studies for instance zhang et al 2016 have shown a significant eto trend for a large part of south america and brazil over past decades where transpiration from vegetation represents more than 70 of total evapotranspiration however eto computations in environmental and climate change studies is in most cases based on daily or longer periods averages chou et al 2014 coulibaly et al 2018 oliveira et al 2017 which is intended to reduce the already large amount of time invested in processing such extensive database this type of study is reasonable for planning but not for daily management purposes specifically for irrigation irrigation plays a key role in matching expected food demand by 2050 godfray et al 2010 however increasing irrigation may rise water demand in critical regions that can intensify water conflicts thus it is necessary to improve management techniques and evapotranspiration estimates for instance the main crop is sowed during november in some regions of the cerrado when etod overestimates etoh by 3 8 this overestimation represents an exceeding volume equal to 155 8 m³ d 1 for one center pivot system covering an area of 100 ha in order to reduce uncertainties and avoid the introduction of unnecessary error in eto estimation adopting hourly timesteps computation is a must djaman et al 2018b gavilán et al 2008 irmak et al 2005 also for irrigation systems to achieve the socio economic benefits of its investment effective use of irrigation management practices is fundamental for it increases sustainable production and profitability as well as reduces the need to expand agriculture over new areas 5 conclusion the present study based on a vast and heterogenous database reports on the implications of computing reference evapotranspiration adopting hourly or daily average meteorological parameters in summar using daily averages resulted in consistent eto overestimation for the tropical monsoon and tropical rainforest climate types amazon while for the tropical savannah cerrado daily averages showed better agreement to sum of hourly estimates along the year adopting daily instead of hourly timesteps for estimating eto will lead to overestimations during brazil s main crop season while to an expressive underestimation during the

10838,identifying the factors driving yield gaps between the attainable and actual yields achieved by farmers is essential for agricultural improvement and water resource management in this study the process based vip vegetation interface processes eco hydrological model was used to estimate the yield gap of spring maize in the hutuo river basin hrb north china to describe the realistic crop growth and attainable yield pattern the field sampled grain yield and aboveground biomass were used to design a scheme to retrieve the intrinsic quantum efficiency ε a c t for leaf photosynthesis of c4 crop including the statistical relationships between the intrinsic quantum efficiency vegetation index and grain yield the actual yields were predicted with the retrieved intrinsic quantum efficiency pattern while the attainable yields were predicted with the average of the top 5 intrinsic quantum efficiencies the simulated actual yields are consistent with the census data at the county level r2 of 0 37 to 0 74 and relative rmse of 16 29 the average yield gap in the basin is 5246 kg ha 1 being 55 of the attainable yield it is revealed that soil organic matter som content and depth of soil layer are the principal limiting factors in more than 80 of farmland and results in 70 of the yield gap while the effects of som content is dominant in flat piedmont water stress is also a critical factor limiting crop yield especially for hilly farmlands with slopes greater than 8 improving fertilizer management and irrigation techniques in the hrb is therefore the primary task to narrow yield gaps attributable to basin management keywords yield gap quantum efficiency vip model vegetation index maize 1 introduction with ongoing population growth increasing grain production is critical to national food security over the next 20 years grain production should increase by at least 35 to meet global food demand zhang 2011 the basic and emergent issues are to assess the yield gap and investigate crop yield constraints to improve our capability to increase yields in the future therefore accurate estimation of exploitable yield gap is essential to assess the potential of regional crop production enhancement the difference between the potential and actual yield achieved by farmers represents the exploitable yield gap cassman et al 2003 in general the potential yield is the yield of a crop cultivar when grown under non limiting water and nutrient supplies and in the absence of pests and diseases evans and fischer 1999 grassini et al 2009 this value is the yield ceiling of a given crop variety in a given location evans and fischer 1999 however this type of absolute biophysical potential yield is difficult to obtain therefore attainable yield which represents the yield achievable using current optimal technology and management techniques at a given time and ecosystem is used more widely than potential yield in general the observed maximum yield and field experimental data are assumed to represent attainable yield while survey or census data are used as actual yield lobell et al 2009 although the observed data are easy to obtain they can t represent an independent estimate of the crop potential production capability based on a specific climate soil and management condition and field data have limited temporal coverage and insufficient spatial resolution schulthess et al 2013 liang et al 2011 crop models can provide estimates of yield at regional scale which have been successfully applied to investigate the attainable yield actual yield and crop yield gap in the north china plain wang et al 2014 entire country of china liu et al 2017 and the wheat belt of western australia oliver and robertson 2013 however model parameters may show significant differences related to environmental conditions e g temperature and precipitation li et al 2016 and the use of crop models in estimating yield gaps still faces challenges of requiring parameters at fine scale resolution combining remote sensing data and crop models is believed to fulfill this requirement of spatial temporal coverage of model parameters in yield estimation remote sensing data can be translated into corresponding parameters or state variables driving the crop model such as photosynthetic parameters and leaf area index lai by empirical functions or physical scattering models dorigo et al 2007 however state variables such as lai cannot be used to estimate the attainable yield which restricted the applications of remote sensing retrieved state variables in yield gap assessment thus obtaining the photosynthetic parameter pattern is critical for accurate estimation of crop attainable yield and actual yield globally the current average actual maize yield is 64 of the maximum attainable yield neumann et al 2010 indicating a gap of 36 with remarkable spatial variability it is reported that the yield gaps in south asia and africa exceed 70 while the gaps are less than 30 in west europe and america hengsdijk and langeveld 2009 van wart et al 2013 schulthess et al 2013 the yield gaps range from 28 to 78 liu et al 2012 hou et al 2013 wang et al 2011 in china such as the actual yield to potential yield ratio is 34 in northeast china lv et al 2015 41 in the north china plain 37 in northwest china and 44 in southwest china meng et al 2013 this remarkable spatial heterogeneity may be attributed to agricultural practices licker et al 2010 nutrition and water management practices ahrens et al 2010 mueller et al 2012 because of the heterogeneity of soil quality water conditions climate conditions agricultural practices and their complex interactions the relative contributions of these factors vary greatly among regions which are still poorly understood in many regions the hutuo river basin hrb is a mountainous watershed located in northern china although farmland accounts for only 27 of the basin agriculture irrigation consumes more than 55 of the water resources in the basin shanxi water resources bulletin 2008 therefore irrigation is closely related to crop yield in the hrb and reduce the amount of water supplied to the downstream plain separating the relative contribution of water to the yield gap from other factors is helpful for basin water resource management in this study firstly an approach based on hu and mo 2011 is developed to retrieve the photosynthetic capability intrinsic quantum efficiency pattern of a c4 crop spring maize from multiyear remote sensing rs data for simulation of regional crop yield secondly the spatial variability of yield gap of spring maize in the hrb is explored and the impacts of soil and water conditions on the yield gaps are separated 2 materials and method 2 1 region description the hutuo river basin 37 16 n to 39 28 n 112 11 e to 119 45 e is located in the northern part of north china which covers parts of shanxi province and hebei province with a drainage

precipitation is distributed irregularly throughout the year with approximately 75 occurring from may to october during the spring maize growing season the major land use types are forests 27 5 grassland 41 5 and farmland 26 8 in the hrb single harvest spring maize more than 80 of cropland is planted with the same maize variety jingdan32 is the prevailing cropping system in the part of shanxi province table a1 in appendix a whereas in the eastern part of the hrb the prevailing cropping system is wheat maize rotation blank area in fig 1b 2 2 data sources 2 2 1 land surface characterization data land surface characteristics include the topography soil physical texture soil organic matter som content soil depth and land use type a digital elevation model was obtained from a topographic map at a 1 250 000 scale soil textural data are available at a scale of 1 1 000 000 and represented by fractions of sand silt and clay http westdc westgis ac cn which were used to estimate the soil physical texture map as reported by zhang 2007 the soil organic matter content and soil depth at a resolution of 1 km were adopted from shangguan et al 2013 land use data from the late 1990s were developed from landsat thematic mapper tm scenes downloaded from http www resdc cn these data were resampled to 250 250 m2 using the nearest neighbor method 2 2 2 meteorological data using the gradient inverse distance gids method daily meteorological data daily average maximum and minimum air temperatures atmospheric pressure humidity wind speed precipitation and sunshine

agricultural data included the measured aboveground biomass lai census yield data effective irrigated area ratio maize production area ratio and annual chemical fertilizer usage the census yield data effective irrigated area ratio maize production area ratio and annual chemical fertilizer usage appendix a table a1 at the county scale of the study area were derived from the shanxi provincial statistical annals from 2006 to 2014 the measured yield lai and aboveground biomass during the maize growing stage at the shouyang agricultural meteorological station in 2011 were used as the reference data gao 2013 the observed maize yield and aboveground biomass at the mature maize stage from 2004 to 2012 at fourteen agricultural experimental stations appendix a table a2 were downloaded from national science technology infrastructure http www cnern org cn 2 2 4 remote sensing data the rs data used were 16 day composite 250 m normalized difference vegetation index ndvi 16 day composite 1 km ndvi and 8 day composite 1 km land surface temperatures from 2005 to 2013 which were derived from the mod13q1 mod13a2 and mod11a2 nasa science data products https ladsweb nascom nasa gov respectively because only cropland was considered in this study the land cover mask derived from landsat tm images http www resdc cn was used to eliminate the influence of non agricultural regions consequently all areas with non agricultural land were masked out and ndvi values were extracted for only those areas having crops in addition pixels with an absolute range of ndvi values maximum minimum of the annual ndvi of less than 0 1 were excluded because the majority of these pixels indicated developed areas and water areas in addition a savitzky golay sg filter chen et al 2004 was applied to check for erroneous data and construct a high quality time series of ndvi to describe the soil moisture conditions based on the approach proposed by sandholt et al 2002 1 km ndvi and 1 km land surface temperature lst data were used to calculate the tvdi temperature vegetation drought index to match the temporal resolution of the modis ndvi a maximum lst of 16 days was retrieved tvdi is a drought index that can reflect soil moisture content high tvdi values indicate low soil moisture and high degrees of drought whereas low tvdi values indicate high soil moisture and low degrees of drought to match the spatial resolution of land surface characterization data and simulated yield tvdi were resampled to 250 250 m2 using the nearest neighbor method 2 3 methods 2 3 1 model introduction the vip model used in this study is a dynamic ecosystem model that simulates radiation water heat and co2 transfer processes during the crop growing season the main biochemical processes in the vip model include the water cycle energy balance and carbon cycle mo et al 2012 mo and liu 2001 the crop growth process and yield are simulated by a crop growth module which includes a daily crop growth submodule and a phenological development submodule appendix b photosynthesis is a critical ecological process that is coupled to the ecosystem s water cycle and carbon cycle which determine the daily growth of crop dry mass ac mol c m 2 d 1 the leaf photosynthesis rate is primarily restricted by saturation of the enzyme ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco with respect to carboxylation electron transport as limited by ribulose bisphosphate rubp regeneration and the phosphate release rate during the consumption of photosynthetic products the actual photosynthesis rate depends on the limiting values of the three aforementioned factors farquhar et al 1980 sellers et al 1992 therefore the net assimilation rate of co2 an μmol c m 2 s 1 is expressed as follows 1 a n min a r a e a s r d where ar is the rubisco limiting rate ae is the light limiting rate as is the capacity for the export or utilization of the photosynthetic products and rd is the leaf respiration rate μmol c m 2 s 1 for c4 crops ar ae and as are expressed as follows 2 a r v cmax 3 a e ε q par 4 a s 2 10 4 c i p v cmax where vcmax is the maximum catalytic capacity of rubisco μmol c m 2 s 1 ci is the intercellular concentration of co2 p is the atmospheric pressure pa qpar is the par photosynthetically active radiation μmol photons m 2 s 1 loaded on the leaf surface and ε is the intrinsic quantum efficiency μmol photons m 2 s 1 which provides an expression of the electron transport capability in the photosynthetic process in this study the influence of soil nitrogen water and other environmental factors are assumed to be accounted for by the intrinsic quantum efficiency values thus to some extent ε is considered an empirical parameter reflecting the background of crop photosynthetic capacity the growth of spring maize is simulated from 2004 to 2013 in daily steps and with a 250 m grid over the study area the model initialization period spans from january 2004 to december 2004 and the simulation results obtained for 2005 to 2013 are used for analysis the input data of the vip model include daily meteorological data average maximum and minimum air temperatures atmospheric pressure humidity wind speed precipitation and sunshine duration and the yearly atmospheric concentration of co2 ε is determined by the approach in section 2 3 2 the values of other parameters used in this paper are listed in table b1 appendix b 2 3 2 approach to obtain the intrinsic quantum efficiency pattern the methodology for obtaining the intrinsic quantum efficiency pattern was developed based on hu and mo 2011 who successfully retrieved the spatial pattern of rubisco carboxylase activity vcmax of winter wheat the intrinsic quantum efficiency in c4 plants is sensitive to environmental stresses such as salinity naidoo et al 2008 nitrogen starvation lu et al 2001 and drought guo et al 2016 which reduce the actual photosynthetic rate and crop yield as shown in fig 2 b at 10 randomly selected pixels one pixel in each county maize yields are simulated at different levels of intrinsic quantum efficiency with the vip model the simulated yields increase with the intrinsic quantum efficiency and the relationship between the intrinsic quantum efficiencies and maize yields can be fit as a power function with an r2 value of 0 98 p 0 001 5 ε n o r 0 056 e yield sim 0 34 0 026 where ε n o r is the intrinsic quantum efficiency yieldsim is the simulated spring maize yield influenced strongly by the environmental conditions the crop s photosynthetically active biomass at the canopy scale can be captured through spectral measures such as ndvi lobell et al 2007 fpar the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation mackey et al 2012 and solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence yoshida et al 2015 numerous studies have shown that ndvi is closely related to crop yield ren et al 2008 moriondo et al 2007 from the observed dataset of maize yield and aboveground biomass at 14 agricultural experimental stations table a2 from 2004 to 2012 a power function is used to fit the yields with their corresponding ndvi values r2 0 75 p 0 001 fig 2a 6 yield obs 0 074 1 ndvi obs 3 77 where yieldobs is the observed yield and ndviobs is the ndvi of maize at the mature stage to avoid mixed pixels the ndvi was deduced from the measured aboveground biomass appendix c all data used to establish the relationship were normalized with the maximum minimum normalization method the validated vip model is able to predict crop yield at the stations with proper values of intrinsic quantum efficiency hence the simulated yields are used in eq 6 and then the relationship between intrinsic quantum efficiency and ndvi is derived as follows 7 ε n o r 0 056 e 0 218 1 ndvi 3 77 0 026 where ndvi is the normalized value of the ndvi at each grid and ε n o r is the normalized value of the intrinsic quantum efficiency at the corresponding grid because the intrinsic quantum efficiency obtained from eq 7 is the normalized value the actual intrinsic quantum efficiency should be recalculated as follows 8 ε act ε min ε n o r ε max ε min where ε act is the actual intrinsic quantum efficiency μmol photons m 2 s 1 ε n o r is the normalized intrinsic quantum efficiency obtained from eq 7 ε m i n is the minimum intrinsic quantum efficiency set as 0 015 μmol photons m 2 s 1 ε max is the maximum intrinsic quantum efficiency set as 0 065 μmol photons m 2 s 1 when calculating the intrinsic quantum efficiency pattern the averaged ndvi patterns at the mature stage august and september are normalized and then the normalized and actual intrinsic quantum efficiency patterns can be obtained with eqs 7 and 8 respectively 2 3 3 yield gap assessment to evaluate the effect of changes in environmental conditions on the yield gap the factors that drive variability in the yield gap should be determined in this study we define three yield levels namely 1 actual yield yr which is the average yield achieved by farmers to simulate the actual yield the intrinsic quantum efficiency pattern obtained by the statistical approach described in section 2 3 2 was used to drive the vip model because the intrinsic quantum efficiency pattern represents the heterogeneity of environmental stress the simulated crop yield can reflect the spatial variation of the yield under realistic agricultural practices and climatic water and nutrient conditions 2 attainable yield ya which is the maximum yield under local climatic conditions with current feasible changes in agricultural practices to address the suboptimal availability of water and nutrients mueller et al 2012 because the attainable yield is measured as the yield on the highest yielding field the average value of the top 5 intrinsic quantum efficiencies in the hrb is used for each pixel in the attainable yield pattern simulation therefore the spatial variation of the attainable yield is only affected by climatic conditions 3 crop yield without water stress yw which is the yield under local climatic and soil nutrient conditions with an abundant water supply soil water content consistently above 70 of the field capacity during the maize growth stage although the intrinsic quantum efficiency may be affected by water and nutrient stress the coefficients of variation of annual nitrogen fertilizer usage range from 0 99 5 22 appendix a table a1 indicating that nutrient management did not change greatly from 2005 to 2013 therefore the pattern of intrinsic quantum efficiency used in the yw simulation is deduced from the relationship between the ndvi and the observed yield data in 2006 the year with the highest precipitation during the maize growth stage over the past 30 years it is set that irrigation starts when the soil water content is lower than 70 of the field capacity if the soil water content reaches the field capacity irrigation is stopped irrigation times have no limitation in the yw simulation the yield gaps defined in this study are as follows 1 yield gap yg which is the difference between the attainable yield and actual yield 2 water limit yield gap ygw which is the difference between the actual yield and yield without water stress yw it represents the yield limited by water stress and 3 soil limit yield gap ygs which is the difference between the attainable yield and yield without water stress yw in this study soil constraints are defined broadly as non water limitations including soil fertility physical structure depth and other soil properties and agricultural practices that affect soil condition the yield gap fractions yg fractions water limit yield gap fractions ygw fractions and soil limit yield gap fractions ygs fractions are calculated as follows 9 y g f r a c t i o n y a y r y a 10 y g w f r a c t i o n y w y r y a y r 11 y g s f r a c t i o n y a y w y a y r 3 results 3 1 method validation the simulated lai aboveground biomass and yield were validated with field survey and census data the simulated lai and aboveground biomass at the shouyang agricultural meteorological station in 2011 were consistent with the measured values fig 3 and presented the same r2 value of 0 98 the simulated crop yield was 9352 kg ha 1 similar to the measured value 9405 kg ha 1 at the shouyang agricultural meteorological station in 2011 the simulated and census yield at the county scale were in reasonable agreement with r2 values ranging from 0 37 to 0 74 and rrmses rrmse equals rmse divided by the observed data ranging from 16 to 29 fig 4 b nine years as nine datasets taking nine years as one dataset r2 between the simulated yield and census yield data was 0 58 and rrmse was 19 these results indicated that the model performed satisfactorily in maize growth process simulation at the field scale and yield pattern simulations at the basin level 3 2 advantage of the parameter retrieval method many approaches have been described for retrieving biophysical parameters from remote sensing data the methodology applied in this study was developed on the basis of research conducted by hu and mo 2011 in which photosynthetic parameters by regressing ndvi and the grain yield were retrieved however empirical function derivation at the county level may result in improper estimates of the values in certain pixels due to ndvi fusion in the north china plain the photosynthetic parameters and grain yield of wheat were underestimated with the method provided by hu and mo 2011 in grids with a relatively low photosynthetic capability hu and mo 2014 in this study the ndvi value used in regression is deduced from the aboveground biomass according to an empirical relationship at pixel scale compared with the relation between ndvi and maize yield at the county level in hrb r2 of 0 63 the relationship at pixel scale is more robust with an r2 of 0 75 fig 2a this resulted in a stronger correlation between the simulated and observed census yields nine years as one dataset r2 0 58 rrmse 19 with the method in this study referred to as method b than with the method provided by hu and mo 2011 referred to as method a r2 0 46 rrmse 23 especially in the counties with high heterogeneity of vegetation such as wutai fanzhi in wutai the farmland percentage is less than 40 and the maize production area ratio is 63 table a1 method b has a much lower rrmse of grain yield 11 and a higher r2 0 22 compared with method a r2 0 15 rrmse 36 table 2 in addition although the relationship between intrinsic quantum efficiency and crop yield is controlled by the mechanism of crop growth variations in the simulated yield with intrinsic quantum efficiency at one location cannot represent the spatial yield variability associated with differences in growth dynamics as reflected in the ndvi therefore the simulated yield variations at different locations due to changes in ε are used to build the relationship between intrinsic quantum efficiency and maize yield which may give a more comprehensive description of yield variation in hrb in general compared with the method provided by hu and mo 2011 the method used in this study avoids ndvi fusion problems and gives more reliable yield simulations 3 3 spatial patterns of quantum efficiency and grain yield the intrinsic quantum efficiency of spring maize was obtained based on the equations in section 2 3 2 and the results showed considerable spatial variability in the hrb with a range of 0 016 μmol photons m 2 s 1 to 0 065 μmol photons m 2 s 1 fig 5 a the spatial pattern of crop yield was highly consistent with that of intrinsic quantum efficiency fig 5 with an r2 value of 0 86 the crop yields ranged from 2542 kg ha 1 to 8698 kg ha 1 in the study area with an average value of 4235 kg ha 1 the top 10 intrinsic quantum efficiency and crop yield which average the values above 0 057 μmol photons m 2 s 1 and 6400 kg ha 1 respectively were distributed in the western area because intrinsic quantum efficiency is closely related to the soil water content the average intrinsic quantum efficiency and crop yield in rain fed fields 0 025 μmol photons m 2 s 1 and 2300 kg ha 1 were lower than those in irrigated fields 0 042 μmol photons m 2 s 1 and 5400 kg ha 1 suggesting great potential for yield improvements the field experiments showed that if the soil water content increased from 45 to 80 of the field capacity the intrinsic quantum efficiency would correspondingly increase by 54 zhang et al 2011 additionally investigations have noted that nitrogen deficiencies may decrease the quantum yield of psii electron transport and the efficiency of excitation energy captured by open psii reaction centers lu et al 2001 leading to a reduction in crop intrinsic quantum efficiency studies have reported intrinsic quantum efficiency values of 0 036 μmol photons m 2 s 1 without nitrogen application and 0 062 μmol photons m 2 s 1 with 180 kg ha 1 nitrogen application wang et al 2014b the top 10 intrinsic quantum efficiency and crop yield were mostly distributed in xinzhou yuanping and dingxiang which have the larger nitrogen fertilizer usage in the hrb appendix a table a1 in addition because soil nitrogen content is linearly related to som zhang et al 2014 the top quantum efficiency appeared in grids with an som content above 18 g kg 1 whereas the gap between the quantum efficiency and the peak values were greater than 0 043 μmol photons m 2 s 1 in grids with som contents less than 7 g kg 1 consequently poor soil conditions and insufficient irrigation increased the quantum efficiency gap and crop yield gap between farmland scattered on upslope regions quantum efficiency less than 0 026 μmol photons m 2 s 1 and farmland in the western area 3 4 spatial pattern of the maize yield gap the yield gap showed a distinct capacity for potential increases in yield the average yield gaps between the attainable and simulated yield showed noticeable spatial variability ranging from 3100 kg ha 1 to 9000 kg ha 1 fig 6 a over the entire region the spatially averaged yield gap was 5246 kg ha 1 which represented 55 of the attainable yield most grids had a yield gap between 4000 kg ha 1 and 6500 kg ha 1 fig 6d the contribution of water stress to the yield gap increased with the slope gradient indicating that high yield gaps resulted from water stress in scattered farmland distributed on the upslope fig 6c in farmland distributed on hillsides with slope gradients above 8 the water limit yield gap fraction which represents the contribution of water stress to the yield gap was greater than 50 fig 7 indicating that water stress is the principle factor limiting crop yield because the topography is not suitable for surface irrigation low effective irrigated area ratios were correlated with rugged terrain in wutai 8 1 yuxian 3 4 and pingding 8 2 which have a large percentage of farmland distributed in the steep hillside fig 8 therefore the soil moisture in june dry season in hrb in wutai yuxian and pingding is lower than those in yuanping and xinzhou which have a high percentage of irrigated fields at the county scale temperature vegetation drought index tvdi was linearly related to the irrigated area ratio and the water limited yield gap decreased with irrigated area ratio fig 9 demonstrating that irrigation is an important source of soil moisture and water scarcity exerted noticeable effects on crop productivity at the sensitive growth stage in addition to water availability other factors affect the crop yield gap including soil organic matter content and soil depth soil organic matter content has long been considered an important component of soil that affects a range of functional soil properties and nutrient cycling murphy 2015 the soil organic matter content presented a pattern similar to that of the maize yield gap with the highest yield gap 7400 kg ha 1 occurring in grids with less than 7 g kg 1 som content and yield gaps less than 3200 kg ha 1 occurring in grids with relatively high som contents 18 25 g kg 1 as shown in fig 10 b the yield gap decreased with the soil organic matter content with an r2 value of 0 74 indicating that soil organic matter content deficiency is a major factor limiting crop yield however the grids with a higher level of soil organic matter content did not have the low yield gap suggesting that other factors contributed to the yield gap as well a comparison of the soil depth soil organic matter content and yield gap patterns showed that grids with soil organic matter contents above 25 g kg 1 were mostly located in the southern part of the study area where the soil layer thickness was less than 50 cm although the soil organic matter content in the top layer of these grids was relatively high the shallow soil layer could not provide the required nutrition and water for crop growth leading to relatively high yield gaps in these grids field experiment results showed that the maize yields in plots with soil depth of 40 cm were only 40 and 34 of those in plots with soil depths of 80 cm and 100 cm respectively zhu et al 2009 over the entire basin the average yield gap induced by soil constraints ygs was 3680 kg ha 1 which accounted for 70 of the total yield gap the soil limit yield gap fractions in more than 80 grids were greater than 50 demonstrating that the yield gap was mainly induced by soil constraints fig 6 h 4 discussion 4 1 prediction uncertainty in crop yield accurately representing the spatial heterogeneity of crop yields is the foundation for analyzing yield gap patterns input driving data model structures and parameters are important sources of uncertainty in model predictions luo et al 2015 to evaluate the simulation uncertainty of the crop yield the simulated maize yield obtained with different interpolated climatic data different soil texture data and land surface characterizations with different spatial resolution were compared with each other as follows climatic variables are the major input data required by the ecosystem models the accuracy of these data is pivotal to the estimation of vegetation biomass matsushita et al 2004 to evaluate simulation errors introduced by climatic variables interpolated climatic data in the five meteorological stations of the study area were compared with the raw data the interpolation dataset obtained using the meteorological data from meteorological stations in fig 1 for interpolation is referred to as gids5 and that obtained using 88 meteorological stations in and around the north china plain for interpolation is referred to as gids88 cross validation showed that the mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse of all meteorological variables with gids5 were greater than those with gids88 table 1 indicating that using meteorological data from more meteorological stations can reduce the interpolation errors however when using the two datasets in the vip model minor differences were found between the mae and rmse of simulated yield with gids5 and gids88 demonstrating that using five meteorological stations for interpolation is acceptable in this region soil texture is a key parameter in the model which plays an important role in determining soil hydrological characteristics and thermal properties such as saturated soil moisture saturated hydraulic conductivity and heat capacity which affect crop growth and yield by comparing the soil textural data used in this study referred to as dataset a with those retrieved from a 1 14 000 000 scale map institute of soil science academia sinica 1989 referred to as dataset b we found that the major soil type in the northern part of the study area such as dingxiang was loam in dataset a and sandy loam in dataset b however in the southern hrb such as yangquan and pingding the major soil type was sandy loam in dataset a and loam in dataset b relative to maize grown in loam the simulated yield increased by 1 6 12 3 while maize was grown in sandy loam under the same treatment indicating that the simulated yield would increase in the northern hrb and decrease in the south with dataset b however the higher spatial resolution dataset dataset a may provide more detailed information about soil texture which may benefit the yield simulation the spatial resolution of the land surface characterization showed a strong effect on the crop yield simulation primarily due to the mixed pixel the uncertainty in a gpp simulation increases as the spatial resolution of the input data sets decreases turner et al 2003 zhao et al 2005 cai et al 2014 in xinzhou where cropland is distributed rather closely the cropland percentage in each grid was greater than 80 and the maize production area ratio was 92 table a1 the r2 value between the simulated and measured yields from 2005 to 2013 was 0 36 and the rmse was 480 kg ha 1 the rrmse was 10 table 3 by contrast in wutai where crop fields are mixed with forest the cropland percentage was less than 40 and the maize production area ratio was 63 table a1 the r2 value between the simulated and measured yields was 0 15 and the rmse was 1448 kg ha 1 the rrmse was 36 table 3 indicating that the efficiency of maize yield prediction was higher in grids with a greater cropland percentage remote sensing data with high spatial resolution such as chinese gao fen remote sensing data can provide more detailed information about land surface characterization with the aid of high spatial resolution land use data 20 m 20 m provided by cbers the evapotranspiration in each subgrid and the contribution of different subgrid scale surface types to the grid box average were calculated which reduced the error in the evapotranspiration simulation with modis ndvi 1 km resolution xin et al 2005 this finding demonstrates that the combination of high resolution remote sensing data and modis data may be a useful way to fix the mixed pixels problem in this study we retrieved intrinsic quantum efficiency patterns a key photosynthetic parameter from rs information and aimed to reduce uncertainties in maize yield pattern predictions although the parameter retrieval method helps the model capture the spatial variability of maize yield errors in the intrinsic quantum efficiency introduced by the retrieval method may also affect the yield simulation to evaluate the simulation errors introduced by the parameter retrieval method the simulated yield in this study referred to as the parameter driven method was compared with the yield derived by the state variable driven method which used the lai retrieved from the ndvi to drive the vip model more details on the method are reported by hu and mo 2014 in the parameter driven method the maximum lai is controlled by the functional mechanism of crop growth reaching 6 5 at the heading stage in highly productive areas such as in yuanping and xinzhou while the maximum lai value was approximately 5 0 when estimated by the state variable driven method due to the saturation problem of rs signals duchemin et al 2006 smith et al 2008 considering that the lai was correlated significantly with the plant biomass and yield the r2 value between the simulated yield and the measured yield in the parameter driven method was higher than that in the state variable driven method in highly productive areas with good farming conditions table 3 however under poor farming conditions with low crop productivity such as in fanzhi and wutai the parameter driven method showed more simulation errors and worse performance lower r2 and higher rrmse than the state variable driven method because the state variable driven method described the interannual variations in yield more favorably therefore when separating the relative contribution of water stress to the yield gap from that of other factors the intrinsic quantum efficiency pattern in the year with the highest precipitation over the past 30 years was used as a controlled treatment although this practice cannot eliminate crop avoidance of water stress at any time during the maize growing stage it provides relatively ideal non water limitation conditions 4 2 comparisons of yield gaps with the relevant references compared with previous studies in the ncp region table 4 which has soil fertility and climatic conditions similar to those in our study area our estimated yield gap of 5246 kg ha 1 appears to be higher than the yield gap of 2000 kg ha 1 for the hebei plain liang et al 2011 900 kg ha 1 for quzhou zhao et al 2015 and 3400 5200 kg ha 1 for the ncp meng et al 2013 liu et al 2017 the major maize variety in ncp is summer maize however spring maize has a significantly higher grain quantity than summer maize because of a distinctly higher dry matter accumulation rate dai et al 2008 and a longer growth cycle the yield gaps in the hrb could be even greater than those in the ncp if spring maize were replaced by summer maize this obvious difference may be caused by differences in the water conditions in the ncp rainfall ranges from 470 to 910 mm from the north to the south and more than 70 falls during the growth period of summer maize wang et al 2008 2010 concentrated summer rainfall could meet the water demand for maize in most years in the ncp chen et al 2010 wang et al 2012 however in the hrb although the precipitation is approximately 300 500 mm it is distributed irregularly during the maize growth stage less than 10 of the rainfall occurs from late may to june during the jointing stage and rainfall can only meet 40 of the water required for maize growth zhang et al 2015 irrigation is therefore particularly important for maize growth before july researchers have shown that yields could be decreased by 7 5 26 19 under conditions with low soil water content at the jointing stage tan et al 2010 compared with those obtained under the rain fed condition the simulation results obtained from the vip model showed that the yield increased by 21 when more than 80 mm water was irrigated at the jointing stage although 55 of water resources are used in agriculture irrigation in hrb we found that most areas presenting water stress with an absolute yield gap of more than 5600 kg ha 1 were located on the hillside which lacks effective irrigation considering cropland located on slopes steeper than 8 are not suitable for surface irrigation shahriar et al 2014 strengthening irrigation infrastructure construction is not suggested in these area and the conserved water can be supplied to the ncp which has higher water use efficiency than the hrb because summer maize is prevailing in the ncp the yield gap of spring maize in northeast china nec was also used for comparison the average yield gap in the nec over the past 50 years is similar to lv et al 2015 or even larger liu et al 2016 than that in the hrb since the 1980s the grain yields in the nec have increased significantly because of plant breeding and improved agricultural practices however the attainable yield has decreased significantly p 0 01 because of temperature increases solar radiation and precipitation decreases as a result the yield gap of the nec was narrowed in 2010 36 of the potential yield liu et al 2016 and lower than that in the hrb compared with that in the nec which has the highest potential maize yield in china the soil organic matter content 13 8 g kg 1 in the study area was much lower than the nec average 30 99 g kg 1 from 2004 to 2013 kang et al 2016 and national average 26 9 g kg 1 in 1997 chen et al 2011 mechanical investigations have indicated that under considerable decreases in soil organic matter concentrations the productive capacity of agriculture will be compromised by impaired soil nutrient cycling mechanisms loveland and webb 2003 and deteriorated soil physical properties such as soil aggregate stability murphy et al 2013 bulk density valzano et al 2005 water holding capacity rawls et al 2003 and buffering capacity krull et al 2004 therefore the soil organic matter content can contribute to crop productivity in rice soil organic matter content was positively associated with crop yield r2 0 674 p 0 05 shen 1997 and in wheat a loss in soil organic matter content equivalent to 1 mg ha 1 was associated with a grain yield decrease of 40 kg ha 1 martin et al 1999 the yield gap in our study decreased with the soil organic matter content indicating a substantial opportunity for increasing agricultural production via nutrition management 5 conclusions crop yield gaps are concerning for farmlands with unfavorable soil and irrigation facilities in this study a process based ecosystem model vip model and rs data were used to explore the gap between the actual yield and attainable yield in a northern china basin assess the magnitude of that yield gap and identify the underlying causes the relationship between the intrinsic quantum efficiency and ndvi was established and used to obtain the electron transport capability pattern over the region the yield predictions for spring maize were validated with census data from 2005 to 2013 demonstrating the ability of the model to simulate grain yields that cover both spatial and temporal heterogeneity the average yield gap of maize is 5246 kg ha 1 55 of the attainable yield in the hrb in more than 80 of the grids in the study area soil constraints such as the som content and soil depth are the primary factors affecting the yield gap crop and nutrient management and other agronomic strategies should be revised to establish better soil conditions for most farmland in the hrb water stress is the major factor constraining crop yields for farmland on hillsides with a slope gradient greater than 8 although the insufficient irrigation is a result of poor agricultural infrastructure construction improving agricultural irrigation construction is not suggested for these regions because the topography is not suitable for surface irrigation the conserved water can be supplied to downstream plains where the water use efficiency is higher than that in the hrb some drought tolerant corn varieties may be more suitable for planting in farmland on hillsides soil quality affects more than 80 of farmland grids and contributes to 70 of the yield gap the yield gap is positively related to soil organic matter content considering that chemical fertilizer usage in hrb is higher than the global average level improving fertilizer management is therefore the primary task in the hrb regulating the structure and varieties of chemical fertilizer is the top priority to achieve balanced fertilization the government should provide fertilizer formulas after soil testing to improve the fertilization efficiency to increase the soil organic matter content planting green manure increasing the investment in organic fertilizer and straw returning should also be encouraged in the hrb funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 41471026

10838,identifying the factors driving yield gaps between the attainable and actual yields achieved by farmers is essential for agricultural improvement and water resource management in this study the process based vip vegetation interface processes eco hydrological model was used to estimate the yield gap of spring maize in the hutuo river basin hrb north china to describe the realistic crop growth and attainable yield pattern the field sampled grain yield and aboveground biomass were used to design a scheme to retrieve the intrinsic quantum efficiency ε a c t for leaf photosynthesis of c4 crop including the statistical relationships between the intrinsic quantum efficiency vegetation index and grain yield the actual yields were predicted with the retrieved intrinsic quantum efficiency pattern while the attainable yields were predicted with the average of the top 5 intrinsic quantum efficiencies the simulated actual yields are consistent with the census data at the county level r2 of 0 37 to 0 74 and relative rmse of 16 29 the average yield gap in the basin is 5246 kg ha 1 being 55 of the attainable yield it is revealed that soil organic matter som content and depth of soil layer are the principal limiting factors in more than 80 of farmland and results in 70 of the yield gap while the effects of som content is dominant in flat piedmont water stress is also a critical factor limiting crop yield especially for hilly farmlands with slopes greater than 8 improving fertilizer management and irrigation techniques in the hrb is therefore the primary task to narrow yield gaps attributable to basin management keywords yield gap quantum efficiency vip model vegetation index maize 1 introduction with ongoing population growth increasing grain production is critical to national food security over the next 20 years grain production should increase by at least 35 to meet global food demand zhang 2011 the basic and emergent issues are to assess the yield gap and investigate crop yield constraints to improve our capability to increase yields in the future therefore accurate estimation of exploitable yield gap is essential to assess the potential of regional crop production enhancement the difference between the potential and actual yield achieved by farmers represents the exploitable yield gap cassman et al 2003 in general the potential yield is the yield of a crop cultivar when grown under non limiting water and nutrient supplies and in the absence of pests and diseases evans and fischer 1999 grassini et al 2009 this value is the yield ceiling of a given crop variety in a given location evans and fischer 1999 however this type of absolute biophysical potential yield is difficult to obtain therefore attainable yield which represents the yield achievable using current optimal technology and management techniques at a given time and ecosystem is used more widely than potential yield in general the observed maximum yield and field experimental data are assumed to represent attainable yield while survey or census data are used as actual yield lobell et al 2009 although the observed data are easy to obtain they can t represent an independent estimate of the crop potential production capability based on a specific climate soil and management condition and field data have limited temporal coverage and insufficient spatial resolution schulthess et al 2013 liang et al 2011 crop models can provide estimates of yield at regional scale which have been successfully applied to investigate the attainable yield actual yield and crop yield gap in the north china plain wang et al 2014 entire country of china liu et al 2017 and the wheat belt of western australia oliver and robertson 2013 however model parameters may show significant differences related to environmental conditions e g temperature and precipitation li et al 2016 and the use of crop models in estimating yield gaps still faces challenges of requiring parameters at fine scale resolution combining remote sensing data and crop models is believed to fulfill this requirement of spatial temporal coverage of model parameters in yield estimation remote sensing data can be translated into corresponding parameters or state variables driving the crop model such as photosynthetic parameters and leaf area index lai by empirical functions or physical scattering models dorigo et al 2007 however state variables such as lai cannot be used to estimate the attainable yield which restricted the applications of remote sensing retrieved state variables in yield gap assessment thus obtaining the photosynthetic parameter pattern is critical for accurate estimation of crop attainable yield and actual yield globally the current average actual maize yield is 64 of the maximum attainable yield neumann et al 2010 indicating a gap of 36 with remarkable spatial variability it is reported that the yield gaps in south asia and africa exceed 70 while the gaps are less than 30 in west europe and america hengsdijk and langeveld 2009 van wart et al 2013 schulthess et al 2013 the yield gaps range from 28 to 78 liu et al 2012 hou et al 2013 wang et al 2011 in china such as the actual yield to potential yield ratio is 34 in northeast china lv et al 2015 41 in the north china plain 37 in northwest china and 44 in southwest china meng et al 2013 this remarkable spatial heterogeneity may be attributed to agricultural practices licker et al 2010 nutrition and water management practices ahrens et al 2010 mueller et al 2012 because of the heterogeneity of soil quality water conditions climate conditions agricultural practices and their complex interactions the relative contributions of these factors vary greatly among regions which are still poorly understood in many regions the hutuo river basin hrb is a mountainous watershed located in northern china although farmland accounts for only 27 of the basin agriculture irrigation consumes more than 55 of the water resources in the basin shanxi water resources bulletin 2008 therefore irrigation is closely related to crop yield in the hrb and reduce the amount of water supplied to the downstream plain separating the relative contribution of water to the yield gap from other factors is helpful for basin water resource management in this study firstly an approach based on hu and mo 2011 is developed to retrieve the photosynthetic capability intrinsic quantum efficiency pattern of a c4 crop spring maize from multiyear remote sensing rs data for simulation of regional crop yield secondly the spatial variability of yield gap of spring maize in the hrb is explored and the impacts of soil and water conditions on the yield gaps are separated 2 materials and method 2 1 region description the hutuo river basin 37 16 n to 39 28 n 112 11 e to 119 45 e is located in the northern part of north china which covers parts of shanxi province and hebei province with a drainage area of 23 000 km2 fig 1 the basin belongs to the subhumid warm temperate continental monsoon climate with annual mean temperature of 5 2 c to 6 7 c and annual precipitation of 350 700 mm precipitation is distributed irregularly throughout the year with approximately 75 occurring from may to october during the spring maize growing season the major land use types are forests 27 5 grassland 41 5 and farmland 26 8 in the hrb single harvest spring maize more than 80 of cropland is planted with the same maize variety jingdan32 is the prevailing cropping system in the part of shanxi province table a1 in appendix a whereas in the eastern part of the hrb the prevailing cropping system is wheat maize rotation blank area in fig 1b 2 2 data sources 2 2 1 land surface characterization data land surface characteristics include the topography soil physical texture soil organic matter som content soil depth and land use type a digital elevation model was obtained from a topographic map at a 1 250 000 scale soil textural data are available at a scale of 1 1 000 000 and represented by fractions of sand silt and clay http westdc westgis ac cn which were used to estimate the soil physical texture map as reported by zhang 2007 the soil organic matter content and soil depth at a resolution of 1 km were adopted from shangguan et al 2013 land use data from the late 1990s were developed from landsat thematic mapper tm scenes downloaded from http www resdc cn these data were resampled to 250 250 m2 using the nearest neighbor method 2 2 2 meteorological data using the gradient inverse distance gids method daily meteorological data daily average maximum and minimum air temperatures atmospheric pressure humidity wind speed precipitation and sunshine duration http cdc cma gov cn were interpolated over the entire region with meteorological data 2005 2013 from five meteorological stations in and around the hrb fig 1 2 2 3 agricultural data the agricultural data included the measured aboveground biomass lai census yield data effective irrigated area ratio maize production area ratio and annual chemical fertilizer usage the census yield data effective irrigated area ratio maize production area ratio and annual chemical fertilizer usage appendix a table a1 at the county scale of the study area were derived from the shanxi provincial statistical annals from 2006 to 2014 the measured yield lai and aboveground biomass during the maize growing stage at the shouyang agricultural meteorological station in 2011 were used as the reference data gao 2013 the observed maize yield and aboveground biomass at the mature maize stage from 2004 to 2012 at fourteen agricultural experimental stations appendix a table a2 were downloaded from national science technology infrastructure http www cnern org cn 2 2 4 remote sensing data the rs data used were 16 day composite 250 m normalized difference vegetation index ndvi 16 day composite 1 km ndvi and 8 day composite 1 km land surface temperatures from 2005 to 2013 which were derived from the mod13q1 mod13a2 and mod11a2 nasa science data products https ladsweb nascom nasa gov respectively because only cropland was considered in this study the land cover mask derived from landsat tm images http www resdc cn was used to eliminate the influence of non agricultural regions consequently all areas with non agricultural land were masked out and ndvi values were extracted for only those areas having crops in addition pixels with an absolute range of ndvi values maximum minimum of the annual ndvi of less than 0 1 were excluded because the majority of these pixels indicated developed areas and water areas in addition a savitzky golay sg filter chen et al 2004 was applied to check for erroneous data and construct a high quality time series of ndvi to describe the soil moisture conditions based on the approach proposed by sandholt et al 2002 1 km ndvi and 1 km land surface temperature lst data were used to calculate the tvdi temperature vegetation drought index to match the temporal resolution of the modis ndvi a maximum lst of 16 days was retrieved tvdi is a drought index that can reflect soil moisture content high tvdi values indicate low soil moisture and high degrees of drought whereas low tvdi values indicate high soil moisture and low degrees of drought to match the spatial resolution of land surface characterization data and simulated yield tvdi were resampled to 250 250 m2 using the nearest neighbor method 2 3 methods 2 3 1 model introduction the vip model used in this study is a dynamic ecosystem model that simulates radiation water heat and co2 transfer processes during the crop growing season the main biochemical processes in the vip model include the water cycle energy balance and carbon cycle mo et al 2012 mo and liu 2001 the crop growth process and yield are simulated by a crop growth module which includes a daily crop growth submodule and a phenological development submodule appendix b photosynthesis is a critical ecological process that is coupled to the ecosystem s water cycle and carbon cycle which determine the daily growth of crop dry mass ac mol c m 2 d 1 the leaf photosynthesis rate is primarily restricted by saturation of the enzyme ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco with respect to carboxylation electron transport as limited by ribulose bisphosphate rubp regeneration and the phosphate release rate during the consumption of photosynthetic products the actual photosynthesis rate depends on the limiting values of the three aforementioned factors farquhar et al 1980 sellers et al 1992 therefore the net assimilation rate of co2 an μmol c m 2 s 1 is expressed as follows 1 a n min a r a e a s r d where ar is the rubisco limiting rate ae is the light limiting rate as is the capacity for the export or utilization of the photosynthetic products and rd is the leaf respiration rate μmol c m 2 s 1 for c4 crops ar ae and as are expressed as follows 2 a r v cmax 3 a e ε q par 4 a s 2 10 4 c i p v cmax where vcmax is the maximum catalytic capacity of rubisco μmol c m 2 s 1 ci is the intercellular concentration of co2 p is the atmospheric pressure pa qpar is the par photosynthetically active radiation μmol photons m 2 s 1 loaded on the leaf surface and ε is the intrinsic quantum efficiency μmol photons m 2 s 1 which provides an expression of the electron transport capability in the photosynthetic process in this study the influence of soil nitrogen water and other environmental factors are assumed to be accounted for by the intrinsic quantum efficiency values thus to some extent ε is considered an empirical parameter reflecting the background of crop photosynthetic capacity the growth of spring maize is simulated from 2004 to 2013 in daily steps and with a 250 m grid over the study area the model initialization period spans from january 2004 to december 2004 and the simulation results obtained for 2005 to 2013 are used for analysis the input data of the vip model include daily meteorological data average maximum and minimum air temperatures atmospheric pressure humidity wind speed precipitation and sunshine duration and the yearly atmospheric concentration of co2 ε is determined by the approach in section 2 3 2 the values of other parameters used in this paper are listed in table b1 appendix b 2 3 2 approach to obtain the intrinsic quantum efficiency pattern the methodology for obtaining the intrinsic quantum efficiency pattern was developed based on hu and mo 2011 who successfully retrieved the spatial pattern of rubisco carboxylase activity vcmax of winter wheat the intrinsic quantum efficiency in c4 plants is sensitive to environmental stresses such as salinity naidoo et al 2008 nitrogen starvation lu et al 2001 and drought guo et al 2016 which reduce the actual photosynthetic rate and crop yield as shown in fig 2 b at 10 randomly selected pixels one pixel in each county maize yields are simulated at different levels of intrinsic quantum efficiency with the vip model the simulated yields increase with the intrinsic quantum efficiency and the relationship between the intrinsic quantum efficiencies and maize yields can be fit as a power function with an r2 value of 0 98 p 0 001 5 ε n o r 0 056 e yield sim 0 34 0 026 where ε n o r is the intrinsic quantum efficiency yieldsim is the simulated spring maize yield influenced strongly by the environmental conditions the crop s photosynthetically active biomass at the canopy scale can be captured through spectral measures such as ndvi lobell et al 2007 fpar the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation mackey et al 2012 and solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence yoshida et al 2015 numerous studies have shown that ndvi is closely related to crop yield ren et al 2008 moriondo et al 2007 from the observed dataset of maize yield and aboveground biomass at 14 agricultural experimental stations table a2 from 2004 to 2012 a power function is used to fit the yields with their corresponding ndvi values r2 0 75 p 0 001 fig 2a 6 yield obs 0 074 1 ndvi obs 3 77 where yieldobs is the observed yield and ndviobs is the ndvi of maize at the mature stage to avoid mixed pixels the ndvi was deduced from the measured aboveground biomass appendix c all data used to establish the relationship were normalized with the maximum minimum normalization method the validated vip model is able to predict crop yield at the stations with proper values of intrinsic quantum efficiency hence the simulated yields are used in eq 6 and then the relationship between intrinsic quantum efficiency and ndvi is derived as follows 7 ε n o r 0 056 e 0 218 1 ndvi 3 77 0 026 where ndvi is the normalized value of the ndvi at each grid and ε n o r is the normalized value of the intrinsic quantum efficiency at the corresponding grid because the intrinsic quantum efficiency obtained from eq 7 is the normalized value the actual intrinsic quantum efficiency should be recalculated as follows 8 ε act ε min ε n o r ε max ε min where ε act is the actual intrinsic quantum efficiency μmol photons m 2 s 1 ε n o r is the normalized intrinsic quantum efficiency obtained from eq 7 ε m i n is the minimum intrinsic quantum efficiency set as 0 015 μmol photons m 2 s 1 ε max is the maximum intrinsic quantum efficiency set as 0 065 μmol photons m 2 s 1 when calculating the intrinsic quantum efficiency pattern the averaged ndvi patterns at the mature stage august and september are normalized and then the normalized and actual intrinsic quantum efficiency patterns can be obtained with eqs 7 and 8 respectively 2 3 3 yield gap assessment to evaluate the effect of changes in environmental conditions on the yield gap the factors that drive variability in the yield gap should be determined in this study we define three yield levels namely 1 actual yield yr which is the average yield achieved by farmers to simulate the actual yield the intrinsic quantum efficiency pattern obtained by the statistical approach described in section 2 3 2 was used to drive the vip model because the intrinsic quantum efficiency pattern represents the heterogeneity of environmental stress the simulated crop yield can reflect the spatial variation of the yield under realistic agricultural practices and climatic water and nutrient conditions 2 attainable yield ya which is the maximum yield under local climatic conditions with current feasible changes in agricultural practices to address the suboptimal availability of water and nutrients mueller et al 2012 because the attainable yield is measured as the yield on the highest yielding field the average value of the top 5 intrinsic quantum efficiencies in the hrb is used for each pixel in the attainable yield pattern simulation therefore the spatial variation of the attainable yield is only affected by climatic conditions 3 crop yield without water stress yw which is the yield under local climatic and soil nutrient conditions with an abundant water supply soil water content consistently above 70 of the field capacity during the maize growth stage although the intrinsic quantum efficiency may be affected by water and nutrient stress the coefficients of variation of annual nitrogen fertilizer usage range from 0 99 5 22 appendix a table a1 indicating that nutrient management did not change greatly from 2005 to 2013 therefore the pattern of intrinsic quantum efficiency used in the yw simulation is deduced from the relationship between the ndvi and the observed yield data in 2006 the year with the highest precipitation during the maize growth stage over the past 30 years it is set that irrigation starts when the soil water content is lower than 70 of the field capacity if the soil water content reaches the field capacity irrigation is stopped irrigation times have no limitation in the yw simulation the yield gaps defined in this study are as follows 1 yield gap yg which is the difference between the attainable yield and actual yield 2 water limit yield gap ygw which is the difference between the actual yield and yield without water stress yw it represents the yield limited by water stress and 3 soil limit yield gap ygs which is the difference between the attainable yield and yield without water stress yw in this study soil constraints are defined broadly as non water limitations including soil fertility physical structure depth and other soil properties and agricultural practices that affect soil condition the yield gap fractions yg fractions water limit yield gap fractions ygw fractions and soil limit yield gap fractions ygs fractions are calculated as follows 9 y g f r a c t i o n y a y r y a 10 y g w f r a c t i o n y w y r y a y r 11 y g s f r a c t i o n y a y w y a y r 3 results 3 1 method validation the simulated lai aboveground biomass and yield were validated with field survey and census data the simulated lai and aboveground biomass at the shouyang agricultural meteorological station in 2011 were consistent with the measured values fig 3 and presented the same r2 value of 0 98 the simulated crop yield was 9352 kg ha 1 similar to the measured value 9405 kg ha 1 at the shouyang agricultural meteorological station in 2011 the simulated and census yield at the county scale were in reasonable agreement with r2 values ranging from 0 37 to 0 74 and rrmses rrmse equals rmse divided by the observed data ranging from 16 to 29 fig 4 b nine years as nine datasets taking nine years as one dataset r2 between the simulated yield and census yield data was 0 58 and rrmse was 19 these results indicated that the model performed satisfactorily in maize growth process simulation at the field scale and yield pattern simulations at the basin level 3 2 advantage of the parameter retrieval method many approaches have been described for retrieving biophysical parameters from remote sensing data the methodology applied in this study was developed on the basis of research conducted by hu and mo 2011 in which photosynthetic parameters by regressing ndvi and the grain yield were retrieved however empirical function derivation at the county level may result in improper estimates of the values in certain pixels due to ndvi fusion in the north china plain the photosynthetic parameters and grain yield of wheat were underestimated with the method provided by hu and mo 2011 in grids with a relatively low photosynthetic capability hu and mo 2014 in this study the ndvi value used in regression is deduced from the aboveground biomass according to an empirical relationship at pixel scale compared with the relation between ndvi and maize yield at the county level in hrb r2 of 0 63 the relationship at pixel scale is more robust with an r2 of 0 75 fig 2a this resulted in a stronger correlation between the simulated and observed census yields nine years as one dataset r2 0 58 rrmse 19 with the method in this study referred to as method b than with the method provided by hu and mo 2011 referred to as method a r2 0 46 rrmse 23 especially in the counties with high heterogeneity of vegetation such as wutai fanzhi in wutai the farmland percentage is less than 40 and the maize production area ratio is 63 table a1 method b has a much lower rrmse of grain yield 11 and a higher r2 0 22 compared with method a r2 0 15 rrmse 36 table 2 in addition although the relationship between intrinsic quantum efficiency and crop yield is controlled by the mechanism of crop growth variations in the simulated yield with intrinsic quantum efficiency at one location cannot represent the spatial yield variability associated with differences in growth dynamics as reflected in the ndvi therefore the simulated yield variations at different locations due to changes in ε are used to build the relationship between intrinsic quantum efficiency and maize yield which may give a more comprehensive description of yield variation in hrb in general compared with the method provided by hu and mo 2011 the method used in this study avoids ndvi fusion problems and gives more reliable yield simulations 3 3 spatial patterns of quantum efficiency and grain yield the intrinsic quantum efficiency of spring maize was obtained based on the equations in section 2 3 2 and the results showed considerable spatial variability in the hrb with a range of 0 016 μmol photons m 2 s 1 to 0 065 μmol photons m 2 s 1 fig 5 a the spatial pattern of crop yield was highly consistent with that of intrinsic quantum efficiency fig 5 with an r2 value of 0 86 the crop yields ranged from 2542 kg ha 1 to 8698 kg ha 1 in the study area with an average value of 4235 kg ha 1 the top 10 intrinsic quantum efficiency and crop yield which average the values above 0 057 μmol photons m 2 s 1 and 6400 kg ha 1 respectively were distributed in the western area because intrinsic quantum efficiency is closely related to the soil water content the average intrinsic quantum efficiency and crop yield in rain fed fields 0 025 μmol photons m 2 s 1 and 2300 kg ha 1 were lower than those in irrigated fields 0 042 μmol photons m 2 s 1 and 5400 kg ha 1 suggesting great potential for yield improvements the field experiments showed that if the soil water content increased from 45 to 80 of the field capacity the intrinsic quantum efficiency would correspondingly increase by 54 zhang et al 2011 additionally investigations have noted that nitrogen deficiencies may decrease the quantum yield of psii electron transport and the efficiency of excitation energy captured by open psii reaction centers lu et al 2001 leading to a reduction in crop intrinsic quantum efficiency studies have reported intrinsic quantum efficiency values of 0 036 μmol photons m 2 s 1 without nitrogen application and 0 062 μmol photons m 2 s 1 with 180 kg ha 1 nitrogen application wang et al 2014b the top 10 intrinsic quantum efficiency and crop yield were mostly distributed in xinzhou yuanping and dingxiang which have the larger nitrogen fertilizer usage in the hrb appendix a table a1 in addition because soil nitrogen content is linearly related to som zhang et al 2014 the top quantum efficiency appeared in grids with an som content above 18 g kg 1 whereas the gap between the quantum efficiency and the peak values were greater than 0 043 μmol photons m 2 s 1 in grids with som contents less than 7 g kg 1 consequently poor soil conditions and insufficient irrigation increased the quantum efficiency gap and crop yield gap between farmland scattered on upslope regions quantum efficiency less than 0 026 μmol photons m 2 s 1 and farmland in the western area 3 4 spatial pattern of the maize yield gap the yield gap showed a distinct capacity for potential increases in yield the average yield gaps between the attainable and simulated yield showed noticeable spatial variability ranging from 3100 kg ha 1 to 9000 kg ha 1 fig 6 a over the entire region the spatially averaged yield gap was 5246 kg ha 1 which represented 55 of the attainable yield most grids had a yield gap between 4000 kg ha 1 and 6500 kg ha 1 fig 6d the contribution of water stress to the yield gap increased with the slope gradient indicating that high yield gaps resulted from water stress in scattered farmland distributed on the upslope fig 6c in farmland distributed on hillsides with slope gradients above 8 the water limit yield gap fraction which represents the contribution of water stress to the yield gap was greater than 50 fig 7 indicating that water stress is the principle factor limiting crop yield because the topography is not suitable for surface irrigation low effective irrigated area ratios were correlated with rugged terrain in wutai 8 1 yuxian 3 4 and pingding 8 2 which have a large percentage of farmland distributed in the steep hillside fig 8 therefore the soil moisture in june dry season in hrb in wutai yuxian and pingding is lower than those in yuanping and xinzhou which have a high percentage of irrigated fields at the county scale temperature vegetation drought index tvdi was linearly related to the irrigated area ratio and the water limited yield gap decreased with irrigated area ratio fig 9 demonstrating that irrigation is an important source of soil moisture and water scarcity exerted noticeable effects on crop productivity at the sensitive growth stage in addition to water availability other factors affect the crop yield gap including soil organic matter content and soil depth soil organic matter content has long been considered an important component of soil that affects a range of functional soil properties and nutrient cycling murphy 2015 the soil organic matter content presented a pattern similar to that of the maize yield gap with the highest yield gap 7400 kg ha 1 occurring in grids with less than 7 g kg 1 som content and yield gaps less than 3200 kg ha 1 occurring in grids with relatively high som contents 18 25 g kg 1 as shown in fig 10 b the yield gap decreased with the soil organic matter content with an r2 value of 0 74 indicating that soil organic matter content deficiency is a major factor limiting crop yield however the grids with a higher level of soil organic matter content did not have the low yield gap suggesting that other factors contributed to the yield gap as well a comparison of the soil depth soil organic matter content and yield gap patterns showed that grids with soil organic matter contents above 25 g kg 1 were mostly located in the southern part of the study area where the soil layer thickness was less than 50 cm although the soil organic matter content in the top layer of these grids was relatively high the shallow soil layer could not provide the required nutrition and water for crop growth leading to relatively high yield gaps in these grids field experiment results showed that the maize yields in plots with soil depth of 40 cm were only 40 and 34 of those in plots with soil depths of 80 cm and 100 cm respectively zhu et al 2009 over the entire basin the average yield gap induced by soil constraints ygs was 3680 kg ha 1 which accounted for 70 of the total yield gap the soil limit yield gap fractions in more than 80 grids were greater than 50 demonstrating that the yield gap was mainly induced by soil constraints fig 6 h 4 discussion 4 1 prediction uncertainty in crop yield accurately representing the spatial heterogeneity of crop yields is the foundation for analyzing yield gap patterns input driving data model structures and parameters are important sources of uncertainty in model predictions luo et al 2015 to evaluate the simulation uncertainty of the crop yield the simulated maize yield obtained with different interpolated climatic data different soil texture data and land surface characterizations with different spatial resolution were compared with each other as follows climatic variables are the major input data required by the ecosystem models the accuracy of these data is pivotal to the estimation of vegetation biomass matsushita et al 2004 to evaluate simulation errors introduced by climatic variables interpolated climatic data in the five meteorological stations of the study area were compared with the raw data the interpolation dataset obtained using the meteorological data from meteorological stations in fig 1 for interpolation is referred to as gids5 and that obtained using 88 meteorological stations in and around the north china plain for interpolation is referred to as gids88 cross validation showed that the mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse of all meteorological variables with gids5 were greater than those with gids88 table 1 indicating that using meteorological data from more meteorological stations can reduce the interpolation errors however when using the two datasets in the vip model minor differences were found between the mae and rmse of simulated yield with gids5 and gids88 demonstrating that using five meteorological stations for interpolation is acceptable in this region soil texture is a key parameter in the model which plays an important role in determining soil hydrological characteristics and thermal properties such as saturated soil moisture saturated hydraulic conductivity and heat capacity which affect crop growth and yield by comparing the soil textural data used in this study referred to as dataset a with those retrieved from a 1 14 000 000 scale map institute of soil science academia sinica 1989 referred to as dataset b we found that the major soil type in the northern part of the study area such as dingxiang was loam in dataset a and sandy loam in dataset b however in the southern hrb such as yangquan and pingding the major soil type was sandy loam in dataset a and loam in dataset b relative to maize grown in loam the simulated yield increased by 1 6 12 3 while maize was grown in sandy loam under the same treatment indicating that the simulated yield would increase in the northern hrb and decrease in the south with dataset b however the higher spatial resolution dataset dataset a may provide more detailed information about soil texture which may benefit the yield simulation the spatial resolution of the land surface characterization showed a strong effect on the crop yield simulation primarily due to the mixed pixel the uncertainty in a gpp simulation increases as the spatial resolution of the input data sets decreases turner et al 2003 zhao et al 2005 cai et al 2014 in xinzhou where cropland is distributed rather closely the cropland percentage in each grid was greater than 80 and the maize production area ratio was 92 table a1 the r2 value between the simulated and measured yields from 2005 to 2013 was 0 36 and the rmse was 480 kg ha 1 the rrmse was 10 table 3 by contrast in wutai where crop fields are mixed with forest the cropland percentage was less than 40 and the maize production area ratio was 63 table a1 the r2 value between the simulated and measured yields was 0 15 and the rmse was 1448 kg ha 1 the rrmse was 36 table 3 indicating that the efficiency of maize yield prediction was higher in grids with a greater cropland percentage remote sensing data with high spatial resolution such as chinese gao fen remote sensing data can provide more detailed information about land surface characterization with the aid of high spatial resolution land use data 20 m 20 m provided by cbers the evapotranspiration in each subgrid and the contribution of different subgrid scale surface types to the grid box average were calculated which reduced the error in the evapotranspiration simulation with modis ndvi 1 km resolution xin et al 2005 this finding demonstrates that the combination of high resolution remote sensing data and modis data may be a useful way to fix the mixed pixels problem in this study we retrieved intrinsic quantum efficiency patterns a key photosynthetic parameter from rs information and aimed to reduce uncertainties in maize yield pattern predictions although the parameter retrieval method helps the model capture the spatial variability of maize yield errors in the intrinsic quantum efficiency introduced by the retrieval method may also affect the yield simulation to evaluate the simulation errors introduced by the parameter retrieval method the simulated yield in this study referred to as the parameter driven method was compared with the yield derived by the state variable driven method which used the lai retrieved from the ndvi to drive the vip model more details on the method are reported by hu and mo 2014 in the parameter driven method the maximum lai is controlled by the functional mechanism of crop growth reaching 6 5 at the heading stage in highly productive areas such as in yuanping and xinzhou while the maximum lai value was approximately 5 0 when estimated by the state variable driven method due to the saturation problem of rs signals duchemin et al 2006 smith et al 2008 considering that the lai was correlated significantly with the plant biomass and yield the r2 value between the simulated yield and the measured yield in the parameter driven method was higher than that in the state variable driven method in highly productive areas with good farming conditions table 3 however under poor farming conditions with low crop productivity such as in fanzhi and wutai the parameter driven method showed more simulation errors and worse performance lower r2 and higher rrmse than the state variable driven method because the state variable driven method described the interannual variations in yield more favorably therefore when separating the relative contribution of water stress to the yield gap from that of other factors the intrinsic quantum efficiency pattern in the year with the highest precipitation over the past 30 years was used as a controlled treatment although this practice cannot eliminate crop avoidance of water stress at any time during the maize growing stage it provides relatively ideal non water limitation conditions 4 2 comparisons of yield gaps with the relevant references compared with previous studies in the ncp region table 4 which has soil fertility and climatic conditions similar to those in our study area our estimated yield gap of 5246 kg ha 1 appears to be higher than the yield gap of 2000 kg ha 1 for the hebei plain liang et al 2011 900 kg ha 1 for quzhou zhao et al 2015 and 3400 5200 kg ha 1 for the ncp meng et al 2013 liu et al 2017 the major maize variety in ncp is summer maize however spring maize has a significantly higher grain quantity than summer maize because of a distinctly higher dry matter accumulation rate dai et al 2008 and a longer growth cycle the yield gaps in the hrb could be even greater than those in the ncp if spring maize were replaced by summer maize this obvious difference may be caused by differences in the water conditions in the ncp rainfall ranges from 470 to 910 mm from the north to the south and more than 70 falls during the growth period of summer maize wang et al 2008 2010 concentrated summer rainfall could meet the water demand for maize in most years in the ncp chen et al 2010 wang et al 2012 however in the hrb although the precipitation is approximately 300 500 mm it is distributed irregularly during the maize growth stage less than 10 of the rainfall occurs from late may to june during the jointing stage and rainfall can only meet 40 of the water required for maize growth zhang et al 2015 irrigation is therefore particularly important for maize growth before july researchers have shown that yields could be decreased by 7 5 26 19 under conditions with low soil water content at the jointing stage tan et al 2010 compared with those obtained under the rain fed condition the simulation results obtained from the vip model showed that the yield increased by 21 when more than 80 mm water was irrigated at the jointing stage although 55 of water resources are used in agriculture irrigation in hrb we found that most areas presenting water stress with an absolute yield gap of more than 5600 kg ha 1 were located on the hillside which lacks effective irrigation considering cropland located on slopes steeper than 8 are not suitable for surface irrigation shahriar et al 2014 strengthening irrigation infrastructure construction is not suggested in these area and the conserved water can be supplied to the ncp which has higher water use efficiency than the hrb because summer maize is prevailing in the ncp the yield gap of spring maize in northeast china nec was also used for comparison the average yield gap in the nec over the past 50 years is similar to lv et al 2015 or even larger liu et al 2016 than that in the hrb since the 1980s the grain yields in the nec have increased significantly because of plant breeding and improved agricultural practices however the attainable yield has decreased significantly p 0 01 because of temperature increases solar radiation and precipitation decreases as a result the yield gap of the nec was narrowed in 2010 36 of the potential yield liu et al 2016 and lower than that in the hrb compared with that in the nec which has the highest potential maize yield in china the soil organic matter content 13 8 g kg 1 in the study area was much lower than the nec average 30 99 g kg 1 from 2004 to 2013 kang et al 2016 and national average 26 9 g kg 1 in 1997 chen et al 2011 mechanical investigations have indicated that under considerable decreases in soil organic matter concentrations the productive capacity of agriculture will be compromised by impaired soil nutrient cycling mechanisms loveland and webb 2003 and deteriorated soil physical properties such as soil aggregate stability murphy et al 2013 bulk density valzano et al 2005 water holding capacity rawls et al 2003 and buffering capacity krull et al 2004 therefore the soil organic matter content can contribute to crop productivity in rice soil organic matter content was positively associated with crop yield r2 0 674 p 0 05 shen 1997 and in wheat a loss in soil organic matter content equivalent to 1 mg ha 1 was associated with a grain yield decrease of 40 kg ha 1 martin et al 1999 the yield gap in our study decreased with the soil organic matter content indicating a substantial opportunity for increasing agricultural production via nutrition management 5 conclusions crop yield gaps are concerning for farmlands with unfavorable soil and irrigation facilities in this study a process based ecosystem model vip model and rs data were used to explore the gap between the actual yield and attainable yield in a northern china basin assess the magnitude of that yield gap and identify the underlying causes the relationship between the intrinsic quantum efficiency and ndvi was established and used to obtain the electron transport capability pattern over the region the yield predictions for spring maize were validated with census data from 2005 to 2013 demonstrating the ability of the model to simulate grain yields that cover both spatial and temporal heterogeneity the average yield gap of maize is 5246 kg ha 1 55 of the attainable yield in the hrb in more than 80 of the grids in the study area soil constraints such as the som content and soil depth are the primary factors affecting the yield gap crop and nutrient management and other agronomic strategies should be revised to establish better soil conditions for most farmland in the hrb water stress is the major factor constraining crop yields for farmland on hillsides with a slope gradient greater than 8 although the insufficient irrigation is a result of poor agricultural infrastructure construction improving agricultural irrigation construction is not suggested for these regions because the topography is not suitable for surface irrigation the conserved water can be supplied to downstream plains where the water use efficiency is higher than that in the hrb some drought tolerant corn varieties may be more suitable for planting in farmland on hillsides soil quality affects more than 80 of farmland grids and contributes to 70 of the yield gap the yield gap is positively related to soil organic matter content considering that chemical fertilizer usage in hrb is higher than the global average level improving fertilizer management is therefore the primary task in the hrb regulating the structure and varieties of chemical fertilizer is the top priority to achieve balanced fertilization the government should provide fertilizer formulas after soil testing to improve the fertilization efficiency to increase the soil organic matter content planting green manure increasing the investment in organic fertilizer and straw returning should also be encouraged in the hrb funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 41471026

10839,increasing water use efficiency is one of the main challenges of sustainable fruit tree production from 2013 to 2015 we measured actual evapotranspiration eta using eddy covariance in a well irrigated apple orchard located in in south tyrol italy a sub humid environment we assessed the experimental crop coefficient k c e x p and analyzed the dependency of kc on specific environmental variables at a daily time scale k c e x p values changed throughout the season following a bell shaped trend and were generally lower than the fao tabular values corrected for local climatic conditions in the mid season phase when lai and tabular kc are supposed to be constant the average experimental kc k c e x p was 1 01 86 of the kc value reported by fao 1 18 mid season kc residuals k c e x p k c e x p were positively correlated with daily vapor pressure deficit vpd ρ 0 45 suggesting that the daily kc variability observed is due at least in part to changes in the evaporative demands of the atmosphere we explain these results by considering the relatively humid environment the high water availability and the fact that leaves on apple trees are more tightly coupled to the atmosphere with respect to a smoother grass surface keywords water needs eddy covariance vapor pressure deficit sustainable irrigation 1 introduction water used by the agricultural sector accounts for a high fraction of the fresh water available on earth faostat 2017 problems related with water shortage are increasing affecting not only agricultural production but also the civil and industrial economy there is a great need to increase knowledge about actual crop water consumption in order to adopt strategies to increase irrigation efficiency apples are the main deciduous fruit tree crop worldwide and the trentino south tyrol region northern italy is one the main apple growing regions in europe accounting for approximately 65 of the national total and 10 of eu production faostat 2017 istat 2017 to obtain high yields apple trees are often irrigated the most widely used estimate of water requirements etc for a particular crop allen et al 1998 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 pereira et al 2015 is obtained multiplying the reference evapotranspiration eto the sum of evaporation and transpiration of an homogeneously clipped and well irrigated grass field calculated by the fao penman monteith equation fao pm by a crop coefficient kc etc eto kc the main advantage of this method is that the assessment of eto is based on meteorological data from reference stations while tabular kc values account for specific crop types and growing conditions this method however has been questioned when applied to fruit tree crops the fao pm equation uses a constant value for the bulk surface resistance rs 70 s m 1 to assess eto while many authors katerji and rana 2006 lecina et al 2003 have shown that rs varies according to environmental drivers such as radiation water pressure deficit and wind velocity damour et al 2010 as an attempt to take into account these environmental drivers allen et al 2006 recommended the use of separate rs values for day and night periods when eto is assessed hourly stomatal control on crop transpiration depends on the coupling between the leaves and the surrounding atmosphere jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 monteith 1981 jarvis 1985 discussed the degree of coupling of different horticultural crops based on their height and canopy roughness tall well exposed crop systems like orchards are well coupled to the atmosphere and respond sensitively to small changes in stomatal conductance gs especially in the presence of wind short or protected crop systems are on the contrary poorly coupled with the atmosphere and their transpiration depends more on radiation than on gs chapin et al 2011 jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 sadras et al 2016 for such systems a fixed rs can be assumed as a reasonable simplification for several fruit tree species like peach paço et al 2006 kiwifruit silva et al 2008 pear conceição et al 2008 girona et al 2004 and apple dragoni et al 2005 marsal et al 2014 naor and girona 2012 volschenk 2017 kc values different from the fao tabular values have been reported allen et al 1998 in addition to random error and oscillation around the mean the mismatch between modelled and actual evapotranspiration etc and eta respectively might be partly explained by different characteristics of the boundary layer in well and in poorly coupled crop systems in production regions characterized by unstable meteorological conditions during summer e g in those close to mountains where driving variables like the vapor pressure deficit vpd and radiation rg can change suddenly high daily variability in kc can be observed dragoni et al 2005 volschenk 2017 in this study water and energy fluxes were continuously measured during three years 2013 2015 via eddy covariance among different methodologies to directly measure

al 2012 mauder et al 2018 mcgloin et al 2018 stoy et al 2013 wilson et al 2002 wohlfahrt et al 2016 to be reliable this method requires the selection of a proper site preferable flat where an homogeneous crop cover turbulent conditions and good control of data quality are present aubinet et al 2000 soubie et al 2016 the objectives of this study were i to obtain experimental kc kcexp values from the ratio measured eta modelled eto ii to compare the seasonal trends in kcexp with reference kc adapted for local meteorological conditions and iii to test the hypothesis that day to day variability of kcexp within the same growing phase depends at least in part upon the variability of key meteorological variables affecting et 2 material and methods 2 1 the experimental site the experiment was conducted for three years from 2013 to 2015 in an apple orchard located in the valley of the adige river 46 21 n 11 16 e 224 m above sea level municipality of caldaro bolzano italy the apple trees malus domestica borkh cultivar fuji grafted on m9 dwarfing rootstock were planted in 2000 at distances of 3 x 1 m and managed following organic farming guidelines the soil in the 1 8 m wide alleys between apple tree rows is covered by actively growing grasses throughout the growing season and mowed three times a year fig a supplemental material the growth of grasses in the 1 2 m soil stripe below the tree canopy is controlled by alternating mowing and mechanical tillage the training system is spindle bush and trees with heights between 3 5 and 4 m have been in their full production phase since 2005 seasonal trends in leaf area index lai was assessed by repeated measurement during the three years before this experiment zanotelli et al 2015 between 2013 and 2015 only

point estimated according to soil texture is 0 12 m3 m 3 soil bulk density is 1 23 0 01 g cm 3 since planting the orchard is irrigated using an overhead sprinkler irrigation system an additional drip irrigation system was implemented in spring 2015 and used in combination with the overhead sprinkler system the maximum number of days between two successive rainfall and or overhead irrigation events in 2015 when also the drip irrigation was applied was 6 days frequent overhead irrigation and rainfall made water available both underneath the trees and in the alleys demonstrated by the actively growing alley vegetation in summer fig a supplemental material 2 2 meteorological measurements meteorological variables were measured using instruments installed on the eddy covariance tower at 8 m

used to assess the soil water content swc three of them were vertically oriented starting from soil surface so that they integrated the soil moisture in the first 30 cm of soil three additional probes were oriented horizontally at depths of 10 30 and 60 cm to assess the swc soil profile two soil heat flux plates hfp01 huxeflux delft holland were placed at 5 cm depth in the opposite sides south and north of the 1 2 m wide weed free soil strip below the trees to measure the soil heat transfer g a cr3000 csi logged all meteorological data half hourly a comparative analysis between air temperature relative humidity wind velocity and vapour pressure deficit data collected in the experimental site and in a standard meteorological station located approximately 3 km away from the experimental orchard laimburg research centre lrc http www laimburg it en services weather data asp was carried out fig b in supplemental material unfortunately net radiation data were not recorded at the lrc a correlation analysis for each variables was performed to calculate the intercept and slope of the ordinary least square linear regression model a and b respectively the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean square error rmse the linear model fitted the two series of data very well intercept and slope close to 0 and 1 respectively fig b of supplemental material for this reason and given the need to synchronize radiation data with aerodynamic parameters at half hourly calculation time steps pereira et al 2015 we decided to calculate reference et eto using the data collected at the eddy covariance site after having adapted the daily net radiation rn data from the orchard adjusted to include outgoing shortwave radiation corresponding to an albedo of 0 23 typical of a grass field allen et al 1998 we also assumed that the long wave radiation did not significantly differ between the two sites more information are reported in fig c of supplemental material 2 3 eto estimation

and denominator coefficients that differ in reason of computation time step at the half hour time step cn was equal to 18 5 regarding cd it was decided to follow allen et al 2006 who suggested to consider a different bulk surface resistance rs for the day 50 s m 1 and the night 200 s m 1 period when the equation is applied at hourly or lower time step this means that cd instead of being constantly equal to 0 34 assumes a value of 0 24 when rn is 0 and 0 96 when rn is 0 2 4 eddy covariance measurements an 8 meter tower was installed at the experimental site in the spring 2009 in an area that proved to satisfy the requirements of flatness and homogeneity of surface cover zanotelli et al 2013 h2o concentrations were measured by a li 7200 li cor biosciences lincoln nebraska usa infrared gas analyzer instantaneous gas and wind data were taken 4 ms above the canopy with a frequency of 20 hz raw data were collected and h2o flux data eta computed every 30 min with eddysoft software kolle and rebmann 2007 low quality data for turbulence and stationarity were screened out according to the foken and wichura 1996 quality test as described by zanotelli et al 2013 the gaps in the original dataset due to maintenance and instrument failure and the data that did not pass the quality check process were replaced using the online gap filling and flux partitioning tool provided by the max plank institute http www bgc jena mpg de mdiwork eddyproc applying the approach described in reichstein et al 2005 this approach considers both the co variation of fluxes with meteorological variables and the temporal auto correlation of the fluxes on average in the three years of the study this process was used to fill approximately 30 of daylight data 2 5 correction of the eddy measured eta measured eta data were corrected to account for the underestimation involved with the closure failure of the energy balance the energy balance closure ratio ebr was calculated at daily timescale as follows 2 e b r λ e h r n g s where λe and h are the eddy covariance measured latent and sensible heat fluxes respectively while rn is net radiation and g the soil heat transfer all the terms of eq 2 were measured every half hour as energy fluxes w m 2 and converted to mj m 2d 1 we did not measure the heat storage term s which in our system can be considered negligible leuning et al 2012 stoy et al 2013 wilson et al 2002 following previous research on the topic foken 2008 jung et al 2010 mauder et al 2018 twine et al 2000 we forced the closure of the energy balance by means of the bowen ratio method 3 r e s e b r n g λ e h where reseb is the absolute energy balance residual calculated at a daily base and added proportionally to h and λe according to the daily value of the bowen ratio to improve the interpretation of the seasonal course of eta in the three years as well as fo kcexp the local polynomial regression fitting loess function r core team 2017 was used with the default span of 0 75 2 6 assessment and interpretation of crop coefficient kc given the independency of eta and eto assessments the single crop coefficient kc for the studied apple orchard was experimentally obtained as 4 k c e x p e t a e t o where eta corrected by forcing the energy balance closure and eto were considered for the period of active vegetative growth march october at daily timescale to obtain an assessment of experimental kc for three consecutive years following the fao56 approach the growing season was divided into four phases adapting the suggested values table 11 fao56 allen et al 1998 to our experimental conditions the four phenological phases were set as follows the initial phase phase 1 ini indicatively the period from bud burst to fruit set was between doy 60 to doy 99 the phase of leaf development phase 2 dev ranged between doy 100 and doy 165 the mid season phase phase 3 mid when the canopy is fully expanded ranged from doy 166 to doy 258 while phase

as reference kc values in the mid and end season phases were adapted to our specific climatic conditions using the equation proposed by allen et al 1998 5 k c m i d e n d k c m i d e n d t a b 0 04 u

the mid season phase where lai and kc are supposed to be constant the difference k c e x p k c e x p later residuals was calculated where k c e x p represents the three year average of the

precipitation was 1113 1277 and 573 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively during the experimental period the soil water content was always kept within an optimal range as a consequence of natural precipitation in 2014 and irrigation in 2013 and 2015 data from the three vertically oriented tdr probes showed soil water contents in the first 30 cm of soil depth from 0 27 to 0 41 m3 m 3 0 33 0 02

balance ratio ebr of the experimental site calculated by means of eq 2 was 0 60 with higher values recorded during the summer months from 0 56 in july 2014 to 0 75 in july 2015 table 1 despite the high determination coefficients observed between the available energy rn g and the surface energy fluxes h λe average r2 0 93 the average slope of the linear regression ranged between 0 68 in 2014 and 0 77 in 2015 fig 2 with the aim to close the energy balance the missing energy was assigned either to h or le based on the daily bowen ratio values average bowen ratio values at the monthly scale for the three seasons are reported in table 1 the cumulated eta obtained via eddy covariance and corrected by forcing the energy balance closure was 764 683 and 745 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively the closure of the energy balance increased the measured eta by approximately 25 considering only the growing season march october the mean daily eta in the three years was 2 9 2 7 and 2 9 mm d 1 while the maximum daily eta recorded always in july was 6 7 6 3 and 6 8 mm d 1 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 3 3 3 kc values the linear correlation between eta and eto in the mid season phase was highly significant fig 4 the non parametric regression line fitted on the seasonal course of kcexp showed a bell shaped curve with some differences among the years fig 5 the trend of the curve was similar in 2013 and in 2015 with a slightly higher peak in the latter year while it was smoother and lower in the wetter and cooler 2014 season with the exception of some isolated spikes the highest kcexp values between 1 00 and 1 25 associated with the peak of the non parametric curve were obtained around doy 200 when the highest mean daily temperatures were also recorded the seasonal course of k c e x p obtained by applying eq 4 schematized according to the four phases approach proposed in fao56 is shown in fig 6 together with the tabular kc values fao56 corrected for local environmental condition according to eq 5 k c e x p was 30 higher than the values proposed by fao56 in the initial phase and both were of similar magnitude at the end of the season in the mid phase the k c e x p averaged 1 01 approximately 15 lower than the 1 20 proposed as default by fao the differences were confirmed even after kcmid was adapted to the local growing meteorological conditions with k c e x p always lower than the tabular values table 2 in the mid season phase the kc residuals k c e x p k c e x p were positively correlated with both tair and vpd fig 7 a and c in both cases both intercept and slope parameters of the fitted linear model were highly significant and the spearman correlation coefficient confirmed the existence of a moderate monotonic positive correlation ρ 0 45 although the coefficients of determination were rather low r2 0 15 no significant correlation between the residuals and rg or wind speed was on the contrary observed fig 7 b and d given the high level of autocorrelation between vpd and tair r2 696 ρ 0 83 the backward elimination procedure applied to the fitted multiple regression models with four variables excluded tair and kept only vpd rg and wind as significant predictors the amount of variance explained by the model increased with respect to the single linear models r2 27 7 and the analysis on the relative importance of the parameters confirmed vpd as the most influential 78 followed by rg 16 and wind speed 6 table 4 the sign of the coefficient indicated that vpd has a positive influence on kc residuals while rg and wind speed affect negatively the results coherently with the analysis of the residuals average k c e x p values obtained when vpd values were below 0 5 kpa were significantly lower 0 91 on average with respect to those recorded when vpd was between 0 5 and 1 5 kpa 1 01 and 1 02 the highest k c e x p values were recorded with vpd values above 1 5 kpa 1 12 on average table 3 4 discussion a reliable assessment of eto and a precise measurement of eta are of a pivotal importance for the purposes of this work as both directly influence kcexp eq 4 the method reported in fao56 allen et al 1998 for modelling eto has been questioned by several authors who showed that using fixed instead of a varying canopy or surface resistance rs may limit the predictive capacity of the model especially when applied at hourly and shorter time scales damour et al 2010 de medeiros et al 2005 katerji and rana 2006 lecina et al 2003 steduto et al 2003 ventura et al 1999 to account for this eto was calculated at half hourly time steps considering a varying rs 50 s m 1 during daytime rn 0 wm 2 and 200 s m 1 at night allen et al 2006 pereira et al 2015 eddy covariance has been used successfully as a reference method to assess eta in several fruit trees crops such as olives orgaz et al 2006 testi et al 2006 2004 citrus rana et al 2005 villalobos et al 2009 pear conceição et al 2008 girona et al 2004 peach paço et al 2006 and apple braun et al 2000 a matter of debate in eddy covariance studies is the closure of the energy balance convective energy fluxes made by the sum of the sensible h and the latent λe heat are frequently underestimated imbalances between the available energy represented by the net radiation rn minus the heat transfer to the soil g may be greater than 30 foken 2008 foken et al 2006 leuning et al 2012 stoy et al 2013 wilson et al 2002 wohlfahrt et al 2016 the energy balance closure of 0 60 an imbalance of 40 found in our site is slightly lower than average data reported by wilson et al 2002 from more than 20 sites 0 84 ranging from 0 34 to 1 69 foken 2008 reported energy imbalances from 37 to 10 similar to what reported later by stoy et al 2013 who found the worst average closures in crops deciduous broadleaf forests mixed forests and wetlands these findings are substantially confirmed in a variety of ecosystems in eastern europe where the lowest ebr 0 61 was found in cropland mcgloin et al 2018 recent literature lists the heterogeneity of vegetation cover and morphology at landscape scale characterized by vegetated mountains associated with mesoscale eddies as well as the turbulence conditions present at the site among the most relevant causes of the energy closure failure eder et al 2015 gao et al 2017 mauder et al 2018 mcgloin et al 2018 other processes like the biological energy assimilation and heat storage which are rarely taken into account also partially explain the energy balance closure failure chapin et al 2011 lindroth et al 2010 moderow et al 2009 we cannot fully exclude that our measurements of soil heat flux could have underestimated g due to the fact that the probes were positioned only along the tree line when considered at a daily time scale however the contribution of g can be considered negligible since the heat transferred into the soil during the day is released back to the surface at night chapin et al 2011 other possible sources of uncertainty are related to the possible underestimation of eddy covariance fluxes under rainy conditions van dijk et al 2015 to provide a more quantitatively sound estimate of eta we forced the closure of the energy balance adopting the bowen ratio foken 2008 jung et al 2010 twine et al 2000 to assign the missing energy to the h and λe components it is important to keep in mind that this procedure which increased the magnitude of eta also increased k c e x p thus reducing the gap with the fao s tabular data in the mid season phase k c e x p values showed a bell shaped pattern fig 5 in line with the literature girona et al 2004 gong et al 2007 naor and girona 2012 testa et al 2011 volschenk 2017 some significant differences among the absolute kc values were observed in the three years the highest kc values were reached in 2015 in correspondence with the highest summer temperatures mid season phase while the peak was less pronounced in 2014 when the summer was unusually rainy and mild k c e x p values were generally lower than those proposed by fao56 fig 6 for a mature apple orchard with active ground cover and killing frost allen et al 1998 even when the tabular values were corrected for local climatic conditions in the mid season phase k c e x p reached only 85 of what indicated in fao56 table 2 several authors reported significant deviation of locally assessed kc with respect to fao reference for different horticultural crops for mature pear trees growing on large weighing lysimeters girona et al 2004 found a kc 30 lower than the fao s reference and attributed this difference mainly to a reduced ground cover and to the palmette training system used in that orchard similar results are reported by conceição et al 2008 in a pear orchard in portugal where mean kc values for the mid season stage ranged from 42 to 52 of fao s reference kc paço et al 2006 in a young peach orchard measured kc values 25 lower the tabular values allen et al 1998 and were successively adopted as standard kc for young peach trees allen and pereira 2009 the kc reported for young olive trees by testi et al 2004 regardless the fact that etc was measured via eddy covariance or simulated by water balance were often less than half the fao56 kc for mid and late season 0 7 while testi et al 2006 reported simulated kc values of 0 57 and 0 64 in two commercial olive orchards for the month of july in contrast rana et al 2005 reported experimental kc for citrus growing under mediterranean conditions higher 0 8 1 2 than those reported by allen et al 1998 also for apple orchards contrasting results are available dragoni et al 2005 found lower kc values with respect to the reference ones for apple trees growing in the relatively cool climate of the new york state volschenk 2017 reported maximum kc ranging from 0 8 to 1 1 in south africa australia israel and spain while gong et al 2007 obtained experimental kc values of 1 2 in the semi arid china s shaanxi area the fact that kc depends on ground cover and crop characteristics and may vary quite substantially among locations orgaz et al 2006 makes difficult the application of the single crop coefficient method where no experimental information exists villalobos et al 2000 although there is an increasing interest within the scientific community to apply the dual crop coefficient approach poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 especially when crops are drip irrigated and the soil partially covered by a vegetation we preferred to adopt the single kc approach because the eddy covariance methods does not allow the separation of transpiration from soil evaporation and because the orchard floor vegetation was actively growing during the entire vegetative season so far no specific indications about kc values for apple trees are available for trentino alto adige region the main italian district and one of the most relevant in europe dalla via and mantinger 2012 faostat 2017 istat 2017 where apple trees are generally irrigated using generous amounts of water in summer when most et losses occur and irrigation is more frequent the classic fao56 approach suggests use of a fixed kc assuming that the estimate of eto accounts for the changes in weather conditions our evidence however in line with marsal et al 2013 and volschenk 2017 highlights that experimentally measured kc values significantly vary up to 25 within a short period as well as from year to year in relation to the meteorological conditions we demonstrated that the strongest influence on kc is attributable to vpd positively correlated followed with a lower importance by rg and wind speed negatively correlated when daily vpd values are below 0 5 kpa the actual kc is generally lower with respect to the reference k c e x p so the use of k c e x p generates an overestimate of etc while the opposite occurs with vpd 1 5 kpa fig 7 table 3 if vpd determines an increment of crop et more than proportional with respect to reference et global radiation and and wind speed instead when considered in the multiple regression models with vpd reduce kc demonstrating to have a greater influence on eto than etc and highlighting their different effect on the two ecosystem types chapin et al 2011 these results support the hypothesis expressed by jarvis 1985 jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 and dragoni et al 2005 of a tighter coupling between the tree canopy and the surrounding atmosphere with respect to the reference grass surface it is important however to limit these considerations to the sub humid and not water limited conditions of this study in drier environments where greater water uptake lowers water potential close to the roots the opposite can happen the water uptake limitations occurring even from relatively moist soils determine a decrease in transpiration rate which is thought to be more accentuated in tall crops than on grass thus lowering the kc denmead and shaw 1962 lobet et al 2014 steudle 2000 several authors annandale and stockle 1994 dragoni et al 2005 dragoni and lakso 2011 jarvis 1985 testi et al 2004 have stressed that variable kc should be used when modeling et of tall crops in order to enhance its ability to cope with specific atmospheric conditions this suggests that for many tree crops with fully expanded canopy the evapotranspirative fluxes etc are more responsive than eto to short time variations of the meteorological conditions in other words in the presence of summer days with high air temperature and high vpd water consumption of the orchard will increase more than proportionally when compared with the reference grass surface the apple tree height approximately 4 ms considering summer vegetation the training system the fact that most of the canopy was well exposed to direct radiation and thus to the free atmosphere are all factors that contribute to increase the roughness of the orchard canopy to decrease the boundary layer surrounding the vegetation and to make the evapotranspiration of trees more dependent from the actual environmental conditions in comparison to short and dense canopies of a meadow jarvis 1985 jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 sadras et al 2016 5 conclusions this study provided a quantitative assessment of water losses by evapotranspiration from a mature apple orchard over three growing seasons these measurements allowed the calculation experimental crop coefficients k c e x p since k c e x p in the mid season phase were generally lower than the reference fao56 values applying these findings may save significant amounts of irrigation water moreover we demonstrated that in such a sub humid environment k c e x p is related to tair and vpd and in summer it may vary by more than 20 from cold and humid days with vpd 0 5 kpa to warm and dry days when vpd exceeds 1 5 kpa more research is needed to evaluate whether the vpd dependency of kc values holds true in other apple growing regions or for other tree crops acknowledgements this study was carried out with the financial support from the provincia autonoma di bolzano bozen project monalisa monitoring key environmental parameters in the

10839,increasing water use efficiency is one of the main challenges of sustainable fruit tree production from 2013 to 2015 we measured actual evapotranspiration eta using eddy covariance in a well irrigated apple orchard located in in south tyrol italy a sub humid environment we assessed the experimental crop coefficient k c e x p and analyzed the dependency of kc on specific environmental variables at a daily time scale k c e x p values changed throughout the season following a bell shaped trend and were generally lower than the fao tabular values corrected for local climatic conditions in the mid season phase when lai and tabular kc are supposed to be constant the average experimental kc k c e x p was 1 01 86 of the kc value reported by fao 1 18 mid season kc residuals k c e x p k c e x p were positively correlated with daily vapor pressure deficit vpd ρ 0 45 suggesting that the daily kc variability observed is due at least in part to changes in the evaporative demands of the atmosphere we explain these results by considering the relatively humid environment the high water availability and the fact that leaves on apple trees are more tightly coupled to the atmosphere with respect to a smoother grass surface keywords water needs eddy covariance vapor pressure deficit sustainable irrigation 1 introduction water used by the agricultural sector accounts for a high fraction of the fresh water available on earth faostat 2017 problems related with water shortage are increasing affecting not only agricultural production but also the civil and industrial economy there is a great need to increase knowledge about actual crop water consumption in order to adopt strategies to increase irrigation efficiency apples are the main deciduous fruit tree crop worldwide and the trentino south tyrol region northern italy is one the main apple growing regions in europe accounting for approximately 65 of the national total and 10 of eu production faostat 2017 istat 2017 to obtain high yields apple trees are often irrigated the most widely used estimate of water requirements etc for a particular crop allen et al 1998 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 pereira et al 2015 is obtained multiplying the reference evapotranspiration eto the sum of evaporation and transpiration of an homogeneously clipped and well irrigated grass field calculated by the fao penman monteith equation fao pm by a crop coefficient kc etc eto kc the main advantage of this method is that the assessment of eto is based on meteorological data from reference stations while tabular kc values account for specific crop types and growing conditions this method however has been questioned when applied to fruit tree crops the fao pm equation uses a constant value for the bulk surface resistance rs 70 s m 1 to assess eto while many authors katerji and rana 2006 lecina et al 2003 have shown that rs varies according to environmental drivers such as radiation water pressure deficit and wind velocity damour et al 2010 as an attempt to take into account these environmental drivers allen et al 2006 recommended the use of separate rs values for day and night periods when eto is assessed hourly stomatal control on crop transpiration depends on the coupling between the leaves and the surrounding atmosphere jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 monteith 1981 jarvis 1985 discussed the degree of coupling of different horticultural crops based on their height and canopy roughness tall well exposed crop systems like orchards are well coupled to the atmosphere and respond sensitively to small changes in stomatal conductance gs especially in the presence of wind short or protected crop systems are on the contrary poorly coupled with the atmosphere and their transpiration depends more on radiation than on gs chapin et al 2011 jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 sadras et al 2016 for such systems a fixed rs can be assumed as a reasonable simplification for several fruit tree species like peach paço et al 2006 kiwifruit silva et al 2008 pear conceição et al 2008 girona et al 2004 and apple dragoni et al 2005 marsal et al 2014 naor and girona 2012 volschenk 2017 kc values different from the fao tabular values have been reported allen et al 1998 in addition to random error and oscillation around the mean the mismatch between modelled and actual evapotranspiration etc and eta respectively might be partly explained by different characteristics of the boundary layer in well and in poorly coupled crop systems in production regions characterized by unstable meteorological conditions during summer e g in those close to mountains where driving variables like the vapor pressure deficit vpd and radiation rg can change suddenly high daily variability in kc can be observed dragoni et al 2005 volschenk 2017 in this study water and energy fluxes were continuously measured during three years 2013 2015 via eddy covariance among different methodologies to directly measure crop water consumption such as weighing lysimeters girona et al 2011 2004 mauder et al 2018 sap flow fernández 2014 whole canopy gas exchange measurements dragoni et al 2005 and water balance the micrometeorological approach known as eddy covariance is recognized as one of the most reliable sun et al 2008 to the point that it is also used for calibrating other methods conceição et al 2008 paço et al 2006 rana et al 2005 villalobos et al 2009 eddy covariance tends however to underestimate water fluxes due to the incomplete closure of the energy balance foken 2008 foken et al 2006 leuning et al 2012 mauder et al 2018 mcgloin et al 2018 stoy et al 2013 wilson et al 2002 wohlfahrt et al 2016 to be reliable this method requires the selection of a proper site preferable flat where an homogeneous crop cover turbulent conditions and good control of data quality are present aubinet et al 2000 soubie et al 2016 the objectives of this study were i to obtain experimental kc kcexp values from the ratio measured eta modelled eto ii to compare the seasonal trends in kcexp with reference kc adapted for local meteorological conditions and iii to test the hypothesis that day to day variability of kcexp within the same growing phase depends at least in part upon the variability of key meteorological variables affecting et 2 material and methods 2 1 the experimental site the experiment was conducted for three years from 2013 to 2015 in an apple orchard located in the valley of the adige river 46 21 n 11 16 e 224 m above sea level municipality of caldaro bolzano italy the apple trees malus domestica borkh cultivar fuji grafted on m9 dwarfing rootstock were planted in 2000 at distances of 3 x 1 m and managed following organic farming guidelines the soil in the 1 8 m wide alleys between apple tree rows is covered by actively growing grasses throughout the growing season and mowed three times a year fig a supplemental material the growth of grasses in the 1 2 m soil stripe below the tree canopy is controlled by alternating mowing and mechanical tillage the training system is spindle bush and trees with heights between 3 5 and 4 m have been in their full production phase since 2005 seasonal trends in leaf area index lai was assessed by repeated measurement during the three years before this experiment zanotelli et al 2015 between 2013 and 2015 only

point estimated according to soil texture is 0 12 m3 m 3 soil bulk density is 1 23 0 01 g cm 3 since planting the orchard is irrigated using an overhead sprinkler irrigation system an additional drip irrigation system was implemented in spring 2015 and used in combination with the overhead sprinkler system the maximum number of days between two successive rainfall and or overhead irrigation events in 2015 when also the drip irrigation was applied was 6 days frequent overhead irrigation and rainfall made water available both underneath the trees and in the alleys demonstrated by the actively growing alley vegetation in summer fig a supplemental material 2 2 meteorological measurements meteorological variables were measured using instruments installed on the eddy covariance tower at 8 m

north of the 1 2 m wide weed free soil strip below the trees to measure the soil heat transfer g a cr3000 csi logged all meteorological data half hourly a comparative analysis between air temperature relative humidity wind velocity and vapour pressure deficit data collected in the experimental site and in a standard meteorological station located approximately 3 km away from the experimental orchard laimburg research centre lrc http www laimburg it en services weather data asp was carried out fig b in supplemental material unfortunately net radiation data were not recorded at the lrc a correlation analysis for each variables was performed to calculate the intercept and slope of the ordinary least square linear regression model a and b respectively the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean square error rmse the linear model fitted the two series of data very well intercept and slope close to 0 and 1 respectively fig b of supplemental material for this reason and given the need to synchronize radiation data with aerodynamic parameters at half hourly calculation time steps pereira et al 2015 we decided to calculate reference et eto using the data collected at the eddy covariance site after having adapted the daily net radiation rn data from the orchard adjusted to include outgoing shortwave radiation corresponding to an albedo of 0 23 typical of a grass field allen et al 1998 we also assumed that the long wave radiation did not significantly differ between the two sites more information are reported in fig c of supplemental material 2 3 eto estimation

and denominator coefficients that differ in reason of computation time step at the half hour time step cn was equal to 18 5 regarding cd it was decided to follow allen et al 2006 who suggested to consider a different bulk surface resistance rs for the day 50 s m 1 and the night 200 s m 1 period when the equation is applied at hourly or lower time step this means that cd instead of being constantly equal to 0 34 assumes a value of 0 24 when rn is 0 and 0 96 when rn is 0 2 4 eddy covariance measurements an 8 meter tower was installed at the experimental site in the spring 2009 in an

software kolle and rebmann 2007 low quality data for turbulence and stationarity were screened out according to the foken and wichura 1996 quality test as described by zanotelli et al 2013 the gaps in the original dataset due to maintenance and instrument failure and the data that did not pass the quality check process were replaced using the online gap filling and flux partitioning tool provided by the max plank institute http www bgc jena mpg de mdiwork eddyproc applying the approach described in reichstein et al 2005 this approach considers both the co variation of fluxes with meteorological variables and the temporal auto correlation of the fluxes on average in the three years of the study this process was used to fill approximately 30 of daylight data 2 5 correction of the eddy measured eta measured eta data were corrected to account for the underestimation involved with the closure failure of the energy balance the energy balance closure ratio ebr was calculated at daily timescale as follows 2 e b r λ e h r n g s where λe and h are the eddy covariance measured latent and sensible heat fluxes respectively while rn is net radiation and g the soil heat transfer all the terms of eq 2 were measured every half hour as energy fluxes w m 2 and converted to mj m 2d 1 we did not measure the heat storage term s which in our system can be considered negligible leuning et al 2012 stoy et al 2013 wilson et al 2002 following previous research on the topic foken 2008 jung et al 2010 mauder et al 2018 twine et al 2000 we forced the closure of the energy balance by means of the bowen ratio method 3 r e s e b r n g λ e h where reseb is the absolute energy balance residual calculated at a daily base and added proportionally to h and λe according to the daily value of the bowen ratio to improve the interpretation of the seasonal course of eta in the three years as well as fo kcexp the local polynomial regression fitting loess function r core team 2017 was used with the default span of 0 75 2 6 assessment and interpretation of crop coefficient kc given the independency of eta and eto assessments the single crop coefficient kc for the studied apple orchard was experimentally obtained as 4 k c e x p e t a e t o where eta corrected by forcing the energy balance closure and eto were considered for the period of active vegetative growth march october at daily timescale to obtain an assessment of experimental kc for three consecutive years following the fao56 approach the growing season was divided into four phases adapting the suggested values table 11 fao56 allen et al 1998 to our experimental conditions the four phenological phases were set as follows the initial phase phase 1 ini indicatively the period from bud burst to fruit set was between doy 60 to doy 99 the phase of leaf development phase 2 dev ranged between doy 100 and doy 165 the mid season phase phase 3 mid when the canopy is fully expanded ranged from doy 166 to doy 258 while phase 4 late was between doy 258 to doy 304 just before initial leaf fall end the tabular kcini value for the apple orchard was not modified as the climatic conditions were not different from those assumed as reference kc values in the mid and end season phases were adapted to our specific climatic conditions using the equation proposed by allen et al 1998 5 k c m i d e n d k c m i d e n d t a b 0 04 u

category of apple orchards that matches our growing condition active ground cover killing frost high density and higher effective fraction of ground cover fc eff 0 7 due to the fact that the orchard was irrigated regularly and that soil moisture rarely dropped to 25 in volume fig 1 no stress coefficient was adopted ks 1 to study the effects of environmental variables on the variability of kc in the mid season phase where lai and kc are supposed to be constant the difference k c e x p k c e x p later residuals was calculated where k c e x p represents the three year average of the experimental daily kc for this phase eq 4 then the existence of a correlation between these residuals values with the following meteorological variables was tested mean daily air temperature tair c global radiation rg mj m 2d 1 vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa and wind velocity u2 m s 1 a multiple regression model was first tested on kc residuals considering the four meteorological variables as initial predictors and following the backward elimination process to assess the minimum adequate model the relative importance of the significant parameters was tested with the aid of the r package relaimpo grömping 2006 using the standard lmg metric single linear regression analysis between meteorological parameters and the kc residuals was also performed and the p value of the intercept and slope parameters the coefficient of determination and the spearman correlation coefficient ρ used to test the robustness of the linear models to examine the effect of vpd on kc the dataset was divided according to four classes of vpd 0 5 0 5 1 1 0 1 5 and 1 5 kpa used as different levels of the factor vpd in a non parametric kruskall wallis test followed by the wilcoxon test when significant differences were observed all computation were carried out with the r statistical software r core team 2017 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions and soil water status year 2015 was warmer and drier than 2013 while 2014 was anomalously rainys conte et al 2019 especially in summer fig 1 mean annual vpd was lowest in 2014 0 51 kpa intermediate in 2013 0 58 kpa and highest in 2015 0 63 kpa annual precipitation was 1113 1277 and 573 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively during the experimental period the soil water content was always kept within an optimal range as a consequence of natural precipitation in 2014 and irrigation in 2013 and 2015 data from the three vertically oriented tdr probes showed soil water contents in the first 30 cm of soil depth from 0 27 to 0 41 m3 m 3 0 33 0 02

790 and 851 mm y 1 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively while the eto calculated for the growing season only from doy 60 until doy 304 amounted to 762 735 and 788 mm respectively the average energy balance ratio ebr of the experimental site calculated by means of eq 2 was 0 60 with higher values recorded during the summer months from 0 56 in july 2014 to 0 75 in july 2015 table 1 despite the high determination coefficients observed between the available energy rn g and the surface energy fluxes h λe average r2 0 93 the average slope of the linear regression ranged between 0 68 in 2014 and 0 77 in 2015 fig 2 with the aim to close the energy balance the missing energy was assigned either to h or le based on the daily bowen ratio values average bowen ratio values at the monthly scale for the three seasons are reported in table 1 the cumulated eta obtained via eddy covariance and corrected by forcing the energy balance closure was 764 683 and 745 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively the closure of the energy balance increased the measured eta by approximately 25 considering only the growing season march october the mean daily eta in the three years was 2 9 2 7 and 2 9 mm d 1 while the maximum daily eta recorded always in july was 6 7 6 3 and 6 8 mm d 1 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 3 3 3 kc values the linear correlation between eta and eto in the mid season phase was highly significant fig 4 the non parametric regression line fitted on the seasonal course of kcexp showed a bell shaped curve with some differences among the years fig 5 the trend of the curve was similar in 2013 and in 2015 with a slightly higher peak in the latter year while it was smoother and lower in the wetter and cooler 2014 season with the exception of some isolated spikes the highest kcexp values between 1 00 and 1 25 associated with the peak of the non parametric curve were obtained around doy 200 when the highest mean daily temperatures were also recorded the seasonal course of k c e x p obtained by applying eq 4 schematized according to the four phases approach proposed in fao56 is shown in fig 6 together with the tabular kc values fao56 corrected for local environmental condition according to eq 5 k c e x p was 30 higher than the values proposed by fao56 in the initial phase and both were of similar magnitude at the end of the season in the mid phase the k c e x p averaged 1 01 approximately 15 lower than the 1 20 proposed as default by fao the differences were confirmed even after kcmid was adapted to the local growing meteorological conditions with k c e x p always lower than the tabular values table 2 in the mid season phase the kc residuals k c e x p k c e x p were positively correlated with both tair and vpd fig 7 a and c in both cases both intercept and slope parameters of the fitted linear model were highly significant and the spearman correlation coefficient confirmed the existence of a moderate monotonic positive correlation ρ 0 45 although the coefficients of determination were rather low r2 0 15 no significant correlation between the residuals and rg or wind speed was on the contrary observed fig 7 b and d given the high level of autocorrelation between vpd and tair r2 696 ρ 0 83 the backward elimination procedure applied to the fitted multiple regression models with four variables excluded tair and kept only vpd rg and wind as significant predictors the amount of variance explained by the model increased with respect to the single linear models r2 27 7 and the analysis on the relative importance of the parameters confirmed vpd as the most influential 78 followed by rg 16 and wind speed 6 table 4 the sign of the coefficient indicated that vpd has a positive influence on kc residuals while rg and wind speed affect negatively the results coherently with the analysis of the residuals average k c e x p values obtained when vpd values were below 0 5 kpa were significantly lower 0 91 on average with respect to those recorded when vpd was between 0 5 and 1 5 kpa 1 01 and 1 02 the highest k c e x p values were recorded with vpd values above 1 5 kpa 1 12 on average table 3 4 discussion a reliable assessment of eto and a precise measurement of eta are of a pivotal importance for the purposes of this work as both directly influence kcexp eq 4 the method reported in fao56 allen et al 1998 for modelling eto has been questioned by several authors who showed that using fixed instead of a varying canopy or surface resistance rs may limit the predictive capacity of the model especially when applied at hourly and shorter time scales damour et al 2010 de medeiros et al 2005 katerji and rana 2006 lecina et al 2003 steduto et al 2003 ventura et al 1999 to account for this eto was calculated at half hourly time steps considering a varying rs 50 s m 1 during daytime rn 0 wm 2 and 200 s m 1 at night allen et al 2006 pereira et al 2015 eddy covariance has been used successfully as a reference method to assess eta in several fruit trees crops such as olives orgaz et al 2006 testi et al 2006 2004 citrus rana et al 2005 villalobos et al 2009 pear conceição et al 2008 girona et al 2004 peach paço et al 2006 and apple braun et al 2000 a matter of debate in eddy covariance studies is the closure of the energy balance convective energy fluxes made by the sum of the sensible h and the latent λe heat are frequently underestimated imbalances between the available energy represented by the net radiation rn minus the heat transfer to the soil g may be greater than 30 foken 2008 foken et al 2006 leuning et al 2012 stoy et al 2013 wilson et al 2002 wohlfahrt et al 2016 the energy balance closure of 0 60 an imbalance of 40 found in our site is slightly lower than average data reported by wilson et al 2002 from more than 20 sites 0 84 ranging from 0 34 to 1 69 foken 2008 reported energy imbalances from 37 to 10 similar to what reported later by stoy et al 2013 who found the worst average closures in crops deciduous broadleaf forests mixed forests and wetlands these findings are substantially confirmed in a variety of ecosystems in eastern europe where the lowest ebr 0 61 was found in cropland mcgloin et al 2018 recent literature lists the heterogeneity of vegetation cover and morphology at landscape scale characterized by vegetated mountains associated with mesoscale eddies as well as the turbulence conditions present at the site among the most relevant causes of the energy closure failure eder et al 2015 gao et al 2017 mauder et al 2018 mcgloin et al 2018 other processes like the biological energy assimilation and heat storage which are rarely taken into account also partially explain the energy balance closure failure chapin et al 2011 lindroth et al 2010 moderow et al 2009 we cannot fully exclude that our measurements of soil heat flux could have underestimated g due to the fact that the probes were positioned only along the tree line when considered at a daily time scale however the contribution of g can be considered negligible since the heat transferred into the soil during the day is released back to the surface at night chapin et al 2011 other possible sources of uncertainty are related to the possible underestimation of eddy covariance fluxes under rainy conditions van dijk et al 2015 to provide a more quantitatively sound estimate of eta we forced the closure of the energy balance adopting the bowen ratio foken 2008 jung et al 2010 twine et al 2000 to assign the missing energy to the h and λe components it is important to keep in mind that this procedure which increased the magnitude of eta also increased k c e x p thus reducing the gap with the fao s tabular data in the mid season phase k c e x p values showed a bell shaped pattern fig 5 in line with the literature girona et al 2004 gong et al 2007 naor and girona 2012 testa et al 2011 volschenk 2017 some significant differences among the absolute kc values were observed in the three years the highest kc values were reached in 2015 in correspondence with the highest summer temperatures mid season phase while the peak was less pronounced in 2014 when the summer was unusually rainy and mild k c e x p values were generally lower than those proposed by fao56 fig 6 for a mature apple orchard with active ground cover and killing frost allen et al 1998 even when the tabular values were corrected for local climatic conditions in the mid season phase k c e x p reached only 85 of what indicated in fao56 table 2 several authors reported significant deviation of locally assessed kc with respect to fao reference for different horticultural crops for mature pear trees growing on large weighing lysimeters girona et al 2004 found a kc 30 lower than the fao s reference and attributed this difference mainly to a reduced ground cover and to the palmette training system used in that orchard similar results are reported by conceição et al 2008 in a pear orchard in portugal where mean kc values for the mid season stage ranged from 42 to 52 of fao s reference kc paço et al 2006 in a young peach orchard measured kc values 25 lower the tabular values allen et al 1998 and were successively adopted as standard kc for young peach trees allen and pereira 2009 the kc reported for young olive trees by testi et al 2004 regardless the fact that etc was measured via eddy covariance or simulated by water balance were often less than half the fao56 kc for mid and late season 0 7 while testi et al 2006 reported simulated kc values of 0 57 and 0 64 in two commercial olive orchards for the month of july in contrast rana et al 2005 reported experimental kc for citrus growing under mediterranean conditions higher 0 8 1 2 than those reported by allen et al 1998 also for apple orchards contrasting results are available dragoni et al 2005 found lower kc values with respect to the reference ones for apple trees growing in the relatively cool climate of the new york state volschenk 2017 reported maximum kc ranging from 0 8 to 1 1 in south africa australia israel and spain while gong et al 2007 obtained experimental kc values of 1 2 in the semi arid china s shaanxi area the fact that kc depends on ground cover and crop characteristics and may vary quite substantially among locations orgaz et al 2006 makes difficult the application of the single crop coefficient method where no experimental information exists villalobos et al 2000 although there is an increasing interest within the scientific community to apply the dual crop coefficient approach poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 especially when crops are drip irrigated and the soil partially covered by a vegetation we preferred to adopt the single kc approach because the eddy covariance methods does not allow the separation of transpiration from soil evaporation and because the orchard floor vegetation was actively growing during the entire vegetative season so far no specific indications about kc values for apple trees are available for trentino alto adige region the main italian district and one of the most relevant in europe dalla via and mantinger 2012 faostat 2017 istat 2017 where apple trees are generally irrigated using generous amounts of water in summer when most et losses occur and irrigation is more frequent the classic fao56 approach suggests use of a fixed kc assuming that the estimate of eto accounts for the changes in weather conditions our evidence however in line with marsal et al 2013 and volschenk 2017 highlights that experimentally measured kc values significantly vary up to 25 within a short period as well as from year to year in relation to the meteorological conditions we demonstrated that the strongest influence on kc is attributable to vpd positively correlated followed with a lower importance by rg and wind speed negatively correlated when daily vpd values are below 0 5 kpa the actual kc is generally lower with respect to the reference k c e x p so the use of k c e x p generates an overestimate of etc while the opposite occurs with vpd 1 5 kpa fig 7 table 3 if vpd determines an increment of crop et more than proportional with respect to reference et global radiation and and wind speed instead when considered in the multiple regression models with vpd reduce kc demonstrating to have a greater influence on eto than etc and highlighting their different effect on the two ecosystem types chapin et al 2011 these results support the hypothesis expressed by jarvis 1985 jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 and dragoni et al 2005 of a tighter coupling between the tree canopy and the surrounding atmosphere with respect to the reference grass surface it is important however to limit these considerations to the sub humid and not water limited conditions of this study in drier environments where greater water uptake lowers water potential close to the roots the opposite can happen the water uptake limitations occurring even from relatively moist soils determine a decrease in transpiration rate which is thought to be more accentuated in tall crops than on grass thus lowering the kc denmead and shaw 1962 lobet et al 2014 steudle 2000 several authors annandale and stockle 1994 dragoni et al 2005 dragoni and lakso 2011 jarvis 1985 testi et al 2004 have stressed that variable kc should be used when modeling et of tall crops in order to enhance its ability to cope with specific atmospheric conditions this suggests that for many tree crops with fully expanded canopy the evapotranspirative fluxes etc are more responsive than eto to short time variations of the meteorological conditions in other words in the presence of summer days with high air temperature and high vpd water consumption of the orchard will increase more than proportionally when compared with the reference grass surface the apple tree height approximately 4 ms considering summer vegetation the training system the fact that most of the canopy was well exposed to direct radiation and thus to the free atmosphere are all factors that contribute to increase the roughness of the orchard canopy to decrease the boundary layer surrounding the vegetation and to make the evapotranspiration of trees more dependent from the actual environmental conditions in comparison to short and dense canopies of a meadow jarvis 1985 jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 sadras et al 2016 5 conclusions this study provided a quantitative assessment of water losses by evapotranspiration from a mature apple orchard over three growing seasons these measurements allowed the calculation experimental crop coefficients k c e x p since k c e x p in the mid season phase were generally lower than the reference fao56 values applying these findings may save significant amounts of irrigation water moreover we demonstrated that in such a sub humid environment k c e x p is related to tair and vpd and in summer it may vary by more than 20 from cold and humid days with vpd 0 5 kpa to warm and dry days when vpd exceeds 1 5 kpa more research is needed to evaluate whether the vpd dependency of kc values holds true in other apple growing regions or for
