17430,production of wood based activated carbon wac generates large volume of highly acidic and phosphate rich wastewater currently the routine treatment i e lime precipitation creates significant secondary pollution leading to extra economic and environmental burdens here by exploiting the strong acidity of wac wastewater we successfully demonstrate fluidized struvite crystallization as a low cost treatment alternative based on a 12 m3 d on site pilot scale system four different fluidized struvite crystallization scenarios are evaluated from technical economic and environmental perspectives the results show that using mgo with mgcl2 supplement saves 42 8 of the reagent cost when treating phosphate rich wastewater i e p 3125 2 mg l and also maintains ideal p removal rate and struvite product purity meanwhile the internal circulation mode exhibits higher p recovery 99 2 than the external mode 55 3 89 3 while also demonstrates superior economic and environmental benefit because of less chemical consumption in addition the struvite morphology can be turned between pellets with strong crushing strength external mode to powder internal mode by life cycle cost lcc analysis we find that on a treatment scale of 500 m3 d struvite based technology saves up to 31 33 million chinese yuan cyn during a 20 year lifespan with relative payback period of 2 60 year the technical economic and environmental assessments confirm that the struvite technology is a promising alternative in solving the bottleneck of wac wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wood based activated carbon wastewater struvite fluidized bed reactor mg source circulation mode life cycle assessment 1 introduction wood based activated carbon wac is used extensively as an effective absorbent in food and drug industry medical sanitation and environmental restoration according to the 2018 annual report on activated carbon industry the global consumption of activated carbon reached 182 million tons 42 of which was wac sansheng consulting 2019 the annual growth rate of wac production is approaching 10 and expected to accelerate in the near future sansheng consulting 2019 the scale up production of wac brings huge burden in waste management and environmental protection it is well known that the large surface area well developed pore structure and abundant surface functional groups of wac originate from the activation process phosphoric acid activation is the most common method because it is simple and effective in producing porous structure baquero et al 2003 consequently washing the residue h3po4 after the activation process leads to tremendous amount of acidic wastewater containing phosphorus in high concentration i e p 1000 mg l currently lime precipitation is a routine method for treating the wac wastewater this seemingly cheap method however has lots of drawbacks 1 liquid to obtain low effluent p concentration lime is used in large excess which results in highly alkaline effluent and requires additional neutralization desmidt et al 2014 2 solid large amount of moisture 50 and overdosed lime are contained in the generated sludge which becomes a hazardous solid waste and is expensive to dispose 3 gas because nh4hco3 is added to neutralize the excess h3po4 significant nh3 gas emission occurs with the excess addition of lime posing health risks therefore renovation of the treatment technology is urgently needed comparing to the removal and disposal approach the recovery strategy effectively reduces the disposal cost struvite crystallization is a well known method for recovering nitrogen and phosphorus from mild basic conditions producing a slow release struvite fertilizer corre et al 2009 li et al 2019a however the implementation of struvite crystallization is largely hindered by the high cost of chemical reagents i e mg source and alkali input romero güiza et al 2015 aiming to lower the operation cost alternative magnesium compounds e g mgo are explored to supply mg2 and oh simultaneously li et al 2019a unfortunately the low solubility of mgo in mild basic environment makes it necessary to pre treat mgo with acid wang et al 2018a or add excess mgo for efficient n p removal romero güiza et al 2015 which eliminates the cost advantage it is worth noticing that the strongly acidic wac wastewater may be exploited to realize the mgo application in the struvite crystallization process which might lead to an economical alternative for the routine lime precipitation treatment to the best of our knowledge there is no report on phosphorus recovery from the wac wastewater to replace a routine process the technical economical and environmental aspects of a new process need to be thoroughly evaluated life cycle assessment lca by iso 14 040 is a system level assessment tool for evaluating the comprehensive environmental impact lca evaluates all related impacts of a process not only on site but also preceding and succeeding of its execution and provides an framework methodology to calculate the environmental burdens and benefits amann et al 2018 for the struvite crystallization technology in addition to analyzing the phosphorus removal profile during the treatment process influences from all associated aspects should be taken into considerations these include the electricity supply chemical production transportation pollutant discharge waste disposal and gaseous emissions so far most of the lca studies on struvite crystallization focus on municipal wastewater and source separated urine amann et al 2018 sena and hicks 2018 the assessment on industrial wastewater scenarios is scarce not to mention wastewater of extremely high p concentration since the environmental burden of struvite crystallization process is highly dependent on the chemical input lca is critical to determine whether the implementation of struvite crystallization process is feasible on highly polluted matrix such as wac wastewater here to investigate the feasibility of struvite crystallization approach in treating wac wastewater we build a pilot scale system in a wac factory with the treatment capacity of 12 m3 d and struvite yield of 94 9 kg d the techno economic and environmental evaluations are conducted in comparison with the routine lime precipitation method in particular the cost effective mgo dosing strategy which is of technical and economic importance is developed by lab scale batch experiments and continuous pilot scale experiments substance flow analysis sfa is then used to produce a system level overview of substance flow among different treatment technologies finally lca and lcc methods are applied to assess the sustainability of the scenarios and to outline a comprehensive selection protocol in treating wac wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater and chemicals the wac wastewater was collected from the regulating tank in a typical wac factory located in nanping fujian china commercial grade chemicals such as mgo 85 mgcl2 nh4cl and naoh were purchased from alibaba these chemicals were used in the lab scale and pilot scale experiments using the same chemicals as in the following full scale renovation provides valuable information because the impurities and price including tax and transportation expense significantly affect the performance economics and environmental impact of the alternative treatment option 2 2 struvite crystallization process 2 2 1 lab scale batch experiment lab scale batch experiments were conducted to explore the p removal ratio product composition and reagent cost of three mg dosing strategies fig 1 a to cover the possible range of p concentrations three wastewater samples with different p concentrations i e 943 2 mg l 2336 4 mg l and 3125 2 mg l were collected three mg dosing modes were performed including mode b1 mgcl2 mode b2 mgo mgcl2 and mode b3 mgo mg containing chemicals were added into 500 ml wac wastewater with mg p molar ratios of 1 0 1 2 1 5 and 2 0 the desired mg p molar ratio of mode b1 and b3 was achieved by adding mgcl2 and mgo respectively in mode b2 mgo was first added to reach the theoretical mg p ratio of 0 8 and mixed with the wac water for 30 min after which the insoluble solid was discarded and mgcl2 was added to the supernatant to reach the preset mg p level once the desired mg p values were achieved nh4cl was added at the n p ratio of 1 0 the reaction proceeded at ph of 8 5 at 200 rpm for 30 min and the supernatant was filtered with a 0 45 µm filter for element analysis the phosphate concentration of the effluent was controlled below 8 0 mg l according to standard gb t 31962 2015 when the effluent phosphate concentrate exceeded 8 0 mg l mgcl2 was added until the standard was met all chemical consumptions were recorded for cost calculation 2 2 2 pilot scale continuous experiment a pilot scale fluidized bed reactor fbr with a volume of 5 m3 was designed as the struvite crystallizer fig s4 it had one cylinder column in the reacting zone fig 1b ye et al 2018a to use mgo as the mg source wastewater was first flowed into a mixing tank where mgo was added to mg p of 1 0 the mixture was then pumped to the fbr and further supplemented with mgcl2 to a total mg p ratio of 1 6 nh4cl was added to n p of 1 0 naoh solution was used to adjust the ph to 8 5 automatically three circulating strategies were compared in the pilot scale experiments including mode f1 external circulation at an upflow velocity of 25 mm s mode f2 external circulation at an upflow velocity of 15 mm s and mode f3 internal circulation at an upflow velocity of 25 mm s the differences between internal and external circulation laid in the position where circulating stream derived from the operation period of pilot scale fbr was at least 40 days for each mode with average treatment capability of 12 m3 d and struvite yield of 94 9 kg d 2 2 3 analytical methods po4 p and nh3 n concentrations were measured via colorimetric methods using a uv visible spectrophotometer dr5000 hach usa phosphorous removal and recovery rates were calculated according to ye et al 2016 mg concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 7000dv usa the ph value of the solution was monitored by an on line ph meter pc 3100 suntex china struvite products were washed with pure water and dried in an oven at 38 c overnight elemental analysis on mg nh3 n and po4 p was conducted after electrothermal digestion with hno3 the nh3 n content was used to calculate the struvite content in final products hao et al 2009 the moisture content was the weight difference between the dried and wet mass the granulation ratio was the mass ratio of granule i e size 0 5 mm in the sample the crystallography of struvite product was analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd panalytical x pert pro netherlands equipped with cu kα radiation product morphologies were observed by scanning electron microscope sem hitachi tm3000 japan 2 3 thermodynamic modeling thermodynamic modeling was conducted using visual minteq to predict the potential precipitations and the theoretical equilibrium concentrations of p three p concentrations were used i e 620 mg l 1860 mg l and 3100 mg l which covered the fluctuation range of the target wastewater periclase was used as the representative mgo and the default setting of the molar ratio of magnesium nitrogen phosphorus mg n p was 1 0 all the simulations were performed between ph 2 and 11 the equilibrium concentration of p at various mg p molar ratio from 1 0 to 1 5 at economical ph was also simulated 2 4 static substance flow analysis a static sfa provides systematic information of interlinked process and substance flows wang et al 2018b here c n and p flux were quantified for each scenario in the water gas solid waste and product pathways the sfa was performed in sankey software the width of each line in the output figure was proportional to the mass flux of the substance flow 2 5 life cycle assessment 2 5 1 overview the environmental impacts were evaluated through lca a holistic approach that quantifies both the direct and indirect environmental influences using the framework and standards outlined in iso 14 040 iso 14040 2006 the system boundary contained the p removal technology with all associated background processes including electricity supply chemicals production and transportation nutrients discharge waste disposal and gaseous emissions the functional unit is set based on treating 1 m3 of raw wac wastewater the construction process was not included since the environmental impact of infrastructure itself was not significant when considering the long lifetime of the treatment plant tillman et al 1998 gabi ts software was used to establish scenarios and assess the environmental impacts through recipe midpoint h v1 13 methodology background information was obtained from ecoinvent v3 1 and gabi database eight environmental categories were concerned including climate change cc fossil depletion fd terrestrial acidification ta metal depletion md human toxicity htox freshwater ecotoxicity fetox freshwater eutrophication fe and marine eutrophication me 2 5 2 scenario settings six scenarios were considered table 1 including two lime based scenarios sc0 and sc1 and four struvite based scenarios sc2 sc5 the baseline scenario sc0 represented the routine lime technology currently used in the wac company this process included lime precipitation solid liquid separation and coagulating sedimentation sc1 as an improved version of sc0 is integrated with nitrogen n and chemical oxygen demand cod removal functions by applying conventional anoxic oxic a o method for the struvite based scenarios sc2 and sc3 adopted the internal circulating mode while sc4 and sc5 operate in the external mode meanwhile only phosphorus recovery function was considered in sc2 and sc4 while sc3 and sc5 integrated the a o process based on sc2 and sc4 respectively because the removal profile of the biological tank was unavailable in the pilot scale experiments theoretical calculation was carried out according to references and the design manual please refer to section a of the supplementary material for elaborate descriptions and inventory data 2 6 economic analysis 2 6 1 life cycle cost lcc analysis lcc analysis was conducted to evaluate a full scale struvite process with wac wastewater treatment capacity of 500 m3 d for struvite based technologies the cost was comprised of capital and operation cost derived from the design protocol and the pilot scale experiment table s5 s6 in addition struvite products were sold to a local farm at 500 cny ton for rice cultivation which partially offset the operation cost for the lime technology the capital cost of the base line scenario was not considered since it has already been built and no additional investment needs to be made the operation cost was obtained from the financial report of the wac company relative net present value rnpv and relative payback period rpb were used as the indicators to verify the economic superiority of the struvite process as compared to the lime technology the rnpv and rpb are calculated based on eq 1 and 2 1 r n p v 1 n c t l i m e c t s t r u v i t e 1 r t c 0 2 r p b c 0 c t l i m e c t s t r u v i t e where n represents the lifetime of the investment ct lime and ct struvite are the operation cost of lime and struvite technologies at tth year respectively ct lime ct struvite denotes the annual cost savings c0 is the initial capital cost of struvite process and r is the discount rate 4 according to the chinese commercial bank xiao et al 2018 2 6 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the uncertainties of chemical price and struvite price with the aim of evaluating the potential economic risk of the struvite technology the sensitivity coefficient was used as the indicator and calculated according to eq 3 xiao et al 2018 3 s i δ r p b i δ f i where si is the sensitivity coefficient fi is the uncertainties factor i is reagent price or struvite price and δrpbi is the variation in rpbi resulting from a change in fi a higher absolute value of si implies that rpbi is more sensitive to the change of fi 2 6 3 trade off analysis because the current study aims to provide a guideline for choosing different treatment scenarios it is necessary to make a multi criteria decision analysis based on the rnpv results and environmental impacts the comprehensive environmental impact was calculated via eq 4 shi et al 2018 4 e i m p a c t i 1 8 1 8 e i e i min where ei is the value of ith environmental impact category in one scenario and ei min is the absolute minimum value of all environmental impact categories in all scenarios 3 results 3 1 wac wastewater composition and current treatment status the targeted wac wastewater was a combination of wastewater from different production units in the factory washing off the residue h3po4 after the activation process leads to tremendous amount of acidic wastewater with high phosphorus content ph 2 0 0 3 p 1300 0 346 1 mg l high cod 1000 0 496 7 mg l content is introduced into the wac wastewater during the tail gas clean up process the substantial use of nh4hco3 for wac neutralization results in high ammonium concentration 160 1 55 1 mg l in the final wastewater currently the wastewater treatment facility is only designed for phosphorus removal through lime dosage leading to large amount of precipitated sludge the sludge is difficult to dispose because landfill of industrial solid waste is strictly prohibited meanwhile the excessive discharge of cod and nh3 n leads to heavy penalty and even suspension of the factory the routine treatment process has become the bottleneck and largely hindered the development of the wac industry since the renovation of the treatment technology is urgently needed we choose the struvite technology because it recovers phosphorus and nitrogen simultaneously without solid waste generation 3 2 batch experiment results batch experiments are conducted to evaluate the p removal rates reagent costs and struvite product purity of the three mg dosing strategies for treating wac wastewater fig 2 overall mode b1 exhibits excellent p removal rates with the highest reagent cost mode b2 demonstrates balance between efficiency and cost while its operation procedure is the most complicated mode b3 has the lowest cost but also the lowest p removal rates the p removal rate of mode b3 at mg p of 1 0 are 43 7 68 2 and 74 4 for different influent p concentrations of 943 2 mg l 2336 4 mg l and 3125 2 mg l respectively these values are significantly lower than mode b2 53 7 85 5 and 82 4 and mode b1 96 in all cases although the p removal rate in mode b3 enhances from 74 4 to 99 9 at high p concentration i e 3125 2 mg l when mg p increases from 1 0 to 2 0 fig 2c the enhancement is not as significant when the p concentration decreases to 943 2 mg l fig 2a it is worth noticing that more than 98 1 of p is removed in all cases by supplementing mgcl2 table s7 from a technical aspect this indicates that mgcl2 supplement is more reliable than the excess dosage of mgo with mgcl2 supplement the overall reagent costs at mg p of 1 0 are 16 6 12 9 and 12 9 cny m3 for mode b1 b2 and b3 respectively at p concentration of 943 2 mg l the corresponding costs further increase to 61 4 39 5 and 35 1 cny m3 for mode b1 b2 and b3 respectively at p concentration of 3125 2 mg l no remarkable cost reduction can be found when switching mode b2 to b3 this is because mgo dosages are similar in mode b2 and b3 at mg p of 1 0 it appears that mode b3 saves 22 3 42 8 of the reagent cost comparing to mode b1 especially at high p concentration increasing mgo to mg p of 2 0 further reduces the cost by 9 5 table s8 but it introduces impurity to struvite fig s3 however when mg p is controlled at 1 0 no remarkably difference of struvite purity is found between mode b1 and b3 fig s3 the thermodynamics modeling outcome is similar to that of the batch experiments it indicates that dosing mgo at mg p ratio of 1 1 is only capable of lowering the p concentration to 19 1 mg l twice of the discharge limit even under the optimum ph i e 9 5 at the equilibrium state fig s2 moreover struvite mghpo4 3h2o and mg3 po4 2 are the only equilibrium products at the investigated ph range fig 3 among them struvite predominates more than 90 once the ph is above 7 and becomes the only product when the ph is controlled between 8 0 and 9 5 the results confirm that the proper use of mgo does not introduce significant amount of impurities to the final product at reported ph range corre et al 2009 therefore the results of batch experiment and modeling both indicate the necessity of mgcl2 supplement by consideration of p removal reagent cost and struvite purity mode b3 with further mgcl2 supplement is adopted for pilot scale continuous experiments 3 3 pilot scale fbr processes a pilot scale fbr with treatment capacity of 12 m3 d is built to test the long term performance of the mg dosing strategy mode b3 the fbr system equipped with a mgo premixing tank is shown fig 4 wastewater is first mixed with mgo in a stirred tank then gets pumped into the fbr where mgcl2 is supplemented accordingly it is well known that the circulating flow is crucial for struvite crystallization in fbr while also responsible for poor phosphorus retention and high energy consumption ye et al 2016 to obtain the most cost effective flow strategy we investigate different circulation modes mode f1 f3 first we operate the fbr under mode f1 external circulation with an upflow velocity of 25 mm s the p removal and recovery rate fluctuate between 82 5 and 72 6 before adding mgcl2 after the supplement of mgcl2 blue arrow the p removal rate increases to 99 0 but the recovery rate decreases to 55 3 fig 5 a the declining p recovery is likely because of the increase of fine particles in the effluent which are the result of supersaturation induced by the addition of mgcl2 mehta and batstone 2013 decreasing the upflow velocity is a straightforward approach to retain the fine particles and improve the p recovery rate ye et al 2016 while also enhancing the p removal rate because of the extended crystallization time xu et al 2019 in mode f2 the upflow velocity is lowered to 15 mm s leading to an improved p recovery rate of 89 3 with high p removal rate fig 5c on the other hand switching from the external to internal circulation is also effective mode f3 a sedimentation region is created between the circulation port and the outflow surface fig s5 as a result p recovery rate stabilizes at 99 2 indicating completely retention of fine particles fig 5e in the product the struvite contents are almost the same across three modes i e 90 0 by mode f1 89 2 by mode f2 and 88 2 by mode f3 the moisture contents 20 0 by mode f1 21 1 by mode f2 and 27 4 by mode f3 are significantly lower than the lime sludge 54 5 it should be noted that the granulation ratio of the product by mode f3 is the lowest 13 5 compared with mode f1 100 and mode f2 89 3 fig 5b and d although the struvite from mode f3 is finer than that from the other two modes we can still collect them easily fig s6 shows the product harvesting process of mode f3 the solid can be simply filtered by a piece of stainless steel mesh or filter cloth with a mesh size of 175 µm moreover mode f3 demonstrates the best economic performance because the lowest mgo loss which requires less mgcl2 and naoh than other modes 3 4 comparison of the treatment technologies 3 4 1 substance flow analysis sfa was used to compare the system level change of c n p flows between lime based and struvite based technologies fig 6 overall changing from lime precipitation to struvite crystallization recovers 99 2 1 290 kg of p and 33 8 0 054 kg of n from the wac wastewater this also further reduces 24 8 0 035 kg of n in the effluent and prevents gaseous nh3 emissions 0 019 kg of n because both lime and struvite based technologies cannot remove n and c to the desired level incorporating a o process appears necessary however the integration of a o process increases other environmental burdens such as the increasing sludge production and gas emission thus the overall environmental impacts of different alternatives should be considered rather than simply focusing on improving the discharge standard 3 4 2 life cycle assessment lca is conducted to compare lime and struvite technologies the flow diagrams of the six scenarios are shown in fig s10 the environmental impacts are investigated by dividing the treatment processes into eight aspects including water consumption electricity chemicals transportation waste disposal treatment process fertilizer offset and water offset fig 7 for climate change cc the co2 emission of sc0 is 26 5 kg co2 eq m3 with the highest contribution from chemicals 64 0 followed by transportation 15 1 electricity 13 1 and waste disposal 7 4 higher emission is observed when coupling with the a o process sc1 for struvite scenarios significantly lower co2 emission from 0 58 to 5 01 kg co2 eq m3 are observed in sc2 sc5 with similar contributing factor and proportions fig 7a the decreasing co2 emission can be attributed to two reasons 1 comparing to the lime production under high temperature calcining the chemicals used in struvite technologies are produced with less energy input and co2 emissions amann et al 2018 2 struvite product is a great substitute for mineral fertilizer which has high co2 emission during the production meanwhile the incorporation of a o biochemical process to the struvite technology increases the co2 emission by 0 796 and 0 806 kg co2 eq m3 caused by n2o emissions and electricity consumption for aeration respectively switching from internal to external circulation also increases environmental impact because of the increased chemicals usage i e mgcl2 and naoh similar trend is observed in fossil depletion fd with 4 99 to 5 28 kg oil eq m3 in sc0 and sc1 and 3 31 to 1 89 kg oil eq m3 in sc2 sc5 fig 7b although chemicals in sc2 sc5 predominate the fd impact the struvite product provides an offset of 6 52 kg oil eq m3 which creates environmental benefit for the whole process for terrestrial acidification ta 0 08 kg so2 eq m3 in sc0 and sc1 is higher than those in sc2 sc5 fig 7c since the ph was uncontrolled during the lime precipitation process 11 9 of n was lost as gaseous nh3 which induces significant potential of ta 58 8 in sc0 and sc1 the ta impacts in sc2 sc5 are dominated by chemicals and transportation which account for more than 85 of the so2 emissions however these impacts again can be offset by the struvite product no remarkable difference is found among sc2 sc5 implying that a o integration and circulation mode have little impact on the so2 emissions lower metal depletion md is observed in sc2 sc5 as compared to sc0 and sc1 fig 7d the main difference lies in the waste disposal process in sc0 and sc1 large amount of highly basic phosphoric sludge 128 9 kg m3 gets landfilled while only small amount of bio sludge 1 5 kg m3 and coagulation sludge 0 33 kg m3 need to be treated in sc2 sc5 with the environmental benefits demonstrated in sc2 sc5 it is worth noting that external circulation decreases the benefit by 43 1 since more chemicals are needed for toxicity related impact categories i e human toxicity htox and freshwater ecotoxicity fetox lower environmental burden is observed in sc0 and sc1 fig 7e and f chemicals contribute almost entirely in the struvite based scenarios however this impact can be compensated by the fertilizer replacement generally emissions of heavy metal dominate the toxicity related impact categories longo et al 2017 comparing to phosphorus minerals the recovered struvite fertilizer results in remarkable reductions of heavy metals pollution wang et al 2018a if the impacts of struvite fertilizer application are considered the struvite substitution generates more benefits because the surface runoff and leaching is reduced because of its slow releasing property rahman et al 2011 regarding eutrophication freshwater eutrophication fe depends mainly on the direct p discharge although struvite based technologies remove p more efficiently than lime based scenarios no remarkable changes are found among sc0 sc5 fig 7g all four struvite scenarios display environmental benefit on fe in the range of 0 43 to 0 42 kg p eq m3 for marine eutrophication me the lowest impact is found in sc1 higher burden observed in struvite processes is attributed to the usage of nh4cl fig 7h lower me impacts in sc3 and sc5 are likely because of the lower nh3 n concentrations in the effluent 3 4 3 life cycle cost analysis based on the economic inventory data table s4 s6 the rnpv and rpb results of each scenario are calculated using eq 1 and 2 and shown in table 2 it shows that the routine lime technology sc0 has the highest operation cost 33 51 cny m3 incorporating a o process to the existing lime technology increases the cost to 34 28 cny m3 the decreasing costs in the struvite based scenarios sc2 sc5 are attributed to the elimination of sludge disposal cost and the economic benefit of struvite product it appears that all of the struvite based scenarios demonstrate better economic significances than the lime processes the major difference among the struvite scenarios lies in the a o process and circulation mode the incorporation of a o process increases the capital cost by about 1 16 million cny on average whereas changing from internal to external circulation reduces the capital cost by 0 30 million cny the removal of nh3 n and cod during the a o process inevitably increases the electricity consumption but cost only increases by 1 10 cny m3 because the treated water can be reclaimed on the other hand switching from internal to external circulation reduces the electricity consumption in the drying process by about 1 00 cny m3 however the poor retention of mgo in the external cycling mode requires additional mgcl2 and naoh supply at the cost of 4 50 cny m3 to meet the p discharging standard from above analysis internal circulation with a o process sc3 seems to be the optimal process from both technical and economic perspectives in this case the rpb is 3 18 year and rnpv reaches 27 99 million cyn the rpb is much shorter than the 20 year lifespan of the renovation project with relatively high rnpv 3 5 sensitivity analysis the successful operation of struvite process relies heavily on the reagent costs which dominates the operation costs kataki et al 2016 uncertainties in the cost evaluations may be caused by price fluctuates in the long term hence we conduct sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of changing reagent price from 50 to 50 on rpb table s9 as a result the sensitivity coefficients of all reagents range from 0 00025 to 0 00043 in the internal circulation and from 0 00053 to 0 00111 in the external circulation mode table s9 the low absolute values indicate that the rpb is not influenced by the reagent cost meanwhile it appears that the reagent price has greater impact on the external circulation mode the 50 price change of naoh influences both modes the most with rpb increase of 0 37 internal mode and 1 67 external mode years since naoh price fluctuated during 2018 and 2019 applying internal circulation mode helps reduce the price uncertainties of chemicals the effect of struvite market price on the economics is also investigated table s9 the baseline struvite price setting in this study is 500 cny ton it is remarkably lower than that in literature li et al 2019b but more reliable because we sold the produced struvite either in the form of pellet or powder at this price the original rpb values were 3 18 and 4 17 years for internal and external circulation modes respectively the rpb difference between the two modes decreases with the increasing struvite price for example when the struvite price increases to 1500 cny ton the rpb values reduce to 2 10 and 2 46 years with a smaller difference of only 0 36 year currently internal circulation mode is more suitable because it is more economical and exhibiting higher resistance to reagent cost fluctuation since the market for recycled phosphate fertilizers is maturing espp 2011 the struvite price will probably increase this indicates that two circulation mode might be freely chosen without economic concerns in the future 3 6 trade off as shown in fig 8 the comprehensive environment impacts are markedly lower in struvite technologies 331 7 to 97 2 than those of the lime based technologies 954 0 and 992 4 for struvite based scenarios the lowest impact and the highest rpnv are observed in sc2 while sc5 exhibits the highest impact and lowest rpnv nevertheless they both show environmental benefits although more cod and nh3 n are removed the incorporation of a o process appears to decrease the environmental benefit mainly because of the higher electricity consumption the biochemical sludge disposal and the potential release of n2o similar observation is obtained from a study on wastewater treatment plants which concludes that improving the effluent standard should be considered very carefully wang et al 2015 furthermore environmental benefit decreases while switching the internal to external circulation mode because of the additional reagent consumption i e mgcl2 and naoh overall all four struvite based scenarios are potential alternatives to replace the routine lime technology for achieving improved economic feasibility and environmental sustainability 4 discussion 4 1 technical aspect 4 1 1 mgo dissolution mgo dissolution and subsequent reactions are critical for treating wac wastewater with the struvite based technology it is highly dependent on the solution ph which also governs the supersaturation of all potential precipitates galbraith and schneider 2014 in neutral aqueous solution mg2 and oh released from mgo leads to the supersaturation of mg oh 2 around the mgo surface suppressing the dissolution stolzenburg et al 2015 on the other hand the generated oh leads to localized high ph which induces impurity nucleation e g newberyite and bobierrite fig 3 onto the mgo surface also hindering the dissolution of mgo these unwanted precipitations consume mg and p before struvite formation resulting in the uncontrolled deposition on the impellers reactor walls and pipe surfaces therefore if the mgo is dosed without control the struvite content will likely decrease in the final product ideally we want more mg2 released from mgo to form struvite rather than impurity phases previous research shows that mgo dissolution and further precipitations are both thermodynamic and kinetic controlled romero güiza et al 2015 thermodynamically the low ph of wac wastewater impedes the mg oh 2 formation and facilitates the dissolution of the mgo as shown in fig s7a when the ph of mixing tank is below 6 5 p loss of less than 20 is achieved when the inflow p concentration is lower than 2000 mg l kinetically to maximize the mgo dissolution and prevent p loss before entering fbr a direct approach is to control the mixing time by reducing the mixing time from 4 h to 2 h the p loss decreases by 53 8 fig s7b this is probably because that mgo dissolves much faster than impurity formation the reduced mixing time also decreases the solid deposition in the mixing tank since most precipitates are prone to remain in the mixture than adsorbed by tank surfaces 4 1 2 upflow velocity as mentioned earlier upflow velocity is a crucial parameter for the fluidization in fbrs fattah et al 2012 it not only affects the p removal recovery performance and product quality but also influences the operation cost of the system researchers have explored the upflow velocity ranging from 25 mm s ye et al 2016 to 500 cm min that is 83 3 mm s xu et al 2019 it is found that excessive fluidization exhibits drawbacks such as poor p recovery more pellet breakage and high energy consumption therefore lowering the upflow velocity is favorable both technically and economically typically the low upflow velocity in fbr struvite crystallization affects the product quality e g low purity and crushing strength however in this study lowering the upflow velocity from 25 mm s to 15 mm s does not show any adverse effect on struvite quality but remarkably improve the p recovery rate further decreasing upflow velocity to 8 mm s is also explored but the result shows that the p removal rate decreases significantly probably because of the poor mass transfer fig s8 moreover insufficient upflow velocity will cause system blockage because of poor fluidization which may affect the system detrimentally fig s9 therefore in our study 15 mm s is chosen as an effective and economic upflow velocity 4 1 3 circulation mode struvite crystallization process consists of nucleation growth aggregation and particle breakage these stages occur simultaneously but they are influenced by the saturation seeding and hydrodynamic conditions corre et al 2009 kataki et al 2016 normally one or two stages dominate the crystallization process and determine the final product for instance nucleation dominates when system operates at high supersaturation leading to powder products decreasing the supersaturation e g via ph or circulation mode facilitates crystal growth and aggregation ye et al 2014 for wac wastewater supersaturation is generated once the wastewater meets the added chemicals and gradually dissipates with the increase of axial height therefore the generated struvite nuclei grow or aggregate in the upper region of the fbr in our system effluent circulation is used to suppress supersaturation promoting crystal growth and aggregation instead of nucleation when external circulation mode is applied aggregations form in the top section of fbr and descend subsequently when they are heavy enough to resist the force of the upflow ye et al 2018b during the descending process these aggregates form granules via further agglomerating and coating growth ye et al 2018b in contrast in the internal circulation mode aggregates in the fbr are circulated through the pump where strong collision occurs between aggregates and pump impeller leading to particle breakage corre et al 2009 fattah et al 2012 at this situation aggregation stage is significantly weakened and aggregates are prone to disintegrate into single crystals the morphology difference between external and internal mode indicates the importance of the particle breakage during the granulation process which in turn emphasizes the significance of the circulation 4 2 economic aspect as we can see the current struvite based technology shows better economic performance than the routine lime technology it is well known that the struvite based technology will become more cost effective when struvite demonstrates its market value currently several full scale struvite reactors have been successfully implemented but the main driving force is to reduce the cost on maintenance and sludge disposal rather than recovering phosphorous egle et al 2016 although struvite exhibits potential as a fertilizer the low price of phosphate mineral hinders the development of the struvite value chain forrest et al 2008 the situation is further complicated by technical environmental social and legal factors de et al 2018 to date the lack of struvite market is overlooked by researchers willem 2014 so the struvite price is often overestimated by multiplying its nutrient components by their common market values world bank 2016 struvite is generally considered as a promising slow release fertilizer but it has only been approved in denmark and the netherlands iwa 2017 the need for struvite as a slow release fertilizer is much smaller than that for regular fertilizers de et al 2018 one potential application of struvite simply makes it a fertilizer additive before a mature market is established for example in our study the struvite is added to organic fertilizer for the rice cultivation with the price of 500 cny ton likely lower than its real value this creates a cost saving of 4 62 cny m3 nevertheless the struvite market is developing because of the depletion of phosphorous resources a market for secondary recycled phosphates is establishing espp 2011 attempts have been made by applying struvite in heavy metal immobilization wang et al 2020 antibiotic resistance genes amendment li et al 2019c and construction li et al 2019a therefore we expect the increasing struvite demand and price in the further which will lower the cost of the struvite based technology further 4 3 environmental aspect struvite based technology creates less environmental burden than the routine lime technology this originates from its lower chemical and electricity consumption decreased greenhouse gas emission reduced solid waste production rate and the replacement of fertilizer by the recovered struvite since chemical consumption introduces the most environmental burden reducing the chemical usage or applying environmentally benign chemicals may help improving the sustainability of the struvite based treatment it is worth noting that the environmental benefits are currently achieved based on the decreased commercial fertilizer production the benefit may further increase if the fertilizing behavior of the struvite is considered during lca this is because that struvite gradually releases its nutrients which is less likely to leach and runoff than the conventional soluble fertilizer rahman et al 2011 meanwhile the slow release property of struvite helps decreasing the fertilizing frequency leading to reduced diesel consumption and co2 emission and therefore further reduce the environmental burden 5 conclusion we demonstrate the superiority of struvite based technology over the routine lime technology in treating wac wastewater improved p recovery performance less sludge generation better economic performance and enhanced environmental sustainability are achieved based on a 12 m3 d pilot scale system we find that using mgo with mgcl2 supplement is the optimum mg dosing strategy in terms of p removal rate struvite purity and operation cost in addition internal circulation mode exhibits higher p recovery than the external mode but lower granulation ratio i e powder products when integrated with a o process the overall operation cost of internal mode is lower than that of external mode when the wac treatment capacity reaches 500 m3 d life cycle cost analysis shows that a maximum of 31 33 million cyn can be saved during a 20 year lifespan by applying struvite based technology with relative payback period of 2 60 year this economic benefit is resistive to the fluctuation of the chemicals price moreover struvite process with internal mode also exhibit superior environmental benefit because of its less chemicals input i e mgcl2 and naoh the product morphology can be turned between pellet struvite with strong crushing strength by external mode to powder struvite preferred as the fertilizer additives by internal mode the technical economic and environmental evaluation of the struvite technology confirm that it is a promising alternative in solving the bottleneck problems of

17430,production of wood based activated carbon wac generates large volume of highly acidic and phosphate rich wastewater currently the routine treatment i e lime precipitation creates significant secondary pollution leading to extra economic and environmental burdens here by exploiting the strong acidity of wac wastewater we successfully demonstrate fluidized struvite crystallization as a low cost treatment alternative based on a 12 m3 d on site pilot scale system four different fluidized struvite crystallization scenarios are evaluated from technical economic and environmental perspectives the results show that using mgo with mgcl2 supplement saves 42 8 of the reagent cost when treating phosphate rich wastewater i e p 3125 2 mg l and also maintains ideal p removal rate and struvite product purity meanwhile the internal circulation mode exhibits higher p recovery 99 2 than the external mode 55 3 89 3 while also demonstrates superior economic and environmental benefit because of less chemical consumption in addition the struvite morphology can be turned between pellets with strong crushing strength external mode to powder internal mode by life cycle cost lcc analysis we find that on a treatment scale of 500 m3 d struvite based technology saves up to 31 33 million chinese yuan cyn during a 20 year lifespan with relative payback period of 2 60 year the technical economic and environmental assessments confirm that the struvite technology is a promising alternative in solving the bottleneck of wac wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wood based activated carbon wastewater struvite fluidized bed reactor mg source circulation mode life cycle assessment 1 introduction wood based activated carbon wac is used extensively as an effective absorbent in food and drug industry medical sanitation and environmental restoration according to the 2018 annual report on activated carbon industry the global consumption of activated carbon reached 182 million tons 42 of which was wac sansheng consulting 2019 the annual growth rate of wac production is approaching 10 and expected to accelerate in the near future sansheng consulting 2019 the scale up production of wac brings huge burden in waste management and environmental protection it is well known that the large surface area well developed pore structure and abundant surface functional groups of wac originate from the activation process phosphoric acid activation is the most common method because it is simple and effective in producing porous structure baquero et al 2003 consequently washing the residue h3po4 after the activation process leads to tremendous amount of acidic wastewater containing phosphorus in high concentration i e p 1000 mg l currently lime precipitation is a routine method for treating the wac wastewater this seemingly cheap method however has lots of drawbacks 1 liquid to obtain low effluent p concentration lime is used in large excess which results in highly alkaline effluent and requires additional neutralization desmidt et al 2014 2 solid large amount of moisture 50 and overdosed lime are contained in the generated sludge which becomes a hazardous solid waste and is expensive to dispose 3 gas because nh4hco3 is added to neutralize the excess h3po4 significant nh3 gas emission occurs with the excess addition of lime posing health risks therefore renovation of the treatment technology is urgently needed comparing to the removal and disposal approach the recovery strategy effectively reduces the disposal cost struvite crystallization is a well known method for recovering nitrogen and phosphorus from mild basic conditions producing a slow release struvite fertilizer corre et al 2009 li et al 2019a however the implementation of struvite crystallization is largely hindered by the high cost of chemical reagents i e mg source and alkali input romero güiza et al 2015 aiming to lower the operation cost alternative magnesium compounds e g mgo are explored to supply mg2 and oh simultaneously li et al 2019a unfortunately the low solubility of mgo in mild basic environment makes it necessary to pre treat mgo with acid wang et al 2018a or add excess mgo for efficient n p removal romero güiza et al 2015 which eliminates the cost advantage it is worth noticing that the strongly acidic wac wastewater may be exploited to realize the mgo application in the struvite crystallization process which might lead to an economical alternative for the routine lime precipitation treatment to the best of our knowledge there is no report on phosphorus recovery from the wac wastewater to replace a routine process the technical economical and environmental aspects of a new process need to be thoroughly evaluated life cycle assessment lca by iso 14 040 is a system level assessment tool for evaluating the comprehensive environmental impact lca evaluates all related impacts of a process not only on site but also preceding and succeeding of its execution and provides an framework methodology to calculate the environmental burdens and benefits amann et al 2018 for the struvite crystallization technology in addition to analyzing the phosphorus removal profile during the treatment process influences from all associated aspects should be taken into considerations these include the electricity supply chemical production transportation pollutant discharge waste disposal and gaseous emissions so far most of the lca studies on struvite crystallization focus on municipal wastewater and source separated urine amann et al 2018 sena and hicks 2018 the assessment on industrial wastewater scenarios is scarce not to mention wastewater of extremely high p concentration since the environmental burden of struvite crystallization process is highly dependent on the chemical input lca is critical to determine whether the implementation of struvite crystallization process is feasible on highly polluted matrix such as wac wastewater here to investigate the feasibility of struvite crystallization approach in treating wac wastewater we build a pilot scale system in a wac factory with the treatment capacity of 12 m3 d and struvite yield of 94 9 kg d the techno economic and environmental evaluations are conducted in comparison with the routine lime precipitation method in particular the cost effective mgo dosing strategy which is of technical and economic importance is developed by lab scale batch experiments and continuous pilot scale experiments substance flow analysis sfa is then used to produce a system level overview of substance flow among different treatment technologies finally lca and lcc methods are applied to assess the sustainability of the scenarios and to outline a comprehensive selection protocol in treating wac wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater and chemicals the wac wastewater was collected from the regulating tank in a typical wac factory located in nanping fujian china commercial grade chemicals such as mgo 85 mgcl2 nh4cl and naoh were purchased from alibaba these chemicals were used in the lab scale and pilot scale experiments using the same chemicals as in the following full scale renovation provides valuable information because the impurities and price including tax and transportation expense significantly affect the performance economics and environmental impact of the alternative treatment option 2 2 struvite crystallization process 2 2 1 lab scale batch experiment lab scale batch experiments were conducted to explore the p removal ratio product composition and reagent cost of three mg dosing strategies fig 1 a to cover the possible range of p concentrations three wastewater samples with different p concentrations i e 943 2 mg l 2336 4 mg l and 3125 2 mg l were collected three mg dosing modes were performed including mode b1 mgcl2 mode b2 mgo mgcl2 and mode b3 mgo mg containing chemicals were added into 500 ml wac wastewater with mg p molar ratios of 1 0 1 2 1 5 and 2 0 the desired mg p molar ratio of mode b1 and b3 was achieved by adding mgcl2 and mgo respectively in mode b2 mgo was first added to reach the theoretical mg p ratio of 0 8 and mixed with the wac water for 30 min after which the insoluble solid was discarded and mgcl2 was added to the supernatant to reach the preset mg p level once the desired mg p values were achieved nh4cl was added at the n p ratio of 1 0 the reaction proceeded at ph of 8 5 at 200 rpm for 30 min and the supernatant was filtered with a 0 45 µm filter for element analysis the phosphate concentration of the effluent was controlled below 8 0 mg l according to standard gb t 31962 2015 when the effluent phosphate concentrate exceeded 8 0 mg l mgcl2 was added until the standard was met all chemical consumptions were recorded for cost calculation 2 2 2 pilot scale continuous experiment a pilot scale fluidized bed reactor fbr with a volume of 5 m3 was designed as the struvite crystallizer fig s4 it had one cylinder column in the reacting zone fig 1b ye et al 2018a to use mgo as the mg source wastewater was first flowed into a mixing tank where mgo was added to mg p of 1 0 the mixture was then pumped to the fbr and further supplemented with mgcl2 to a total mg p ratio of 1 6 nh4cl was added to n p of 1 0 naoh solution was used to adjust the ph to 8 5 automatically three circulating strategies were compared in the pilot scale experiments including mode f1 external circulation at an upflow velocity of 25 mm s mode f2 external circulation at an upflow velocity of 15 mm s and mode f3 internal circulation at an upflow velocity of 25 mm s the differences between internal and external circulation laid in the position where circulating stream derived from the operation period of pilot scale fbr was at least 40 days for each mode with average treatment capability of 12 m3 d and struvite yield of 94 9 kg d 2 2 3 analytical methods po4 p and nh3 n concentrations were measured via colorimetric methods using a uv visible spectrophotometer dr5000 hach usa phosphorous removal and recovery rates were calculated according to ye et al 2016 mg concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 7000dv usa the ph value of the solution was monitored by an on line ph meter pc 3100 suntex china struvite products were washed with pure water and dried in an oven at 38 c overnight elemental analysis on mg nh3 n and po4 p was conducted after electrothermal digestion with hno3 the nh3 n content was used to calculate the struvite content in final products hao et al 2009 the moisture content was the weight difference between the dried and wet mass the granulation ratio was the mass ratio of granule i e size 0 5 mm in the sample the crystallography of struvite product was analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd panalytical x pert pro netherlands equipped with cu kα radiation product morphologies were observed by scanning electron microscope sem hitachi tm3000 japan 2 3 thermodynamic modeling thermodynamic modeling was conducted using visual minteq to predict the potential precipitations and the theoretical equilibrium concentrations of p three p concentrations were used i e 620 mg l 1860 mg l and 3100 mg l which covered the fluctuation range of the target wastewater periclase was used as the representative mgo and the default setting of the molar ratio of magnesium nitrogen phosphorus mg n p was 1 0 all the simulations were performed between ph 2 and 11 the equilibrium concentration of p at various mg p molar ratio from 1 0 to 1 5 at economical ph was also simulated 2 4 static substance flow analysis a static sfa provides systematic information of interlinked process and substance flows wang et al 2018b here c n and p flux were quantified for each scenario in the water gas solid waste and product pathways the sfa was performed in sankey software the width of each line in the output figure was proportional to the mass flux of the substance flow 2 5 life cycle assessment 2 5 1 overview the environmental impacts were evaluated through lca a holistic approach that quantifies both the direct and indirect environmental influences using the framework and standards outlined in iso 14 040 iso 14040 2006 the system boundary contained the p removal technology with all associated background processes including electricity supply chemicals production and transportation nutrients discharge waste disposal and gaseous emissions the functional unit is set based on treating 1 m3 of raw wac wastewater the construction process was not included since the environmental impact of infrastructure itself was not significant when considering the long lifetime of the treatment plant tillman et al 1998 gabi ts software was used to establish scenarios and assess the environmental impacts through recipe midpoint h v1 13 methodology background information was obtained from ecoinvent v3 1 and gabi database eight environmental categories were concerned including climate change cc fossil depletion fd terrestrial acidification ta metal depletion md human toxicity htox freshwater ecotoxicity fetox freshwater eutrophication fe and marine eutrophication me 2 5 2 scenario settings six scenarios were considered table 1 including two lime based scenarios sc0 and sc1 and four struvite based scenarios sc2 sc5 the baseline scenario sc0 represented the routine lime technology currently used in the wac company this process included lime precipitation solid liquid separation and coagulating sedimentation sc1 as an improved version of sc0 is integrated with nitrogen n and chemical oxygen demand cod removal functions by applying conventional anoxic oxic a o method for the struvite based scenarios sc2 and sc3 adopted the internal circulating mode while sc4 and sc5 operate in the external mode meanwhile only phosphorus recovery function was considered in sc2 and sc4 while sc3 and sc5 integrated the a o process based on sc2 and sc4 respectively because the removal profile of the biological tank was unavailable in the pilot scale experiments theoretical calculation was carried out according to references and the design manual please refer to section a of the supplementary material for elaborate descriptions and inventory data 2 6 economic analysis 2 6 1 life cycle cost lcc analysis lcc analysis was conducted to evaluate a full scale struvite process with wac wastewater treatment capacity of 500 m3 d for struvite based technologies the cost was comprised of capital and operation cost derived from the design protocol and the pilot scale experiment table s5 s6 in addition struvite products were sold to a local farm at 500 cny ton for rice cultivation which partially offset the operation cost for the lime technology the capital cost of the base line scenario was not considered since it has already been built and no additional investment needs to be made the operation cost was obtained from the financial report of the wac company relative net present value rnpv and relative payback period rpb were used as the indicators to verify the economic superiority of the struvite process as compared to the lime technology the rnpv and rpb are calculated based on eq 1 and 2 1 r n p v 1 n c t l i m e c t s t r u v i t e 1 r t c 0 2 r p b c 0 c t l i m e c t s t r u v i t e where n represents the lifetime of the investment ct lime and ct struvite are the operation cost of lime and struvite technologies at tth year respectively ct lime ct struvite denotes the annual cost savings c0 is the initial capital cost of struvite process and r is the discount rate 4 according to the chinese commercial bank xiao et al 2018 2 6 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the uncertainties of chemical price and struvite price with the aim of evaluating the potential economic risk of the struvite technology the sensitivity coefficient was used as the indicator and calculated according to eq 3 xiao et al 2018 3 s i δ r p b i δ f i where si is the sensitivity coefficient fi is the uncertainties factor i is reagent price or struvite price and δrpbi is the variation in rpbi resulting from a change in fi a higher absolute value of si implies that rpbi is more sensitive to the change of fi 2 6 3 trade off analysis because the current study aims to provide a guideline for choosing different treatment scenarios it is necessary to make a multi criteria decision analysis based on the rnpv results and environmental impacts the comprehensive environmental impact was calculated via eq 4 shi et al 2018 4 e i m p a c t i 1 8 1 8 e i e i min where ei is the value of ith environmental impact category in one scenario and ei min is the absolute minimum value of all environmental impact categories in all scenarios 3 results 3 1 wac wastewater composition and current treatment status the targeted wac wastewater was a combination of wastewater from different production units in the factory washing off the residue h3po4 after the activation process leads to tremendous amount of acidic wastewater with high phosphorus content ph 2 0 0 3 p 1300 0 346 1 mg l high cod 1000 0 496 7 mg l content is introduced into the wac wastewater during the tail gas clean up process the substantial use of nh4hco3 for wac neutralization results in high ammonium concentration 160 1 55 1 mg l in the final wastewater currently the wastewater treatment facility is only designed for phosphorus removal through lime dosage leading to large amount of precipitated sludge the sludge is difficult to dispose because landfill of industrial solid waste is strictly prohibited meanwhile the excessive discharge of cod and nh3 n leads to heavy penalty and even suspension of the factory the routine treatment process has become the bottleneck and largely hindered the development of the wac industry since the renovation of the treatment technology is urgently needed we choose the struvite technology because it recovers phosphorus and nitrogen simultaneously without solid waste generation 3 2 batch experiment results batch experiments are conducted to evaluate the p removal rates reagent costs and struvite product purity of the three mg dosing strategies for treating wac wastewater fig 2 overall mode b1 exhibits excellent p removal rates with the highest reagent cost mode b2 demonstrates balance between efficiency and cost while its operation procedure is the most complicated mode b3 has the lowest cost but also the lowest p removal rates the p removal rate of mode b3 at mg p of 1 0 are 43 7 68 2 and 74 4 for different influent p concentrations of 943 2 mg l 2336 4 mg l and 3125 2 mg l respectively these values are significantly lower than mode b2 53 7 85 5 and 82 4 and mode b1 96 in all cases although the p removal rate in mode b3 enhances from 74 4 to 99 9 at high p concentration i e 3125 2 mg l when mg p increases from 1 0 to 2 0 fig 2c the enhancement is not as significant when the p concentration decreases to 943 2 mg l fig 2a it is worth noticing that more than 98 1 of p is removed in all cases by supplementing mgcl2 table s7 from a technical aspect this indicates that mgcl2 supplement is more reliable than the excess dosage of mgo with mgcl2 supplement the overall reagent costs at mg p of 1 0 are 16 6 12 9 and 12 9 cny m3 for mode b1 b2 and b3 respectively at p concentration of 943 2 mg l the corresponding costs further increase to 61 4 39 5 and 35 1 cny m3 for mode b1 b2 and b3 respectively at p concentration of 3125 2 mg l no remarkable cost reduction can be found when switching mode b2 to b3 this is because mgo dosages are similar in mode b2 and b3 at mg p of 1 0 it appears that mode b3 saves 22 3 42 8 of the reagent cost comparing to mode b1 especially at high p concentration increasing mgo to mg p of 2 0 further reduces the cost by 9 5 table s8 but it introduces impurity to struvite fig s3 however when mg p is controlled at 1 0 no remarkably difference of struvite purity is found between mode b1 and b3 fig s3 the thermodynamics modeling outcome is similar to that of the batch experiments it indicates that dosing mgo at mg p ratio of 1 1 is only capable of lowering the p concentration to 19 1 mg l twice of the discharge limit even under the optimum ph i e 9 5 at the equilibrium state fig s2 moreover struvite mghpo4 3h2o and mg3 po4 2 are the only equilibrium products at the investigated ph range fig 3 among them struvite predominates more than 90 once the ph is above 7 and becomes the only product when the ph is controlled between 8 0 and 9 5 the results confirm that the proper use of mgo does not introduce significant amount of impurities to the final product at reported ph range corre et al 2009 therefore the results of batch experiment and modeling both indicate the necessity of mgcl2 supplement by consideration of p removal reagent cost and struvite purity mode b3 with further mgcl2 supplement is adopted for pilot scale continuous experiments 3 3 pilot scale fbr processes a pilot scale fbr with treatment capacity of 12 m3 d is built to test the long term performance of the mg dosing strategy mode b3 the fbr system equipped with a mgo premixing tank is shown fig 4 wastewater is first mixed with mgo in a stirred tank then gets pumped into the fbr where mgcl2 is supplemented accordingly it is well known that the circulating flow is crucial for struvite crystallization in fbr while also responsible for poor phosphorus retention and high energy consumption ye et al 2016 to obtain the most cost effective flow strategy we investigate different circulation modes mode f1 f3 first we operate the fbr under mode f1 external circulation with an upflow velocity of 25 mm s the p removal and recovery rate fluctuate between 82 5 and 72 6 before adding mgcl2 after the supplement of mgcl2 blue arrow the p removal rate increases to 99 0 but the recovery rate decreases to 55 3 fig 5 a the declining p recovery is likely because of the increase of fine particles in the effluent which are the result of supersaturation induced by the addition of mgcl2 mehta and batstone 2013 decreasing the upflow velocity is a straightforward approach to retain the fine particles and improve the p recovery rate ye et al 2016 while also enhancing the p removal rate because of the extended crystallization time xu et al 2019 in mode f2 the upflow velocity is lowered to 15 mm s leading to an improved p recovery rate of 89 3 with high p removal rate fig 5c on the other hand switching from the external to internal circulation is also effective mode f3 a sedimentation region is created between the circulation port and the outflow surface fig s5 as a result p recovery rate stabilizes at 99 2 indicating completely retention of fine particles fig 5e in the product the struvite contents are almost the same across three modes i e 90 0 by mode f1 89 2 by mode f2 and 88 2 by mode f3 the moisture contents 20 0 by mode f1 21 1 by mode f2 and 27 4 by mode f3 are significantly lower than the lime sludge 54 5 it should be noted that the granulation ratio of the product by mode f3 is the lowest 13 5 compared with mode f1 100 and mode f2 89 3 fig 5b and d although the struvite from mode f3 is finer than that from the other two modes we can still collect them easily fig s6 shows the product harvesting process of mode f3 the solid can be simply filtered by a piece of stainless steel mesh or filter cloth with a mesh size of 175 µm moreover mode f3 demonstrates the best economic performance because the lowest mgo loss which requires less mgcl2 and naoh than other modes 3 4 comparison of the treatment technologies 3 4 1 substance flow analysis sfa was used to compare the system level change of c n p flows between lime based and struvite based technologies fig 6 overall changing from lime precipitation to struvite crystallization recovers 99 2 1 290 kg of p and 33 8 0 054 kg of n from the wac wastewater this also further reduces 24 8 0 035 kg of n in the effluent and prevents gaseous nh3 emissions 0 019 kg of n because both lime and struvite based technologies cannot remove n and c to the desired level incorporating a o process appears necessary however the integration of a o process increases other environmental burdens such as the increasing sludge production and gas emission thus the overall environmental impacts of different alternatives should be considered rather than simply focusing on improving the discharge standard 3 4 2 life cycle assessment lca is conducted to compare lime and struvite technologies the flow diagrams of the six scenarios are shown in fig s10 the environmental impacts are investigated by dividing the treatment processes into eight aspects including water consumption electricity chemicals transportation waste disposal treatment process fertilizer offset and water offset fig 7 for climate change cc the co2 emission of sc0 is 26 5 kg co2 eq m3 with the highest contribution from chemicals 64 0 followed by transportation 15 1 electricity 13 1 and waste disposal 7 4 higher emission is observed when coupling with the a o process sc1 for struvite scenarios significantly lower co2 emission from 0 58 to 5 01 kg co2 eq m3 are observed in sc2 sc5 with similar contributing factor and proportions fig 7a the decreasing co2 emission can be attributed to two reasons 1 comparing to the lime production under high temperature calcining the chemicals used in struvite technologies are produced with less energy input and co2 emissions amann et al 2018 2 struvite product is a great substitute for mineral fertilizer which has high co2 emission during the production meanwhile the incorporation of a o biochemical process to the struvite technology increases the co2 emission by 0 796 and 0 806 kg co2 eq m3 caused by n2o emissions and electricity consumption for aeration respectively switching from internal to external circulation also increases environmental impact because of the increased chemicals usage i e mgcl2 and naoh similar trend is observed in fossil depletion fd with 4 99 to 5 28 kg oil eq m3 in sc0 and sc1 and 3 31 to 1 89 kg oil eq m3 in sc2 sc5 fig 7b although chemicals in sc2 sc5 predominate the fd impact the struvite product provides an offset of 6 52 kg oil eq m3 which creates environmental benefit for the whole process for terrestrial acidification ta 0 08 kg so2 eq m3 in sc0 and sc1 is higher than those in sc2 sc5 fig 7c since the ph was uncontrolled during the lime precipitation process 11 9 of n was lost as gaseous nh3 which induces significant potential of ta 58 8 in sc0 and sc1 the ta impacts in sc2 sc5 are dominated by chemicals and transportation which account for more than 85 of the so2 emissions however these impacts again can be offset by the struvite product no remarkable difference is found among sc2 sc5 implying that a o integration and circulation mode have little impact on the so2 emissions lower metal depletion md is observed in sc2 sc5 as compared to sc0 and sc1 fig 7d the main difference lies in the waste disposal process in sc0 and sc1 large amount of highly basic phosphoric sludge 128 9 kg m3 gets landfilled while only small amount of bio sludge 1 5 kg m3 and coagulation sludge 0 33 kg m3 need to be treated in sc2 sc5 with the environmental benefits demonstrated in sc2 sc5 it is worth noting that external circulation decreases the benefit by 43 1 since more chemicals are needed for toxicity related impact categories i e human toxicity htox and freshwater ecotoxicity fetox lower environmental burden is observed in sc0 and sc1 fig 7e and f chemicals contribute almost entirely in the struvite based scenarios however this impact can be compensated by the fertilizer replacement generally emissions of heavy metal dominate the toxicity related impact categories longo et al 2017 comparing to phosphorus minerals the recovered struvite fertilizer results in remarkable reductions of heavy metals pollution wang et al 2018a if the impacts of struvite fertilizer application are considered the struvite substitution generates more benefits because the surface runoff and leaching is reduced because of its slow releasing property rahman et al 2011 regarding eutrophication freshwater eutrophication fe depends mainly on the direct p discharge although struvite based technologies remove p more efficiently than lime based scenarios no remarkable changes are found among sc0 sc5 fig 7g all four struvite scenarios display environmental benefit on fe in the range of 0 43 to 0 42 kg p eq m3 for marine eutrophication me the lowest impact is found in sc1 higher burden observed in struvite processes is attributed to the usage of nh4cl fig 7h lower me impacts in sc3 and sc5 are likely because of the lower nh3 n concentrations in the effluent 3 4 3 life cycle cost analysis based on the economic inventory data table s4 s6 the rnpv and rpb results of each scenario are calculated using eq 1 and 2 and shown in table 2 it shows that the routine lime technology sc0 has the highest operation cost 33 51 cny m3 incorporating a o process to the existing lime technology increases the cost to 34 28 cny m3 the decreasing costs in the struvite based scenarios sc2 sc5 are attributed to the elimination of sludge disposal cost and the economic benefit of struvite product it appears that all of the struvite based scenarios demonstrate better economic significances than the lime processes the major difference among the struvite scenarios lies in the a o process and circulation mode the incorporation of a o process increases the capital cost by about 1 16 million cny on average whereas changing from internal to external circulation reduces the capital cost by 0 30 million cny the removal of nh3 n and cod during the a o process inevitably increases the electricity consumption but cost only increases by 1 10 cny m3 because the treated water can be reclaimed on the other hand switching from internal to external circulation reduces the electricity consumption in the drying process by about 1 00 cny m3 however the poor retention of mgo in the external cycling mode requires additional mgcl2 and naoh supply at the cost of 4 50 cny m3 to meet the p discharging standard from above analysis internal circulation with a o process sc3 seems to be the optimal process from both technical and economic perspectives in this case the rpb is 3 18 year and rnpv reaches 27 99 million cyn the rpb is much shorter than the 20 year lifespan of the renovation project with relatively high rnpv 3 5 sensitivity analysis the successful operation of struvite process relies heavily on the reagent costs which dominates the operation costs kataki et al 2016 uncertainties in the cost evaluations may be caused by price fluctuates in the long term hence we conduct sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of changing reagent price from 50 to 50 on rpb table s9 as a result the sensitivity coefficients of all reagents range from 0 00025 to 0 00043 in the internal circulation and from 0 00053 to 0 00111 in the external circulation mode table s9 the low absolute values indicate that the rpb is not influenced by the reagent cost meanwhile it appears that the reagent price has greater impact on the external circulation mode the 50 price change of naoh influences both modes the most with rpb increase of 0 37 internal mode and 1 67 external mode years since naoh price fluctuated during 2018 and 2019 applying internal circulation mode helps reduce the price uncertainties of chemicals the effect of struvite market price on the economics is also investigated table s9 the baseline struvite price setting in this study is 500 cny ton it is remarkably lower than that in literature li et al 2019b but more reliable because we sold the produced struvite either in the form of pellet or powder at this price the original rpb values were 3 18 and 4 17 years for internal and external circulation modes respectively the rpb difference between the two modes decreases with the increasing struvite price for example when the struvite price increases to 1500 cny ton the rpb values reduce to 2 10 and 2 46 years with a smaller difference of only 0 36 year currently internal circulation mode is more suitable because it is more economical and exhibiting higher resistance to reagent cost fluctuation since the market for recycled phosphate fertilizers is maturing espp 2011 the struvite price will probably increase this indicates that two circulation mode might be freely chosen without economic concerns in the future 3 6 trade off as shown in fig 8 the comprehensive environment impacts are markedly lower in struvite technologies 331 7 to 97 2 than those of the lime based technologies 954 0 and 992 4 for struvite based scenarios the lowest impact and the highest rpnv are observed in sc2 while sc5 exhibits the highest impact and lowest rpnv nevertheless they both show environmental benefits although more cod and nh3 n are removed the incorporation of a o process appears to decrease the environmental benefit mainly because of the higher electricity consumption the biochemical sludge disposal and the potential release of n2o similar observation is obtained from a study on wastewater treatment plants which concludes that improving the effluent standard should be considered very carefully wang et al 2015 furthermore environmental benefit decreases while switching the internal to external circulation mode because of the additional reagent consumption i e mgcl2 and naoh overall all four struvite based scenarios are potential alternatives to replace the routine lime technology for achieving improved economic feasibility and environmental sustainability 4 discussion 4 1 technical aspect 4 1 1 mgo dissolution mgo dissolution and subsequent reactions are critical for treating wac wastewater with the struvite based technology it is highly dependent on the solution ph which also governs the supersaturation of all potential precipitates galbraith and schneider 2014 in neutral aqueous solution mg2 and oh released from mgo leads to the supersaturation of mg oh 2 around the mgo surface suppressing the dissolution stolzenburg et al 2015 on the other hand the generated oh leads to localized high ph which induces impurity nucleation e g newberyite and bobierrite fig 3 onto the mgo surface also hindering the dissolution of mgo these unwanted precipitations consume mg and p before struvite formation resulting in the uncontrolled deposition on the impellers reactor walls and pipe surfaces therefore if the mgo is dosed without control the struvite content will likely decrease in the final product ideally we want more mg2 released from mgo to form struvite rather than impurity phases previous research shows that mgo dissolution and further precipitations are both thermodynamic and kinetic controlled romero güiza et al 2015 thermodynamically the low ph of wac wastewater impedes the mg oh 2 formation and facilitates the dissolution of the mgo as shown in fig s7a when the ph of mixing tank is below 6 5 p loss of less than 20 is achieved when the inflow p concentration is lower than 2000 mg l kinetically to maximize the mgo dissolution and prevent p loss before entering fbr a direct approach is to control the mixing time by reducing the mixing time from 4 h to 2 h the p loss decreases by 53 8 fig s7b this is probably because that mgo dissolves much faster than impurity formation the reduced mixing time also decreases the solid deposition in the mixing tank since most precipitates are prone to remain in the mixture than adsorbed by tank surfaces 4 1 2 upflow velocity as mentioned earlier upflow velocity is a crucial parameter for the fluidization in fbrs fattah et al 2012 it not only affects the p removal recovery performance and product quality but also influences the operation cost of the system researchers have explored the upflow velocity ranging from 25 mm s ye et al 2016 to 500 cm min that is 83 3 mm s xu et al 2019 it is found that excessive fluidization exhibits drawbacks such as poor p recovery more pellet breakage and high energy consumption therefore lowering the upflow velocity is favorable both technically and economically typically the low upflow velocity in fbr struvite crystallization affects the product quality e g low purity and crushing strength however in this study lowering the upflow velocity from 25 mm s to 15 mm s does not show any adverse effect on struvite quality but remarkably improve the p recovery rate further decreasing upflow velocity to 8 mm s is also explored but the result shows that the p removal rate decreases significantly probably because of the poor mass transfer fig s8 moreover insufficient upflow velocity will cause system blockage because of poor fluidization which may affect the system detrimentally fig s9 therefore in our study 15 mm s is chosen as an effective and economic upflow velocity 4 1 3 circulation mode struvite crystallization process consists of nucleation growth aggregation and particle breakage these stages occur simultaneously but they are influenced by the saturation seeding and hydrodynamic conditions corre et al 2009 kataki et al 2016 normally one or two stages dominate the crystallization process and determine the final product for instance nucleation dominates when system operates at high supersaturation leading to powder products decreasing the supersaturation e g via ph or circulation mode facilitates crystal growth and aggregation ye et al 2014 for wac wastewater supersaturation is generated once the wastewater meets the added chemicals and gradually dissipates with the increase of axial height therefore the generated struvite nuclei grow or aggregate in the upper region of the fbr in our system effluent circulation is used to suppress supersaturation promoting crystal growth and aggregation instead of nucleation when external circulation mode is applied aggregations form in the top section of fbr and descend subsequently when they are heavy enough to resist the force of the upflow ye et al 2018b during the descending process these aggregates form granules via further agglomerating and coating growth ye et al 2018b in contrast in the internal circulation mode aggregates in the fbr are circulated through the pump where strong collision occurs between aggregates and pump impeller leading to particle breakage corre et al 2009 fattah et al 2012 at this situation aggregation stage is significantly weakened and aggregates are prone to disintegrate into single crystals the morphology difference between external and internal mode indicates the importance of the particle breakage during the granulation process which in turn emphasizes the significance of the circulation 4 2 economic aspect as we can see the current struvite based technology shows better economic performance than the routine lime technology it is well known that the struvite based technology will become more cost effective when struvite demonstrates its market value currently several full scale struvite reactors have been successfully implemented but the main driving force is to reduce the cost on maintenance and sludge disposal rather than recovering phosphorous egle et al 2016 although struvite exhibits potential as a fertilizer the low price of phosphate mineral hinders the development of the struvite value chain forrest et al 2008 the situation is further complicated by technical environmental social and legal factors de et al 2018 to date the lack of struvite market is overlooked by researchers willem 2014 so the struvite price is often overestimated by multiplying its nutrient components by their common market values world bank 2016 struvite is generally considered as a promising slow release fertilizer but it has only been approved in denmark and the netherlands iwa 2017 the need for struvite as a slow release fertilizer is much smaller than that for regular fertilizers de et al 2018 one potential application of struvite simply makes it a fertilizer additive before a mature market is established for example in our study the struvite is added to organic fertilizer for the rice cultivation with the price of 500 cny ton likely lower than its real value this creates a cost saving of 4 62 cny m3 nevertheless the struvite market is developing because of the depletion of phosphorous resources a market for secondary recycled phosphates is establishing espp 2011 attempts have been made by applying struvite in heavy metal immobilization wang et al 2020 antibiotic resistance genes amendment li et al 2019c and construction li et al 2019a therefore we expect the increasing struvite demand and price in the further which will lower the cost of the struvite based technology further 4 3 environmental aspect struvite based technology creates less environmental burden than the routine lime technology this originates from its lower chemical and electricity consumption decreased greenhouse gas emission reduced solid waste production rate and the replacement of fertilizer by the recovered struvite since chemical consumption introduces the most environmental burden reducing the chemical usage or applying environmentally benign chemicals may help improving the sustainability of the struvite based treatment it is worth noting that the environmental benefits are currently achieved based on the decreased commercial fertilizer production the benefit may further increase if the fertilizing behavior of the struvite is considered during lca this is because that struvite gradually releases its nutrients which is less likely to leach and runoff than the conventional soluble fertilizer rahman et al 2011 meanwhile the slow release property of struvite helps decreasing the fertilizing frequency leading to reduced diesel consumption and co2 emission and therefore further reduce the environmental burden 5 conclusion we demonstrate the superiority of struvite based technology over the routine lime technology in treating wac wastewater improved p recovery performance less sludge generation better economic performance and enhanced environmental sustainability are achieved based on a 12 m3 d pilot scale system we find that using mgo with mgcl2 supplement is the optimum mg dosing strategy in terms of p removal rate struvite purity and operation cost in addition internal circulation mode exhibits higher p recovery than the external mode but lower granulation ratio i e powder products when integrated with a o process the overall operation cost of internal mode is lower than that of external mode when the wac treatment capacity reaches 500 m3 d life cycle cost analysis shows that a maximum of 31 33 million cyn can be saved during a 20 year lifespan by applying struvite based technology with relative payback period of 2 60 year this economic benefit is resistive to the fluctuation of the chemicals price moreover struvite process with internal mode also exhibit superior environmental benefit because of its less chemicals input i e mgcl2 and naoh the product morphology can be turned between pellet struvite with strong crushing strength by external mode to powder struvite preferred as the fertilizer additives by internal mode the technical economic and environmental evaluation of the struvite technology confirm that it is a promising alternative in solving the bottleneck problems of

17431,design and operation of drinking water treatment plants and associated distribution systems with long residence times are complicated by the formation of regulated disinfection byproducts dbps comprised of total trihalomethanes tthm and five haloacetic acids haa5 treated water dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations the unit processes required to meet those doc concentrations and disinfection strategies e g booster chlorination are the primary design and operational considerations that can require extensive testing or modeling to determine in this study twelve different treated drinking waters were generated at the bench scale using ferric chloride coagulation and granular activated carbon adsorption from four parent raw waters collected from the san juan river representing spring runoff monsoon and low flow events treated drinking waters with doc concentrations of 0 9 1 4 and 1 9 mg l were tested for regulated dbp formation under simulated distribution system sds conditions over residence times as long as 56 days and compared to 7 day formation potential fp testing sds free chlorine concentrations were maintained between 0 2 and 1 0 mg l as cl2 through periodic booster chlorination maximum sds tthm and haa5 concentrations were 0 208 and 0 074 mg l respectively with formation consistently varying by approximately 20 across the four different parent raw waters despite having been treated to the same three doc concentrations an average of four existing tthm models consistently underpredicted tthm formation by approximatively 20 long considered a conservative measure of dbp formation fp testing also underpredicted sds dbp formation at 56 days by approximately 40 on average the dbp testing approach presented in this study allowed for the development of several significant linear relationships for predicting dbp concentrations based on treated water ultraviolet light absorbance at 254 nm water temperature and cumulative free chlorine demand graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction despite relatively recent advances in identifying numerous new and more genotoxic disinfection byproducts dbps resulting from reactions between dissolved organic matter dom halogens and oxidants during drinking water treatment the regulated dbp groups of total trihalomethanes tthm and five haloacetic acids haa5 continue to govern the design and operation of many drinking water treatment plants wtps and distribution systems using treated water tthm and haa5 concentrations as reliable indicators of other non regulated and more toxic dbps is not formally established but regarded as the best available approach from the environmental protection agency epa without burdening drinking water providers with expensive analytical requirements richardson et al 2007 awwa 2011 richardson and plewa 2020 therefore advancements in understanding tthm and haa5 formation under unique conditions and development of new predictive models remain valuable contributions to the field of drinking water treatment one such unique understudied and often overlooked condition related to dbp formation is long distribution system residence times e g 7 days which are relevant for multiple reasons many disadvantaged and rural communities in the united states including native american communities have dispersed populations and yet still rely on centralized wtps inherently creating distribution systems with long residence times for example the navajo nation has a population density of approximately 2 5 people per km2 ndh and nec 2013 and a major infrastructure project is underway to provide part of the navajo nation and other communities with drinking water from centralized wtps usbr 2020 it is imperative that these communities are provided straightforward and autonomous approaches for evaluating dbp formation such as those presented in this study to ensure the delivery of the same safe and regulation compliant drinking water as communities with shorter distribution system residence times as for those systems with shorter residence times a recent survey of drinking water providers conducted by the american water works association awwa 2018 found that 15 of participants responded with maximum distribution system residence times longer than 10 days whereas most 59 participants responded with less than 5 days n 256 responses these responses likely did not include premise plumbing residence times which can also be significant and highly variable regardless these shorter residence time survey results agree with the majority of dbp formation methods and studies to date with residence or hold times of 1 7 days for formation potential fp testing standard method 5710b apha et al 2017 2 1 day for uniform formation conditions ufc testing summers et al 1996 3 7 days or less for predictive model boundaries amy et al 1987 westerhoff et al 2002 epa 2005 and 4 7 days or less for various other dbp studies clark and sivaganesan 1998 gang et al 2002 hua and reckhow 2008 roccaro et al 2008 only a few studies or predictive models have evaluated tthm formation only not haa5 at residence times longer than 7 days gallard and von gunten 2002 obolensky and singer 2008 gallard and von gunten 2002 focused mainly on tthm formation kinetics after spiking mostly untreated waters with relatively high free chlorine doses 10 mg l as cl2 while the maximum residence time was uniquely long at approximately 21 days it was based solely on reaching a tthm formation plateau after single high chlorine doses to target 20 to 100 in excess of the free chlorine demand obolensky and singer 2008 evaluated information collection rule icr data with a maximum residence time of 31 days but this value is somewhat misleading as the mean and median values from icr data used to develop their tthm predictive model were 15 5 and 8 2 h respectively other than applicability to short residence times only limitations of current predictive models also include the large number of variables that influence dbp formation such as bromide br concentration chlorine dose dissolved organic carbon doc concentration ph and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uva254 among others documented in a review by chowdhury et al 2009 as well as large initial chlorine doses instead of periodic booster chlorination accordingly it is difficult for drinking water providers especially those in rural communities with long residence times and potentially multiple booster chlorination locations to predict dbp formation that could inform wtp and distribution system design and operation a simpler approach is predicting dbp formation as solely a function of chlorine demand cd because it includes chlorine consumption required for dbp formation and is also a function of previously mentioned variables e g doc such an approach has been successful in studies without booster chlorination singer et al 1995 clark and sivaganesan 1998 el shafy and grunwald 2000 gang et al 2002 roccaro et al 2008 with booster chlorination boccelli et al 2003 and unsuccessful for others westerhoff et al 2000 no studies have extended the cd dbp relationship for residence times greater than 7 days therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate tthm and haa5 formation over residence times as long as 56 days and 2 predict tthm and haa5 formation as a function of free cd fcd considering the latter is likely to be system specific the objective pertains more broadly to the approach and linear model form of using fcd for predicting tthm and haa5 formation as opposed to the specific model coefficients determined for the waters in this study a total of twelve different conventionally treated waters were tested using coagulation and granular activated carbon gac adsorption for dom removal raw surface water from the same source was collected four times during seasonal events such as spring runoff to generate the treated waters

aromatic dom of low to high molecular weight awwa 2011 each parent raw water was subjected to coagulation and gac treatment at the bench scale to create treated waters with three different doc

initially targeted but testing resulted in 32 doc removal for water 1 raw 2 8 mg l coagulated 1 9 mg l therefore for water 1 and all subsequent testing the target h doc concentration was 1 9 mg l independent of regulatory doc removal requirements target m doc and l doc concentrations were then chosen based on 0 5 mg l increments or 1 4 and 0 9 mg l respectively actual doc concentrations are shown in table 1 with other relevant water quality parameters by maintaining the same treated water doc concentrations for h doc m doc and l doc across all parent raw waters dbp formation was normalized for the effect of doc concentration this allowed for dbp formation to be evaluated as a function of dom character defined by the easily measured uva254 and calculated suva254 shown in table

sds herein all testing used chlorine demand free amber glassware that was washed with tap water deionized water 16 mω cm and soaked in chlorinated deionized water 10 mg l as cl2 for several days prior to immediate use glassware was rinsed again with deionized water and the specific treated water waters were maintained at either a low or high temperature averaging 10 1 and 22 1 c respectively then sampled and analyzed for dbp formation after hold times of 1 h 7 days 14 days 28 days 49 days and 56 days initially approximately 7 l of h doc m doc or l doc water in a 20 l hdpe container was spiked

checking free chlorine residual in between specified sample times for the next 8 weeks free chlorine concentration was measured and boosted for all bottles as necessary to maintain a target free chlorine residual between 0 2 and 1 0 mg l as cl2 typical for drinking water distribution systems awwa 2018 fp tests were performed with each water according to standard method 5710b apha et al 2017 to facilitate a more fair dbp formation comparison of fp to sds fp tests were performed at a ph of 8 0 0 2 and low and high temperatures of 10 1 and 23 2 respectively instead of standard values of 7 0

byproduct formation and free chlorine demand tthm and haa5 formation were modeled as a function of cumulative free chlorine demand or fcd similar to prior studies dbp formation was evaluated over an initial rapid phase followed by a longer slow phase westerhoff et al 2000 gallard and von gunten 2002 gang et al 2002 westerhoff et al 2004 herein the rapid phase was defined as primary disinfection and the slow phase as secondary disinfection to coincide with typical drinking water treatment designations specifically for tthm same for haa5 concentrations the two phases were established by eq 1 1 t t h m t o t t t h m p r i t t h m s e c where tthmtot is the total concentration mg l tthmpri is the concentration mg l formed during primary disinfection i e in the wtp and tthmsec is the

value for a i free chlorine measurement ii free chlorine boost or iii sample event where t 0 represents both the end of primary disinfection and start of secondary disinfection and as such csec 0 cpri tthm and haa5 concentration total primary or secondary can then be evaluated as a function of fcd total primary or secondary and a simple linear predictive model of the form shown in eq 3 could be developed and implemented for wtp startup and operations 3 t t h m a f c d b where a and b are empirical coefficients similar to models developed by clark and sivaganesan 1998 and boccelli et al 2003 3 results and discussion 3 1 disinfection byproduct formation tthmtot concentrations as a function of residence time are shown in fig 1 for all h doc m doc and l doc waters as expected tthmtot concentrations were higher than haa5tot concentrations because of the higher ph chowdhury et al 2009 awwa 2011 brown et al 2011 crittenden et al 2012 and were thus the focus of analysis herein but haa5tot trends were similar figure sm1 through figure sm3 for a sense of the time scale the vertical dashed line in fig 1 highlights the long residence times in this study relative to the typical maximum of 7 days only one treated water of the 12 was above the regulatory tthm limit of 0 080 mg l at the higher temperature after 7 days whereas 10 of 12 higher temperature waters were above 0 080 mg l tthm after 56 days this difference demonstrates the greater difficulty in selecting processes to achieve required treated water doc concentrations for longer distribution residence times which is also complicated by seasonal dom precursor variation for the same doc concentration tthmtot concentrations increased with residence time doc concentration and temperature in the characteristic power function form with relatively rapid formation rates 7 days followed by relatively slow formation rates 7 days as dom precursors were slowly exhausted maximum tthmtot concentrations were 0 208 49 days

and 0 031 mg l all at 56 days for high temperature h doc w1 m doc w1 and l doc w1 waters respectively by comparison higher dbp concentrations than those observed in this study have frequently been observed at much shorter residence times under mostly realistic chlorination scenarios summers et al 1996 gang et al 2002 hua and reckhow 2008 roccaro et al 2008 awwa 2011 in terms of dbp formation kinetics reaction rates can generally be viewed as either dom precursor or chlorine limited brown et al 2007 awwa 2011 dom reactivity was quantified by specific tthm yields or mg of tthm formed per mg of doc tthmtot concentrations were interpolated at 1 day using power function fits to high temperature tthmtot formation curves to allow for direct comparisons to literature ufc values the average specific yield across all high temperature waters was 0 021 0 002 tthm mg doc which is slightly on the lower end but within typical ufc ranges of approximately 0 010 to 0 060 mg tthm mg doc for surface waters and groundwaters summers et al 1996 awwa 2011 this comparison indicates the waters in this study had relatively lower dom reactivity or dbp precursor concentrations free chlorine concentrations were also relatively low compared to other studies that used high one time doses e g 4 mg l as cl2 low free chlorine concentrations e g 1 mg l as cl2 could also have decreased tthmtot formation rates due to free chlorine concentration proportionality to tthm formation rates gallard and von gunten 2002 therefore tthmtot concentrations were likely not as high as one might expect from such long residence times because the tested waters had relatively low dom reactivity or dbp precursor concentrations in combination with low free chlorine concentrations as demonstrated by the data in fig 1 there were minor to no discernable trends between tthmtot concentrations and seasonal events identified in table 1 for each raw water consistent with the findings of others when normalized for doc summers et al 1996 gallard and von gunten 2002 uyak et al 2008 in other words the hierarchy of tthmtot concentrations at each sample time were not the same although high temperature w1 spring runoff did consistently produce the highest tthmtot concentrations while w4 monsoon event m doc fig 1b and l doc fig 1c waters consistently produced the lowest tthmtot concentrations these waters did have the highest and lowest suva254 values respectively but this trend did not hold across all waters at each time point confirming suva254 is not always a reliable predictor of tthm precursors archer and singer 2006 awwa 2011 hua et al 2015 more important than the lack of seasonal trends and even after normalizing for doc concentration through coagulation and gac treatment tthmtot concentrations and specific yields considering doc concentrations were the same varied by approximately 20 as shown by the dashed lines in fig 1 as previously noted the average rsd a surrogate measure of experimental variability for 1 week duplicate tthm samples was 2 1 indicating much of the variability between waters shown in fig 1 was a function of variable dom precursors these findings are relevant to drinking water providers and design engineers for several reasons at different times of the year dbp formation could fluctuate significantly despite achieving the same treated water doc in this case easily measured water quality parameters such as treated water uva254 and temperature can be used as one approach for predicting or anticipating relative increases or decreases in dbp formation for example significant linear relationships between tthmpri concentrations and uva254 suva254 relationships were relatively weak were observed shown in fig 2 for the high and low temperature waters and are similar to those observed by others gallard and von gunten 2002 archer and singer 2006 the regression from gallard and von gunten 2002 is also shown in fig 2 for comparison representing tthm formation within the first 3 h after chlorination designated as initial trihalomethane formation potential thmfpi such relationships based on uva254 could be expected because the parameter quantifies dom aromaticity and conjugated carbon to carbon double bonds that serve as attractive sites for free chlorine oxidation resulting in dbp formation awwa 2011 combining high 22 c and low 10 c temperature data resulted in an overall more robust relationship between tthmpri uva254 and water temperature tw shown in eq 4 r2 0 83 r2 adj 0 82 r2 pred 0 78 p 0 05 n 24 with 95 confidence intervals on the coefficients a parallel relationship was also found for haa5pri shown in eq 5 r2 0 89 r2 adj 0 88 r2 pred 0 86 p 0 05 n 24 with 95 confidence intervals on the coefficients 4 t t h m p r i 0 27 0 088 u v a 254 3 8 e 4 1 5 e 4 t w 0 0042 0 0031 5 h a a 5 p r i 0 26 0 048 u v a 254 1 1 e 4 8 4 e 5 t w 0 0031 0 0018 where residual versus fitted value and normal probability plots demonstrated randomly and normally distributed residuals for both relationships eqs 4 and 5 have nearly identical coefficients for uva254 indicating the parameter captured both tthmpri and haa5pri dom precursors also observed by others hua and reckhow 2008 haa5pri formation was less sensitive to temperature based on the 3 5 times smaller coefficient compared to tthmpri as shown by the comparison with the regression from gallard and von gunten 2002 in fig 2 it is likely such relationships would be specific to treated drinking water leaving each wtp assuming treatment of relatively consistent source water quality consequently although the approach of using uva254 and tw should be widely applicable caution should be exercised when using the specific relationships identified by eqs 4 or 5 for predicting tthmpri and haa5pri concentrations although there is not always the possibility of performing a dbp formation study prior to wtp or distribution system design or modifications several tests are recommended to capture the seasonal variability shown in fig 1 if dbp formation studies are not an option and predictive models must be used without comparisons to actual data accuracy cannot reasonably be expected to be better than 20 a metric that has been used by others for predictive model validation amy et al 1987 3 2 comparisons to existing models despite the known time constraints of existing dbp formation models measured tthmtot concentrations were compared to predictions from four existing tthm models developed by amy et al 1987 westerhoff et al 2002 epa 2005 and obolensky and singer 2008 to establish their applicability if any these specific models were chosen due to their relevance for systems that use free chlorine with independent model variables of doc uva254 br temperature chlorine dose and ph similar to other models chowdhury et al 2009 these models have maximum residence time boundary conditions ranging from 4 to 31 days for amy et al 1987 and obolensky and singer 2008 molar concentration predictions were converted to mass concentrations using a weighted average based on the average tthm speciation tthm species tthmtot which in this study was 0 6 for chloroform 0 3 for bromodichloromethane 0 1 for dibromochloromethane 0 0 for bromoform i e tthm weighted average molar mass of 140 mg mmol for epa 2005 equation 5 143 for h doc waters and 5 154 for m doc and l doc waters in cited reference tthmpri concentrations were divided by a recommended 0 77 correction factor based on icr data no special modifications were required for the westerhoff et al 2002 case iv in cited reference model for all model predictions input br concentrations were assumed to be half of the mrl or 0 005 mg l comparisons between predicted and measured tthmtot concentrations are shown in fig 3 a with the previously justified 20 dashed lines around the 1 1 line tthmtot concentration predictions varied widely well outside 20 even at lower concentrations 0 020 mg l fig 3 inset predictions were bracketed on the lower end by the obolensky and singer 2008 model and on the upper end by the westerhoff et al 2002 model these results demonstrate that ultimately bench scale dbp formation testing is superior to predictions from individual models to collectively evaluate the four models predictions were averaged and are shown in fig 3b with standard deviation error bars the trend in fig 3b shows a consistent under prediction which would be expected based on the shorter residence times used to develop the models coincidentally a trendline fitted to the data in fig 3b with the intercept set to zero yielded a slope of 0 795 r2 0 91 directly overlapping with the 20 line note slope was 0 85 with br taken as the mrl or 0 010 mg l in this case the average predictions would then be acceptable based on the established 20 range therefore for long residence time scenarios a correction factor of 0 8 applied to the average of predictions from several existing tthm models may provide more accurate projections than uncorrected individual model predictions 3 3 disinfection byproduct formation and free chlorine demand fcdtot closely tracked tthmtot and haa5tot formation during testing tthmtot and haa5tot concentrations could be reasonably estimated before obtaining analytical results based solely on free chlorine measurements observed relationships between tthmtot and haa5tot concentrations and fcdtot are shown in fig 4 a and 4b respectively and are similar to relationships observed by singer et al 1995 el shafy and grunwald 2000 and boccelli et al 2003 all waters exhibited essentially the same slope mg dbp formed per mg free chlorine consumed but with different fcdpri values especially for w3 low flow it would be expected that fcdpri would vary with time due to source water quality changes particularly related to dissolved species that react with free chlorine well within time scales associated with primary disinfection the most common example of such a demand is from ammonia ammonium nh3 nh4 in fig 4 the w3 low flow fcdpri was relatively high explained in part by an ammonia concentration table 1 that was at least 2 3 times higher than the other waters 0 07 vs 0 03 mg l as n ammonia may have originated from an upstream wastewater treatment plant discharge that had a higher impact under low flow conditions due to less san juan river flow being available for point source dilution therefore a model using solely fcdtot cannot be expected to provide accurate or mechanistically sound predictions due to initial demands from dissolved species that do not lead to dbp formation westerhoff et al 2000 however as previously discussed it does represent an opportunity for developing a simple predictive dbp model based solely on fcdsec as opposed to the multi parameter models previously discussed in relation to fig 3 continuing the discussion presented in section 2 4 a predictive model for tthmsec and haa5sec was developed based on fcdsec to eliminate dependence on fcdpri following eqs 1 and 2 and perhaps more importantly because most dbp formation occurs during secondary disinfection as distribution system residence times increase in this study tthmpri concentrations represented only 8 1 on average of tthmtot concentrations for all waters by subtracting tthmpri and haa5pri concentrations from tthmtot and haa5tot concentrations respectively and fcdpri from fcdtot all data collapsed onto a single line the results were strong r2 0 8 and significant p 0 05 linear relationships shown in fig 5 regression equations are shown in fig 5 but also in more detail in eq 6 r2 0 93 r2 adj 0 93 r2 pred 0 93 p 0 05 n 120 and eq 7 r2 0 88 r2 adj 0 88 r2 pred 0 88 p 0 05 n 119 respectively with 95 confidence intervals on the coefficients 6 t t h m s e c 0 053 0 0030 f c d s e c 0 013 0 0048 7 h a a 5 s e c 0 015 0 0011 f c d s e c 0 0010 0 0018 where residual versus fitted value and normal probability plots demonstrated randomly and normally distributed residuals the intercept in eq 6 was significant did not intersect the origin and the intercept in eq 7 was not significant intersected the origin for eq 6 the intercept is conceptually confusing but such is the nature of empirical relationships and lower tthmsec concentrations could have justified an alternative non linear fit also suggested by boccelli et al 2003 however due to its attractive simplicity a linear relationship for both tthmsec and haa5sec was deemed more favorable and yielded strong significant relationships every model is not without limitations however starting with the boundary conditions shown in table 2 and as such caution should be exercised in extending eqs 6 and 7 to other scenarios as with eqs 4 and 5 beyond the boundary conditions a major limitation is that although twelve different treated waters were used to develop eqs 6 and 7 they originated from the same seasonally variable collection point on the san juan river even so in terms of dom concentration i e doc character i e suva254 and reactivity i e specific yield there is nothing unique about the source water san juan river and subsequent treatments coagulation and gac that would preclude it from being considered of typical raw and treated water quality awwa 2011 as the data in fig 3 and related discussion have shown four existing predictive models developed with a vast number of source waters and treatment conditions are not guaranteed to provide reliable predictions even when applied within their own boundary conditions i e fig 3 inset such is a major reason for the continued development of new and simpler predictive dbp models for the models presented herein external validation is certainly needed but difficult to ascertain due to lack of published extended residence time dbp studies that also provide data to confidently apply eqs 6 and 7 e g fcdpri tthmpri in can be reasonably expected that relationships based on fcdsec would also be system specific because of differences in bulk water fcd fcdbulk from dissolved constituents e g dom as well as differences in fcdsec from distribution system pipe walls biofilms tank walls sediment and fittings fcdwall these wall demands do not result in dbp formation and can be quite significant brown et al 2007 following this logic fcdsec in fig 5 eqs 6 and 7 is more accurately secondary fcdbulk fcd dbp relationships in eqs 6 and 7 can serve as a starting point and with system specific coefficient tuning demonstrate the applicability of the fcd approach outlined in this study which is that robust system specific relationships can be established using easily measured free chlorine concentrations at both the wtp and within the distribution system by contrast measurements for doc and br that are required for current prediction models can be difficult to obtain in real time for many utilities in addition to the absence of predictive models developed specifically for long residence times once a system specific relationship is established through quantifying primary and secondary dbp formation in addition to fcdpri secondary fcdbulk and secondary fcdwall simple free chlorine decay and booster testing can be conducted in most wtp laboratories to predict distribution system dbp concentrations and adjust operations accordingly in real time coagulant dose gac ebct gac replacement in tank aeration systems etc in conjunction with eqs 4 and 5 eqs 6 and 7 could also be used to establish system specific maximum free chlorine doses at the wtp to ensure epa tthm and haa5 maximum contaminant levels of 0 080 and 0 060 mg l respectively would not be exceeded in the distribution system 3 4 comparisons to formation potential fp testing is widely interpreted to provide conservative estimates of dbp formation due to relatively high chlorine concentrations high temperature and long residence time compared to ufc summers et al 1996 crittenden et al 2012 apha et al 2017 considering the sds residence times in this study were much longer than the fp standard of 7 days there was a unique opportunity to compare the two shown in fig 6 a and b for tthm and haa5 respectively as a note the subscripts used thus far e g tot for total were not used for fp concentrations because primary and secondary delineations are not relevant to the method at 1 week sds tthmtot and haa5tot concentrations correlated closely with fp tthm and haa5 concentrations more specifically linear regression dashed lines in fig 6 coefficients 95 confidence intervals were 1 16 0 22 and 0 90 0 27 for slopes and 0 00023 0 010 and 0 0025 0 0054 for intercepts for tthm and haa5 respectively therefore there was no difference between sds and fp concentrations at 1 week as the regressions were not significantly different from a 1 1 relationship at the 95 confidence level dbp speciation between the sds and fp tests was nearly identical and dominated by chloroform 52 to 80 of tthmtot and dichloroacetic acid 42 to 78 of haa5tot similar dbp concentrations between sds and fp tests indicate dbp formation was not limited by free chlorine concentrations but by dom precursors or more measurably doc concentrations at least within the first week while fp conditions were modified from the standard method the results still indicate that fp testing may not always provide conservative estimates of dbp concentrations in fact fp tthm concentrations might have been even lower at the method specified ph of 7 for the 8 week comparison sds tthmtot and haa5tot concentrations were considerably higher than fp tthm and haa5 concentrations fp concentrations were only 56 tthm and 58 haa5 on average of the 8 week sds concentrations these results indicate fp testing may not be appropriate for estimating dbp concentrations for long residence times and that while they decrease with exposure time to free chlorine dom precursors can persist for long periods of time even in the presence of low free chlorine concentrations 0 2 to 1 0 mg l as cl2 a further comparison of sds and fp testing is shown in table 3 where tthmtot and haa5tot concentrations were normalized by fcdtot and averaged across each treated water doc i e h doc m doc and l doc to obtain aggregate values in more explicit terms the ratios or values in table 3 represent the mg of tthmtot or haa5tot formed per mg of free chlorine consumed essentially a dbp yield in terms of fcd that has also been used by others gallard and von gunten 2002 gang et al 2002 dbp fcd yields ranged from 0 023 to 0 038 mg tthm mg cl2 and 0 008 to 0 015 mg haa5 mg cl2 similar to the treated water average values of 0 030 mg tthm mg cl2 and 0 017 mg haa9 mg cl2 observed by gang et al 2002 there was not a consistent statistical difference at the 95 confidence level between sds 1 and 8 weeks and fp dbp fcd yields using tukey s test as identified by letters in table 3 but fp values were consistently lower than sds values tthm and haa5 formation from dom precursors is a complex combination of sequential oxidation substitution and hydrolysis reactions hua and reckhow 2008 awwa 2011 while neither the sds or fp tests in this study were designed to elucidate or isolate those reaction pathways these results indicate that compared to sds testing realistic chlorination fp testing unrealistic chlorination resulted in more destructive dom precursor oxidation reactions and less substitution hydrolysis reactions required for tthm and haa5 formation while oxidation reduction potential orp was not measured for any water the differences in free chlorine residuals between sds and fp tests likely resulted in significant differences in orp or degree of an oxidizing environment for example free chlorine residual concentrations of 0 2 mg l as cl2 sds lower end and 3 0 mg l as cl2 fp lower end can yield significant differences in orp approximately 400 and 700 mv respectively at ph 8 copeland and lytle 2014 therefore as with the discussion related to fig 6 fp testing may underestimate tthm and haa5 concentrations by unrealistically increasing dom oxidation reactions that do not necessarily result in their formation 4 conclusions both tthmtot and haa5tot concentrations varied by approximately 20 over the four parent raw waters from different collection events one spring runoff one low flow two monsoons despite having been treated to the same three doc concentrations four existing and well established tthm models predicted a wide range of concentrations for the conditions in this study and when averaged together they underpredicted sds dbp formation by approximately 20 alternative linear regression models for predicting primary and secondary dbp concentrations based solely on uva254 tw and fcdsec were developed demonstrating that while such relationships are likely to be system specific the approach in their development is straightforward and could be useful for implementing seasonal or real time operational changes at wtps and in distribution systems future work could also validate or verify these developed predictive models fp testing underestimated sds tthmtot and haa5tot concentrations at 8 weeks by approximately 40 altogether this study provides useful approaches to predicting dbp formation in drinking water

17431,design and operation of drinking water treatment plants and associated distribution systems with long residence times are complicated by the formation of regulated disinfection byproducts dbps comprised of total trihalomethanes tthm and five haloacetic acids haa5 treated water dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations the unit processes required to meet those doc concentrations and disinfection strategies e g booster chlorination are the primary design and operational considerations that can require extensive testing or modeling to determine in this study twelve different treated drinking waters were generated at the bench scale using ferric chloride coagulation and granular activated carbon adsorption from four parent raw waters collected from the san juan river representing spring runoff monsoon and low flow events treated drinking waters with doc concentrations of 0 9 1 4 and 1 9 mg l were tested for regulated dbp formation under simulated distribution system sds conditions over residence times as long as 56 days and compared to 7 day formation potential fp testing sds free chlorine concentrations were maintained between 0 2 and 1 0 mg l as cl2 through periodic booster chlorination maximum sds tthm and haa5 concentrations were 0 208 and 0 074 mg l respectively with formation consistently varying by approximately 20 across the four different parent raw waters despite having been treated to the same three doc concentrations an average of four existing tthm models consistently underpredicted tthm formation by approximatively 20 long considered a conservative measure of dbp formation fp testing also underpredicted sds dbp formation at 56 days by approximately 40 on average the dbp testing approach presented in this study allowed for the development of several significant linear relationships for predicting dbp concentrations based on treated water ultraviolet light absorbance at 254 nm water temperature and cumulative free chlorine demand graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction despite relatively recent advances in identifying numerous new and more genotoxic disinfection byproducts dbps resulting from reactions between dissolved organic matter dom halogens and oxidants during drinking water treatment the regulated dbp groups of total trihalomethanes tthm and five haloacetic acids haa5 continue to govern the design and operation of many drinking water treatment plants wtps and distribution systems using treated water tthm and haa5 concentrations as reliable indicators of other non regulated and more toxic dbps is not formally established but regarded as the best available approach from the environmental protection agency epa without burdening drinking water providers with expensive analytical requirements richardson et al 2007 awwa 2011 richardson and plewa 2020 therefore advancements in understanding tthm and haa5 formation under unique conditions and development of new predictive models remain valuable contributions to the field of drinking water treatment one such unique understudied and often overlooked condition related to dbp formation is long distribution system residence times e g 7 days which are relevant for multiple reasons many disadvantaged and rural communities in the united states including native american communities have dispersed populations and yet still rely on centralized wtps inherently creating distribution systems with long residence times for example the navajo nation has a population density of approximately 2 5 people per km2 ndh and nec 2013 and a major infrastructure project is underway to provide part of the navajo nation and other communities with drinking water from centralized wtps usbr 2020 it is imperative that these communities are provided straightforward and autonomous approaches for evaluating dbp formation such as those presented in this study to ensure the delivery of the same safe and regulation compliant drinking water as communities with shorter distribution system residence times as for those systems with shorter residence times a recent survey of drinking water providers conducted by the american water works association awwa 2018 found that 15 of participants responded with maximum distribution system residence times longer than 10 days whereas most 59 participants responded with less than 5 days n 256 responses these responses likely did not include premise plumbing residence times which can also be significant and highly variable regardless these shorter residence time survey results agree with the majority of dbp formation methods and studies to date with residence or hold times of 1 7 days for formation potential fp testing standard method 5710b apha et al 2017 2 1 day for uniform formation conditions ufc testing summers et al 1996 3 7 days or less for predictive model boundaries amy et al 1987 westerhoff et al 2002 epa 2005 and 4 7 days or less for various other dbp studies clark and sivaganesan 1998 gang et al 2002 hua and reckhow 2008 roccaro et al 2008 only a few studies or predictive models have evaluated tthm formation only not haa5 at residence times longer than 7 days gallard and von gunten 2002 obolensky and singer 2008 gallard and von gunten 2002 focused mainly on tthm formation kinetics after spiking mostly untreated waters with relatively high free chlorine doses 10 mg l as cl2 while the maximum residence time was uniquely long at approximately 21 days it was based solely on reaching a tthm formation plateau after single high chlorine doses to target 20 to 100 in excess of the free chlorine demand obolensky and singer 2008 evaluated information collection rule icr data with a maximum residence time of 31 days but this value is somewhat misleading as the mean and median values from icr data used to develop their tthm predictive model were 15 5 and 8 2 h respectively other than applicability to short residence times only limitations of current predictive models also include the large number of variables that influence dbp formation such as bromide br concentration chlorine dose dissolved organic carbon doc concentration ph and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uva254 among others documented in a review by chowdhury et al 2009 as well as large initial chlorine doses instead of periodic booster chlorination accordingly it is difficult for drinking water providers especially those in rural communities with long residence times and potentially multiple booster chlorination locations to predict dbp formation that could inform wtp and distribution system design and operation a simpler approach is predicting dbp formation as solely a function of chlorine demand cd because it includes chlorine consumption required for dbp formation and is also a function of previously mentioned variables e g doc such an approach has been successful in studies without booster chlorination singer et al 1995 clark and sivaganesan 1998 el shafy and grunwald 2000 gang et al 2002 roccaro et al 2008 with booster chlorination boccelli et al 2003 and unsuccessful for others westerhoff et al 2000 no studies have extended the cd dbp relationship for residence times greater than 7 days therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate tthm and haa5 formation over residence times as long as 56 days and 2 predict tthm and haa5 formation as a function of free cd fcd considering the latter is likely to be system specific the objective pertains more broadly to the approach and linear model form of using fcd for predicting tthm and haa5 formation as opposed to the specific model coefficients determined for the waters in this study a total of twelve different conventionally treated waters were tested using coagulation and granular activated carbon gac adsorption for dom removal raw surface water from the same source was collected four times during seasonal events such as spring runoff to generate the treated waters

independent of regulatory doc removal requirements target m doc and l doc concentrations were then chosen based on 0 5 mg l increments or 1 4 and 0 9 mg l respectively actual doc concentrations are shown in table 1 with other relevant water quality parameters by maintaining the same treated water doc concentrations for h doc m doc and l doc across all parent raw waters dbp formation was normalized for the effect of doc concentration this allowed for dbp formation to be evaluated as a function of dom character defined by the easily measured uva254 and calculated suva254 shown in table

with a predetermined dose of a combined boric acid h3bo3 and sodium hydroxide naoh solution to buffer ph to an overall average value of 8 1 0 1 within the ufc value range of 8 0 0 2 buffer addition was followed by a predetermined dose of a combined boric acid and sodium hypochlorite naocl solution with a stock strength of approximately 2500 mg l as cl2 all chemicals were reagent grade fisher scientific watham ma a free chlorine residual of approximately 1 0 mg l as cl2 after 1 h was targeted typical for treated water leaving a clearwell awwa 2018 this combination of free chlorine concentration c 1 0 mg l as cl2 and contact time t 60 min represents a ct value of 60 min mg l which is sufficient for 90 and 99 1 and 2 log giardia cyst inactivation at 10 and 20 c respectively and ph 8 epa 1999 initial free chlorine doses ranged from 1 2 to 2 7 mg l as cl2 with the first hour simulating primary disinfection water was well mixed during buffer and sodium hypochlorite addition using a stir plate and bar for 1 min then allowed to sit covered without mixing for 1 h and sampled for dbps the remaining water was then poured into chlorine demand free 500 ml amber glass bottles headspace free with one bottle prepared for each hold time and duplicate bottles for the 1 week sample several chlorine demand free 125 ml amber glass bottles were also filled headspace free for checking free chlorine residual in between specified sample times for the next 8 weeks free chlorine concentration was measured and boosted for all bottles as necessary to maintain a target free chlorine residual between 0 2 and 1 0 mg l as cl2 typical for drinking water distribution systems awwa 2018 fp tests were performed with each water according to standard method 5710b apha et al 2017 to facilitate a more fair dbp formation comparison of fp to sds fp tests were performed at a ph of 8 0 0 2 and low and high temperatures of 10 1 and 23 2 respectively instead of standard values of 7 0

spectrophotometer dr6000 hach bromide br concentrations were measured according to epa method 300 0 and were found to be less than the mrl 0 010 mg l in all raw waters table 1 2 4 disinfection byproduct formation and free chlorine demand tthm and haa5 formation were modeled as a function of cumulative free chlorine demand or fcd similar to prior studies dbp formation was evaluated over an initial rapid phase followed by a longer slow phase westerhoff et al 2000 gallard and von gunten 2002 gang et al 2002 westerhoff et al 2004 herein the rapid phase was defined as primary disinfection and the slow phase as secondary disinfection to coincide with typical drinking water treatment designations specifically for tthm same for haa5 concentrations the two phases were established by eq 1 1 t t h m t o t t t h m p r i t t h m s e c where tthmtot is the total concentration mg l tthmpri is the concentration mg l formed during primary disinfection i e in the wtp and tthmsec is the concentration mg l formed during secondary disinfection i e in the distribution system the same distinction was made for fcd mg l as cl2 as defined by eq 2 2 f c d t o t f c d p r i f c d s e c d p r

tthm and haa5 concentration total primary or secondary can then be evaluated as a function of fcd total primary or secondary and a simple linear predictive model of the form shown in eq 3 could be developed and implemented for wtp startup and operations 3 t t h m a f c d b where a and b are empirical coefficients similar to models developed by clark and sivaganesan 1998 and boccelli et al 2003 3 results and discussion 3 1 disinfection byproduct formation tthmtot concentrations as a function of residence time are shown in fig 1 for all h doc m doc and l doc waters as expected tthmtot concentrations were higher than haa5tot concentrations because of the higher ph chowdhury et al 2009 awwa 2011 brown et al 2011 crittenden et al 2012 and were thus the focus of analysis herein but haa5tot trends were similar figure sm1 through figure sm3 for a sense of the time scale the vertical dashed line in fig 1 highlights the long residence times in this study relative to the typical maximum of 7 days only one treated water of the 12 was above the regulatory tthm limit of 0 080 mg l at the higher temperature after 7 days whereas 10 of 12 higher temperature waters were above 0 080 mg l tthm after 56 days this difference demonstrates the greater difficulty in selecting processes to achieve required treated water doc concentrations for longer distribution residence times which is also complicated by seasonal dom precursor variation for the same doc concentration tthmtot concentrations increased with residence time doc concentration and temperature in the characteristic power function form with relatively rapid formation rates 7 days followed by relatively slow formation rates 7 days as dom precursors were slowly exhausted maximum tthmtot concentrations were 0 208 49 days 0 169 56 days and 0 102 56 days mg l for high temperature h doc w1 spring runoff m doc w2 monsoon event and l doc w1 spring runoff waters respectively maximum haa5tot concentrations were 0 074 0 047 and 0 031 mg l all at 56 days for high temperature h doc w1 m doc w1 and l doc w1 waters respectively by comparison higher dbp concentrations than those observed in this study have frequently been observed at much shorter residence times under mostly realistic chlorination scenarios summers et al 1996 gang et al 2002 hua and reckhow 2008 roccaro et al 2008 awwa 2011 in terms of dbp formation kinetics reaction rates can generally be viewed as either dom precursor or chlorine limited brown et al 2007 awwa 2011 dom reactivity was quantified by specific tthm yields or mg of tthm formed per mg of doc tthmtot concentrations were interpolated at 1 day using power function fits to high temperature tthmtot formation curves to allow for direct comparisons to literature ufc values the average specific yield across all high temperature waters was 0 021 0 002 tthm mg doc which is slightly on the lower end but within typical ufc ranges of approximately 0 010 to 0 060 mg tthm mg doc for surface waters and groundwaters summers et al 1996 awwa 2011 this comparison indicates the waters in this study had relatively lower dom reactivity or dbp precursor concentrations free chlorine concentrations were also relatively low compared to other studies that used high one time doses e g 4 mg l as cl2 low free chlorine concentrations e g 1 mg l as cl2 could also have decreased tthmtot formation rates due to free chlorine concentration proportionality to tthm formation rates gallard and von gunten 2002 therefore tthmtot concentrations were likely not as high as one might expect from such long residence times because the tested waters had relatively low dom reactivity or dbp precursor concentrations in combination with low free chlorine concentrations as demonstrated by the data in fig 1 there were minor to no discernable trends between tthmtot concentrations and seasonal events identified in table 1 for each raw water consistent with the findings of others when normalized for doc summers et al 1996 gallard and von gunten 2002 uyak et al 2008 in other words the hierarchy of tthmtot concentrations at each sample time were not the same although high temperature w1 spring runoff did consistently produce the highest tthmtot concentrations while w4 monsoon event m doc fig 1b and l doc fig 1c waters consistently produced the lowest tthmtot concentrations these waters did have the highest and lowest suva254 values respectively but this trend did not hold across all waters at each time point confirming suva254 is not always a reliable predictor of tthm precursors archer and singer 2006 awwa 2011 hua et al 2015 more important than the lack of seasonal trends and even after normalizing for doc concentration through coagulation and gac treatment tthmtot concentrations and specific yields considering doc concentrations were the same varied by approximately 20 as shown by the dashed lines in fig 1 as previously noted the average rsd a surrogate measure of experimental variability for 1 week duplicate tthm samples was 2 1 indicating much of the variability between waters shown in fig 1 was a function of variable dom precursors these findings are relevant to drinking water providers and design engineers for several reasons at different times of the year dbp formation could fluctuate significantly despite achieving the same treated water doc in this case easily measured water quality parameters such as treated water uva254 and temperature can be used as one approach for predicting or anticipating relative increases or decreases in dbp formation for example significant linear relationships between tthmpri concentrations and uva254 suva254 relationships were relatively weak were observed shown in fig 2 for the high and low temperature waters and are similar to those observed by others gallard and von gunten 2002 archer and singer 2006 the regression from gallard and von gunten 2002 is also shown in fig 2 for comparison representing tthm formation within the first 3 h after chlorination designated as initial trihalomethane formation potential thmfpi such relationships based on uva254 could be expected because the parameter quantifies dom aromaticity and conjugated carbon to carbon double bonds that serve as attractive sites for free chlorine oxidation resulting in dbp formation awwa 2011 combining high 22 c and low 10 c temperature data resulted in an overall more robust relationship between tthmpri uva254 and water temperature tw shown in eq 4 r2 0 83 r2 adj 0 82 r2 pred 0 78 p 0 05 n 24 with 95 confidence intervals on the coefficients a parallel relationship was also found for haa5pri shown in eq 5 r2 0 89 r2 adj 0 88 r2 pred 0 86 p 0 05 n 24 with 95 confidence intervals on the coefficients 4 t t h m p r i 0 27 0 088 u v a 254 3 8 e 4 1 5 e 4 t w 0 0042 0 0031 5 h a a 5 p r i 0 26 0 048 u v a 254 1 1 e 4 8 4 e 5 t w 0 0031 0 0018 where residual versus fitted value and normal probability plots demonstrated randomly and normally distributed residuals for both relationships eqs 4 and 5 have nearly identical coefficients for uva254 indicating the parameter captured both tthmpri and haa5pri dom precursors also observed by others hua and reckhow 2008 haa5pri formation was less sensitive to temperature based on the 3 5 times smaller coefficient compared to tthmpri as shown by the comparison with the regression from gallard and von gunten 2002 in fig 2 it is likely such relationships would be specific to treated drinking water leaving each wtp assuming treatment of relatively consistent source water quality consequently although the approach of using uva254 and tw should be widely applicable caution should be exercised when using the specific relationships identified by eqs 4 or 5 for predicting tthmpri and haa5pri concentrations although there is not always the possibility of performing a dbp formation study prior to wtp or distribution system design or modifications several tests are recommended to capture the seasonal variability shown in fig 1 if dbp formation studies are not an option and predictive models must be used without comparisons to actual data accuracy cannot reasonably be expected to be better than 20 a metric that has been used by others for predictive model validation amy et al 1987 3 2 comparisons to existing models despite the known time constraints of existing dbp formation models measured tthmtot concentrations were compared to predictions from four existing tthm models developed by amy et al 1987 westerhoff et al 2002 epa 2005 and obolensky and singer 2008 to establish their applicability if any these specific models were chosen due to their relevance for systems that use free chlorine with independent model variables of doc uva254 br temperature chlorine dose and ph similar to other models chowdhury et al 2009 these models have maximum residence time boundary conditions ranging from 4 to 31 days for amy et al 1987 and obolensky and singer 2008 molar concentration predictions were converted to mass concentrations using a weighted average based on the average tthm speciation tthm species tthmtot which in this study was 0 6 for chloroform 0 3 for bromodichloromethane 0 1 for dibromochloromethane 0 0 for bromoform i e tthm weighted average molar mass of 140 mg mmol for epa 2005 equation 5 143 for h doc waters and 5 154 for m doc and l doc waters in cited reference tthmpri concentrations were divided by a recommended 0 77 correction factor based on icr data no special modifications were required for the westerhoff et al 2002 case iv in cited reference model for all model predictions input br concentrations were assumed to be half of the mrl or 0 005 mg l comparisons between predicted and measured tthmtot concentrations are shown in fig 3 a with the previously justified 20 dashed lines around the 1 1 line tthmtot concentration predictions varied widely well outside 20 even at lower concentrations 0 020 mg l fig 3 inset predictions were bracketed on the lower end by the obolensky and singer 2008 model and on the upper end by the westerhoff et al 2002 model these results demonstrate that ultimately bench scale dbp formation testing is superior to predictions from individual models to collectively evaluate the four models predictions were averaged and are shown in fig 3b with standard deviation error bars the trend in fig 3b shows a consistent under prediction which would be expected based on the shorter residence times used to develop the models coincidentally a trendline fitted to the data in fig 3b with the intercept set to zero yielded a slope of 0 795 r2 0 91 directly overlapping with the 20 line note slope was 0 85 with br taken as the mrl or 0 010 mg l in this case the average predictions would then be acceptable based on the established 20 range therefore for long residence time scenarios a correction factor of 0 8 applied to the average of predictions from several existing tthm models may provide more accurate projections than uncorrected individual model predictions 3 3 disinfection byproduct formation and free chlorine demand fcdtot closely tracked tthmtot and haa5tot formation during testing tthmtot and haa5tot concentrations could be reasonably estimated before obtaining analytical results based solely on free chlorine measurements observed relationships between tthmtot and haa5tot concentrations and fcdtot are shown in fig 4 a and 4b respectively and are similar to relationships observed by singer et al 1995 el shafy and grunwald 2000 and boccelli et al 2003 all waters exhibited essentially the same slope mg dbp formed per mg free chlorine consumed but with different fcdpri values especially for w3 low flow it would be expected that fcdpri would vary with time due to source water quality changes particularly related to dissolved species that react with free chlorine well within time scales associated with primary disinfection the most common example of such a demand is from ammonia ammonium nh3 nh4 in fig 4 the w3 low flow fcdpri was relatively high explained in part by an ammonia concentration table 1 that was at least 2 3 times higher than the other waters 0 07 vs 0 03 mg l as n ammonia may have originated from an upstream wastewater treatment plant discharge that had a higher impact under low flow conditions due to less san juan river flow being available for point source dilution therefore a model using solely fcdtot cannot be expected to provide accurate or mechanistically sound predictions due to initial demands from dissolved species that do not lead to dbp formation westerhoff et al 2000 however as previously discussed it does represent an opportunity for developing a simple predictive dbp model based solely on fcdsec as opposed to the multi parameter models previously discussed in relation to fig 3 continuing the discussion presented in section 2 4 a predictive model for tthmsec and haa5sec was developed based on fcdsec to eliminate dependence on fcdpri following eqs 1 and 2 and perhaps more importantly because most dbp formation occurs during secondary disinfection as distribution system residence times increase in this study tthmpri concentrations represented only 8 1 on average of tthmtot concentrations for all waters by subtracting tthmpri and haa5pri concentrations from tthmtot and haa5tot concentrations respectively and fcdpri from fcdtot all data collapsed onto a single line the results were strong r2 0 8 and significant p 0 05 linear relationships shown in fig 5 regression equations are shown in fig 5 but also in more detail in eq 6 r2 0 93 r2 adj 0 93 r2 pred 0 93 p 0 05 n 120 and eq 7 r2 0 88 r2 adj 0 88 r2 pred 0 88 p 0 05 n 119 respectively with 95 confidence intervals on the coefficients 6 t t h m s e c 0 053 0 0030 f c d s e c 0 013 0 0048 7 h a a 5 s e c 0 015 0 0011 f c d s e c 0 0010 0 0018 where residual versus fitted value and normal probability plots demonstrated randomly and normally distributed residuals the intercept in eq 6 was significant did not intersect the origin and the intercept in eq 7 was not significant intersected the origin for eq 6 the intercept is conceptually confusing but such is the nature of empirical relationships and lower tthmsec concentrations could have justified an alternative non linear fit also suggested by boccelli et al 2003 however due to its attractive simplicity a linear relationship for both tthmsec and haa5sec was deemed more favorable and yielded strong significant relationships every model is not without limitations however starting with the boundary conditions shown in table 2 and as such caution should be exercised in extending eqs 6 and 7 to other scenarios as with eqs 4 and 5 beyond the boundary conditions a major limitation is that although twelve different treated waters were used to develop eqs 6 and 7 they originated from the same seasonally variable collection point on the san juan river even so in terms of dom concentration i e doc character i e suva254 and reactivity i e specific yield there is nothing unique about the source water san juan river and subsequent treatments coagulation and gac that would preclude it from being considered of typical raw and treated water quality awwa 2011 as the data in fig 3 and related discussion have shown four existing predictive models developed with a vast number of source waters and treatment conditions are not guaranteed to provide reliable predictions even when applied within their own boundary conditions i e fig 3 inset such is a major reason for the continued development of new and simpler predictive dbp models for the models presented herein external validation is certainly needed but difficult to ascertain due to lack of published extended residence time dbp studies that also provide data to confidently apply eqs 6 and 7 e g fcdpri tthmpri in can be reasonably expected that relationships based on fcdsec would also be system specific because of differences in bulk water fcd fcdbulk from dissolved constituents e g dom as well as differences in fcdsec from distribution system pipe walls biofilms tank walls sediment and fittings fcdwall these wall demands do not result in dbp formation and can be quite significant brown et al 2007 following this logic fcdsec in fig 5 eqs 6 and 7 is more accurately secondary fcdbulk fcd dbp relationships in eqs 6 and 7 can serve as a starting point and with system specific coefficient tuning demonstrate the applicability of the fcd approach outlined in this study which is that robust system specific relationships can be established using easily measured free chlorine concentrations at both the wtp and within the distribution system by contrast measurements for doc and br that are required for current prediction models can be difficult to obtain in real time for many utilities in addition to the absence of predictive models developed specifically for long residence times once a system specific relationship is established through quantifying primary and secondary dbp formation in addition to fcdpri secondary fcdbulk and secondary fcdwall simple free chlorine decay and booster testing can be conducted in most wtp laboratories to predict distribution system dbp concentrations and adjust operations accordingly in real time coagulant dose gac ebct gac replacement in tank aeration systems etc in conjunction with eqs 4 and 5 eqs 6 and 7 could also be used to establish system specific maximum free chlorine doses at the wtp to ensure epa tthm and haa5 maximum contaminant levels of 0 080 and 0 060 mg l respectively would not be exceeded in the distribution system 3 4 comparisons to formation potential fp testing is widely interpreted to provide conservative estimates of dbp formation due to relatively high chlorine concentrations high temperature and long residence time compared to ufc summers et al 1996 crittenden et al 2012 apha et al 2017 considering the sds residence times in this study were much longer than the fp standard of 7 days there was a unique opportunity to compare the two shown in fig 6 a and b for tthm and haa5 respectively as a note the subscripts used thus far e g tot for total were not used for fp concentrations because primary and secondary delineations are not relevant to the method at 1 week sds tthmtot and haa5tot concentrations correlated closely with fp tthm and haa5 concentrations more specifically linear regression dashed lines in fig 6 coefficients 95 confidence intervals were 1 16 0 22 and 0 90 0 27 for slopes and 0 00023 0 010 and 0 0025 0 0054 for intercepts for tthm and haa5 respectively therefore there was no difference between sds and fp concentrations at 1 week as the regressions were not significantly different from a 1 1 relationship at the 95 confidence level dbp speciation between the sds and fp tests was nearly identical and dominated by chloroform 52 to 80 of tthmtot and dichloroacetic acid 42 to 78 of haa5tot similar dbp concentrations between sds and fp tests indicate dbp formation was not limited by free chlorine concentrations but by dom precursors or more measurably doc concentrations at least within the first week while fp conditions were modified from the standard method the results still indicate that fp testing may not always provide conservative estimates of dbp concentrations in fact fp tthm concentrations might have been even lower at the method specified ph of 7 for the 8 week comparison sds tthmtot and haa5tot concentrations were considerably higher than fp tthm and haa5 concentrations fp concentrations were only 56 tthm and 58 haa5 on average of the 8 week sds concentrations these results indicate fp testing may not be appropriate for estimating dbp concentrations for long residence times and that while they decrease with exposure time to free chlorine dom precursors can persist for long periods of time even in the presence of low free chlorine concentrations 0 2 to 1 0 mg l as cl2 a further comparison of sds and fp testing is shown in table 3 where tthmtot and haa5tot concentrations were normalized by fcdtot and averaged across each treated water doc i e h doc m doc and l doc to obtain aggregate values in more explicit terms the ratios or values in table 3 represent the mg of tthmtot or haa5tot formed per mg of free chlorine consumed essentially a dbp yield in terms of fcd that has also been used by others gallard and von gunten 2002 gang et al 2002 dbp fcd yields ranged from 0 023 to 0 038 mg tthm mg cl2 and 0 008 to 0 015 mg haa5 mg cl2 similar to the treated water average values of 0 030 mg tthm mg cl2 and 0 017 mg haa9 mg cl2 observed by gang et al 2002 there was not a consistent statistical difference at the 95 confidence level between sds 1 and 8 weeks and fp dbp fcd yields using tukey s test as identified by letters in table 3 but fp values were consistently lower than sds values tthm and haa5 formation from dom precursors is a complex combination of sequential oxidation substitution and hydrolysis reactions hua and reckhow 2008 awwa 2011 while neither the sds or fp tests in this study were designed to elucidate or isolate those reaction pathways these results indicate that compared to sds testing realistic chlorination fp testing unrealistic chlorination resulted in more destructive dom precursor oxidation reactions and less substitution hydrolysis reactions required for tthm and haa5 formation while oxidation reduction potential orp was not measured for any water the differences in free chlorine residuals between sds and fp tests likely resulted in significant differences in orp or degree of an oxidizing environment for example free chlorine residual concentrations of 0 2 mg l as cl2 sds lower end and 3 0 mg l as cl2 fp lower end can yield significant differences in orp approximately 400 and 700 mv respectively at ph 8 copeland and lytle 2014 therefore as with the discussion related to fig 6 fp testing may underestimate tthm and haa5 concentrations by unrealistically increasing dom oxidation reactions that do not necessarily result in their formation 4 conclusions both tthmtot and haa5tot concentrations varied by approximately 20 over the four parent raw waters from different collection events one spring runoff one low flow two monsoons despite having been treated to the same three doc concentrations four existing and well established tthm models predicted a wide range of concentrations for the conditions in this study and when averaged together they underpredicted sds dbp formation by approximately 20 alternative linear regression models for predicting primary and secondary dbp concentrations based solely on uva254 tw and fcdsec were developed demonstrating that while such relationships are likely to be system specific the approach in their development is straightforward and could be useful for implementing seasonal or real time operational changes at wtps and in distribution systems future work could also validate or verify these developed predictive models fp testing underestimated sds tthmtot and haa5tot concentrations at 8 weeks by approximately 40 altogether this study provides useful approaches to predicting dbp formation in drinking water

metals pharmaceuticals human health aquatic environment wwtp effluents 1 introduction micropollutants are unwanted substances which presence in the environment at very low concentrations ng to µg l in aquatic environment is mainly due to human activities industrial processes agricultural practices daily life activities even at low concentrations they can have negative effects on living organisms due to their toxicity persistence and bioaccumulation in the food chain wastewaters contain a huge variety of organic and inorganic micropollutants that are more or less eliminated from water during wastewater treatments besha et al 2017 choubert et al 2011 clara et al 2005 michael et al 2013 by sorption to sludge volatilization or physicochemical biological transformation alvarino et al 2018 grandclément et al 2017 as the elimination from water is not complete carballa et al 2004 effluents still contain part of the micropollutants present in wastewaters those micropollutants are thus emitted to environment with effluents and can impact aquatic environment and human health organic micropollutants have known effects on living organisms and human beings like carcinogenicity endocrine disruption ahmed et al 2017 inorganic micropollutants may also have different effects on health depending on their form gwenzi et al 2018 carcinogenicity nervous system degradation gastric troubles dermal pathologies etc as wwtp are converging point and disseminate a huge diversity of micropollutants it is important to know the risks or impacts associated to these compounds on human health and aquatic environment one way to prioritize chosen micropollutants is to use concentrations in effluents which allows determining quantities emitted to the aquatic environment but the simultaneous use of emitted quantities and toxicity of micropollutants shows sometimes a different prioritization of micropollutants as poorly concentrated substances can show high toxicity oldenkamp et al 2018 the risk is usually evaluated with risk quotient using pec pnec or mec pnec ratios pec predicted environmental concentration mec measured environmental concentration and pnec predicted no effect concentration brus and perrodin 2017 gunnarsson et al 2019 oldenkamp et al 2018 škrbić et al 2018 verlicchi et al 2012 yang et al 2017 if the quotient is superior to one it is considered that the micropollutant represent a risk meaning that the predicted or measured concentration in the environment is superior to the concentration with no effect difficulties come from obtaining pec mec and pnec pec is obtained considering dilution of the emitted concentration in the aquatic environment thus it does not consider potential transformation and sorption to sediment that limit bioaccessibility of micropollutants mec considered the real concentration in the aquatic environment it is thus necessary to have measure campaigns to obtain this concentration mec furthermore cannot allow identifying source of emission as it corresponds to a resultant of many emissions wwtp agriculture industries air deposit etc pnec considers chronic or acute ec10 ec50 or noec corrected with a factor 10 or 1000 that considers the most sensitive species which implies uncertainties as only one species is thus considered this approach is limited by the fact that micropollutants are studied one by one and the overall risk of all micropollutants cannot be estimated another way to study the burden of micropollutants on human health or aquatic environment is to use life cycle assessment lca tools lca allows to estimate the potential impacts of one or a set of micropollutants muñoz et al 2008 used lca tools to assess the potential impacts of micropollutants contained in influent and effluent of a wwtp they showed that over 98 micropollutants water framework directive substances and pharmaceuticals compounds 15 12 organic and 3 inorganic micropollutants were identified with elevated risk in effluents for human health aquatic and terrestrial environments more recently ortiz de garcía et al 2017 used usetox characterization factors to evaluate the potential toxicological and ecotoxicological impacts of 49 pharmaceuticals and personal care products emitted by wwtp in spain contrary to risk assessment with pec or mec pnec ratios they could give an impact score of the mixture of 49 compounds whatever the lca model used to obtain characterization factors that convert emitted mass in potential impact it considered a fate factor that takes into account transformation and sorption of micropollutants in aquatic environment and an exposure factor that gives the level at which humans and organisms are really exposed here we decided to use lca tools to evaluate the potential impacts on human health and aquatic environment of a mixture of micropollutants both organic and inorganic emitted by wwtp at the scale of france the consensual usetox characterization factors were used first we selected a list of micropollutants according to the european policy applied to france and we reviewed reports and papers on quantification of micropollutants including pharmaceuticals in french wwtp effluents then we evaluated the mean french concentrations of those substances in wwtp effluents with data collected in literature and given by industrial partners finally potential impacts were evaluated by converting annual mass emitted in the environment with characterization factors obtained in usetox rosenbaum et al 2008 2 material and methods 2 1 micropollutants selection the selection of reference lists was based on i european legislation applied to france that sets up monitoring of micropollutants in aquatic environments ii studies that quantified all or part of these micropollutants and iii studies that highlighted hazards of emerging micropollutants which are not yet considered in legislation the european water framework directive wfd and its modification set objectives for the preservation and restauration of the quality of surface water freshwater and costal water and groundwater they give a list of substances and groups of substances that are priority substances or hazardous priority substances for these substances environmental quality standards eqs set concentrations that cannot be exceeded in surface and groundwater this implies the setting up of strategies to reduce or suppress emissions to the environment and the monitoring of these substances in aquatic environment in france due to the wfd an action of survey and reduction of hazardous substances in water rsde started in 2002 with monitoring campaigns of emissions of 2 800 installations classified for the protection of the environment including wastewater treatment plants wwtp results of this campaigns ineris 2007 allowed to conclude that wwtp contributed in a non negligible way and sometimes in significant way to the emission of priority substances and hazardous priority substances in aquatic environment this first step lead to the setting up of a specific monitoring of wwtp effluents priority substances and hazardous priority substances were measured in the effluents of 760 wwtp with a nominal capacity equal or superior to 10 000 people equivalents pe results confirmed previous emissions data scientists also used the list of substances of the wfd for a quantification campaign of micropollutants in 15 wwtp effluents in france martin martin ruel et al 2012 they also add pharmaceutical compounds that were not considered in wfd wwtp effluents being one of the main route of emission to the environment of such compounds we selected micropollutants listed in i the wfd directive 2008 105 ce n d ii the rsde national action for survey and reduction of hazardous substances in water ineris 2016 and iii the amperes french project in which micropollutants wfd and pharmaceuticals were analyzed in influents and effluents of 15 wwtp martin martin ruel et al 2012 other micropollutants were selected according to the scientific expertise of industrial partners 45 substances and families were identified as priority or hazardous priority substances in wfd individual substances were selected and substances included in families were added substances from the watch lists were also selected finally 116 substances from the wfd and its watch lists were selected 112 organics and 4 inorganics 94 substances came from the french rsde survey 35 new substances were added during the second stage of the action which was set up in august 2016 these micropollutants were also included in the list finally as 66 substances were in common with the wfd a list of 179 substances 134 organics and 15 inorganics was selected 128 substances were studied in the amperes project 70 substances were in common with the previous list a list of 237 substances was selected 212 organics and 25 inorganics the expertise allowed to add 48 substances to the list pharmaceuticals compounds and additional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of the us epa list not taken into account previously for imidaclopride two forms were identified and quantified separately in studies so we decided to study the two forms thus it added one substance to the list finally a list of 286 substances was selected with 261 organic micropollutants and 25 inorganic micropollutants the list is given in supporting information this list included 87 pharmaceuticals pharma 66 pesticides pest 18 polychlorobiphenyls pcb 17 polychlorodibenzodioxines and furanes pcdd and pcdf 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah 8 alkylphenols ap 8 halogenated volatile organic compounds hvoc 8 halophenols hph 7 polybromodiphenylethers pbde 4 btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylenes 5 hexabromocyclododecanes hbcdd 4 organotins osn 3 chlorobenzenes clbz and 10 non classified substances pfos bisphenol a chloroalkanes etc 2 2 mass released in the aquatic environment 2 2 1 volume of water the volume of water released in the environment with wwtp effluents was estimated using daily flows arriving to wwtp considering that the amount of water arriving to wwtp was the same as the one of effluent flows were obtained on official website of french wwtp monitoring portail d informations sur l assainissement communal accueil n d the flows of all wwtp were added and multiplied by 365 days to obtain the annual water volume discharged in the aquatic environment we did not consider wet weather flows the annual volume of effluent was estimated at 5 000 000 000 m3 2 2 2 concentration and mass data were collected in the report of the french survey rsde ineris 2016 in the published data of amperes project bruchet et al 2015 in 30 articles dealing with micropollutants in french wwtp effluents andreozzi et al 2002 bergé et al 2012 botta et al 2009 cargouët et al 2004 cavalheiro et al 2017 chiffre et al 2016 dagnac et al 2005 deycard et al 2017 dinh et al 2017b 2017a

in 6 phd reports dealing with french wwtp cladière 2012 coetsier 2009 gilbert pawlik 2011 mailler 2015 pasquini 2013 pomiès 2013 or given by wwtp stakeholders wet weather data as well as data from tertiary treatment were excluded data inferior to limit of quantification were estimated at half of the quantification limit as usually applied in environmental studies ineris 2016 data were highly variable from one study to another which is consistent with local usage moreover in many papers and reports no information was given on location or analysis time but we have chosen to tackle with this diversity of data characterize it and take into account of the uncertainties rather than work on a single source of data in order to do so and to avoid giving to much weight to the highest concentrations mean concentration was estimated using geometrical mean instead of arithmetical mean furthermore confidence intervals at 95 were estimated allowing to show the accuracy of data indeed the lowest was the interval the lowest was the variation of data considering variability of data above time and location with geometrical mean and confidence interval allowed estimation of mean value for a year and at the scale of france for most of the molecules there was a factor 2 between mean values and interval confidence boundaries which was much lower than the error on characterization factors 1 or 2 log in view of all the uncertainties of what was available we can only wish for a greater sharing of measured and consolidated data from wwtp with for example open data for each substance a reliability index was estimated if the proportion of data inferior to the limit of quantification was higher than 90 the index was set at 0 for some substances only one concentration was found in literature or given by wwtp stakeholders in that case if the concentration was superior to quantification limit the index was set at 1 and the error on the logarithm was estimated at 100 maximum error for substances with high number of found concentrations in all other cases the index was set at 1 this index allowed to eliminate data which were not reliable considering that the estimated volume and the mean concentrations were representative of the whole france mass released annually in the aquatic environment was estimated by multiplying each concentration by the volume mass was converted in kilograms or tons 2 3 impacts characterization factors were obtained from usetox 2 1 hauschild et al 2008 henderson et al 2011 rosenbaum et al 2011 2008 model was set to europe and characterization factors were obtained for emissions in freshwater compartment characterization factors cfs were calculated in usetox 2 1 through the following formula cf ff x xf x ef ff was the fate factor indicating the residence time in the environment and was estimating with physicochemical properties for organic micropollutants or speciation for inorganic micropollutants xf was the exposure factor i e the fraction of micropollutants in environment that was available for organisms ef was the effect factor corresponding to the effect on aquatic environment considering three trophic levels or the effect on human health for human toxicity cfs usetox 2 1 calculated the intake fraction if i e the amount of micropollutants absorbed through air water and food after emission in freshwater compartment if was equal to xf x ff lca tool was preferred to pec pnec or mec pnec approach as we wanted to estimate potential impacts of each micropollutants and the overall impact of the mixture furthermore the use of this method allowed us determining the impact linked to wwtp emissions only potential impacts were estimated by multiplying the mass with the characterization factor according to usetox documentation fantke et al 2017 impacts were different if there was 1 or 2 log difference for respectively organic and inorganic substances only the error due to the variation of concentrations was plotted but usetox error on impacts was also considered for results interpretation for human health the impact was expressed in daly disability adjusted life year which represented the number of years lost with illness handicap or premature death it considered both carcinogenic and non carcinogenic effects for aquatic environment the impact was expressed in pdf m3 d potentially disappeared fraction integrated with volume and time the total impact for human health or aquatic environment was calculated by summing all the impacts no agonist or antagonist effects were considered when summing concentrations masses or impacts geometrical mean values were added and considered as the total mean the error for the total mean was the sum of 95 confidence intervals limits 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentration and mass 3 1 1 organic micropollutants 225 261 organic micropollutants 86 presented at least one concentration in literature and wwtp stakeholders data the 36 organic micropollutants without data were i 17 pcdd pcdf ii heptabromodiphenylethers iii 11 pesticides methiocarbe acetamipride clothianidine thiaclopride thiametoxame metaflumizone triallate cybutryne ddt 24 ddd 44 dde 44 and iv 7 pharmaceuticals butylated hydroxytoluene octyl methoxycinnamate 4 epi chlortetracycline chlortetracycline doxycycline acetylsulfamethoxazole azoxystrobine 153 261 organic micropollutants 59 presented reliability index of 1 123 had more than one available data and 30 had only one available data mean concentrations and masses were calculated for these 153 compounds the reliability index allowed to eliminate substances poorly quantified with high limit of quantification such as methanol or hydrazine concentrations ranged from 0 1 ng l 1 to around 5 µg l 1 table 1 this underlined the high variety of concentrations 75 of the concentrations were below 0 1 µg l 1 annual masses ranged between 0 5 kg to 26 tons 75 of the annual mass were below 0 6 tons 15 compounds had concentrations masses higher than the 90th centile i 9 pharmaceuticals valsartan irbesartan ranitidine hydrochlorothiazide chlordiazepoxide sotalol furosemide carbamazepine atenolol and ii np1ec nonylphenol ethoxyacetic acid trichloromethane tetrachloroethylene dichloromethane ampa aminomethylphosphonic acid and dehp bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate pharmaceuticals concentrations in the french effluents were in accordance with the data in europe verlicchi et al 2012 results highlighted that some pharmaceuticals have high emissions to the environment compared to other organic micropollutants these high masses may be due to i high concentrations in wastewaters ii low sorption to sludge iii poor biodegradability iv transformation in parent compounds of conjugated forms or v combination of these hypotheses dehp is a plasticizer used in many manufactured products wormuth et al 2006 tetrachloromethane dichloromethane and tetrachloroethylene are chemicals used in many industries ampa is a transformation product of glyphosate and phosphonates present in washing powders and liquids grandcoin et al 2017 np1ec is a transformation product of nonylphenol polyethoxylates which are common surfactants used in many chemical products ying et al 2002 and can no longer be used without authorization since july 2019 reach ue n 999 2017 and 2020 171 annex xiv for some of these highest concentrated organic micropollutants eqs were available 1650 452 2 5 2 5 and 1 3 µg l 1 for dichloromethane ampa carbamazepine trichloromethane and dehp respectively in this study estimated concentrations in effluents were 3 01 2 81 3 21 range from 95 to 95 confidence interval 1 12 0 59 2 14 0 40 0 29 0 54 0 58 0 55 0 61 and 0 73 0 69 0 77 µg l 1 for dichloromethane ampa carbamazepine trichloromethane and dehp respectively in this case all effluent concentrations were lower than eqs in french survey it is considered that a substance should be monitored if concentration in effluent was above ten times its eqs consideration of a mean dilution factor of 10 in the aquatic environment applying this rule none of these molecules should be monitored concentrations in french rivers were also found survey from 1st of january 2015 and 31st of december 2018 http www naiades eaufrance fr consulted the 20th and 23rd of september 2019 for these 15 organic micropollutants mean concentrations were calculated with all obtained data with the same hypotheses as for wwtp effluents when quantification frequency was lower than 10 no mean concentration was calculated all the mean concentrations found in rivers remained below the effluent ones but the ratio between those concentrations effluent river was variable depending on the compounds underlying that considering a common dilution factor to predict the concentration in the river from the effluent one may contribute to calculation error of the risk quotient dehp ampa furosemide carbamazepine and atenolol had concentrations in effluent 2 to 4 times higher than mean concentrations in rivers sotalol hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan had concentrations in effluent 7 11 and 16 times higher respectively than mean concentrations in rivers thus wwtp may contribute in a significant way to occurrences in rivers indeed except ampa which can also be emitted by agricultural emissions all cited micropollutants originate from urban activities those 15 compounds 10 of the compounds represented 70 of the total mass of the 153 organic micropollutants 48 for the 9 pharmaceuticals and 22 for the other 6 compounds the total mass of the 153 organic micropollutants released in the environment by french wwtp was around 147 tons between 107 and 223 tons considering confidence intervals 3 1 2 inorganic micropollutants a concentration was estimated for 24 25 96 inorganic compounds fig 1 thallium was searched in effluents but never quantified it was not therefore considered concentrations ranged from 0 01 µg l 1 mercury to 159 µg l 1 iron the total mass released in the environment was around 1 892 tons range 1 382 to 3 005 tons main contributors to the total mass were in decreasing order iron 42 boron 17 aluminum 10 zinc 9 and manganese 7 most of organic micropollutants are synthetic substances produced by human activities pah are also produced by natural sources such as forest fire but inorganic micropollutants are naturally present in the environment and increase of concentrations in environment compartments is also linked to human activities natural presence in water and non biodegradability can explain that concentrations of inorganic micropollutants are generally higher than those of organic micropollutants mean concentrations estimated in this study in the effluent are close to environmental concentration salpeteur and angel 2010 and above french drinking water limits as for organic micropollutants concentrations were compared to eqs and mean rivers concentrations for the highest concentrations in wwtp effluents only zinc has eqs stated at 7 8 or 3 1 µg l 1 depending on water alkalinity for some rivers zinc should be monitored as its mean concentration in effluents was 35 33 37 range µg l 1 thus superior to ten times the lowest eqs aluminum concentration in effluents was half of the mean concentration in rivers iron and manganese concentration in effluents were close to rivers concentration boron and zinc concentrations were respectively 6 and 20 times higher in wwtp effluents than in rivers concentrations wwtp might only be a major contributor of inorganic micropollutants for boron and zinc which was in accordance with their use by human activities in urban areas 3 2 potential impacts of organic micropollutants 3 2 1 human health the impact on human health of organic micropollutants was calculated with the 94 substances with characterization factors over the 261 selected organic micropollutants 36 and over the 153 organic micropollutants with estimated concentrations 61 this was due to the lack of concentrations and or characterization factors butylphenol aspirin ibuprofen cimetidine hydrochlorothiazide βe2 caffeine and theophylline had characterization factors equal to 0 the impact on human health was estimated with compounds representing 48 of the characterized organic micropollutants mass impacts ranged from 0 to 2 daly fig 2 a with a total average impact of 6 daly main contributors were benzo b fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene indomethacin dicofol indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene pentabromodiphenylethers dibenzo a h anthracene and diclofenac with respective contributions of 28 16 15 13 12 6 3 and 1 of the total impact considering substances with at least 1 contribution to the total impact those eight compounds represented only 4 of the 94 characterized organic micropollutants mass but 94 of the total potential impact on human health it is thus important not only to consider the mass released in the environment for prioritization but also toxicity as stated by oldenkamp et al 2018 among these 8 compounds 4 are pah that are produced by human activities and natural sources and thus are ubiquist in environmental matrices the 2 following compounds are already banned of use dicofol is an acaricide forbidden since 2010 in france and pentabromodiphenylethers are a group of flame retardant forbidden since 2004 in france their low residual presence in wwtp effluents is thus relied to illegal use or persistence in the environment only indomethacin and diclofenac both anti inflammatory drugs are still used in france compounds with the highest potential impacts to human health corresponded mainly to recognized carcinogenic ones especially pah and polybromodiphenylethers muñoz et al 2008 studied the impact on human health of 98 micropollutants using a scenario in which they were emitted to soil use for agricultural crop irrigation with characterization factors coming from two different methods first method edip 97 scores expressed in m3 highlighted two substances with the highest impact on human health gemfibrozil and nicotine 2nd method uses lca scores expressed in kg dcb eq highlighted two others substances 2 3 7 8 tcdd and hexachlorobenzene in our study nicotine was not considered 2 3 7 8 tcdd and hexachlorobenzene were first selected but not taken into account due to non available concentration data in french effluents gemfibrozil was characterized for human toxicity and showed only around 0 01 contribution to the total potential impact difference in results came from the lca methods used for characterization factors calculation and from the choice of compartment in which emission is made and the exposure pathway via crops irrigated with treated effluent ortiz de garcía et al 2017 using a similar methodology based on lca only studied pharmaceutical compounds over 49 substances they were able to quantify the impact of 41 ones the total impact calculated considering their masses and characterization factors was 36 cases which was 2 log higher than the 0 8 cases we found for our 94 substances it was only possible to convert our results in cases the total mass emitted to the environment is an explanation to the difference as it was 234 tons for their study and only 71 tons for ours considering only pharmaceuticals compounds of our study 46 substances the total impact was 0 1 cases and the total mass was 37 tons confirming that the emitted mass is a critical point for the impact on human health in our study characterized pharmaceuticals represented 52 of the total mass and around 14 of the total impact meaning that other less concentrated compounds had high impacts on human health due to high toxicity if we considered only common pharmaceuticals compounds between both studies 16 their impact was one log higher than ours fig 3 a in terms of mass released to the environment only carbamazepine diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole had same orders of magnitude ee2 and trimethoprim had mass higher in our study with one log difference for others masses were lower in our study with one log difference for norfloxacine azithromycine ciprofloxacin naproxen alprazolam βe2 fluoxetine clarithromycin and ibuprofen and with 2 logs difference for acetaminophen and omeprazole those differences highlighted the need to consider geographical difference between countries some characterization factors were different between the two studies probably due to the update of usetox database except for naproxen ciprofloxacin trimethoprim acetaminophen sulfamethoxazole and norfloxacin with same order of magnitude trimethoprim and diclofenac had impact superior in our study with one log difference ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole and naproxen had similar impacts in both studies for the other substances impacts were lower in our study with 1 2 3 or 4 logs difference for βe2 and ibuprofen our database gave null characterization factor avoiding comparison for substances with the same characterization factors the difference between the two studies came from the emitted mass in aquatic environment in accordance with available comparison it meant that probably due to difference in terms of use pharmaceuticals potential impacts to human health could be strongly impacted by the mass emitted to the environment nevertheless both studies showed low impact on human health whatever the considered micropollutants were other studies only evaluated the risk linked to the presence of organic micropollutants in drinking water hollender et al 2018 searched more than 500 organic micropollutants in drinking water they found 123 substances with concentrations above quantification limits and showed that there was no significant risk for the consumption of these water due to organic micropollutants presence comparison of the measured concentrations with a threshold value of 0 1 µg l 1 threshold of toxicological concern approach enault et al 2015 compared the contribution of environmental micropollutants exposure 11 mineral elements and 73 organic micropollutants they also showed a minor risk due to the consumption of drinking water due to poor exposure via water although some micropollutants lead non dioxin like polychlorobiphenyls pfoa pfos might have a non negligible risk compared to air or food exposure de jesus gaffney et al 2015 showed with quotient risk analysis that 16 pharmaceuticals compounds quantified over 31 searched ones present in surface water underground water and drinking water did not show an elevated risk to human health although those studies concerned drinking water it tended to confirm our results as contamination of drinking waters partly occurred because of wwtp emissions especially for compounds only used in everyday life such as pharmaceuticals in our study the total impact of organic micropollutants released in aquatic environment through wwtp effluents on human health was low due to i the absence of direct exposure to these molecules ii the buffer role of the environment and iii the treatment steps before exposure drinking water ozonation activated carbon treatments than can eliminate a huge part of organic micropollutants simazaki et al 2015 3 2 2 aquatic environment over the 153 organic micropollutants with estimated concentrations 88 58 had ecotoxicity characterization factors the impact on aquatic environment was estimated with compounds representing 44 of the organic micropollutants mass impacts ranged from 13 103 to 49 109 pdf m3 d fig 2b main contributors to the total impact 61 109 pdf m3 d were cypermethrin pcb 101 βe2 amoxicillin and aclonifen with respective contributions of 82 12 2 and 1 as cypermethrin had a very high score we also included in the list with the highest impacts 1 2 5 6 9 10 hbcdd boscalid dicofol isodrin and dichlorvos which had a least 1 of the total impact calculated without cypermethrine those 10 compounds represented around 2 of the 88 organic micropollutants mass but 99 of the total impact cypermethrin is a pesticide which use is limited in france pcb 101 is an ubiquist polychlorobiphenyl forbidden since 1987 in france but highly refractory to degradation in the environment βe2 is a natural hormone produced by humans and animals it is a well know endocrine disruptor and this estrogenic effect has already been observed after discharged of treated water in river miège et al 2009b but this molecule presents also high ecotoxicity for aquatic environment which implies a high effect factor and a high impact calculated with our approach by comparison ee2 well known to have higher endocrine disruption effect than βe2 jobling et al 2006 had a lower potential impact because its ecotoxicity expressed in the effect factor was lower amoxicillin beta lactam from the aminopenicillin family is a well used antibiotic in france 1 2 5 6 9 10 hbcdd is a flame retardant which use was progressively reduced since 2011 due to suspicion of endocrine disruption effect dicofol isodrine and dichlorvos are pesticides which uses are forbidden in france on the contrary aclonifen and boscalid use is authorized in france both pesticides among those main contributors suspected endocrine disruptors were present pcb chlorinated pesticides brominated flame retardant matthiessen et al 2018 vilela et al 2018 even if this effect is not considered in the effect factor used to calculate the ecotoxicity characterization factor for the ten compounds having the highest impacts on aquatic environment we observed that the exposure factor had low influence on the potential impact as it was close to 100 for all compounds thus mass fate factor and effect factor had the highest influence the effect factor had a great influence as its contribution to the impact was between 45 and 72 the emitted mass and fate factor had similar contributions between 7 and 32 in that case toxicity of the substances had more effect than the quantity released to the environment or the degradation potency of those molecules other studies used life cycle assessment tools to determine potential impacts of micropollutants emitted by wwtp on aquatic environment muñoz et al 2008 with the study of one wwtp in spain showed that fluoxetine triclosan and ciprofloxacin had greatest potential impacts on aquatic environment with both models they used with edip97 model 2 3 7 8 tcdd had high contribution to the impact whereas uses lca model highlighted ibuprofen in our study fluoxetine triclosan ciprofloxacin and ibuprofen ranked in decreasing order of contribution at the 49th 30th 43rd and 82nd positions respectively in our case the molecules with highest impacts were not considered in muñoz et al 2008 ibuprofen had low contribution in our study due to the difference of emitted mass and or evaluation of characterization factor not the same models 2 3 7 8 tcdd was in our initial list but not considered due to lack of french concentration data in wwtp effluents nevertheless its usetox characterization factor was among the highest meaning that even with probably low concentration in effluent highly hydrophobic compound its impact should be among the highest ortiz de garcía et al 2017 only studied pharmaceutical compounds the total impact on aquatic environment of their 45 characterized pharmaceuticals was in same order of magnitude of our 88 substances total impact respectively 1 4 1010 and 6 1 1010 pdf m3 d the huge difference was the mass as already shown for human toxicity 236 tons and 64 tons for 45 pharmaceuticals and 88 substances respectively it proved that substances with very low concentrations can have a great impact on aquatic environment contrary to the potential impact on human health taking into account other substances than pharmaceuticals was of great concern when considering only our 37 characterized pharmaceuticals 38 of the mass and 4 of the impact emitted mass and impact had one log less than ortiz de garcia s results thus both results seemed consistent it highlighted once more that geographical situation was very important when estimating potential impacts among the 45 substances we had calculated the impact for the 19 substances in common fig 3b the total emitted mass was 70 and 10 tons for their study and ours respectively and the total impact was 1 3 1010 and 2 2 109 pdf m3 d respectively as already shown previously mass emitted to the environment were different except for salicylic acid estrone and norfloxacin same order of magnitude contrary to toxicity characterization factors only amoxicillin clarithromycin estrone and venlafaxine characterization factors were not in the same order of magnitude difference occurred for potential impacts on aquatic environment mainly due to the difference of emitted mass in both studies βe2 azithromycin and clarithromycin had very high potential impact hormone and antibiotics macrolides showed also high ecotoxicity prediction of concentrations in aquatic environment crossed with estimation of ecotoxicity allowed also to study potential impacts on aquatic environment lindim et al 2019 in their study the bioavailable concentrations of 54 pharmaceuticals were predicted in different rivers thanks to fugacity model stream eu and their ecotoxicity effect was evaluated in percentage of the total potentially affected fraction paf using ec50 of each substance in their study some pharmaceuticals with highest contribution to predicted toxic pressure were among the list of the most impacting pharmaceuticals in our study diclofenac ee2 erythromycin ciprofloxacin neale et al 2015 coupled analytical tools and biological bioassays with mixture toxicity modeling to in vitro effects of micropollutants to detected organic micropollutants in water they showed that for some effect few molecules contributed to a large amount of the impact which was in accordance with our findings johnson et al 2019 studied the change of wastewater treatment process on the biodiversity of macroinvertebrates in a river of the united kingdom between 1970 and 2010 they studied the evolution of bmwp index biological monitoring working party and the spear indexes species at risk during time in the river flow one carbon filter was set up between 2008 and 2014 as tertiary treatment during this period no significant impact on macroinvertebrates was noticed due to the use of activated carbon the observed improvement of biodiversity was related to the improvement of oxygen levels during the whole study authors estimated that in this case pollutants present in wwtp effluent were not a great threat compared to other emissions such as agricultural ones other articles confirmed our results showing an impact on aquatic environment richmond et al 2018 analyzed pharmaceutical compounds in 190 aquatic insects larvae and other aquatic invertebrates and riparian spiders they showed possible bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms such as brown trout and terrestrial organisms spiders and platypus consuming insects larvae and insects no effect of bioaccumulation was studied ojemaye and petrik 2019 analyzed 15 organic micropollutants pharmaceutical compounds perfluoroalkyl compounds and compounds from chemical industry in fish caught near cape town eleven molecules were detected at least in one body part of each fish with risk quotient results showed that micropollutants present in fish represent a potential risk to fish and humans that consume them our results are in accordance with a low but real risk of the presence of organic micropollutants in aquatic environment bioaccumulation and risk for organisms remaining question is that neither our study nor literature show the deleterious effect if any of bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms other studies using mixture of micropollutants showed cocktail effects but these studies were made in lab control conditions with concentrations generally higher than in real environment cizmas et al 2015 silva et al 2002 rajapakse et al 2001 thrupp et al 2018 verlicchi et al 2012 showed high risk of some pharmaceuticals in aquatic environment using pec pnec method antibiotics especially macrolides in common in our studies were shown to have great impact or risk on the aquatic environment bioaccumulation endocrine disruption and toxicity of micropollutants had been already observed and quantified in literature with different methods our results tended to confirm negative effects of micropollutants released by wwtp in aquatic environment many studies focused on emerging micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals here we highlighted potential impacts of recalcitrant and persistent compound and pharmaceuticals furthermore literature and our study also proved that whatever the method used to evaluate risk or impact it is necessary to cross released or environmental concentration and ecotoxicity effect to determine negative effects of organic micropollutants on aquatic environment high potential impacts of both persistent and emerging compounds imply that both source reduction and addition of tertiary treatment might have significant impact on the reduction of micropollutants burden to the aquatic environment 3 3 potential impacts of inorganic micropollutants 3 3 1 human health over the 24 inorganic micropollutants with estimated

micropollutants mass it is difficult to conclude on the potential impacts of inorganic micropollutants on human health and aquatic environment indeed they are naturally present in the environment making difficult to assess the real effects due to the release by wwtp on aquatic organisms and humans if usetox provides characterizations factors for metals they are considered as interim and should be interpreted with caution as they present a high degree of uncertainty fantke et al 2017 4 conclusions 286 substances were selected for this study and the potential impacts on human health and aquatic environment were estimated only with 1 3 of the molecules fig 6 total potential impacts on human health varied between 3 and 14 and 761 to 904 daly for respectively organic and inorganic micropollutants total potential impacts on aquatic environment varied between 18 and 22 and 2 408 to 3 407 billions pdf m3 d for respectively organic and inorganic micropollutants for toxicity and ecotoxicity the potential impacts were calculated with little number of molecules over the ones that had been selected this highlighted the lack of concentration data and characterization factors the actual knowledge of the effects of micropollutants on human health and aquatic environment is limited our studies raised question about the solution to reduce organic micropollutants impacts on human health and aquatic environment reduction or ban on using is preferred in france here we highlighted that ubiquitous micropollutants pah forbidden pcb or natural ones hormone are still found in effluents and contributed to the calculated impact meaning that this solution is not appropriate for all the micropollutants tertiary treatments are another way to reduce amount release to the environment but we need to know if they are sufficient to reduce micropollutants with highest impacts and studies to prove that degradation products if any are not more toxic than parent compounds furthermore we can also question the cost implied by the addition of tertiary treatments we need to know if the available tertiary treatment options are effective to remove micropollutants and if they are cost effective considering their cost and the decrease of impact our results raised questions about the impacts of inorganic micropollutants indeed they are naturally present in water most of the concentrations in wwtp effluents are closed to river concentrations but estimated impacts showed high risk due to these substances usetox is only based on chronic toxicity data and does not consider endocrine disrupting effect moreover effects of nanomaterials microplastics resistance genes etc were not considered by this method but can represent a huge impact on human health and aquatic environment however this method could be used to compare different scenarii addition of tertiary treatment reduction of emission at the source etc here as a first step of potential impacts estimation we focus on mean mass values at the scale of france we know that there is a spatial and temporal variation of micropollutants emission lindim et al 2019 one perspective is to use this kind of method at the scale of catchment basin considering other emissions coming from agriculture or industries furthermore other emissions on wwtp air sludge can be studied with this method and compared to

17432,micropollutants emitted by human activities represent a potential threat to our health and aquatic environment thousands of active substances are used and go to wwtp through wastewaters during water treatment incomplete elimination occurs effluents released to the environment still contain part of the micropollutants present in the influents here we studied the potential impacts on human health and aquatic environment of the release of 261 organic micropollutants and 25 inorganic micropollutants at the scale of france data were gathered from national surveys reports papers and phd works the usetox model was used to assess potential impacts the impacts on human health were estimated for 94 organic and 15 inorganic micropollutants and on aquatic environment for 88 organic and 19 inorganic micropollutants highlighting lack of concentration and toxicological data in literature some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and pesticides as well as as and zn showed highest potential impacts on human health some pesticides pcb 101 βe2 al fe and cu showed highest potential impacts on aquatic environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords persistent compounds trace metals pharmaceuticals human health aquatic environment wwtp effluents 1 introduction micropollutants are unwanted substances which presence in the environment at very low concentrations ng to µg l in aquatic environment is mainly due to human activities industrial processes agricultural practices daily life activities even at low concentrations they can have negative effects on living organisms due to their toxicity persistence and bioaccumulation in the food chain wastewaters contain a huge variety of organic and inorganic micropollutants that are more or less eliminated from water during wastewater treatments besha et al 2017 choubert et al 2011 clara et al 2005 michael et al 2013 by sorption to sludge volatilization or physicochemical biological transformation alvarino et al 2018 grandclément et al 2017 as the elimination from water is not complete carballa et al 2004 effluents still contain part of the micropollutants present in wastewaters those micropollutants are thus emitted to environment with effluents and can impact aquatic environment and human health organic micropollutants have known effects on living organisms and human beings like carcinogenicity endocrine disruption ahmed et al 2017 inorganic micropollutants may also have different effects on health depending on their form gwenzi et al 2018 carcinogenicity nervous system degradation gastric troubles dermal pathologies etc as wwtp are converging point and disseminate a huge diversity of micropollutants it is important to know the risks or impacts associated to these compounds on human health and aquatic environment one way to prioritize chosen micropollutants is to use concentrations in effluents which allows determining quantities emitted to the aquatic environment but the simultaneous use of emitted quantities and toxicity of micropollutants shows sometimes a different prioritization of micropollutants as poorly concentrated substances can show high toxicity oldenkamp et al 2018 the risk is usually evaluated with risk quotient using pec pnec or mec pnec ratios pec predicted environmental concentration mec measured environmental concentration and pnec predicted no effect concentration brus and perrodin 2017 gunnarsson et al 2019 oldenkamp et al 2018 škrbić et al 2018 verlicchi et al 2012 yang et al 2017 if the quotient is superior to one it is considered that the micropollutant represent a risk meaning that the predicted or measured concentration in the environment is superior to the concentration with no effect difficulties come from obtaining pec mec and pnec pec is obtained considering dilution of the emitted concentration in the aquatic environment thus it does not consider potential transformation and sorption to sediment that limit bioaccessibility of micropollutants mec considered the real concentration in the aquatic environment it is thus necessary to have measure campaigns to obtain this concentration mec furthermore cannot allow identifying source of emission as it corresponds to a resultant of many emissions wwtp agriculture industries air deposit etc pnec considers chronic or acute ec10 ec50 or noec corrected with a factor 10 or 1000 that considers the most sensitive species which implies uncertainties as only one species is thus considered this approach is limited by the fact that micropollutants are studied one by one and the overall risk of all micropollutants cannot be estimated another way to study the burden of micropollutants on human health or aquatic environment is to use life cycle assessment lca tools lca allows to estimate the potential impacts of one or a set of micropollutants muñoz et al 2008 used lca tools to assess the potential impacts of micropollutants contained in influent and effluent of a wwtp they showed that over 98 micropollutants water framework directive substances and pharmaceuticals compounds 15 12 organic and 3 inorganic micropollutants were identified with elevated risk in effluents for human health aquatic and terrestrial environments more recently ortiz de garcía et al 2017 used usetox characterization factors to evaluate the potential toxicological and ecotoxicological impacts of 49 pharmaceuticals and personal care products emitted by wwtp in spain contrary to risk assessment with pec or mec pnec ratios they could give an impact score of the mixture of 49 compounds whatever the lca model used to obtain characterization factors that convert emitted mass in potential impact it considered a fate factor that takes into account transformation and sorption of micropollutants in aquatic environment and an exposure factor that gives the level at which humans and organisms are really exposed here we decided to use lca tools to evaluate the potential impacts on human health and aquatic environment of a mixture of micropollutants both organic and inorganic emitted by wwtp at the scale of france the consensual usetox characterization factors were used first we selected a list of micropollutants according to the european policy applied to france and we reviewed reports and papers on quantification of micropollutants including pharmaceuticals in french wwtp effluents then we evaluated the mean french concentrations of those substances in wwtp effluents with data collected in literature and given by industrial partners finally potential impacts were evaluated by converting annual mass emitted in the environment with characterization factors obtained in usetox rosenbaum et al 2008 2 material and methods 2 1 micropollutants selection the selection of reference lists was based on i european legislation applied to france that sets up monitoring of micropollutants in aquatic environments ii studies that quantified all or part of these micropollutants and iii studies that highlighted hazards of emerging micropollutants which are not yet considered in legislation the european water framework directive wfd and its modification set objectives for the preservation and restauration of the quality of surface water freshwater and costal water and groundwater they give a list of substances and groups of substances that are priority substances or hazardous priority substances for these substances environmental quality standards eqs set concentrations that cannot be exceeded in surface and groundwater this implies the setting up of strategies to reduce or suppress emissions to the environment and the monitoring of these substances in aquatic environment in france due to the wfd an action of survey and reduction of hazardous substances in water rsde started in 2002 with monitoring campaigns of emissions of 2 800 installations classified for the protection of the environment including wastewater treatment plants wwtp results of this campaigns ineris 2007 allowed to conclude that wwtp contributed in a non negligible way and sometimes in significant way to the emission of priority substances and hazardous priority substances in aquatic environment this first step lead to the setting up of a specific monitoring of wwtp effluents priority substances and hazardous priority substances were measured in the effluents of 760 wwtp with a nominal capacity equal or superior to 10 000 people equivalents pe results confirmed previous emissions data scientists also used the list of substances of the wfd for a quantification campaign of micropollutants in 15 wwtp effluents in france martin martin ruel et al 2012 they also add pharmaceutical compounds that were not considered in wfd wwtp effluents being one of the main route of emission to the environment of such compounds we selected micropollutants listed in i the wfd directive 2008 105 ce n d ii the rsde national action for survey and reduction of hazardous substances in water ineris 2016 and iii the amperes french project in which micropollutants wfd and pharmaceuticals were analyzed in influents and effluents of 15 wwtp martin martin ruel et al 2012 other micropollutants were selected according to the scientific expertise of industrial partners 45 substances and families were identified as priority or hazardous priority substances in wfd individual substances were selected and substances included in families were added substances from the watch lists were also selected finally 116 substances from the wfd and its watch lists were selected 112 organics and 4 inorganics 94 substances came from the french rsde survey 35 new substances were added during the second stage of the action which was set up in august 2016 these micropollutants were also included in the list finally as 66 substances were in common with the wfd a list of 179 substances 134 organics and 15 inorganics was selected 128 substances were studied in the amperes project 70 substances were in common with the previous list a list of 237 substances was selected 212 organics and 25 inorganics the expertise allowed to add 48 substances to the list pharmaceuticals compounds and additional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of the us epa list not taken into account previously for imidaclopride two forms were identified and quantified separately in studies so we decided to study the two forms thus it added one substance to the list finally a list of 286 substances was selected with 261 organic micropollutants and 25 inorganic micropollutants the list is given in supporting information this list included 87 pharmaceuticals pharma 66 pesticides pest 18 polychlorobiphenyls pcb 17 polychlorodibenzodioxines and furanes pcdd and

xylenes 5 hexabromocyclododecanes hbcdd 4 organotins osn 3 chlorobenzenes clbz and 10 non classified substances pfos bisphenol a chloroalkanes etc 2 2 mass released in the aquatic environment 2 2 1 volume of water the volume of water released in the environment with wwtp effluents was estimated using daily flows arriving to wwtp considering that the amount of water arriving to wwtp was the same as the one of effluent flows were obtained on official website of french wwtp monitoring portail d informations sur l assainissement communal accueil n d the flows of all wwtp were added and multiplied by 365 days to obtain the annual water volume discharged in the aquatic environment we did not consider wet weather flows the annual volume of effluent was estimated at 5 000 000 000 m3 2 2 2 concentration and mass data were collected in the report of the french survey rsde ineris 2016 in the published data of amperes project bruchet et al 2015 in 30 articles dealing with micropollutants

in 6 phd reports dealing with french wwtp cladière 2012 coetsier 2009 gilbert pawlik 2011 mailler 2015 pasquini 2013 pomiès 2013 or given by wwtp stakeholders wet weather data as well as data from tertiary treatment were excluded data inferior to limit of quantification were estimated at half of the quantification limit as usually applied in environmental studies ineris 2016 data were highly variable from one study to another which is consistent with local usage moreover in many papers and reports no information was given on location or analysis time but we have chosen to tackle with this diversity of data characterize it and take into account of the uncertainties rather than work on a single source of data in order to do so and to avoid giving to much weight to the highest concentrations mean concentration was estimated using geometrical mean instead of arithmetical mean furthermore confidence intervals at 95 were estimated allowing to show the accuracy of data indeed the lowest was the interval the lowest was the variation of data considering variability of data above time and location with geometrical mean and confidence interval allowed estimation of mean value for a year and at the scale of france for most of the molecules there was a factor 2 between mean values and interval confidence boundaries which was much lower than the error on characterization factors 1 or 2 log in view of all the uncertainties of what was available we can only wish for a greater sharing of measured and consolidated data from wwtp with for example open data for each substance a reliability index was estimated if the proportion of data inferior to the limit of quantification was higher than 90 the index was set at 0 for some substances only one concentration was found in literature or given by wwtp stakeholders in that case if the concentration was superior to quantification limit the index was set at 1 and the error on the logarithm was estimated at 100 maximum error for substances with high number of found concentrations in all other cases the index was set at 1 this index allowed to eliminate data which were not reliable considering that the estimated volume and the mean concentrations were representative of the whole france mass released annually in the aquatic environment was estimated by multiplying each concentration by the volume mass was converted in kilograms or tons 2 3 impacts characterization factors were obtained from usetox 2 1 hauschild et al 2008 henderson et al 2011 rosenbaum et al 2011 2008 model was set to europe and characterization factors were obtained for emissions in freshwater compartment characterization factors cfs were calculated in usetox 2 1 through the following formula cf ff x xf x ef ff was the fate factor indicating the residence time in the environment and was estimating with physicochemical properties for organic micropollutants or speciation for inorganic micropollutants xf was the exposure factor i e the fraction of micropollutants in environment that was available for organisms ef was the effect factor corresponding to the effect on aquatic environment considering three trophic levels or the effect on human health for human toxicity cfs usetox 2 1 calculated the intake fraction if i e the amount of micropollutants absorbed through air water and food after emission in freshwater compartment if was equal to xf x ff lca tool was preferred to pec pnec or mec pnec approach as we wanted to estimate potential impacts of each micropollutants and the overall impact of the mixture furthermore the use of this method allowed us determining the impact linked to wwtp emissions only potential impacts were estimated by multiplying the mass with the characterization factor according to usetox documentation fantke et al 2017 impacts were different if there was 1 or 2 log difference for respectively organic and inorganic substances only the error due to the variation of concentrations was plotted but usetox error on impacts was also considered for results interpretation for human health the impact was expressed in daly disability adjusted life year which represented the number of years lost with illness handicap or premature death it considered both carcinogenic and non carcinogenic effects for aquatic environment the impact was expressed in pdf m3 d potentially disappeared fraction integrated with volume and time the total impact for human health or aquatic environment was calculated by summing all the impacts no agonist or antagonist effects were considered when summing concentrations masses or impacts geometrical mean values were added and considered as the total mean the error for the total mean was the sum of 95 confidence intervals limits 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentration and mass 3 1 1 organic micropollutants 225 261 organic micropollutants 86 presented at least one concentration in literature and wwtp stakeholders data the 36 organic

micropollutants 59 presented reliability index of 1 123 had more than one available data and 30 had only one available data mean concentrations and masses were calculated for these 153 compounds the reliability index allowed to eliminate substances poorly quantified with high limit of quantification such as methanol or hydrazine concentrations ranged from 0 1 ng l 1 to around 5 µg l 1 table 1 this underlined the high variety of concentrations 75 of the concentrations were below 0 1 µg l 1 annual masses ranged between 0 5 kg to 26 tons 75 of the annual mass were below 0 6 tons 15 compounds had concentrations masses higher than the 90th centile i 9 pharmaceuticals valsartan irbesartan ranitidine hydrochlorothiazide chlordiazepoxide sotalol furosemide carbamazepine atenolol and ii np1ec nonylphenol ethoxyacetic acid trichloromethane tetrachloroethylene dichloromethane ampa aminomethylphosphonic acid and dehp bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate pharmaceuticals concentrations in the french effluents were in accordance with the data in europe verlicchi et al 2012 results highlighted that some pharmaceuticals have high emissions to the environment compared to other organic micropollutants these high masses may be due to i high concentrations in wastewaters ii low sorption to sludge iii poor biodegradability iv transformation in parent compounds of conjugated forms or v combination of these hypotheses dehp is a plasticizer used in many manufactured products wormuth et al 2006 tetrachloromethane dichloromethane and tetrachloroethylene are chemicals used in many industries ampa is a transformation product of glyphosate and phosphonates present in washing powders and liquids grandcoin et al 2017 np1ec is a transformation product of nonylphenol polyethoxylates which are common surfactants used in many chemical products ying et al 2002 and can no longer be used without authorization since july 2019 reach ue n 999 2017 and 2020 171 annex xiv for some of these highest concentrated organic micropollutants eqs were available 1650 452 2 5 2 5 and 1 3 µg l 1 for dichloromethane ampa carbamazepine trichloromethane and dehp respectively in this study estimated concentrations in effluents were 3 01 2 81 3 21 range from 95 to 95 confidence interval 1 12 0 59 2 14 0 40 0 29 0 54 0 58 0 55 0 61 and 0 73 0 69 0 77 µg l 1 for dichloromethane ampa carbamazepine trichloromethane and dehp respectively in this case all effluent concentrations were lower than eqs in french survey it is considered that a substance should be monitored if concentration in effluent was above ten times its eqs consideration of a mean dilution factor of 10 in the aquatic environment applying this rule none of these molecules should be monitored concentrations in french rivers were also found survey from 1st of january 2015 and 31st of december 2018 http www naiades eaufrance fr consulted the 20th and 23rd of september 2019 for these 15 organic micropollutants mean concentrations were calculated with all obtained data with the same hypotheses as for wwtp effluents when quantification frequency was lower than 10 no mean concentration was calculated all the mean concentrations found in rivers remained below the effluent ones but the ratio between those concentrations effluent river was variable depending on the compounds underlying that considering a common dilution factor to predict the concentration in the river from the effluent one may contribute to calculation error of the risk quotient dehp ampa furosemide carbamazepine and atenolol had concentrations in effluent 2 to 4 times higher than mean concentrations in rivers sotalol hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan had concentrations in effluent 7 11 and 16 times higher respectively than mean concentrations in rivers thus wwtp may contribute in a significant way to occurrences in rivers indeed except ampa which can also be emitted by agricultural emissions all cited micropollutants originate from urban activities those 15 compounds 10 of the compounds represented 70 of the total mass of the 153 organic micropollutants 48 for the 9 pharmaceuticals and 22 for the other 6 compounds the total mass of the 153 organic micropollutants released in the environment by french wwtp was around 147 tons between 107 and 223 tons considering confidence intervals 3 1 2 inorganic micropollutants a concentration was estimated for 24 25 96 inorganic compounds fig 1 thallium was searched in effluents but never quantified it was not therefore considered concentrations ranged from 0 01 µg l 1 mercury to 159 µg l 1 iron the total mass released in the environment was around 1 892 tons range 1 382 to 3 005 tons main contributors to the total mass were in decreasing order iron 42 boron 17 aluminum 10 zinc 9 and manganese 7 most of organic micropollutants are synthetic substances produced by human activities pah are also produced by natural sources such as forest fire but inorganic micropollutants are naturally present in the environment and increase of concentrations in environment compartments is also linked to human activities natural presence in water and non biodegradability can explain that concentrations of inorganic micropollutants are generally higher than those of organic micropollutants mean concentrations estimated in this study in the effluent are close to environmental concentration salpeteur and angel 2010 and above french drinking water limits as for organic micropollutants concentrations were compared to eqs and mean rivers concentrations for the highest concentrations in wwtp effluents only zinc has eqs stated at 7 8 or 3 1 µg l 1 depending on water alkalinity for some rivers zinc should be monitored as its mean concentration in effluents was 35 33 37 range µg l 1 thus superior to ten times the lowest eqs aluminum concentration in effluents was half of the mean concentration in rivers iron and manganese concentration in effluents were close to rivers concentration boron and zinc concentrations were respectively 6 and 20 times higher in wwtp effluents than in rivers concentrations wwtp might only be a major contributor of inorganic micropollutants for boron and zinc which was in accordance with their use by human activities in urban areas 3 2 potential impacts of organic micropollutants 3 2 1 human health the impact on human health of organic micropollutants was calculated with the 94 substances with characterization factors over the 261 selected organic micropollutants 36 and over the 153 organic micropollutants with estimated concentrations 61 this was due to the lack of concentrations and or characterization factors butylphenol aspirin ibuprofen cimetidine hydrochlorothiazide βe2 caffeine and theophylline had characterization factors equal to 0 the impact on human health was estimated with compounds representing 48 of the characterized organic micropollutants mass impacts ranged from 0 to 2 daly fig 2 a with a total average impact of 6 daly main contributors were benzo b fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene indomethacin dicofol indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene pentabromodiphenylethers dibenzo a h anthracene and diclofenac with respective contributions of 28 16 15 13 12 6 3 and 1 of the total impact considering substances with at least 1 contribution to the total impact those eight compounds represented only 4 of the 94 characterized organic micropollutants mass but 94 of the total potential impact on human health it is thus important not only to consider the mass released in the environment for prioritization but also toxicity as stated by oldenkamp et al 2018 among these 8 compounds 4 are pah that are produced by human activities and natural sources and thus are ubiquist in environmental matrices the 2 following compounds are already banned of use dicofol is an acaricide forbidden since 2010 in france and pentabromodiphenylethers are a group of flame retardant forbidden since 2004 in france their low residual presence in wwtp effluents is thus relied to illegal use or persistence in the environment only indomethacin and diclofenac both anti inflammatory drugs are still used in france compounds with the highest potential impacts to human health corresponded mainly to recognized carcinogenic ones especially pah and polybromodiphenylethers muñoz et al 2008 studied the impact on human health of 98 micropollutants using a scenario in which they were emitted to soil use for agricultural crop irrigation with characterization factors coming from two different methods first method edip 97 scores expressed in m3 highlighted two substances with the highest impact on human health gemfibrozil and nicotine 2nd method uses lca scores expressed in kg dcb eq highlighted two others substances 2 3 7 8 tcdd and hexachlorobenzene in our study nicotine was not considered 2 3 7 8 tcdd and hexachlorobenzene were first selected but not taken into account due to non available concentration data in french effluents gemfibrozil was characterized for human toxicity and showed only around 0 01 contribution to the total potential impact difference in results came from the lca methods used for characterization factors calculation and from the choice of compartment in which emission is made and the exposure pathway via crops irrigated with treated effluent ortiz de garcía et al 2017 using a similar methodology based on lca only studied pharmaceutical compounds over 49 substances they were able to quantify the impact of 41 ones the total impact calculated considering their masses and characterization factors was 36 cases which was 2 log higher than the 0 8 cases we found for our 94 substances it was only possible to convert our results in cases the total mass emitted to the environment is an explanation to the difference as it was 234 tons for their study and only 71 tons for ours considering only pharmaceuticals compounds of our study 46 substances the total impact was 0 1 cases and the total mass was 37 tons confirming that the emitted mass is a critical point for the impact on human health in our study characterized pharmaceuticals represented 52 of the total mass and around 14 of the total impact meaning that other less concentrated compounds had high impacts on human health due to high toxicity if we considered only common pharmaceuticals compounds between both studies 16 their impact was one log higher than ours fig 3 a in terms of mass released to the environment only carbamazepine diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole had same orders of magnitude ee2 and trimethoprim had mass higher in our study with one log difference for others masses were lower in our study with one log difference for norfloxacine azithromycine ciprofloxacin naproxen alprazolam βe2 fluoxetine clarithromycin and ibuprofen and with 2 logs difference for acetaminophen and omeprazole those differences highlighted the need to consider geographical difference between countries some characterization factors were different between the two studies probably due to the update of usetox database except for naproxen ciprofloxacin trimethoprim acetaminophen sulfamethoxazole and norfloxacin with same order of magnitude trimethoprim and diclofenac had impact superior in our study with one log difference ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole and naproxen had similar impacts in both studies for the other substances impacts were lower in our study with 1 2 3 or 4 logs difference for βe2 and ibuprofen our database gave null characterization factor avoiding comparison for substances with the same characterization factors the difference between the two studies came from the emitted mass in aquatic environment in accordance with available comparison it meant that probably due to difference in terms of use pharmaceuticals potential impacts to human health could be strongly impacted by the mass emitted to the environment nevertheless both studies showed low impact on human health whatever the considered micropollutants were other studies only evaluated the risk linked to the presence of organic micropollutants in drinking water hollender et al 2018 searched more than 500 organic micropollutants in drinking water they found 123 substances with concentrations above quantification limits and showed that there was no significant risk for the consumption of these water due to organic micropollutants presence comparison of the measured concentrations with a threshold value of 0 1 µg l 1 threshold of toxicological concern approach enault et al 2015 compared the contribution of environmental micropollutants exposure 11 mineral elements and 73 organic micropollutants they also showed a minor risk due to the consumption of drinking water due to poor exposure via water although some micropollutants lead non dioxin like polychlorobiphenyls pfoa pfos might have a non negligible risk compared to air or food exposure de jesus gaffney et al 2015 showed with quotient risk analysis that 16 pharmaceuticals compounds quantified over 31 searched ones present in surface water underground water and drinking water did not show an elevated risk to human health although those studies concerned drinking water it tended to confirm our results as contamination of drinking waters partly occurred because of wwtp emissions especially for compounds only used in everyday life such as pharmaceuticals in our study the total impact of organic micropollutants released in aquatic environment through wwtp effluents on human health was low due to i the absence of direct exposure to these molecules ii the buffer role of the environment and iii the treatment steps before exposure drinking water ozonation activated carbon treatments than can eliminate a huge part of organic micropollutants simazaki et al 2015 3 2 2 aquatic environment over the 153 organic micropollutants with estimated concentrations 88 58 had ecotoxicity characterization factors the impact on aquatic environment was estimated with compounds representing 44 of the organic micropollutants mass impacts ranged from 13 103 to 49 109 pdf m3 d fig 2b main contributors to the total impact 61 109 pdf m3 d were cypermethrin pcb 101 βe2 amoxicillin and aclonifen with respective contributions of 82 12 2 and 1 as cypermethrin had a very high score we also included in the list with the highest impacts 1 2 5 6 9 10 hbcdd boscalid dicofol isodrin and dichlorvos which had a least 1 of the total impact calculated without cypermethrine those 10 compounds represented around 2 of the 88 organic micropollutants mass but 99 of the total impact cypermethrin is a pesticide which use is limited in france pcb 101 is an ubiquist polychlorobiphenyl forbidden since 1987 in france but highly refractory to degradation in the environment βe2 is a natural hormone produced by humans and animals it is a well know endocrine disruptor and this estrogenic effect has already been observed after discharged of treated water in river miège et al 2009b but this molecule presents also high ecotoxicity for aquatic environment which implies a high effect factor and a high impact calculated with our approach by comparison ee2 well known to have higher endocrine disruption effect than βe2 jobling et al 2006 had a lower potential impact because its ecotoxicity expressed in the effect factor was lower amoxicillin beta lactam from the aminopenicillin family is a well used antibiotic in france 1 2 5 6 9 10 hbcdd is a flame retardant which use was progressively reduced since 2011 due to suspicion of endocrine disruption effect dicofol isodrine and dichlorvos are pesticides which uses are forbidden in france on the contrary aclonifen and boscalid use is authorized in france both pesticides among those main contributors suspected endocrine disruptors were present pcb chlorinated pesticides brominated flame retardant matthiessen et al 2018 vilela et al 2018 even if this effect is not considered in the effect factor used to calculate the ecotoxicity characterization factor for the ten compounds having the highest impacts on aquatic environment we observed that the exposure factor had low influence on the potential impact as it was close to 100 for all compounds thus mass fate factor and effect factor had the highest influence the effect factor had a great influence as its contribution to the impact was between 45 and 72 the emitted mass and fate factor had similar contributions between 7 and 32 in that case toxicity of the substances had more effect than the quantity released to the environment or the degradation potency of those molecules other studies used life cycle assessment tools to determine potential impacts of micropollutants emitted by wwtp on aquatic environment muñoz et al 2008 with the study of one wwtp in spain showed that fluoxetine triclosan and ciprofloxacin had greatest potential impacts on aquatic environment with both models they used with edip97 model 2 3 7 8 tcdd had high contribution to the impact whereas uses lca model highlighted ibuprofen in our study fluoxetine triclosan ciprofloxacin and ibuprofen ranked in decreasing order of contribution at the 49th 30th 43rd and 82nd positions respectively in our case the molecules with highest impacts were not considered in muñoz et al 2008 ibuprofen had low contribution in our study due to the difference of emitted mass and or evaluation of characterization factor not the same models 2 3 7 8 tcdd was in our initial list but not considered due to lack of french concentration data in wwtp effluents nevertheless its usetox characterization factor was among the highest meaning that even with probably low concentration in effluent highly hydrophobic compound its impact should be among the highest ortiz de garcía et al 2017 only studied pharmaceutical compounds the total impact on aquatic environment of their 45 characterized pharmaceuticals was in same order of magnitude of our 88 substances total impact respectively 1 4 1010 and 6 1 1010 pdf m3 d the huge difference was the mass as already shown for human toxicity 236 tons and 64 tons for 45 pharmaceuticals and 88 substances respectively it proved that substances with very low concentrations can have a great impact on aquatic environment contrary to the potential impact on human health taking into account other substances than pharmaceuticals was of great concern when considering only our 37 characterized pharmaceuticals 38 of the mass and 4 of the impact emitted mass and impact had one log less than ortiz de garcia s results thus both results seemed consistent it highlighted once more that geographical situation was very important when estimating potential impacts among the 45 substances we had calculated the impact for the 19 substances in common fig 3b the total emitted mass was 70 and 10 tons for their study and ours respectively and the total impact was 1 3 1010 and 2 2 109 pdf m3 d respectively as already shown previously mass emitted to the environment were different except for salicylic acid estrone and norfloxacin same order of magnitude contrary to toxicity characterization factors only amoxicillin clarithromycin estrone and venlafaxine characterization factors were not in the same order of magnitude difference occurred for potential impacts on aquatic environment mainly due to the difference of emitted mass in both studies βe2 azithromycin and clarithromycin had very high potential impact hormone and antibiotics macrolides showed also high ecotoxicity prediction of concentrations in aquatic environment crossed with estimation of ecotoxicity allowed also to study potential impacts on aquatic environment lindim et al 2019 in their study the bioavailable concentrations of 54 pharmaceuticals were predicted in different rivers thanks to fugacity model stream eu and their ecotoxicity effect was evaluated in percentage of the total potentially affected fraction paf using ec50 of each substance in their study some pharmaceuticals with highest contribution to predicted toxic pressure were among the list of the most impacting pharmaceuticals in our study diclofenac ee2 erythromycin ciprofloxacin neale et al 2015 coupled analytical tools and biological bioassays with mixture toxicity modeling to in vitro effects of micropollutants to detected organic micropollutants in water they showed that for some effect few molecules contributed to a large amount of the impact which was in accordance with our findings johnson et al 2019 studied the change of wastewater treatment process on the biodiversity of macroinvertebrates in a river of the united kingdom between 1970 and 2010 they studied the evolution of bmwp index biological monitoring working party and the spear indexes species at risk during time in the river flow one carbon filter was set up between 2008 and 2014 as tertiary treatment during this period no significant impact on macroinvertebrates was noticed due to the use of activated carbon the observed improvement of biodiversity was related to the improvement of oxygen levels during the whole study authors estimated that in this case pollutants present in wwtp effluent were not a great threat compared to other emissions such as agricultural ones other articles confirmed our results showing an impact on aquatic environment richmond et al 2018 analyzed pharmaceutical compounds in 190 aquatic insects larvae and other aquatic invertebrates and riparian spiders they showed possible bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms such as brown trout and terrestrial organisms spiders and platypus consuming insects larvae and insects no effect of bioaccumulation was studied ojemaye and petrik 2019 analyzed 15 organic micropollutants pharmaceutical compounds perfluoroalkyl compounds and compounds from chemical industry in fish caught near cape town eleven molecules were detected at least in one body part of each fish with risk quotient results showed that micropollutants present in fish represent a potential risk to fish and humans that consume them our results are in accordance with a low but real risk of the presence of organic micropollutants in aquatic environment bioaccumulation and risk for organisms remaining question is that neither our study nor literature show the deleterious effect if any of bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms other studies using mixture of micropollutants showed cocktail effects but these studies were made in lab control conditions with concentrations generally higher than in real environment cizmas et al 2015 silva et al 2002 rajapakse et al 2001 thrupp et al 2018 verlicchi et al 2012 showed high risk of some pharmaceuticals in aquatic environment using pec pnec method antibiotics especially macrolides in common in our studies were shown to have great impact or risk on the aquatic environment bioaccumulation endocrine disruption and toxicity of micropollutants had been already observed and quantified in literature with different methods our results tended to confirm negative effects of micropollutants released by wwtp in aquatic environment many studies focused on emerging micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals here we highlighted potential impacts of recalcitrant and persistent compound and pharmaceuticals furthermore literature and our study also proved that whatever the method used to evaluate risk or impact it is necessary to cross released or environmental concentration and ecotoxicity effect to determine negative effects of organic micropollutants on aquatic environment high potential impacts of both persistent and emerging compounds imply that both source reduction and addition of tertiary treatment might have significant impact on the reduction of micropollutants burden to the aquatic environment 3 3 potential impacts of inorganic micropollutants 3 3 1 human health over the 24 inorganic micropollutants with estimated concentrations 15 63 had human toxicity characterization factors missing ones were for fe b al mn rb li ti co and u sn and se had null characterization factors the impact on human health was estimated with compounds representing only 17 of the inorganic micropollutants mass indeed highly concentrated compounds in effluents such as fe and al were not characterized impacts ranged from 0 sn and se to 503 as daly as and zn were the main contributors to the total impact of 818 daly fig 4 with respective contributions of 62 and 29 those two compounds represented 63 of the 15 characterized inorganic micropollutants mass 3 3 2 aquatic environment over the 24 inorganic micropollutants with estimated concentrations 19 79 had ecotoxicity characterizations factors missing ones were for b rb li ti and u the impact on aquatic environment was estimated with compounds representing 76 of the inorganic micropollutants mass impacts ranged from 1595 278 hg to 1 973 471 331 644 al pdf m3 d al fe and cu were the main contributors to the total impact of 2 858 392 569 287 pdf m3 d fig 5 with respective contributions of 69 15 and 12 those three compounds represented 69 of the 19 characterized inorganic micropollutants mass it is difficult to conclude on the potential impacts of inorganic micropollutants on human health and aquatic environment indeed they are naturally present in the environment making difficult to assess the real effects due to the release by wwtp on aquatic organisms and humans if usetox provides characterizations factors for metals they are considered as interim and should be interpreted with caution as they present a high degree of uncertainty fantke et al 2017 4 conclusions 286 substances were selected for this study and the potential impacts on human health and aquatic environment were estimated only with 1 3 of the molecules fig 6 total potential impacts on human health varied between 3 and 14 and 761 to 904 daly for respectively organic and inorganic micropollutants total potential impacts on aquatic environment varied between 18 and 22 and 2 408 to 3 407 billions pdf m3 d for respectively organic and inorganic micropollutants for toxicity and ecotoxicity the potential impacts were calculated with little number of molecules over the ones that had been selected this highlighted the lack of concentration data and characterization factors the actual knowledge of the effects of micropollutants on human health and aquatic environment is limited our studies raised question about the solution to reduce organic micropollutants impacts on human health and aquatic environment reduction or ban on using is preferred in france here we highlighted that ubiquitous micropollutants pah forbidden pcb or natural ones hormone are still found in effluents and contributed to the calculated impact meaning that this solution is not appropriate for all the micropollutants tertiary treatments are another way to reduce amount release to the environment but we need to know if they are sufficient to reduce micropollutants with highest impacts and studies to prove that degradation products if any are not more toxic than parent compounds furthermore we can also question the cost implied by the addition of tertiary treatments we need to know if the available tertiary treatment options are effective to remove micropollutants and if they are cost effective considering their cost and the decrease of impact our results raised questions about the impacts of inorganic micropollutants indeed they are naturally present in water most of the concentrations in wwtp effluents are closed to river concentrations but estimated impacts showed high risk due to these substances usetox is only based on chronic toxicity data and does not consider endocrine disrupting effect moreover effects of nanomaterials microplastics resistance genes etc were not considered by this method but can represent a huge impact on human health and aquatic environment however this method could be used to compare different scenarii addition of tertiary treatment reduction of emission at the source etc here as a first step of potential impacts estimation we focus on mean mass values at the scale of france we know that there is a spatial and temporal variation of micropollutants emission lindim et al 2019 one perspective is to use this kind of method at the scale of catchment basin considering other emissions coming from agriculture or industries furthermore other emissions on wwtp air sludge can be studied with this method and compared to effluent emissions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

17433,the activated sludge process is efficient for pollutant removal but was criticized for its large upfront investment and land area requirements improving nitrogen removal to levels sufficient to reduce eutrophication is a challenge to conventional nitrification and denitrification which is limited by process configuration with nitrate recirculation and environmental inhibition to satisfy stringent discharge standards within a compact plant footprint a sustainable strategy by moving nitrogen removal from mainstream to side stream is designed by a cycle of ammonium exchange regeneration and nitrogen removal aern combined with biological and physiochemical technologies ammonium was rapidly captured by ion exchangers then exchanged into regenerant and converted to n2 by chlorination or sharon anaerobic ammonia oxidation in the side stream the aern cycle can be combined with a high rate anaerobic aerobic process and chemical phosphorus removal to construct a haern process or inserted between a coagulation sedimentation tank and a membrane bioreactor to construct a caernm process two aern based systems both achieved efficient pollutants removal especially for nitrogen removal of 86 8 93 7 in long term running and didn t impair exchange capacity and properties of ion exchangers compared with the conventional anaerobic anoxic aerobic process aern based processes reduce land occupancy upfront investments and treatment costs by 59 9 71 1 25 5 38 0 and 2 3 31 0 respectively graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment nitrogen removal space energy ion exchange 1 introduction modern wastewater treatments have eliminated most of the water borne health hazards that have afflicted human society larsen et al 2016 lu et al 2018 however eutrophication persists as a global ecological threat because upgrading wastewater treatment plants wwtps to prevent excessive discharge of nutrients is challenging conley et al 2009 hautier et al 2014 wang 2012 wastewater treatment is commonly accomplished via an low cost activated sludge process but requires high upfront investments more than half for construction and large land areas van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 more stringent discharge standards all over the world table s1 have further increased the footprints required for wwtps because the lower dischargeable concentrations of substrates reduce reaction rates and prolong reaction times seasonal temperature variations further increase land area requirements for activated sludge wwtps because slower rates of biological reactions at lower temperatures increase hydraulic retention times hrt needed to ensure compliance with discharge standards the average land occupancy increased from 1 35 to 1 59 m2 m3 d when discharge standard was upgraded from grade ii to i a of chinese national standard gb 18918 2002 he et al 2018 furthermore the substantial increase in requirements for environmental water quality has compelled governments to increase control over pollutants in rainwater runoff rivers and other water sources xu et al 2019 thus developments of pollutant removal methods using low land area occupancies will be of interest in the whole industry of wastewater treatment in biological wastewater treatment systems nitrification is the rate limiting step that determines space requirements owing to its slow rate and sensitivity to inhibitory conditions such as low temperatures toxic compounds etc li et al 2018b tang and chen 2015 the breakdown of nitrification has caused the unstable operation in activated sludge processes and long term violations of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and total nitrogen tn in the effluent of full scale wwtps because populations of nitrifiers are difficult to recover due to low growth rates li et al 2018b moreover low carbon availability in domestic wastewater increases the space requirements and costs for improving nitrogen removal wang et al 2015 therefore improving nitrogen removal to levels sufficient to reduce eutrophication is challenging due to unstable efficiency limited land availability high upfront investments and increased operational costs hence there is a compelling need to develop new technologies for stable and efficient nitrogen removal that require less land occupancy than currently available processes one promising approach to these challenges is to implement anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox technology typically used in side streams for the treatment of warm and concentrated reject water in the mainstream van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 at present mainstream anammox has been successfully applied in the strass wwtp in austria the changi wwtp in singapore and the xi an wwtp in china li et al 2019 yeshi et al 2016 nevertheless these full scale applications were achieved by high strength reject water treatment strass high temperature in tropical region changi or suspended carriers xi an the contribution of anammox to nitrogen removal was 15 9 in the xi an wwtp li et al 2019 therefore the dilute and highly variable characteristics of influent wastewater combined with low temperatures and stringent discharge standards have slowed the process of adopting anammox in the mainstream laureni et al 2019 compared to biological nitrogen removal ion exchange ie technology achieves excellent nitrogen removal for domestic wastewater and has advantages of fast reaction kinetics high affinity and selectivity ease to operate and no sludge production malovanyy et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 methods for regenerating exhausted ion exchangers have been explored because one time use is technically and economically unfeasible jung et al 2004 lahav et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2015 using ie to move nitrogen removal from mainstream to side stream is a promising approach to solve challenges mentioned above and even promotes innovations in wastewater treatment processes herein we assessed the potentiality of ie to move nitrogen removal from mainstream to side stream a sustainable strategy within a compact footprint through cycles of nh4 n exchange regeneration and nitrogen removal aern was proposed pilot scale aern based systems were investigated to examine the efficacy of intensive pollutant removal the mass balance of pollutants and representative competitive ion ca2 in the proposed processes was constructed furthermore we conducted techno economic analysis and indicated the future research for the full scale application in wwtps the findings from this study will provide an insight into future flowsheets for wastewater treatment by abiotic nitrogen management from the mainstream and regenerant management from the side stream this will greatly reduce the land occupancy of wwtps and overcome the challenges that biological systems exert in terms of energy and greenhouse gas ghg emission 2 materials and methods 2 1 batch tests for nh4 n removal kinetics by ion exchange kinetic experiments were designed to compare the performance of biological nitrification and nh4 n ie under different temperatures the determination method of biological nitrification rate is shown in text s2 natural zeolite which had a mean particle size of 1 2 mm and an exchange capacity of 3 6 mg nh4 n g was obtained from jinyun county zhejiang province china and chosen as the ie exchanger for nh4 n removal the zeolite was washed by deionized water to remove any fine particulates or other undesirable materials before it was used for batch tests or loaded into zeolite packed filters after ten times of nh4 n exchange and regeneration a batch test for nh4 n removal was conducted for the artificial domestic wastewater which was prepared by dosing ammonium chloride into the effluent of the full scale anaerobic anoxic aerobic aao system to maintain the nh4 n concentration of 25 mg l 200 ml wastewater was put into a 500 ml beaker and mixed with 8 g zeolite then the beaker was placed in a thermostatic shaker to control temperature of 10 0 0 1 and 20 0 0 1 c and shaken at 200 rpm with average ph 7 35 in the wastewater 98 9 and 99 5 nh4 n were calculated in the charged form at 10 and 20 c 10 ml homogenized samples were collected from the beaker at a regular interval of 5 min in the first 30 min and at an interval of 30 min in 0 5 14 h and filtered through an acetate cellulose membrane with mean pore size of 0 45 µm for nh4 n analysis 2 2 breakthrough experiments for nh4 n exchange by a zeolite packed filter the breakthrough experiments were designed to demonstrate the feasibility of zeolite filters and to provide applicable parameters of the empty bed contact time ebct and the operation time under different nh4 n concentrations in the influent the experiments were conducted in a filter 550 φ 30 mm packed with zeolite to a height of 300 mm and operated at 20 0 0 5 c the artificial domestic wastewater was continuously pumped into the zeolite packed filter at an ebct of 30 min 50 ml effluent sample was collected at the top of the filter every hour all the samples were filtered and analyzed for the nh4 n concentration before breakthrough the nh4 n concentration of 1 5 mg l was defined as the breakthrough point to control it to meet the most stringent discharge standards table s1 an identical breakthrough nh4 n concentration was used in all the experiments and thus the ebct of the zeolite packed filter was positively related to nh4 n concentration in the influent 2 3 column tests to determine relationship between ebct and nh4 n concentration in the effluent of zeolite packed filter three column tests were conducted for polluted river water at initial nh4 n concentration of 5 0 mg l by three zeolite packed filters with ebcts of 5 10 and 15 min respectively the experiments were conducted at 20 0 0 5 c and samples of effluent from the three filters were collected after 24 h continuous operation to determine the nh4 n concentration in order to illustrate effects of temperature on nh4 n removal from domestic wastewater eight column tests were carried out at temperature of 20 0 0 5 and 10 0 0 5 c by using four zeolite packed filters with ebcts of 10 15 20 and 30 min the nh4 n concentration in the effluent after 24 h continuous operation was determined thrice for each zeolite packed filter 2 4 batch tests for multiple cyclic nh4 n exchange and regeneration in order to investigate the accumulated concentration of nh4 n in the regenerant for the posterior nitrogen removal or recovery process batch tests for multiple cyclic nh4 n exchange and regeneration were conducted by the zeolite packed filter 550 φ 30 mm and regenerant of 20 g l nacl with ph of 7 0 during the ammonium exchange stage the artificial domestic wastewater was continuously pumped into the zeolite packed filter at an ebct of 30 min until the saturation point 25 mg l then the nacl regenerant was supplied into the filter in the up flow mode from an 1 l vessel and recycled by pump between the filter and the vessel for 4 h in the regeneration stage 10 ml regenerant samples were termly collected from the vessel at an interval of 15 min in the first 1 h and then at an interval of 1 h during 1 4 h the regenerant sample was filtered and analyzed for the nh4 n concentration then the second nh4 n exchange and regeneration cycle was started by switching the zeolite packed filter into the nh4 n exchange stage and the filter was regenerated by a newly prepared 1 l regenerant ten cycles of nh4 n exchange and regeneration were carried out and the data were collected at regeneration cycle 1 2 3 4 5 and 10 2 5 the pilot scale haern system for domestic wastewater treatment a pilot scale haern system consisting of a high rate anoxic aerobic ao reactor and an aern module was fed with wastewater from the grit chamber of dongqu wwtp shanghai china and operated for 120 days at a constant flow rate of 540 l d hrts of the anoxic and aerobic tank in the ao module were 1 5 and 2 0 h respectively aluminum chloride was added into the aerobic tank at dosage of 3 5 mg al l for phosphorus removal an agitator was installed in the anoxic tank to keep the sludge suspended and air was supplied through micropore pipes to the aerobic tank to maintain dissolved oxygen do of 3 0 4 0 mg l sludge retention time srt of the ao module was kept at 8 d by discharging waste activated sludge from the aerobic tank the mixed liquor recirculation ratio and returned activated sludge ratio were maintained at 200 and 100 by peristaltic pumps respectively the effluent of the ao reactor was fed into the aern module which consisted of two zeolite packed filters a regenerant storage tank an untreated regenerant storage tank a sharon reactor and an anammox reactor fig 3b the filter was a cylinder 820 φ 100 mm packed with zeolite to a height of 720 mm and operated in the up flow mode with an ebct of 15 min two zeolite packed filters were operated in a succession of repeated cycles each consisting of three stages of continuous operation 24 h regeneration 2 h and idle 22 h one filter was regenerated after 24 h continuous operation and then the flow was switched to the other to continue operation the first filter was backwashed and then regenerated for 2 h by pumping regenerant 10 g l nacl solution 32 1 c in the up flow mode from a 21 6 l regenerant storage tank to immerse the exhausted zeolite and then backwashed to remove residual salt and maintained idle until put back in service for the next exchange cycle a naclo solution of 1 0 v v was used to remove organic matters and biofilms attached on the zeolite every week in the side stream system the used regenerant was flowed into the untreated regenerant storage tank in which 80 mg l na2co3 was added to remove ca2 and to provide alkalinity for the sharon anammox process the caco3 precipitate was discharged from the bottom of the storage tank every two days then the regenerant was fed into the sharon and anammox reactor at flow rate of 21 6 l d in sequence and the effluent of the anammox reactor flowed into the regenerant storage tank for the next regeneration the effective volumes of the sharon and anammox reactor were 3 6 and 7 2 l respectively in the sharon reactor three flat sheet polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes zizheng environmental inc shanghai china with an average pore size of 0 22 µm and a total effective filtration area of 0 06 m2 125 80 mm were mounted vertically above air diffusers the reactor was inoculated with activated sludge from the full scale aao system and put into operation after 28 days microbial acclimation period the effluent was sucked using a peristaltic pump with membrane flux of 15 l m2 h and the do was controlled at 1 0 2 0 mg l by a gas flow meter the trans membrane pressure was monitored with a pressure gage an intermittent filtration mode with 2 min pause for every 10 min suction was employed to alleviate membrane fouling mechanical cleaning and in place chemical cleaning were conducted for membranes with a 0 5 v v naclo solution when trans membrane pressure exceeded 35 kpa anammox was carried out in an up flow anaerobic biofilter 950 φ 100 mm made of acrylic glass the biofilter was packed with cylindrical shaped polyethylene carrier elements specific density of 0 96 0 98 g cm3 at filling rate of 32 the packing carriers were 12 mm in height and 24 mm in diameter with a cross inside the cylinder and longitudinal stripes on the outside the carmine anammox biofilm was attached on the carriers after 50 days inoculation with seed sludge from a pilot scale anammox reactor for reject water treatment the temperature and ph were controlled at 32 1 c and 8 0 0 2 for the sharon anammox process 2 6 the pilot scale caernm system for domestic wastewater treatment a pilot scale caernm system consisting of a coagulation sedimentation unit csu an aern and a membrane bioreactor mbr module was also continuously fed with wastewater of dongqu wwtp at 72 l d for 100 days the csu module was composed of a coagulation tank 0 75 l and a settler 1 5 l with al2so4 4 0 mg al l and polyacrylamide 0 3 mg l dosing into the coagulation tank at 200 rpm in the aern module two zeolite packed filters were operated in a succession of repeated cycles each consisting of three stages of continuous operation 24 h regeneration 2 h and idle 22 h the zeolite packed filter 390 φ 100 mm was designed with a packing height of 300 mm and an ebct of 45 min in the regeneration stage the naclonacl regenerant was pumped into each filter in the up flow mode from an 1 l vessel the molar ratio of hypochlorite to nitrogen captured by ion exchangers in the continuous operation in the naclonacl solution was 1 75 the nacl concentration was 20 g l and the ph value for regeneration was 10 0 zhang et al 2017 after regeneration the column was washed to remove residual

mbr the tail gas from the mbr module was introduced into the regenerant tank to remove ca2 and the precipitated caco3 was discharged every two days 2 7 analytical methods concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n nitrite nitrogen nitrate nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and suspended solids ss were analyzed according to standard methods chinese nepa 2012 mixed liquor suspended solids and volatile suspended solids in the aerobic tank of the ao and aao system were determined twice a week do and ph were monitored using an hq30d portable meter hach usa concentrations of na k ca2 mg2 al3 fe3 and cu2 in the wastewater were determined using the icp 7510 shimadzu japan differences of pollutants in the effluent were compared by one way factor analysis of variance using office excel 2016 microsoft usa the length of the unused bed lub was calculated according to liu et al 2011a the method of microbial community analysis was shown in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 rapid and excellent nh4 n removal by ion exchange biological nitrification required hrt 10 h to decrease the nh4 n concentration to below 5 0 mg l fig 1 a and low temperature further increased the required hrt because it slowed down activities of nitrifiers li et al 2018b ie by ion exchangers after cyclic nh4 n exchange and regeneration also had efficient nh4 n removal capacity and decreased the nh4 n concentration to below 1 0 mg l within 30 min and temperature was not an important influencing factor for nh4 n exchange guaya et al 2015 fig 1b shows that the nh4 n concentration was maintained below 1 5 mg l at an ebct of 30 min for 35 30 and 15 h by feeding domestic wastewater initial rainwater and polluted river water into zeolite packed filters respectively the lub values increased from 132 to 180 and 225 mm with influent nh4 n concentration rising from 5 to 8 and 25 mg l which was also reported by liu et al 2011a wall effects on the mass transfer increased the percentage of lub in the loaded bed and will be decreased in the large scale application martin et al 2013 for domestic wastewater nh4 n efflux concentration after 24 h exchange was reduced below 5 0 mg l at ebct 15 min fig 1c decreased temperature increased nh4 n exchange because it is a spontaneous and exothermic process zhao et al 2010 allowing nh4 n 5 0 mg l to be reached for ebct 10 min for initial rainwater and polluted river water zeolite packed filters with ebct 12 5 and 10 min maintained nh4 n 1 5 mg l the rapid and efficient nh4 n capture relies on the diffusion of nh4 n through water to the zeolite surface where nh4 n is adsorbed at ie sites mark and robert 2017 therefore if efficient and cheap regeneration of exhausted ion exchangers can be achieved low footprint treatment systems can be constructed using ie as a rapid unit for nitrogen removal 3 2 side stream regeneration strategies regeneration and restoration of ion exchangers to remove both nh4 n and competitive cations are important to the future utility of ie for sustainable and economical nitrogen removal from wastewater ca2 mg2 and k are major competitive cations of nh4 n exchange in domestic wastewater cruz et al 2019 while concentrations of mg2 and k are greatly lower than ca2 table s2 ca2 is exchanged from wastewater and accumulated in the regenerant which can be periodically removed by caco3 precipitation fig 2 a captured nh4 n can be removed from ion exchangers by high concentration solutions of nacl or acids malovanyy et al 2013 but nh4 n accumulated in the regenerant requires further treatment to remove nitrogen as shown in fig 2b nacl regeneration obtained nh4 n concentration of 400 600 mg l in the regenerant in about 1 0 h corresponding to an approximately 20 fold concentration of nh4 n in domestic wastewater the concentrated nh4 n can be recovered as ammonia by air stripping precipitated as struvite or converted to gaseous nitrogen fig 2c struvite recovery is usually ineffective because of its low molar ratio of phosphorus to nitrogen and shortage of magnesium li et al 2015 tchobanoglous et al 2003 so we did not evaluate the approach for nitrogen recovery heating the used regenerant by a wastewater source heat pump will benefit both regeneration of ion exchangers and nitrogen recovery air stripping or biological removal air stripping after ph elevation by alkali is a feasible and economic approach to recovering ammonia from wastewater the residual nh4 n after air stripping requires no further treatment because the regenerant is not discharged but recirculated in the aern cycle based on literature data errico et al 2018 the aern with air stripping was calculated to yield 4302 tons of ammonium sulfate per year creating an annual benefit of 0 207 million for a wwtp with a flow rate of 50 000 m3 d and removed nh4 n of 25 mg l on a global scale interference with the nitrogen cycle by converting n2 to reactive nitrogen for human use is one of the three earth system processes having already transgressed the bounds of sustainability rockström et al 2009 in view of the large demand for reactive nitrogen staying within the suggested boundaries of sustainability requires a dramatic increase in nitrogen recovery from wastewater which could supply about 25 of the present anthropogenic production of reactive nitrogen larsen et al 2016 and save 250 terawatt hours of energy li et al 2015 naclonacl regeneration provides an attractive method to achieve sustainable removal of nitrogen from wastewater through ie by oxidizing adsorbed nh4 n to n2 a long term ie regeneration cycle had no obvious impairment on ie capacity or microporosity of the zeolite zhang et al 2017 but the regeneration cost was relatively high about 6 1 kg n the strategy is suitable for cases where limited space is available for control of water pollutants such as on site treatment of initial rainwater and sewer overflow or emergency treatment of pollution naclo can be generated electrochemically using a highly concentrated nacl solution as both regenerant and electrolyte for cost savings the electrooxidation of ammonia in the regenerant can be scheduled for hours when electricity prices are lower lahav et al 2013 regeneration through conventional nitrification and denitrification offers environmental and economic advantages jung et al 2004 zheng et al 2015 but requires long reaction times controlled temperature and ph and available carbon sources for denitrification coupling nacl regeneration with sharon and anammox is more efficient than the nitrification denitrification process and substantially less expensive than naclonacl regeneration the limiting factors of anammox for low strength wastewater treatment such as low nh4 n concentration high organic matter concentrations and the presence of toxic substances laureni et al 2019 speth et al 2016 can be overcome effectively by the aern cycle anammox bacteria can survive in saline wastewater and acquire high nitrogen removal rate of 1 0 4 5 kg n m3 d at a salinity of 30 33 g l li et al 2018a which is 3 6 16 0 times of that of the conventional nitrification for domestic wastewater tchobanoglous et al 2003 high salinity selectively suppresses nitrite oxidizing activity and thus nitrite accumulates for anammox ye et al 2009 side stream nitrogen removal circumvents the risk of tn violation for mainstream application of the anammox owing to residual nitrate generated eq 1 sodium carbonate is dosed into the regenerant to compensate for alkalinity required in the sharon anammox process and to provide na for the regeneration of ion exchangers 1 nh 4 1 32 no 2 0 066 hco 3 0 13 h 1 02 n 2 0 25 no 3 0 066 c h 2 o 0 5 n 0 15 2 03 h 2 o in this study naclonacl regeneration and nacl regeneration coupling with the sharon anammox process were considered as two side stream regeneration strategies and tested by pilot scale systems 3 3 construction of wastewater treatment processes with small space requirements fig 3 a illustrates a typical process used to comply with a stringent discharge standard grade i a of gb 18918 2002 the illustrated process consists of an aao system a csu and a denitrification filter the process occupies a large footprint has a total hrt of 26 6 h by considering both reactors and settlers consumes substantial energy and chemicals and generates large amounts of waste activated sludge with low methane production potential owing to excessive aeration fig 3b and 3c illustrate two aern based processes constructed to overcome drawbacks of the typical aao process and to meet requirements of two different scenarios for the haern system fig 3b the wastewater treated by a primary settler is fed into the high rate ao unit to remove cod tp ss and part of tn and then flows into the aern unit to remove the residual tn before discharge the high rate ao with low hrt and srt inhibits the growth of nitrifiers and removes the majority of organic matters by biomass assimilation and accumulation rather than oxidation enhancing anaerobic degradability of the generated sludge ge et al 2013 the short srt also improves biological phosphorus removal chemical phosphorus precipitation by dosing aluminum salt into the aerobic tank is required in some cases to meet the discharge concentration the aluminum salt inhibits the activity of nitrifiers liu et al 2011b resulting in more nh4 n remaining in the effluent considering that the short srt decreases sludge concentration in the ao and that aluminum coagulation improves sludge settleability the typical hrts for the anoxic tank aerobic tank and secondary settler are 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 h respectively hrts of the aern module with the sharon anammox process for nitrogen removal were calculated in details according to the constructed model text s9 one regeneration tank can be served for 12 ie reactors if durations of nh4 n exchange and regeneration are set to 22 and 2 h respectively if the nh4 n concentration in the regenerant is set at 250 mg l considering both ie capacity and nitrogen removal ability hrts of the sharon and anammox reactors are chosen as 4 0 and 8 0 h according to their typical nitrogen loads choi et al 2019 li et al 2018a speth et al 2016 if the removed nh4 n concentration is 8 0 mg l for the haern the equivalent hrt for the side stream system are 0 6 h therefore the total hrt of haern in fig 3b is 8 9 h for the caernm system fig 3c the wastewater is directly fed into the csu to remove particulate and colloidal cod tp and ss with a compact footprint most nh4 n remains in the effluent of the csu and is removed in the posterior aern module soluble cod is removed by the downstream mbr the csu efficiently controls particles fed into the aern and reduces organic loads in the mbr the total hrt of the caernm is 3 5 h for aern with naclonacl regeneration and increases to 5 4 h if the sharon anammox regeneration is applied for typical domestic wastewater the caernm process removed almost all the nh4 n in the aern module and thus achieved a higher nitrogen removal than the haern process the mbr in fig 3c can be bypassed to form caern process for wastewater with low concentrations of soluble cod such as initial rainwater or polluted river water and thus a more compact process with a total hrt of about 1 5 h could be constructed 3 4 long term pollutant removal performances of haern and caernm as shown in table 1 the aern based processes achieved comparable cod nh4 n and tp removal to aao for domestic wastewater treatment with a more compact footprint fig 3 the haern 86 8 and caernm 93 7 systems obtained significantly higher nitrogen removal than the aao 62 9 although the influent had a lower cod tn ratio than the aao in the haern the ao removed 89 8 ss 91 5 cod and 86 9 tp and retained a proportion of nh4 n 29 1 that was removed in the aern the side stream sharon anammox removed 89 9 nitrogen from the regenerant and the residual nitrogen was recycled and removed in the next cycle microbial community structure analysis fig s1 showed that the sharon reactor enriched halotolerant bacteria e g candidatus kuenenia gonzalez silva et al 2017 and limnobacter garcía ruiz et al 2018 with relative abundance of 28 7 and 3 63 respectively and ammonium oxidizing bacteria nitrosomonas 0 82 and suppressed the nitrite oxidizing bacteria nitrolancea 0 16 and nitrospira 0 06 liu et al 2020 the anammox reactor enriched two anammox genera fig s2 candidatus kuenenia 21 13 and candidatus jettenia 0 41 and illustrated lower diversity but higher relative abundance than those operated under low salinity ji et al 2020 the results confirmed that anammox bacteria especially candidatus kuenenia could acclimate to salinity and reach stable operation in the caernm the csu removed 93 5 ss 51 9 cod and 97 7 tp tn was efficiently removed in the aern with the efflux concentration below 5 0 mg l 3 5 mass balance analysis of the aern based processes the mass balance analysis of haern fig 4 a indicates that the incoming n was mostly removed by the high rate ao 64 0 in which 49 7 n was converted to n2 by nitrification and denitrification 22 8 n was captured by ion exchangers then completely exchanged into regenerant and converted to n2 by the sharon anammox where 1 9 n was cycled in the side stream system because of the incomplete conversion of nh4 n and nox n in the anammox table 1 in the aao and sharon anammox system the average n2o emission was previously reported as 1 29 wang et al 2016 and 2 27 ali et al 2016 of the nitrogen load and thus 0 32 and 0 28 mg l nh4 n in the influent were converted to n2o in the aao and haern process the fate of ca2 indicates that 68 7 ca2 was removed in the ao and 24 8 was captured by ion exchangers exchanged into the regenerant and then precipitated as caco3 for the caernm fig 4b 12 5 n was removed in the csu in the particulate form 78 6 n was exchanged by ion exchangers and mostly oxidized by naclo to n2 77 5 without n2o production 1 7 n was exchanged into regenerant in the form of nitrate and then accumulated but didn t impair exchange capacity of regenerant the aern module removed the most proportion of ca2 46 5 and greatly reduced ghg emissions by capturing co2 from tail gas of the mbr high rate ao and csu separated 23 5 and 56 8 c from domestic wastewater into sludge and had the potential for carbon redirection to methane production and minimized carbon oxidation by microbes ge et al 2013 the ie reactor removed 1 9 and 6 9 c from the effluent of the high rate ao and csu which were mostly in the particulate and colloidal forms and recirculated to the influent by backwashing the residual c in the ie reactor was oxidized by naclo in the caernm 34 3 c was captured in the form of co2 to precipitate ca2 in regenerant high rate ao and csu removed 91 2 and 95 8 p by biological and chemical phosphorus removal in the ie reactor a small proportion of p was filtered or precipitated with ca2 released from ion exchangers wan et al 2017 and then removed by backwashing the accumulation of p was not observed on the surface of ion exchangers 3 6 long term variations of zeolite properties in the aern based process the initial ammonium exchange capacities of zeolites in the haern and caernm were 3 01 0 44 and 5 46 1 30 mg g after 10 times exchange and regeneration by nacl and naclonacl zeolites in the two systems achieved an equilibrium capacity of 2 32 0 41 and 4 48 0 96 mg g which were almost unchanged in the long term operation the data were coherent to our previous study zhang et al 2017 in which naclonacl regeneration effectively accelerated nh4 n exchange and maintained an exchange capacity 80 of unused zeolites table s3 x ray powder diffraction fig s3 and s4 results indicated that the main mineral species of zeolites were unchanged after long term operation for artificial and real domestic wastewater treatment and both naclonacl and sharon anammox regeneration had insignificant impacts on the compositions of zeolites which mainly consisted of clinoptilolite and quartz lin et al 2013 compositional analysis of zeolites in the two aern based systems table s5 showed that contents of na and mg increased and other cations such as k and ca decreased after long term exchange and regeneration the high concentration of na in the regenerant exchanged k ca2 and mg2 on the zeolite and inhibited metal pollution and mg2 can be controlled by precipitating exchanged mg2 in the regenerant periodically the increasing na contents in zeolites increased both nh4 n exchange capacity and rate table s5 by enhancing film mass transfer rate lin et al 2013 textural analysis tables s4 and s6 suggested that the long term regeneration leads to an increased surface area and microporosity of zeolites with the micropore volume increased by 33 3 and 53 3 which benefited to enhance nh4 n exchange capacity these results confirmed that the stability and reusability of ammonium ion exchangers were almost unchanged for domestic wastewater treatment after repeated regeneration by naclonacl or sharon anammox 3 7 techno economic analysis the land occupancy upfront investment and treatment cost of the aao process and two aern based processes coupled with the sharon anammox regeneration were compared by using a wwtp with treatment capacity of 50 000 m3 d under a stringent discharge standard and the results are shown in table 2 see text s10 for details the land occupancies of wwtp for haern and caernm are 59 9 and 71 1 less than that of aao owing to their greatly lower hrts the reduced space requirements save construction cost and thus the upfront investments required for haern and caernm are reduced by 38 0 and 25 5 compared to aao respectively in china wastewater treatment is expected to consume a land area of 1 90 104 m2 due to upgrading discharge standards to grade i a he et al 2018 and thus implementing the haern or caernm will reduce the land area by 1 14 or 1 36 104 hm2 respectively the savings in land area and investment will be substantial globally considering the global flow rate for domestic wastewater treatment of 1 04 109 m3 year larsen et al 2016 wastewater treatment industry heads toward 3 of global electricity consumption li et al 2015 lu et al 2018 the energy consumption of the aao is calculated to be 0 530 kwh m3 after comprehensively considering the mainstream process the sharon anammox and wastewater source heat pump the energy consumption of haern and caernm can be reduce by 27 4 and 19 4 respectively mainstream aeration is the dominant energy consuming process even when the aerobic hrt is substantially decreased and accounts for 46 8 or 35 1 of the total energy consumed by haern or caernm the wastewater source heat pump is the second most energy consuming process accounting for 27 3 or 41 0 in order to achieve a low nitrogen level in the effluent addition of an external carbon source is required in the aao and accounts for most chemical costs 74 6 in the aern based processes maintaining alkalinity for the sharon anammox is the dominant fraction of chemical cost in summary the total treatment costs for haern and caernm are 31 0 and 2 3 less than that for aao 4 conclusions we proposed a novel strategy by moving nitrogen removal from mainstream to side stream by an aern cycle nh4 n in the wastewater is rapidly and efficiently captured by ion exchangers then regenerated into the side stream system and converted to n2 by chlorination or sharon anammox methods the aern cycle can be combined with a high rate ao and chemical phosphorus removal to construct a haern process or inserted between a csu and an mbr to construct a caernm process long term operation for domestic wastewater treatment showed that the two aern based systems achieved more efficient nitrogen removal 86 8 93 7 than the conventional aao and had insignificant adverse to exchange capacity compositions and textural properties of ion exchangers compared with the aao process aern based processes can satisfy more stringent discharge standards and greatly reduce land occupancy upfront investments and treatment costs the aern cycle and derived processes proposed in this study can bring forward a sustainable strategy to upgrade wwtp to satisfy stringent discharge standards within a compact footprint and had potential for ghg emissions reduction and resources recovery further research can be focused on i more cost effective nitrogen recovery approach in the side stream ii novel ie reactor operated in continuous mode suitable for wwtps iii novel ion exchangers efficient in ammonium exchange and release resistant against scaling and biofouling and stable under repeated exchange and regeneration in the future the key challenges for full scale application of the proposed process were the adaptation of multi module systems

17433,the activated sludge process is efficient for pollutant removal but was criticized for its large upfront investment and land area requirements improving nitrogen removal to levels sufficient to reduce eutrophication is a challenge to conventional nitrification and denitrification which is limited by process configuration with nitrate recirculation and environmental inhibition to satisfy stringent discharge standards within a compact plant footprint a sustainable strategy by moving nitrogen removal from mainstream to side stream is designed by a cycle of ammonium exchange regeneration and nitrogen removal aern combined with biological and physiochemical technologies ammonium was rapidly captured by ion exchangers then exchanged into regenerant and converted to n2 by chlorination or sharon anaerobic ammonia oxidation in the side stream the aern cycle can be combined with a high rate anaerobic aerobic process and chemical phosphorus removal to construct a haern process or inserted between a coagulation sedimentation tank and a membrane bioreactor to construct a caernm process two aern based systems both achieved efficient pollutants removal especially for nitrogen removal of 86 8 93 7 in long term running and didn t impair exchange capacity and properties of ion exchangers compared with the conventional anaerobic anoxic aerobic process aern based processes reduce land occupancy upfront investments and treatment costs by 59 9 71 1 25 5 38 0 and 2 3 31 0 respectively graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment nitrogen removal space energy ion exchange 1 introduction modern wastewater treatments have eliminated most of the water borne health hazards that have afflicted human society larsen et al 2016 lu et al 2018 however eutrophication persists as a global ecological threat because upgrading wastewater treatment plants wwtps to prevent excessive discharge of nutrients is challenging conley et al 2009 hautier et al 2014 wang 2012 wastewater treatment is commonly accomplished via an low cost activated sludge process but requires high upfront investments more than half for construction and large land areas van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 more stringent discharge standards all over the world table s1 have further increased the footprints required for wwtps because the lower dischargeable concentrations of substrates reduce reaction rates and prolong reaction times seasonal temperature variations further increase land area requirements for activated sludge wwtps because slower rates of biological reactions at lower temperatures increase hydraulic retention times hrt needed to ensure compliance with discharge standards the average land occupancy increased from 1 35 to 1 59 m2 m3 d when discharge standard was upgraded from grade ii to i a of chinese national standard gb 18918 2002 he et al 2018 furthermore the substantial increase in requirements for environmental water quality has compelled governments to increase control over pollutants in rainwater runoff rivers and other water sources xu et al 2019 thus developments of pollutant removal methods using low land area occupancies will be of interest in the whole industry of wastewater treatment in biological wastewater treatment systems nitrification is the rate limiting step that determines space requirements owing to its slow rate and sensitivity to inhibitory conditions such as low temperatures toxic compounds etc li et al 2018b tang and chen 2015 the breakdown of nitrification has caused the unstable operation in activated sludge processes and long term violations of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and total nitrogen tn in the effluent of full scale wwtps because populations of nitrifiers are difficult to recover due to low growth rates li et al 2018b moreover low carbon availability in domestic wastewater increases the space requirements and costs for improving nitrogen removal wang et al 2015 therefore improving nitrogen removal to levels sufficient to reduce eutrophication is challenging due to unstable efficiency limited land availability high upfront investments and increased operational costs hence there is a compelling need to develop new technologies for stable and efficient nitrogen removal that require less land occupancy than currently available processes one promising approach to these challenges is to implement anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox technology typically used in side streams for the treatment of warm and concentrated reject water in the mainstream van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 at present mainstream anammox has been successfully applied in the strass wwtp in austria the changi wwtp in singapore and the xi an wwtp in china li et al 2019 yeshi et al 2016 nevertheless these full scale applications were achieved by high strength reject water treatment strass high temperature in tropical region changi or suspended carriers xi an the contribution of anammox to nitrogen removal was 15 9 in the xi an wwtp li et al 2019 therefore the dilute and highly variable characteristics of influent wastewater combined with low temperatures and stringent discharge standards have slowed the process of adopting anammox in the mainstream laureni et al 2019 compared to biological nitrogen removal ion exchange ie technology achieves excellent nitrogen removal for domestic wastewater and has advantages of fast reaction kinetics high affinity and selectivity ease to operate and no sludge production malovanyy et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 methods for regenerating exhausted ion exchangers have been explored because one time use is technically and economically unfeasible jung et al 2004 lahav et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2015 using ie to move nitrogen removal from mainstream to side stream is a promising approach to solve challenges mentioned above and even promotes innovations in wastewater treatment processes herein we assessed the potentiality of ie to move nitrogen removal from mainstream to side stream a sustainable strategy within a compact footprint through cycles of nh4 n exchange regeneration and nitrogen removal aern was proposed pilot scale aern based systems were investigated to examine the efficacy of intensive pollutant removal the mass balance of pollutants and representative competitive ion ca2 in the proposed processes was constructed furthermore we conducted techno economic analysis and indicated the future research for the full scale application in wwtps the findings from this study will provide an insight into future flowsheets for wastewater treatment by abiotic nitrogen management from the mainstream and regenerant management from the side stream this will greatly reduce the land occupancy of wwtps and overcome the challenges that biological systems exert in terms of energy and greenhouse gas ghg emission 2 materials and methods 2 1 batch tests for nh4 n removal kinetics by ion exchange kinetic experiments were designed to compare the performance of biological nitrification and nh4 n ie under different temperatures the determination method of biological nitrification rate is shown in text s2 natural zeolite which had a mean particle size of 1 2 mm and an exchange capacity of 3 6 mg nh4 n g was obtained from jinyun county zhejiang province china and chosen as the ie exchanger for nh4 n removal the zeolite was washed by deionized water to remove any fine particulates or other undesirable materials before it was used for batch tests or loaded into zeolite packed filters after ten times of nh4 n exchange and regeneration a batch test for nh4 n removal was conducted for the artificial domestic wastewater which was prepared by dosing ammonium chloride into the effluent of the full scale anaerobic anoxic aerobic aao system to maintain the nh4 n concentration of 25 mg l 200 ml wastewater was put into a 500 ml beaker and mixed with 8 g zeolite then the beaker was placed in a thermostatic shaker to control temperature of 10 0 0 1 and 20 0 0 1 c and shaken at 200 rpm with average ph 7 35 in the wastewater 98 9 and 99 5 nh4 n were calculated in the charged form at 10 and 20 c 10 ml homogenized samples were collected from the beaker at a regular interval of 5 min in the first 30 min and at an interval of 30 min in 0 5 14 h and filtered through an acetate cellulose membrane with mean pore size of 0 45 µm for nh4 n analysis 2 2 breakthrough experiments for nh4 n exchange by a zeolite packed filter the breakthrough experiments were designed to demonstrate the feasibility of zeolite filters and to provide applicable parameters of the empty bed contact time ebct and the operation time under different nh4 n concentrations in the influent the experiments were conducted in a filter 550 φ 30 mm packed with zeolite to a height of 300 mm and operated at 20 0 0 5 c the artificial domestic wastewater was continuously pumped into the zeolite packed filter at an ebct of 30 min 50 ml effluent sample was collected at the top of the filter every hour all the samples were filtered and analyzed for the nh4 n concentration before breakthrough the nh4 n concentration of 1 5 mg l was defined as the breakthrough point to control it to meet the most stringent discharge standards table s1 an identical breakthrough nh4 n concentration was used in all the experiments and thus the ebct of the zeolite packed filter was positively related to nh4 n concentration in the influent 2 3 column tests to determine relationship between ebct and nh4 n concentration in the effluent of zeolite packed filter three column tests were conducted for polluted river water at initial nh4 n concentration of 5 0 mg l by three zeolite packed filters with ebcts of 5 10 and 15 min respectively the experiments were conducted at 20 0 0 5 c and samples of effluent from the three filters were collected after 24 h continuous operation to determine the nh4 n concentration in order to illustrate effects of temperature on nh4 n removal from domestic wastewater eight column tests were carried out at temperature of 20 0 0 5 and 10 0 0 5 c by using four zeolite packed filters with ebcts of 10 15 20 and 30 min the nh4 n concentration in the effluent after 24 h continuous operation was determined thrice for each zeolite packed filter 2 4 batch tests for multiple cyclic nh4 n exchange and regeneration in order to investigate the accumulated concentration of nh4 n in the regenerant for the posterior nitrogen removal or recovery process batch tests for multiple cyclic nh4 n exchange and regeneration were conducted by the zeolite packed filter 550 φ 30 mm and regenerant of 20 g l nacl with ph of 7 0 during the ammonium exchange stage the artificial domestic wastewater was continuously pumped into the zeolite packed filter at an ebct of 30 min until the saturation point 25 mg l then the nacl regenerant was supplied into the filter in the up flow mode from an 1 l vessel and recycled by pump between the filter and the vessel for 4 h in the regeneration stage 10 ml regenerant samples were termly collected from the vessel at an interval of 15 min in the first 1 h and then at an interval of 1 h during 1 4 h the regenerant sample was filtered and analyzed for the nh4 n concentration then the second nh4 n exchange and regeneration cycle was started by switching the zeolite packed filter into the nh4 n exchange stage and the filter was regenerated by a newly prepared 1 l regenerant ten cycles of nh4 n exchange and regeneration were carried out and the data were collected at regeneration cycle 1 2 3 4 5 and 10 2 5 the pilot scale haern system for domestic wastewater treatment a pilot scale haern system consisting of a high rate anoxic aerobic ao reactor and an aern module was fed with wastewater from the grit chamber of dongqu wwtp shanghai china and operated for 120 days at a constant flow rate of

zeolite packed filters were operated in a succession of repeated cycles each consisting of three stages of continuous operation 24 h regeneration 2 h and idle 22 h one filter was regenerated after 24 h continuous operation and then the flow was switched to the other to continue operation the first filter was backwashed and then regenerated for 2 h by pumping regenerant 10 g l nacl solution 32 1 c in the up flow mode from a 21 6 l regenerant storage tank to immerse the exhausted zeolite and then backwashed to remove residual salt and maintained idle until put back in service for the next exchange cycle a naclo solution of 1 0 v v was used to remove organic matters and biofilms attached on the zeolite every week in the side stream system the used regenerant was flowed into the untreated regenerant storage tank in which 80 mg l na2co3 was added to remove ca2 and to provide alkalinity for the sharon anammox process the caco3 precipitate was discharged from the bottom of the

carmine anammox biofilm was attached on the carriers after 50 days inoculation with seed sludge from a pilot scale anammox reactor for reject water treatment the temperature and ph were controlled at 32 1 c and 8 0 0 2 for the sharon anammox process 2 6 the pilot scale caernm system for domestic wastewater treatment a pilot scale caernm system consisting of a coagulation sedimentation unit csu an aern and a membrane bioreactor mbr module was also continuously fed with wastewater of dongqu wwtp at 72 l d for 100 days the csu module was composed of a coagulation tank 0 75 l and a settler 1 5 l with al2so4 4 0 mg al l and polyacrylamide 0 3 mg l dosing into the coagulation tank at 200 rpm in the aern module two zeolite packed filters were operated in a succession of repeated cycles each

microsoft usa the length of the unused bed lub was calculated according to liu et al 2011a the method of microbial community analysis was shown in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 rapid and excellent nh4 n removal by ion exchange biological nitrification required hrt 10 h to decrease the nh4 n concentration to below 5 0 mg l fig 1 a and low temperature further increased the required hrt because it slowed down activities of nitrifiers li et al 2018b ie by ion exchangers after cyclic nh4 n exchange and regeneration also had efficient nh4 n removal capacity and decreased the nh4 n concentration to below 1 0 mg l within 30 min and temperature was not an important influencing factor for nh4 n exchange guaya et al 2015 fig 1b shows that the nh4 n concentration was maintained below 1 5 mg l at an ebct of 30 min for 35 30 and 15 h by feeding domestic wastewater initial rainwater and polluted river water into zeolite packed filters respectively the lub values increased from 132 to 180 and 225 mm with influent nh4 n concentration rising from 5 to 8 and 25 mg l which was also reported by liu et al 2011a wall effects on the mass transfer increased the percentage of lub in the loaded bed and will be decreased in the large scale application martin et al 2013 for domestic wastewater nh4 n efflux concentration after 24 h exchange was reduced below 5 0 mg l at ebct 15 min fig 1c decreased temperature increased nh4 n exchange because it is a spontaneous and exothermic process zhao et al 2010 allowing nh4 n 5 0 mg l to be reached for ebct 10 min for initial rainwater and polluted river water zeolite packed filters with ebct 12 5 and 10 min maintained nh4 n 1 5 mg l the rapid and efficient nh4 n capture relies on the diffusion of nh4 n through water to the zeolite surface where nh4 n is adsorbed at ie sites mark and robert 2017 therefore if efficient and cheap regeneration of exhausted ion exchangers can be achieved low footprint treatment systems can be constructed using ie as a rapid unit for nitrogen removal 3 2 side stream regeneration strategies regeneration and restoration of ion exchangers to remove both nh4 n and competitive cations are important to the future utility of ie for sustainable and economical nitrogen removal from wastewater ca2 mg2 and k are major competitive cations of nh4 n exchange in domestic wastewater cruz et al 2019 while concentrations of mg2 and k are greatly lower than ca2 table s2 ca2 is exchanged from wastewater and accumulated in the regenerant which can be periodically removed by caco3 precipitation fig 2 a captured nh4 n can be removed from ion exchangers by high concentration solutions of nacl or acids malovanyy et al 2013 but nh4 n accumulated in the regenerant requires further treatment to remove nitrogen as shown in fig 2b nacl regeneration obtained nh4 n concentration of 400 600 mg l in the regenerant in about 1 0 h corresponding to an approximately 20 fold concentration of nh4 n in domestic wastewater the concentrated nh4 n can be recovered as ammonia by air stripping precipitated as struvite or converted to gaseous nitrogen fig 2c struvite recovery is usually ineffective because of its low molar ratio of phosphorus to nitrogen and shortage of magnesium li et al 2015 tchobanoglous et al 2003 so we did not evaluate the approach for nitrogen recovery heating the used regenerant by a wastewater source heat pump will benefit both regeneration of ion exchangers and nitrogen recovery air stripping or biological removal air stripping after ph elevation by alkali is a feasible and economic approach to recovering ammonia from wastewater the residual nh4 n after air stripping requires no further treatment because the regenerant is not discharged but recirculated in the aern cycle based on literature data errico et al 2018 the aern with air stripping was calculated to yield 4302 tons of ammonium sulfate per year creating an annual benefit of 0 207 million for a wwtp with a flow rate of 50 000 m3 d and removed nh4 n of 25 mg l on a global scale interference with the nitrogen cycle by converting n2 to reactive nitrogen for human use is one of the three earth system processes having already transgressed the bounds of sustainability rockström et al 2009 in view of the large demand for reactive nitrogen staying within the suggested boundaries of sustainability requires a dramatic increase in nitrogen recovery from wastewater which could supply about 25 of the present anthropogenic production of reactive nitrogen larsen et al 2016 and save 250 terawatt hours of energy li et al 2015 naclonacl regeneration provides an attractive method to achieve sustainable removal of nitrogen from wastewater through ie by oxidizing adsorbed nh4 n to n2 a long term ie regeneration cycle had no obvious impairment on ie capacity or microporosity of the zeolite zhang et al 2017 but the regeneration cost was relatively high about 6 1 kg n the strategy is suitable for cases where limited space is available for control of water pollutants such as on site treatment of initial rainwater and sewer overflow or emergency treatment of pollution naclo can be generated electrochemically using a highly concentrated nacl solution as both regenerant and electrolyte for cost savings the electrooxidation of ammonia in the regenerant can be scheduled for hours when electricity prices are lower lahav et al 2013 regeneration through conventional nitrification and denitrification offers environmental and economic advantages jung et al 2004 zheng et al 2015 but requires long reaction times controlled temperature and ph and available carbon sources for denitrification coupling nacl regeneration with sharon and anammox is more efficient than the nitrification denitrification process and substantially less expensive than naclonacl regeneration the limiting factors of anammox for low strength wastewater treatment such as low nh4 n concentration high organic matter concentrations and the presence of toxic substances laureni et al 2019 speth et al 2016 can be overcome effectively by the aern cycle anammox bacteria can survive in saline wastewater and acquire high nitrogen removal rate of 1 0 4 5 kg n m3 d at a salinity of 30 33 g l li et al 2018a which is 3 6 16 0 times of that of the conventional nitrification for domestic wastewater tchobanoglous et al 2003 high salinity selectively suppresses nitrite oxidizing activity and thus nitrite accumulates for anammox ye et al 2009 side stream nitrogen removal circumvents the risk of tn violation for mainstream application of the anammox owing to residual nitrate generated eq 1 sodium carbonate is dosed into the regenerant to compensate for alkalinity required in the sharon anammox process and to provide na for the regeneration of ion exchangers 1 nh 4 1 32 no 2 0 066 hco 3 0 13 h 1 02 n 2 0 25 no 3 0 066 c h 2 o 0 5 n 0 15 2 03 h 2 o in this study naclonacl regeneration and nacl regeneration coupling with the sharon anammox process were considered as two side stream regeneration strategies and tested by pilot scale systems 3 3 construction of wastewater treatment processes with small space requirements fig 3 a illustrates a typical process used to comply with a stringent discharge standard grade i a of gb 18918 2002 the illustrated process consists of an aao system a csu and a denitrification filter the process occupies a large footprint has a total hrt of 26 6 h by considering both reactors and settlers consumes substantial energy and chemicals and generates large amounts of waste activated sludge with low methane production potential owing to excessive aeration fig 3b and 3c illustrate two aern based processes constructed to overcome drawbacks of the typical aao process and to meet requirements of two different scenarios for the haern system fig 3b the wastewater treated by a primary settler is fed into the high rate ao unit to remove cod tp ss and part of tn and then flows into the aern unit to remove the residual tn before discharge the high rate ao with low hrt and srt inhibits the growth of nitrifiers and removes the majority of organic matters by biomass assimilation and accumulation rather than oxidation enhancing anaerobic degradability of the generated sludge ge et al 2013 the short srt also improves biological phosphorus removal chemical phosphorus precipitation by dosing aluminum salt into the aerobic tank is required in some cases to meet the discharge concentration the aluminum salt inhibits the activity of nitrifiers liu et al 2011b resulting in more nh4 n remaining in the effluent considering that the short srt decreases sludge concentration in the ao and that aluminum coagulation improves sludge settleability the typical hrts for the anoxic tank aerobic tank and secondary settler are 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 h respectively hrts of the aern module with the sharon anammox process for nitrogen removal were calculated in details according to the constructed model text s9 one regeneration tank can be served for 12 ie reactors if durations of nh4 n exchange and regeneration are set to 22 and 2 h respectively if the nh4 n concentration in the regenerant is set at 250 mg l considering both ie capacity and nitrogen removal ability hrts of the sharon and anammox reactors are chosen as 4 0 and 8 0 h according to their typical nitrogen loads choi et al 2019 li et al 2018a speth et al 2016 if the removed nh4 n concentration is 8 0 mg l for the haern the equivalent hrt for the side stream system are 0 6 h therefore the total hrt of haern in fig 3b is 8 9 h for the caernm system fig 3c the wastewater is directly fed into the csu to remove particulate and colloidal cod tp and ss with a compact footprint most nh4 n remains in the effluent of the csu and is removed in the posterior aern module soluble cod is removed by the downstream mbr the csu efficiently controls particles fed into the aern and reduces organic loads in the mbr the total hrt of the caernm is 3 5 h for aern with naclonacl regeneration and increases to 5 4 h if the sharon anammox regeneration is applied for typical domestic wastewater the caernm process removed almost all the nh4 n in the aern module and thus achieved a higher nitrogen removal than the haern process the mbr in fig 3c can be bypassed to form caern process for wastewater with low concentrations of soluble cod such as initial rainwater or polluted river water and thus a more compact process with a total hrt of about 1 5 h could be constructed 3 4 long term pollutant removal performances of haern and caernm as shown in table 1 the aern based processes achieved comparable cod nh4 n and tp removal to aao for domestic wastewater treatment with a more compact footprint fig 3 the haern 86 8 and caernm 93 7 systems obtained significantly higher nitrogen removal than the aao 62 9 although the influent had a lower cod tn ratio than the aao in the haern the ao removed 89 8 ss 91 5 cod and 86 9 tp and retained a proportion of nh4 n 29 1 that was removed in the aern the side stream sharon anammox removed 89 9 nitrogen from the regenerant and the residual nitrogen was recycled and removed in the next cycle microbial community structure analysis fig s1 showed that the sharon reactor enriched halotolerant bacteria e g candidatus kuenenia gonzalez silva et al 2017 and limnobacter garcía ruiz et al 2018 with relative abundance of 28 7 and 3 63 respectively and ammonium oxidizing bacteria nitrosomonas 0 82 and suppressed the nitrite oxidizing bacteria nitrolancea 0 16 and nitrospira 0 06 liu et al 2020 the anammox reactor enriched two anammox genera fig s2 candidatus kuenenia 21 13 and candidatus jettenia 0 41 and illustrated lower diversity but higher relative abundance than those operated under low salinity ji et al 2020 the results confirmed that anammox bacteria especially candidatus kuenenia could acclimate to salinity and reach stable operation in the caernm the csu removed 93 5 ss 51 9 cod and 97 7 tp tn was efficiently removed in the aern with the efflux concentration below 5 0 mg l 3 5 mass balance analysis of the aern based processes the mass balance analysis of haern fig 4 a indicates that the incoming n was mostly removed by the high rate ao 64 0 in which 49 7 n was converted to n2 by nitrification and denitrification 22 8 n was captured by ion exchangers then completely exchanged into regenerant and converted to n2 by the sharon anammox where 1 9 n was cycled in the side stream system because of the incomplete conversion of nh4 n and nox n in the anammox table 1 in the aao and sharon anammox system the average n2o emission was previously reported as 1 29 wang et al 2016 and 2 27 ali et al 2016 of the nitrogen load and thus 0 32 and 0 28 mg l nh4 n in the influent were converted to n2o in the aao and haern process the fate of ca2 indicates that 68 7 ca2 was removed in the ao and 24 8 was captured by ion exchangers exchanged into the regenerant and then precipitated as caco3 for the caernm fig 4b 12 5 n was removed in the csu in the particulate form 78 6 n was exchanged by ion exchangers and mostly oxidized by naclo to n2 77 5 without n2o production 1 7 n was exchanged into regenerant in the form of nitrate and then accumulated but didn t impair exchange capacity of regenerant the aern module removed the most proportion of ca2 46 5 and greatly reduced ghg emissions by capturing co2 from tail gas of the mbr high rate ao and csu separated 23 5 and 56 8 c from domestic wastewater into sludge and had the potential for carbon redirection to methane production and minimized carbon oxidation by microbes ge et al 2013 the ie reactor removed 1 9 and 6 9 c from the effluent of the high rate ao and csu which were mostly in the particulate and colloidal forms and recirculated to the influent by backwashing the residual c in the ie reactor was oxidized by naclo in the caernm 34 3 c was captured in the form of co2 to precipitate ca2 in regenerant high rate ao and csu removed 91 2 and 95 8 p by biological and chemical phosphorus removal in the ie reactor a small proportion of p was filtered or precipitated with ca2 released from ion exchangers wan et al 2017 and then removed by backwashing the accumulation of p was not observed on the surface of ion exchangers 3 6 long term variations of zeolite properties in the aern based process the initial ammonium exchange capacities of zeolites in the haern and caernm were 3 01 0 44 and 5 46 1 30 mg g after 10 times exchange and regeneration by nacl and naclonacl zeolites in the two systems achieved an equilibrium capacity of 2 32 0 41 and 4 48 0 96 mg g which were almost unchanged in the long term operation the data were coherent to our previous study zhang et al 2017 in which naclonacl regeneration effectively accelerated nh4 n exchange and maintained an exchange capacity 80 of unused zeolites table s3 x ray powder diffraction fig s3 and s4 results indicated that the main mineral species of zeolites were unchanged after long term operation for artificial and real domestic wastewater treatment and both naclonacl and sharon anammox regeneration had insignificant impacts on the compositions of zeolites which mainly consisted of clinoptilolite and quartz lin et al 2013 compositional analysis of zeolites in the two aern based systems table s5 showed that contents of na and mg increased and other cations such as k and ca decreased after long term exchange and regeneration the high concentration of na in the regenerant exchanged k ca2 and mg2 on the zeolite and inhibited metal pollution and mg2 can be controlled by precipitating exchanged mg2 in the regenerant periodically the increasing na contents in zeolites increased both nh4 n exchange capacity and rate table s5 by enhancing film mass transfer rate lin et al 2013 textural analysis tables s4 and s6 suggested that the long term regeneration leads to an increased surface area and microporosity of zeolites with the micropore volume increased by 33 3 and 53 3 which benefited to enhance nh4 n exchange capacity these results confirmed that the stability and reusability of ammonium ion exchangers were almost unchanged for domestic wastewater treatment after repeated regeneration by naclonacl or sharon anammox 3 7 techno economic analysis the land occupancy upfront investment and treatment cost of the aao process and two aern based processes coupled with the sharon anammox regeneration were compared by using a wwtp with treatment capacity of 50 000 m3 d under a stringent discharge standard and the results are shown in table 2 see text s10 for details the land occupancies of wwtp for haern and caernm are 59 9 and 71 1 less than that of aao owing to their greatly lower hrts the reduced space requirements save construction cost and thus the upfront investments required for haern and caernm are reduced by 38 0 and 25 5 compared to aao respectively in china wastewater treatment is expected to consume a land area of 1 90 104 m2 due to upgrading discharge standards to grade i a he et al 2018 and thus implementing the haern or caernm will reduce the land area by 1 14 or 1 36 104 hm2 respectively the savings in land area and investment will be substantial globally considering the global flow rate for domestic wastewater treatment of 1 04 109 m3 year larsen et al 2016 wastewater treatment industry heads toward 3 of global electricity consumption li et al 2015 lu et al 2018 the energy consumption of the aao is calculated to be 0 530 kwh m3 after comprehensively considering the mainstream process the sharon anammox and wastewater source heat pump the energy consumption of haern and caernm can be reduce by 27 4 and 19 4 respectively mainstream aeration is the dominant energy consuming process even when the aerobic hrt is substantially decreased and accounts for 46 8 or 35 1 of the total energy consumed by haern or caernm the wastewater source heat pump is the second most energy consuming process accounting for 27 3 or 41 0 in order to achieve a low nitrogen level in the effluent addition of an external carbon source is required in the aao and accounts for most chemical costs 74 6 in the aern based processes maintaining alkalinity for the sharon anammox is the dominant fraction of chemical cost in summary the total treatment costs for haern and caernm are 31 0 and 2 3 less than that for aao 4 conclusions we proposed a novel strategy by moving nitrogen removal from mainstream to side stream by an aern cycle nh4 n in the wastewater is rapidly and efficiently captured by ion exchangers then regenerated into the side stream system and converted to n2 by chlorination or sharon anammox methods the aern cycle can be combined with a high rate ao and chemical phosphorus removal to construct a haern process or inserted between a csu and an mbr to construct a caernm process long term operation for domestic wastewater treatment showed that the two aern based systems achieved more efficient nitrogen removal 86 8 93 7 than the conventional aao and had insignificant adverse to exchange capacity compositions and textural properties of ion exchangers compared with the aao process aern based processes can satisfy more stringent discharge standards and greatly reduce land occupancy upfront investments and treatment costs the aern cycle and derived processes proposed in this study can bring forward a sustainable strategy to upgrade wwtp to satisfy stringent discharge standards within a compact footprint and had potential for ghg emissions reduction and resources recovery further research can be focused on i more cost effective nitrogen recovery approach in the side stream ii novel ie reactor operated in continuous mode suitable for wwtps iii novel ion exchangers efficient in ammonium exchange and release resistant against scaling and biofouling and stable under repeated exchange and regeneration in the future the key challenges for full scale application of the proposed process were the adaptation of multi module systems

germantown usa see section 2 4 2 all dna samples were tested for hf183 and sketa table 1 cdna synthesis was performed by reverse transcription rt with the superscript iv first strand synthesis system invitrogen carlsbad usa and all cdna samples were analyzed for pmmov novgi and fcv table 1 all samples and extraction rt controls were analyized in duplicate the presence of rt qpcr inhibition was assessed by analyzing a 1 10 dilution of sample dna and cdna for the hf183 and pmmov assays respectively pcr inhibition was determined by comparing the cq quantification cycle of an undiluted sample to a 1 10 diluted sample pcr inhibition was deemed to be absent if the cq of the diluted sample was at least 2 cq lower than that of the undiluted sample cao et al 2012 no inhibition was observed

usa in situ at the time of sample collection rainfall mm in the last 12 h was measured using a weather station acurite pro 5 in 1 weather station lake geneva us located in jacó within 1 2 km of the sample collection sites 2 5 data analyses r version 4 0 2 was used to execute all statistical analyses descriptive statistics hypothesis testing and redundancy analyses as well as correlation analyses r core team 2013 all values less than the lod and loq were censored to 1 lod or loq respectively and all subsequent statistical analyses for censored data were executed using the nada r package and a package obtained from the nondetects and data analysis training course downloaded at https practicalstats teachable com on june 20 2020 helsel 2019 2011 lee 2017 data censoring took into account both the non detects concentrations below the lod and positive but not quantifiable detects concentrations below the loq multivariate analyses were executed to avoid problems with the increased type i error associated with multiple pair wise comparisons and multiple hypothesis tests prior to all multivariate analyses all environmental parameters were standardized by calculating their z score and an euclidean distance matrix was calculated all microbial data were natural log ln normally distributed thus they were ln transformed the u score ranks were calculated for all the ln transformed microbial data to account for censored observations helsel 2019 2011 to accommodate left censored data in all multivariate analyses euclidean distance matrices were calculated from the microbial u score ranks helsel 2011 statistical significance for all analyses was assessed at α 0 05 river and ocean water sampling were based upon measurements of salinity and not a specific location given the influence of tides on the river and ocean sampling locations differences by water type were confirmed by the clear clustering observed in the non metric multidimensional scaling plot using all environmental and microbial variables fig s1 consequently river and ocean data were analyzed separately non metric multidimensional scaling was also used to identify possible differences between sub watersheds for all of the river as well as the ocean environmental and microbial variables separately the data for each sub watershed were grouped together for the river and ocean respectively given the lack of distinctive clustering by sub watershed and the close proximity of the sub watersheds figures s2 and s3 2 5 1 descriptive statistics in order to describe and understand the water quality at jacó beach the data from river and ocean discharge sites were grouped by season rainy vs dry there were 18 samples for any given water type and season for the environmental data only boxplots were created to describe each environmental parameter by season and by tide n 9 for each grouping for the microbial data boxplots were created to describe each non censored microorganism by season based upon these groupings descriptive statistics were calculated for all environmental and non censored microbial data for all microbial variables that included left censored data values but that were 80 left censored descriptive statistics were estimated using robust regression on order statistics rros where a lognormal distribution was assumed for modeling the left censored portion of the distribution observations below the process lod or loq using nada r package helsel 2011 lee 2017 pathogen data included 80 left censored values thus the frequency of detection for each pathogen was determined 2 5 2 testing differences in environmental and microbial data by season and tide given the multi factor sampling design by season and by tide and the multivariate data distance based redundancy analysis dbrda followed by an analysis of variance like permutation test to assess the significance of constraints was used to test for differences in the environmental data by season tide and season and tide combined rainy incoming vs rainy outgoing vs dry incoming vs dry outgoing legendre et al 2011 legendre and anderson 1999 differences in microorganism concentrations by season tide and season and tide combined were also tested by dbrda as previously described river and ocean data were considered separately analyses was executed using the vegan package oksanen et al 2016 a manhattan distance matrix was calculated from the binomial season and tide categories for all dbrda analyses each season contained 18 samples in which nine were collected during the outgoing tide and nine were collected during the incoming tide 2 5 3 relationships between environmental variables and microorganisms redundancy analysis rda is a multivariate analysis commonly used in microbial ecology to understand multivariate linear relationships legendre and legendre 2012 ramette 2007 here it was executed using the vegan package oksanen et al 2016 to test the following null hypotheses for river and ocean data separately there is no significant multivariate linear relationship between environmental parameters and microbial data the variance inflation factor was calculated for each set of model explanatory variables to assess the severity of multicollinearity all variance inflation factors were less than or equal to 2 thus minimal correlations were identified between the explanatory environmental variables 2 5 4 exceedance of recreational water quality criteria pathogen presence and indicator criteria and mst marker performance with respect to pathogen detection all water samples were classified by their fecal coliform and enterococci concentrations according to costa rican and us epa recreational water quality criteria rwqc costa rican rwqc include fecal coliform and enterococci criteria fecal coliform criteria developed in costa rica mora 2007 and the cr enterococci criteria are based upon the us epa rwqc us epa 2012b coastal waters were considered appropriate for recreation when enterococci geometric mean concentrations were below 35 cfu 100 ml and or fecal coliform geometric mean concentrations were below 240 or 1000 mpn 100 ml for marine or freshwater respectively the us epa rwqc statistical threshold value stv 130 cfu 100 ml was used to define when water samples were not appropriate for swimming per us epa rwqc since costa rica s recommendations do not include a threshold value for a single sample the geometric mean criterion was used to classify each water sample to explore the predictive relationship between fib rwqc and pathogen presence water samples were binned as follows 1 fib above or below rwqc and 2 any pathogen detected or no pathogen detected the relationship between rwqc exceedance and pathogen detection was subsequently calculated as follows 1 true positive tp rwqc exceedance pathogen detection 2 true negative tn rwqc not exceeded and pathogen not detected 3 false positive fp rwqc exceedance but pathogen not detected and 4 false negative fn rwqc not exceeded but pathogens detected for each criterion the following were calculated the sensitivity indicating how frequently the criterion was exceeded when at last one pathogen was detected was determined as 1 t p t p f n the specificity indicating how frequently fib levels were below the criterion when no pathogen was detected was calculated as 2 t n t n f p the positive predictive value indicating how frequently a rwqc exceedance co occurred with detection of at least one pathogen was calculated as 3 t p t p f p and the negative predictive value indicating how frequently fib levels below the criterion co occurred with detection of 0 pathogens was calculated as 4 t n t n f n a similar exercise was carried out to compare the predictive ability of mst sewage markers hf183 and pmmov to indicate pathogen presence given the lack of livestock activities and point sources of treated and undertreated domestic wastewater mora 2009 orozco montoya 2015 in this case the mst markers were binned according to whether they were above or below the process lod or according to mst marker criteria which were based on qmra estimates of human health risks associated with recreational water exposure ahmed et al 2018a crank et al 2019 ahmed et al 2018a calculated that 3220 hf183 gc 100 ml and 544 pmmov gc 100 ml are associated with the us epa benchmark for recreational waters 36 illnesses 1000 swimmers for pmmov only crank et al 2019 estimated that 5054 pmmov gc 100 ml was associated with the us epa benchmark for recreational waters 30 illnesses 1000 swimmers 2 5 5 correlations between fecal indicator microorganisms and mst markers and pathogens the mantel test a multivariate approach was used to identify correlations between indicator microorganisms and mst markers one matrix and pathogens second matrix in the rivers and ocean separately legendre and legendre 2012 this approach was executed using the kendall method with the vegan package oksanen et al 2016 and included 9999 permutations euclidean distance matrices one for the indicator microorganisms and mst markers and the second one for the pathogens were calculated and the correlation between the two matrices was analyzed in order to identify the best subset of indicator microorganism and mst markers that maximized the correlations with the pathogen concentrations iterative mantel tests with the kendall method were executed using the bio env procedure clarke and ainsworth 1993 from the vegan package oksanen et al 2016 3 results the environmental data varied by season and to a lesser extent by tide figure s4 the mean rainfall was 0 88 mm and 21 42 mm in the dry and rainy season respectively the mean physical chemical water parameters were as follows for the river in the dry and rainy season respectively water temperature 28 84 c and 27 07 c salinity 0 23 ppt and 0 37 ppt and turbidity 3 95 ntu and 24 06 ntu in the ocean data mean physical chemical water parameters were as follows for the dry and rainy season respectively water temperature 29 80 c and 27 43 c salinity 31 40 ppt and 27 60 ppt and turbidity 23 19 ntu and 64 96 ntu with respect to tides median turbidity was greatest during the incoming tide in the rivers 16 5 ntu and the outgoing tide in the ocean 21 5 ntu figure s4 median river and ocean water temperatures were greatest during the outgoing tide 30 2 c and 30 55 c respectively the median salinities were similar in the river 0 2 ppt and ocean 32 ppt respectively regardless of season or tidal stage however increased variability was observed in the rainy season in which higher salinities 0 4 ppt were identified in the river and lower salinities in the ocean 30 ppt particularly on the outgoing tide similarly the microbial data varied by season in the river measurements of enterococci male specific coliphage and hf183 were at least one order of magnitude greater during the rainy season fig 2 and table s2 furthermore the frequency of detection of most pathogens giardia salmonella and cryptosporidium was greatest during the rainy season except for novgi which was only detected during dry season table 2 in the ocean enterococci fecal coliforms male specific coliphage and hf183 were at least one order of magnitude greater during the rainy season and somatic coliphage had greater concentrations during the dry season fig 2 and tables s2 the overall pathogen detection frequency was greatest in the ocean during the rainy season table 2 3 1 hypothesis testing for differences associated with seasons and tides river and ocean samples were collected on six occasions in the rainy and six occasions in the dry season as well as during outgoing i e transition from high to low tide and incoming i e transition from low to high tide tides thus analyses testing the differences in environmental parameters and microorganisms by season and tide were executed for the river and ocean data separately for each water type n 9 for each season and tide combination 3 1 1 differences in environmental parameters by season and tide river significant differences in river environmental parameters between seasons f 7 3483 p 0 001 and tides f 4 519 p 0 003 were identified by dbrda separately significant differences in river environmental parameters were also identified by the multi factor hypothesis test for season and tide using dbrda f 5 9689 p 0 001 in which water temperature f 9 7402 p 0 001 and rainfall f 6 2202 p 0 001 significantly contributed to the differences observed turbidity f 0 4917 p 0 751 and salinity f 1 9470 p 0 061 were not significant contributors ocean significant differences in environmental parameters between seasons were also identified by season f 14 845 p 0 001 and tide f 3 3044 p 0 015 by dbrda separately significant differences in ocean environmental parameters were also identified by the dbrda multi factor hypothesis test for season and tide f 6 0915 p 0 001 in which water temperature f 8 7430 p 0 001 and rainfall f 8 0718 p 0 001 most significantly contributed to the differences observed turbidity f 0 4717 p 0 852 and salinity f 1 1654 p 0 354 were not a significant contributors 3 1 2 differences in microbial parameters by season and tide river significant differences in river microorganism concentrations were identified between seasons f 12 667 p 0 001 and not tides f 1 8465 p 0 116 using dbrda significant differences in river microorganisms concentrations were identified by the dbrda multi factor hypothesis test for season and tide combined f 3 1006 p 0 001 in which cryptosporidium concentrations significantly contributed the most to the differences observed f 5 5225 p 0 003 followed by enterococci f 4 4098 p 0 007 and novgi f 3 8663 p 0 014 ocean significant differences in ocean microorganism concentrations between seasons f 6 5674 p 0 001 but not between tides f 1 5659 p 0 179 were identified by dbrda somatic coliphage contributed the most to the differences observed between seasons f 5 9577 p 0 028 followed by pmmov f 3 9262 p 0 064 significant differences in ocean microorganism concentrations were identified by the dbrda multi factor hypothesis test for season and tide f 2 1354 p 0 003 however no specific microorganism s significantly contributed to the differences identified 3 2 relationships between environmental variables and microorganisms river there was a significant relationship between environmental variables and microorganisms in the river in which the rda model explained 12 34 of the overall microorganism variability f 2 1969 p 0 001 adjusted r2 0 1234 fig 3 all of the variability was explained by the first canonical axis rda1 p 0 001 rainfall and salinity significantly explained the variability in microbial concentrations f 2 8307 p 0 006 and f 2 619 p 0 003 respectively water temperature and turbidity did not significantly explain microbial variability f 0 7604 p 0 617 and f 0 9993 p 0 459 respectively in the model in the rda ordination plot all microorganisms clustered where salinity was lowest enterococci male specific coliphage and cryptosporidium grouped together and were clustered with higher rainfall and turbidity and decreasing temperature contrastingly fecal coliforms c perfringens somatic coliphage salmonella and novgi grouped together with increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall and turbidity ocean there was also a significant relationship between environmental parameters and microorganisms in the ocean in which the rda model explained 26 44 of microorganism variability f 4 0561 p 0 001 adjusted r2 0 2644 fig 4 all of the variability was explained by the first canonical axis rda1 p 0 001 rainfall f 3 1391 p 0 025 water temperature f 3 0286 p 0 035 and salinity f 2 8416 p 0 024 were the best predictors of microorganism concentrations in the ocean turbidity was not predictive of microorganism concentrations f 0 8766 p 0 508 in the model in the rda ordination plot microorganism concentrations were typically clustered where salinity and water temperature were lowest enterococci fecal coliforms c perfringens male specific coliphage hf183 pmmov cryptosporidium and giardia grouped together according to increasing rainfall and decreasing water temperature while somatic coliphage clustered with decreasing rainfall and increasing temperatures 3 3 exceedance of rwqc and performance of indicator microorganisms and mst markers with respect to pathogen detection fib concentrations in 89 100 of the river samples exceeded rwqc regardless of the standard to which they were compared table 3 fecal coliform and enterococci geometric mean concentrations were 9 04 103 cfu 100 ml and 1 26 103 mpn 100 ml respectively fib levels in the ocean samples exceeded rwqc much less frequently 25 44 with fecal coliform and enterococci geometric mean concentrations of 9 68 101 cfu 100 ml and 2 98 101 mpn 100 ml respectively with respect to mst markers hf183 and pmmov were detected in 100 of river samples as well as 88 9 and 91 7 of ocean samples respectively the mean hf183 and pmmov concentrations in the rainy season were 5 7 103 and 5 3 103 gc 100 ml in the rivers respectively compared to 7 9 102 and 5 1 102 gc 100 ml in the ocean respectively table s2 during the dry season mean hf183 and pmmov concentrations in the rivers were 3 8 102 and 1 0 102 gc 100 ml respectively compared to 7 9 102 and 5 1 102 gc 100 ml in the ocean respectively table s2 the ability of indicator microorganisms to predict pathogen presence was assessed by binning indicator observations into above or below rwqc i e criteria for enterococci or fecal coliforms and by binning pathogen detection results e g at least one pathogen detected or no pathogens detected in a sample performance metrics sensitivity specificity positive predictive value and negative predictive value were then calculated see methods for details table 3 table s3 regardless of the criterion used enterococci and fecal coliforms were sensitive to pathogen presence in both water types 88 100 i e indicator criteria were generally exceeded when pathogens were present specificity was low in river samples 0 25 but higher in ocean samples 68 93 due largely to infrequent observations of fib below rwqc in river samples 0 for cr fecal coliforms and enterococci criteria 11 for the us epa stv positive predictive values were higher in river 89 91 than in ocean 44 78 samples indicating greater confidence that indicator microorganisms above rwqc in river samples would correctly indicate pathogen presence compared to ocean samples table 3 negative predictive values were low in the river 11 25 again driven by very few indicator microorganism observations below the rwqc in the ocean the negative predictive values were highest for enterococci stv standard and fecal coliforms 95 96 and were much lower for the costa rican enterococci criteria 50 the ability of mst markers to predict pathogen presence in water samples was explored in a similar manner table 4 when mst markers were binned as above positive or below negative the lod sensitivity was 100 in river and ocean samples indicating that the mst marker was always observed when at least one pathogen was detected when binning criteria for mst markers was changed to reflect the qmra estimated criteria byahmed et al 2018a sensitivity dropped to 88 for pmmov and 53 for hf183 in river samples and dropped to 0 for both markers in ocean samples thus this drop in sensitivity by using qmra estimated criteria indicated an increased frequency of false negative relationships mst marker below criteria but pathogen present for pmmov the more stringent criteria estimated by cranks et al 2019 produced a much lower sensitivity in river samples 40 compared to 88 compared to ahmed s criteria specificity was low for both mst markers when they were binned according to the lod 0 14 but was improved by binning according to qmra criteria particularly in ocean samples for example specificity of hf183 in ocean samples increased from 14 lod binning to 93 qmra binning pmmov followed a similar pattern indicating that the more stringent criteria for defining a mst marker positive decreased the rate of false positives mst marker positive no pathogens detected positive predictive values for mst markers under all criteria were markedly better in river compared to ocean samples indicating greater confidence that a positive mst result would be co observed with a pathogen in river samples compared to ocean while negative predictive values showed the opposite trend 3 4 correlations between indicator microorganisms and mst markers and pathogens a significant correlation between indicator microorganisms and mst markers and pathogens was identified by the multivariate mantel test for river τ 0 131 p 0 0004 and ocean datasets τ 0 1699 p 0 0008 c perfringens somatic coliphage male specific coliphage and pmmov were the subset of indicator microorganisms and mst markers that maximized the correlation with pathogen concentrations in the rivers τ 0 1529 p 0 0003 in the ocean enterococci male specific coliphage and pmmov were the subset of indicator microorganisms and mst markers that maximized correlations with the pathogen concentrations τ 0 2710 p 0 0001 fig 5 is a conceptual diagram that illustrates these results 4 discussion jacó like the majority of tropical beaches is a popular beach whose recreational waters receive treated and undertreated domestic wastewater mora 2009 world health organization and unicef 2014 our analyses consisted of multivariate approaches that were appropriate for the left censored data sets typical of environmental pathogens which allowed for their analysis in spite of frequent undetectable concentrations helsel 2011 since the power of statistical analyses are compromised when a large percentage of the data are censored future studies are needed to corroborate the findings presented here using multivariate analyses we identified that the environmental parameters were significantly different by season and tide and explained 12 and 26 of the microbial variability in the river and the ocean respectively the percentage of variability explained by environmental parameters is similar to other studies laureano rosario et al 2017 it also likely reflects the constant discharge of domestic wastewater to the rivers which was identified by frequently high levels of mst markers bacteroides hf183 and pmmov in river samples and to a lesser extent in the ocean waters a previous study identified illegal sewage connections to the stormwater system that drained into the river study areas mora 2009 4 1 environmental variables explain some variability in pathogens while correlations among variables are not necessarily indicative of cause and effect relationships they nonetheless provide important information about relationships among variables in complex natural systems these relationships can be used to develop hypotheses that may be tested in manipulative experiments however this type of scientific inquiry is extremely difficult to carry out in a representative manner in scenarios as complex and variable as anthropogenically impacted beaches multivariate statistical analyses yield more insight about complex systems than univariate analyses because they consider multiple independent and dependent variables simultaneously as such they produce a more holistic analysis that is also less subject to the type i statistical errors that easily arise from conducting multiple univariate analyses grace 2002 we therefore used multivariate statistics to analyze relationships of microorganisms with environmental variables and with each other throughout this study an additional complexity in analyses of relationships among human pathogens in anthropogenically impacted environments is that pathogens may be contributed to water bodies by sewage or by the feces of a variety of animals harwood et al 2014 korajkic et al 2018 nguyen et al 2018 fecal material derived from various sources will doubtlessly be affected differently by environmental variables contributing to discrepant relationships that would not be expected in simpler systems rainfall which was significantly different between seasons was a significant predictive variable of microbial concentrations in river and ocean models previous studies also found a positive relationship between rainfall and fecal associated microorganisms ahmed et al 2018b curriero et al 2001 laureano rosario et al 2017 shehane et al 2005 interestingly contrasting associations between rainfall and the fecal microorganisms occurred in the rivers and ocean in the rivers cryptosporidium increased with increasing rainfall while novgi was highest when rainfall was lowest while pathogen detection was infrequent in the ocean cryptosporidium tended to increase when rainfall was higher heavy rainfall often results ito increased runoff and saturation of soils which can cause leakage from septic leach field systems such leakage may increase pathogen concentrations in surface waters particularly those pathogens that are usually removed e g unicellular parasites hofstra and vermeulen 2016 neumann et al 2015 of the microorganisms cryptosporidium made the greatest contribution to the differences observed between seasons as it was only detected during rainy season in the river and ocean although this pathogen is not exclusive to humans limited agricultural and livestock activities occur in the jacó beach watershed orozco montoya 2015 it is likely that the high percentage of septic leach field systems combined with intense rainfall led to increased cryptosporidium concentrations in the rainy season the other protozoan parasite analyzed giardia was detected equally across seasons and as frequently as cryptosporidium overall cryptosporidium prevalence in human populations is strongly correlated with precipitation particularly in tropical locations jagai et al 2009 our results suggest that giardia prevalence in fecal contaminated surface waters is not as affected by season as cryptosporidium perhaps because of the presence of a source other than sewage giardia infection in canines is not uncommon even in well cared for dogs hascall et al 2016 many dogs roam jacó beach and canine associated parasites have been frequently detected in jacó beach sand castro et al 2009 salmonella and novgi were detected most frequently during the dry season in the rivers which likely reflects the increased volume of sewage generated when tourism is greatest and possibly the seasonality of the pathogen in the population seasonal variability in novgi concentrations in domestic wastewater is understudied in the tropics nevertheless there is evidence of high concentrations year round on the costa rican pacific coast symonds et al 2017 and increased concentrations have been identified in the dry season in the san josé greater metropolitan area chacon et al 2020 it is likely that novgi was detected most frequently in the rivers during the dry season due to increased tourism in the area borowy 2004 which leads to increased wastewater generated and also increases the potential for the introduction of novgi cases from other countries or areas within costa rica furthermore an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness occurred in jacó during the dry season sampling period in which nov was among the suspected causative agents ministerio de salud 2018 it is also likely that lower river flow in the dry season indicating less dilution by rainwater as well as lower turbidities improved the likelihood of novgi detection in the rivers during the dry season mull and hill 2012 salinity was a dominant predictive variable in the river and ocean models generally correlating negatively with pathogens this relationship was likely due to the greater inflow of untreated and partially treated sewage directly to the rivers thus lower salinity waters almost always contained more pathogens given the higher percentage of riverwater tidal stage also influenced salinity by changing the relative proportion of river and ocean water in samples which was visually apparent in the rainy season when the river discharge created a marked brown mass of low salinity water along the coast this relationship was also identified by previous studies where higher fib and salmonella levels were negatively correlated with salinity ortega et al 2009 walters et al 2011 water temperature was a significant predictor of fecal microorganisms in the ocean in which they clustered according to decreasing temperature several studies have also determined an inverse relationship between fecal microorganisms and water temperature and have found associations between bacterial die off and increasing water temperature walters et al 2011 faust et al 1975 vasconcelos and swarmz 1976 although water temperature was significantly different between seasons in both river and the ocean it was not a significant predictor of microorganism variability in the rivers 4 2 performance of indicator criteria and mst markers with respect to pathogen detection recreational water quality at jacó and many other tropical beaches is regulated by fib criteria originally developed in temperate climates some have recommended regionally specific guidelines for tropical beaches due to the influence of climate on microbial ecology and ineffective wastewater treatment in low income communities e g verhougstraete et al 2020 while epidemiological studies are needed to identify and validate rwqc in the tropics we were able to relate fib rwqc from the united states and costa rica as well as sewage associated mst markers with pathogen detection in this study the predictive capabilities of the cr fecal coliform and enterococci geometric mean rwqc and the us epa enterococci stv rwqc with respect to pathogen presence were similar and most had high sensitivity rwqc exceedance when at least one pathogen was detected this result was unexpected because fecal coliform concentrations are less likely to be correlated with human health outcomes from exposure to recreational water in comparison to enterococci in marine and freshwaters us epa 2012b 2000 wade et al 2003 enterococci were more specific with respect to pathogen presence in river and ocean samples compared to fecal coliforms indicating fewer false positive results when using enterococci criteria fib above rwqc when pathogens were not detected the predictive capability of mst markers hf183 and pmmov to identify pathogen presence was also assessed mst marker detection was used as a permissive criterion for calling a marker positive while criterion based on qmra estimates of execeeding the us epa benchmark were used as a more rigorous criterion the permissive lod criterion detection produced 100 sensitivity marker always present when at least one pathogen was detected but very low specificity marker frequently positive when no pathogen was detected thus it appears that low levels of the markers are unlikely to be associated with sewage borne pathogens particularly in the ocean where positive predictive values were low ahmed et al 2018a calculated that 3220 hf183 gc 100 ml and 544 pmmov gc 100 ml are associated with the us epa benchmark for recreational waters 36 gastroenteritis illnesses 1000 swimmers for pmmov only crank et al 2019 estimated that 5054 pmmov gc 100 ml is associated with the approximate us epa benchmark for recreational waters 30 illnesses 1000 swimmers both studies based risk in part on estimated nov sewage concentrations from the literature which may not accurately describe the nov prevalence in jacó sewage binning mst marker levels according to these qmra estimates greater than or less than the benchmark markedly increased specificity with respect to prediction of pathogen presence in river and ocean samples compared to binning mst markers by lod detected or not detected the sensitivity of pmmov towards pathogens using the ahmed et al 2018a benchmark was markedly greater than that for the crank et al 2019 estimate suggesting that at jacó beach the higher pmmov criterion elevated the false negative results mst marker below criterion pathogens detected this comparison illustrates the variability of qmra estimates developed in different geographic regions the data collected in this study will provide the opportunity to develop a regionally specific qmra and will also be augmented by data from subsequent sampling efforts 4 3 fecal pollution toolbox approach in tropical surface waters relationships between fecal microorganisms are complex making the predictive capabilities of one fecal indicator or mst marker alone inadequate to accurately indicate pathogen presence fujioka et al 2015 symonds and breitbart 2015 viau et al 2011a in this study for example fecal microorganisms formed two distinct clusters based on the influence of environmental parameters in rda ordination plots in both rivers and the ocean furthermore no one fecal indicator or mst marker best correlated with pathogens in the river or ocean waters rather the use of multiple fecal microorganisms best correlated with pathogens which was also previously observed for tropical streams viau et al 2011a in this study different subsets of the fecal microorganisms best correlated with pathogens c perfringens somatic and male specific coliphage and pmmov in the rivers and enterococci male specific coliphage and pmmov in ocean waters fig 5 the best subset of indicator microorganisms and mst markers always included at least two viruses and one fib regardless of the water type the presence of pmmov and male specific coliphage in both the river and ocean subsets of fecal microorganisms that best correlated with pathogens further highlights the importance of these microorganisms as water quality indicators fujioka et al 2015 nappier et al 2019 symonds et al 2018 vergara et al 2015 viau et al 2011a 2011b it also further emphasizes the importance of including viral indicators to increase the likelihood of identifying the presence of pathogens symonds and breitbart 2015 for the river and ocean samples different fib were identified in the best subset of fecal microorganisms that maximized correlations to pathogens c perfringens was best for freshwaters when accompanied by three viral indicators which may reflect previous observations that c perfringens is a useful fecal indicator in tropical environments viau et al 2011 fujioka et al 2015 enterococci and two viral indicators best correcated with pathogens in the ocean previous studies have identified a significant relationship with enterococci concentrations and swimmer gastrointestinal illnesses in marine waters with point source pollution in temperate latitudes as well as in the tropics lamparelli et al 2015 verhougstraete et al 2020 our study further supports enterococci as an indicator of fecal contamination and human health risks in marine tropical waters future studies are needed to confirm the most appropriate combination of fecal indicators as well as their specific rwqc for jacó and other tropical beaches 5 conclusions regardless of season jacó rivers were implicated as sources of human fecal contamination based on percent exceedance rwqc high mst sewage marker concentrations and occurrence of diverse waterborne pathogens environmental variables explained 26 of the microbial variability rainfall was the most important predictor at jacó beach while salinity and water temperature were also significant in river and ocean models fib and mst sewage markers had high positive predictive values for pathogens in rivers when rwqc or qmra estimated criteria were used as benchmarks the us epa enterococci stv criterion had the highest positive 78 and negative 96 predictive value of all indicators in ocean samples c perfringens somatic and male specific coliphages and pmmov together maximized correlations with pathogens in the rivers while male specific coliphages pmmov and enterococci together maximized correlations with pathogens at ocean sites no one fecal indicator or mst sewage marker best correlated with pathogens rather the use of multiple fecal indicators and mst markers maximized pathogen correlations a fecal pollution toolbox approach containing at least one viral indicator is recommended for pathogen

17434,tropical coastal waters are understudied despite their ecological and economic importance they also reflect projected climate change scenarios for other climate zones e g increased rainfall and water temperatures we conducted an exploratory microbial water quality study at a tropical beach influenced by sewage contaminated rivers and tested the hypothesis that fecal microorganisms fecal coliforms enterococci clostridium perfringens somatic and male specific coliphages pepper mild mottle virus pmmov bacteroides hf183 norovirus genogroup i novgi salmonella cryptosporidium and giardia would vary by season and tidal stage most microorganisms concentrations were greater in the rainy season however novgi was only detected in the dry season and cryptosporidium was the only pathogen most frequently detected in rainy season fecal indicator bacteria fib levels exceeded recreational water quality criteria standards in 85 of river samples and in 50 of ocean samples regardless of the fib or regulatory criterion chronic sewage contamination was demonstrated by detection of hf183 and pmmov in 100 of river samples and in 89 of ocean samples giardia cryptosporidium salmonella and novgi were frequently detected in rivers 39 39 26 and 39 of samples respectively but infrequently in ocean water particularly during the dry season multivariate analysis showed that c perfringens somatic coliphage male specific coliphage and pmmov were the subset of indicators that maximized the correlation with pathogens in the rivers in the ocean the best subset of indicators was enterococci male specific coliphage and pmmov we also executed redudancy analyses on environmental parameters and microorganim concentrations and found that rainfall best predicted microbial concentrations the seasonal interplay of rainfall and pathogen prevalence undoubtedly influences beach users health risks relationships are likely to be complex with some risk factors increasing and others decreasing

introduction wastewater management practices affect the health of coastal ecosystems and the well being of people who use these water resources for their livelihood and recreational purposes shuval 2003 globally more than 80 of domestic wastewater is discharged into rivers or the ocean without any treatment united nations world water assessment programme 2017 gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses have been frequently associated with exposure to surface water contaminated with fecal waste world health organization 2003 the annual economic burden of recreation associated waterborne illness in countries with high sanitation coverage and treatment like the united states us is estimated at usd 2 2 3 7 billion deflorio barker et al 2018 this burden is likely much greater in parts of the world where safe sanitation is lacking prüss ustün et al 2014 adequate wastewater treatment is essential for human health and well being yet sanitation infrastructure is vulnerable to climate change howard et al 2010 and more research is needed to understand and mitigate this impact on sanitation infrastructure howard et al 2016 routine monitoring of fecal indicator bacteria fib such as e coli fecal coliforms and enterococci in recreational waters has been used for decades to protect public health griffith et al 2009 fib are intended to predict pathogen presence however poor correlations between fib and pathogens have been reported in many studies e g boehm et al 2003 harwood et al 2005 exclusive reliance on fib to indicate recent fecal pollution is problematic since there is evidence of their persistence and growth in the sediments and vegetation in environmental waters anderson et al 2005 desmarais et al 2002 nguyen et al 2018 symonds and breitbart 2015 extra intestinal sources of fib such as soil sediments and aquatic vegetation can confound the relationship between fib and pathogens badgley et al 2011 lamb et al 2017 soupir et al 2010 whitman et al 2003 fib are also present in the feces of a variety of animal species byappanahalli et al 2012 which limits their predictive relationship with pathogens as well as their efficacy in risk assessment and remediation of fecal pollution in recreational waters harwood et al 2014 alternative indicators to conventional fib have been increasingly explored as replacements and or additions to water quality monitoring the us state of hawaii has used clostridium perfringens as a tracer of fecal contamination fujioka et al 2015 and coliphages have been proposed as viral indicators us epa 2015 wanjugi et al 2018 human pathogens like giardia cryptosporidium and norovirus genogroup i novgi are increasingly included in microbial water quality studies because conventional fib do not always correlate with their presence ashbolt et al 2010 boehm et al 2009 microbial source tracking mst methods have been developed to determine fecal pollution sources chase et al 2012 harwood et al 2009 microorganisms associated with human feces and wastewater are frequent targets of mst assays including the 16s rrna gene of a bacteroides species hf183 seurinck et al 2005 and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov symonds et al 2018 2016 these mst markers which are strongly associated with domestic wastewater were proposed as a proxy for pathogens in quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra ahmed et al 2018a zhang et al 2019 most microbial water quality studies regarding fib alternative indicators management criteria and human health risks have been developed in temperate zones and are employed globally thus significant knowledge gaps exist with respect to tropical waters boehm et al 2009 fujioka et al 2015 world health organization 2003 furthermore tropical coastal beaches are useful study systems for the effects of climate change on water quality in temperate zones as some temperate regions are likely to experience weather that is similar to tropical conditions e g increased precipitation and flooding trenberth 2011 such conditions will present challenges for wastewater treatment and collection systems and can result in widespread sewage spills dale et al 2017 howard et al 2016 jacó beach located on the central pacific costa rican coast is characterized by a long intense rainy season and a short dry season solano and villalobos 2012 known as a famous surfing destination jacó experiences heavy national and international tourism due to its close proximity to the greater san josé metropolitan area tourism is central to the local economy the tourism industry has led to intensive development of high rise condominiums hotels and other infrastructure that serves tourists which impacts local water and wastewater systems krause 2012 according to the costa rican institute

2004 limited sources of animal fecal pollution are present in the watershed i e there is no intensive production of livestock or dense bird populations orozco montoya 2015 deterioration in the microbial water quality of jacó beach was reported by the costa rican government institution responsible for water quality monitoring the costa rican national water quality laboratory mora 2011 2009 and singled out by the community and local newspapers on several occasions angulo 2013 anonymous 2008 lopez 2017 due to its popularity jacó is among the prioritized areas for sanitation infrastructure improvements by the costa rican government angulo 2015 jacó beach was chosen for this study in part because it is heavily used for recreation year round some of the larger commercial establishments such as hotels have small scale wastewater treatment plants while much of the population has septic leach field systems however there is a population that discharges directly into the surface waters or the stormwater collection system which discharges to the rivers or the beach mora 2009 we tested two major hypotheses in this study 1 was there seasonal variation in environmental variables that influenced fecal indicator microorganism mst marker and pathogen levels and relationships among them and 2 could mst sewage markers predict the presence of pathogens better than established fib criteria used to regulate recreational water quality we used multivariate statistical methods that are appropriate for left censored data i e observations below the limit of detection or quantification of a given analytical method left censored data are a major issue in public health related water microbiology because relevant pathogen concentrations tend to be below our ability to measure them in environmental waters ortega et al 2009 soller et al 2016 symonds and breitbart 2015 2 methods 2 1 study site and sample collection jacó beach is a 4 2 km long beach located in a westward facing bay on the costa rican pacific coast fig 1 tides at this beach are semidiurnal with a meso tidal range i e difference between high and low tide is 2 to 4 m thus samples were purposefully collected during outgoing i e transition from high to low tide and incoming i e transition from low to high tide tides each season three rivers and their ocean discharge sites were sampled on three occasions for each combination of season rainy october 2017 and dry march 2018 and tidal cycle incoming and outgoing copey river naranjal river and madrigal river resulting in a total of 72 samples collected from 12 sampling events of the total number of samples collected 36 were river samples and 36 ocean samples such that 9 river and ocean samples were collected per season and tide combination during each sampling event water was collected from the three rivers along the beach within three meters of the riverbank ideally where salinity was less than 1 ppt additionally water was collected in the ocean between the swash zone and the first set of waves just outside each river plume where the salinity was ideally 30 ppt the direction of the river plume northward or southward was identified by adding a handful of bright dyes standard yellow green powder 25 kingscote chemicals miamisburg us to the river and observing the movement of the dyed river plume all samples were collected within 10 cm of the water surface for each sampling site two types of samples were collected 500 ml and large volume samples the 500 ml grab samples were collected in sterile containers and transported at 4 c to the costa rican national water quality laboratory for fecal coliform and enterococci analyses that were performed within 12 h the large volume water samples were concentrated on site as described in section 2 2 2 2 sample concentration and handling ultrafiltration was used on site to concentrate alternative fecal indicators pathogens and mst markers from 50 l water samples 50 l only when filter clogged as previously described smith and hill 2009 clogged filters infrequently 3 of samples resulted in lower sample volumes briefly a peristaltic pump powered by a portable generator pushed 50 l of water through a 2 mm nylon mesh and subsequently through a rexeed 25sx dialysis filter asahi kasei japan the rexeed 25sx dialysis filters were stored at 4 c and shipped to bcs laboratories in gainesville florida for processing within 72 h of collection 2 3 microbiological quantification methods fecal coliforms were enumerated by the five tube most probable number mpn technique using ec media according to the american public health association standard methods section 9221 e american public health association 2017 and following costa rican regulations 33903 minae s 2007 and water quality monitoring recommendations mora 2007 enterococci enumeration was performed using membrane filtration and mei agar according to the us environmental protection agency us epa method 1600 us epa 2005a all rexeed 25sx dialysis filters were eluted as previously described mull and hill 2012 briefly the filters were back flushed with a 500 ml solution containing 0 5 tween 80 0

1996 giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp were also enumerated by immunomagnetic separation and microscopy by us epa method 1623 us epa 2005b finally viruses and bacteria in the remaining 210 ml of final concentrate were further concentrated by polyethylene glycol peg precipitation hill et al 2010 mull and hill 2012 the final concentrate was amended with 12 peg 8000 0 9 m nacl and 1 bovine serum albumin held at 4 c for 2 h and centrifuged at 10 000 x g for 20 min the pellet was resuspended in 0 15 m na2hpo4 7h2o stored at 20 c and shipped to the university of south florida for molecular analysis of mst markers hf183 and pmmov and novgi hf183 and pmmov were previously validated as appropriate sewage associated markers in costa rica greater than 90 sensitive and specific to domestic sewage symonds et al 2018 limits of detection for analyses are provided in table s1 2 4 molecular analyses 2 4 1 nucleic acid extraction and qpcr analysis dna and rna were extracted from all sample

germantown usa see section 2 4 2 all dna samples were tested for hf183 and sketa table 1 cdna synthesis was performed by reverse transcription rt with the superscript iv first strand synthesis system invitrogen carlsbad usa and all cdna samples were analyzed for pmmov novgi and fcv table 1 all samples and extraction rt controls were analyized in duplicate the presence of rt qpcr inhibition was assessed by analyzing a 1 10 dilution of sample dna and cdna for the hf183 and pmmov assays respectively pcr inhibition was determined by comparing the cq quantification cycle of an undiluted sample to a 1 10 diluted sample pcr inhibition was deemed to be absent if the cq of the diluted sample was at least 2 cq lower than that of the undiluted sample cao et al 2012 no inhibition was observed during this study all assays were run using an abi 7500 real time pcr system thermo fisher scientific waltham us all extraction blanks were negative for all rt qpcr assays negative controls containing

usa in situ at the time of sample collection rainfall mm in the last 12 h was measured using a weather station acurite pro 5 in 1 weather station lake geneva us located in jacó within 1 2 km of the sample collection sites 2 5 data analyses r version 4 0 2 was used to execute all statistical analyses descriptive statistics hypothesis testing and redundancy analyses as well as correlation analyses r core team 2013 all values less than the lod and loq were censored to 1 lod or loq respectively and all subsequent statistical analyses for censored data were executed using the nada r package and a package obtained from the nondetects and data analysis training course downloaded at https practicalstats teachable com on june 20 2020 helsel 2019 2011 lee 2017 data censoring took into account both the non detects concentrations below the lod and positive but not quantifiable detects concentrations below the loq multivariate analyses were executed to avoid problems with the increased type i error associated with multiple pair wise comparisons and multiple hypothesis tests prior to all multivariate analyses all environmental parameters were standardized by calculating their z score and an euclidean distance matrix was calculated all microbial data were natural log ln normally distributed thus they were ln transformed the u score ranks were calculated for all the ln transformed microbial data to account for censored observations helsel 2019 2011 to accommodate left censored data in all multivariate analyses euclidean distance matrices were calculated from the microbial u score ranks helsel 2011 statistical significance for all analyses was assessed at α 0 05 river and ocean water sampling were based upon measurements of salinity and not a specific location given the influence of tides on the river and ocean sampling locations differences by water type were confirmed by the clear clustering observed in the non metric multidimensional scaling plot using all environmental and microbial variables fig s1 consequently river and ocean data were analyzed separately non metric multidimensional scaling was also used to identify possible differences between sub watersheds for all of the river as well as the ocean environmental and microbial variables separately the data for each sub watershed were grouped together for the river and ocean respectively given the lack of distinctive clustering by sub watershed and the close proximity of the sub watersheds figures s2 and s3 2 5 1 descriptive statistics in order to describe and understand the water quality at jacó beach the data from river and ocean discharge sites were grouped by season rainy vs dry there were 18 samples for any given water type and season for the environmental data only boxplots were created to describe each environmental parameter by season and by tide n 9 for each grouping for the microbial data boxplots were created to describe each non censored microorganism by season based upon these groupings descriptive statistics were calculated for all environmental and non censored microbial data for all microbial variables that included left censored data values but that were 80 left censored descriptive statistics were estimated using robust regression on order statistics rros where a lognormal distribution was assumed for modeling the left censored portion of the distribution observations below the process lod or loq using nada r package helsel 2011 lee 2017 pathogen data included 80 left censored values thus the frequency of detection for each pathogen was determined 2 5 2 testing differences in environmental and microbial data by season and tide given the multi factor sampling design by season and by tide and the multivariate data distance based redundancy analysis dbrda followed by an analysis of variance like permutation test to assess the significance of constraints was used to test for differences in the environmental data by season tide and season and tide combined rainy incoming vs rainy outgoing vs dry incoming vs dry outgoing legendre et al 2011 legendre and anderson 1999 differences in microorganism concentrations by season tide and season and tide combined were also tested by dbrda as previously described river and ocean data were considered separately analyses was executed using the vegan package oksanen et al 2016 a manhattan distance matrix was calculated from the binomial season and tide categories for all dbrda analyses each season contained 18 samples in which nine were collected during the outgoing tide and nine were collected during the incoming tide 2 5 3 relationships between environmental variables and microorganisms redundancy analysis rda is a multivariate analysis commonly used in microbial ecology to understand multivariate linear relationships legendre and legendre 2012 ramette 2007 here it was executed using the vegan package oksanen et al 2016 to test the following null hypotheses for river and ocean data separately there is no significant multivariate linear relationship between environmental parameters and microbial data the variance inflation factor was calculated for each set of model explanatory variables to assess the severity of multicollinearity all variance inflation factors were less than or equal to 2 thus minimal correlations were identified between the explanatory environmental variables 2 5 4 exceedance of recreational water quality criteria pathogen presence and indicator criteria and mst marker performance with respect to pathogen detection all water samples were classified by their fecal coliform and enterococci concentrations according to costa rican and us epa recreational water quality criteria rwqc costa rican rwqc include fecal coliform and enterococci criteria fecal coliform criteria developed in costa rica mora 2007 and the cr enterococci criteria are based upon the us epa rwqc us epa 2012b coastal waters were considered appropriate for recreation when enterococci geometric mean concentrations were below 35 cfu 100 ml and or fecal coliform geometric mean concentrations were below 240 or 1000 mpn 100 ml for marine or freshwater respectively the us epa rwqc statistical threshold value stv 130 cfu 100 ml was used to define when water samples were not appropriate for swimming per us epa rwqc since costa rica s recommendations do not include a threshold value for a single sample the geometric mean criterion was used to classify each water sample to explore the predictive relationship between fib rwqc and pathogen presence water samples were binned as follows 1 fib above or below rwqc and 2 any pathogen detected or no pathogen detected the relationship between rwqc exceedance and pathogen detection was subsequently calculated as follows 1 true positive tp rwqc exceedance pathogen detection 2 true negative tn rwqc not exceeded and pathogen not detected 3 false positive fp rwqc exceedance but pathogen not detected and 4 false negative fn rwqc not exceeded but pathogens detected for each criterion the following were calculated the sensitivity indicating how frequently the criterion was exceeded when at last one pathogen was detected was determined as 1 t p t p f n the specificity indicating how frequently fib levels were below the criterion when no pathogen was detected was calculated as 2 t n t n f p the positive predictive value indicating how frequently a rwqc exceedance co occurred with detection of at least one pathogen was calculated as 3 t p t p f p and the negative predictive value indicating how frequently fib levels below the criterion co occurred with detection of 0 pathogens was calculated as 4 t n t n f n a similar exercise was carried out to compare the predictive ability of mst sewage markers hf183 and pmmov to indicate pathogen presence given the lack of livestock activities and point sources of treated and undertreated domestic wastewater mora 2009 orozco montoya 2015 in this case the mst markers were binned according to whether they were above or below the process lod or according to mst marker criteria which were based on qmra estimates of human health risks associated with recreational water exposure ahmed et al 2018a crank et al 2019 ahmed et al 2018a calculated that 3220 hf183 gc 100 ml and 544 pmmov gc 100 ml are associated with the us epa benchmark for recreational waters 36 illnesses 1000 swimmers for pmmov only crank et al 2019 estimated that 5054 pmmov gc 100 ml was associated with the us epa benchmark for recreational waters 30 illnesses 1000 swimmers 2 5 5 correlations between fecal indicator microorganisms and mst markers and pathogens the mantel test a multivariate approach was used to identify correlations between indicator microorganisms and mst markers one matrix and pathogens second matrix in the rivers and ocean separately legendre and legendre 2012 this approach was executed using the kendall method with the vegan package oksanen et al 2016 and included 9999 permutations euclidean distance matrices one for the indicator microorganisms and mst markers and the second one for the pathogens were calculated and the correlation between the two matrices was analyzed in order to identify the best subset of indicator microorganism and mst markers that maximized the correlations with the pathogen concentrations iterative mantel tests with the kendall method were executed using the bio env procedure clarke and ainsworth 1993 from the vegan package oksanen et al 2016 3 results the environmental data varied by season and to a lesser extent by tide figure s4 the mean rainfall was 0 88 mm and 21 42 mm in the dry and rainy season respectively the mean physical chemical water parameters were as follows for the river in the dry and rainy season respectively water temperature 28 84 c and 27 07 c salinity 0 23 ppt and 0 37 ppt and turbidity 3 95 ntu and 24 06 ntu in the ocean data mean physical chemical water parameters were as follows for the dry and rainy season respectively water temperature 29 80 c and 27 43 c salinity 31 40 ppt and 27 60 ppt and turbidity 23 19 ntu and 64 96 ntu with respect to tides median turbidity was greatest during the incoming tide in the rivers 16 5 ntu and the outgoing tide in the ocean 21 5 ntu figure s4 median river and ocean water temperatures were greatest during the outgoing tide 30 2 c and 30 55 c respectively the median salinities were similar in the river 0 2 ppt and ocean 32 ppt respectively regardless of season or tidal stage however increased variability was observed in the rainy season in which higher salinities 0 4 ppt were identified in the river and lower salinities in the ocean 30 ppt particularly on the outgoing tide similarly the microbial data varied by season in the river measurements of enterococci male specific coliphage and hf183 were at least one order of magnitude greater during the rainy season fig 2 and table s2 furthermore the frequency of detection of most pathogens giardia salmonella and cryptosporidium was greatest during the rainy season except for novgi which was only detected during dry season table 2 in the ocean enterococci fecal coliforms male specific coliphage and hf183 were at least one order of magnitude greater during the rainy season and somatic coliphage had greater concentrations during the dry season fig 2 and tables s2 the overall pathogen detection frequency was greatest in the ocean during the rainy season table 2 3 1 hypothesis testing for differences associated with seasons and tides river and ocean samples were collected on six occasions in the rainy and six occasions in the dry season as well as during outgoing i e transition from high to low tide and incoming i e transition from low to high tide tides thus analyses testing the differences in environmental parameters and microorganisms by season and tide were executed for the river and ocean data separately for each water type n 9 for each season and tide combination 3 1 1 differences in environmental parameters by season and tide river significant differences in river environmental parameters between seasons f 7 3483 p 0 001 and tides f 4 519 p 0 003 were identified by dbrda separately significant differences in river environmental parameters were also identified by the multi factor hypothesis test for season and

p 0 015 by dbrda separately significant differences in ocean environmental parameters were also identified by the dbrda multi factor hypothesis test for season and tide f 6 0915 p 0 001 in which water temperature f 8 7430 p 0 001 and rainfall f 8 0718 p 0 001 most significantly contributed to the differences observed turbidity f 0 4717 p 0 852 and salinity f 1 1654 p 0 354 were not a significant contributors 3 1 2 differences in microbial parameters by season and tide river significant differences in river microorganism concentrations were identified between seasons f 12 667 p 0 001 and not tides f 1 8465 p 0 116 using dbrda significant differences in river microorganisms concentrations were identified by the dbrda multi factor hypothesis test for season and tide combined f 3 1006 p 0 001 in which cryptosporidium concentrations significantly contributed the most to the differences observed f 5 5225 p 0 003 followed by enterococci f 4 4098 p 0 007 and novgi f 3 8663 p 0 014 ocean significant differences in ocean microorganism concentrations between seasons f 6 5674 p 0 001 but not between tides f 1 5659 p 0 179 were identified by dbrda somatic coliphage contributed the most to the differences observed between seasons f 5 9577 p 0 028 followed by pmmov f 3 9262 p 0 064 significant differences in ocean microorganism concentrations were identified by the dbrda multi factor hypothesis test for season and tide f 2 1354 p 0 003 however no specific microorganism s significantly contributed to the differences identified 3 2 relationships between environmental variables and

microbial concentrations f 2 8307 p 0 006 and f 2 619 p 0 003 respectively water temperature and turbidity did not significantly explain microbial variability f 0 7604 p 0 617 and f 0 9993 p 0 459 respectively in the model in the rda ordination plot all microorganisms clustered where salinity was lowest enterococci male specific coliphage and cryptosporidium grouped together and were clustered with higher rainfall and turbidity and decreasing temperature contrastingly fecal coliforms c perfringens somatic coliphage salmonella and novgi grouped together with increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall and turbidity ocean there was also a significant relationship between environmental parameters and microorganisms in the ocean in which the rda model explained 26 44 of microorganism variability f 4 0561 p 0 001 adjusted r2 0 2644 fig 4 all of the variability was explained by the first canonical axis rda1 p 0 001 rainfall f 3 1391 p 0 025 water temperature f 3 0286 p

the rda ordination plot microorganism concentrations were typically clustered where salinity and water temperature were lowest enterococci fecal coliforms c perfringens male specific coliphage hf183 pmmov cryptosporidium and giardia grouped together according to increasing rainfall and decreasing water temperature while somatic coliphage clustered with decreasing rainfall and increasing temperatures 3 3 exceedance of rwqc and performance of indicator microorganisms and mst markers with respect to pathogen detection fib concentrations in 89 100 of the river samples exceeded rwqc regardless of the standard to which they were compared table 3 fecal coliform and enterococci geometric mean concentrations were 9 04 103 cfu 100 ml and 1 26 103 mpn 100 ml respectively fib levels in the ocean samples exceeded rwqc much less frequently 25 44 with fecal coliform and enterococci geometric mean concentrations of 9 68 101 cfu 100 ml and 2 98 101 mpn 100 ml respectively with respect to mst markers hf183 and pmmov were detected in 100 of river samples as well as 88 9 and 91 7 of ocean samples respectively the mean hf183 and pmmov concentrations in the rainy season were 5 7 103 and 5 3 103 gc 100 ml in the rivers respectively compared to 7 9 102 and 5 1 102 gc 100 ml in the ocean respectively table s2 during the dry season mean hf183 and pmmov concentrations in the rivers were 3 8 102 and 1 0 102 gc 100 ml respectively compared to 7 9 102 and 5 1 102 gc 100 ml in the ocean respectively table s2 the ability of indicator microorganisms to predict pathogen presence was assessed by binning indicator observations into above or below rwqc i e criteria for enterococci or fecal coliforms and by binning pathogen detection results e g at least one pathogen detected or no pathogens detected in a sample performance metrics sensitivity specificity positive predictive value and negative predictive value were then calculated see methods for details table 3 table s3 regardless of the criterion used enterococci and fecal coliforms were sensitive to pathogen presence in both water types 88 100 i e indicator criteria were generally exceeded when pathogens were present specificity was low in river samples 0 25 but higher in ocean samples 68 93 due largely to infrequent observations of fib below rwqc in river samples 0 for cr fecal coliforms and enterococci criteria 11 for the us epa stv positive predictive values were higher in river 89 91 than in ocean 44 78 samples indicating greater confidence that indicator microorganisms above rwqc in river samples would correctly indicate pathogen presence compared to ocean samples table 3 negative predictive values were low in the river 11 25 again driven by very few indicator microorganism observations below the rwqc in the ocean the negative predictive values were highest for enterococci stv standard and fecal coliforms 95 96 and were much lower for the costa rican enterococci criteria 50 the ability of mst markers to predict pathogen presence in water samples was explored in a similar manner table 4 when mst markers were binned as above positive or below negative the lod sensitivity was 100 in river and ocean samples indicating that the mst marker was always observed when at least one pathogen was detected when binning criteria for mst markers was changed to reflect the qmra estimated criteria byahmed et al 2018a sensitivity dropped to 88 for pmmov and 53 for hf183 in river samples and dropped to 0 for both markers in ocean samples thus this drop in sensitivity by using qmra estimated criteria indicated an increased frequency of false negative relationships mst marker below criteria but pathogen present for pmmov the more stringent criteria estimated by cranks et al 2019 produced a much lower sensitivity in river samples 40 compared to 88 compared to ahmed s criteria specificity was low for both mst markers when they were binned according to the lod 0 14 but was improved by binning according to qmra criteria particularly in ocean samples for example specificity of hf183 in ocean samples increased from 14 lod binning to 93 qmra binning pmmov followed a similar pattern indicating that the more stringent criteria for defining a mst marker positive decreased the rate of false positives mst marker positive no pathogens detected positive predictive values for mst markers under all criteria were markedly better in river compared to ocean samples indicating greater confidence that a positive mst result would be co observed with a pathogen in river samples compared to ocean while negative predictive values showed the opposite trend 3 4 correlations between indicator microorganisms and mst markers and pathogens a significant correlation between indicator microorganisms and mst markers and pathogens was identified by the multivariate mantel test for river τ 0 131 p 0 0004 and ocean datasets τ 0 1699 p 0 0008 c perfringens somatic coliphage male specific coliphage and pmmov were the subset of indicator microorganisms and mst markers that maximized the correlation with pathogen concentrations in the rivers τ 0 1529 p 0 0003 in the ocean enterococci male specific coliphage and pmmov were the subset of indicator microorganisms and mst markers that maximized correlations with the pathogen concentrations τ 0 2710 p 0 0001 fig 5 is a conceptual diagram that illustrates these results 4 discussion jacó like the majority of tropical beaches is a popular beach whose recreational waters receive treated and undertreated domestic wastewater mora 2009 world health organization and unicef 2014 our analyses consisted of multivariate approaches that were appropriate for the left censored data sets typical of environmental pathogens which allowed for their analysis in spite of frequent undetectable concentrations helsel 2011 since the power of statistical analyses are compromised when a large percentage of the data are censored future studies are needed to corroborate the findings presented here using multivariate analyses we identified that the environmental parameters were significantly different by season and tide and explained 12 and 26 of the microbial variability in the river and the ocean respectively the percentage of variability explained by environmental parameters is similar to other studies laureano rosario et al 2017 it also likely reflects the constant discharge of domestic wastewater to the rivers which was identified by frequently high levels of mst markers bacteroides hf183 and pmmov in river samples and to a lesser extent in the ocean waters a previous study identified illegal sewage connections to the stormwater system that drained into the river study areas mora 2009 4 1 environmental variables explain some variability in pathogens while correlations among variables are not necessarily indicative of cause and effect relationships they nonetheless provide important information about relationships among variables in complex natural systems these relationships can be used to develop hypotheses that may be tested in manipulative experiments however this type of scientific inquiry is extremely difficult to carry out in a representative manner in scenarios as complex and variable as anthropogenically impacted beaches multivariate statistical analyses yield more insight about complex systems than univariate analyses because they consider multiple independent and dependent variables simultaneously as such they produce a more holistic analysis that is also less subject to the type i statistical errors that easily arise from conducting multiple univariate analyses grace 2002 we therefore used multivariate statistics to analyze relationships of microorganisms with environmental variables and with each other throughout this study an additional complexity in analyses of relationships among human pathogens in anthropogenically impacted environments is that pathogens may be contributed to water bodies by sewage or by the feces of a variety of animals harwood et al 2014 korajkic et al 2018 nguyen et al 2018 fecal material derived from various sources will doubtlessly be affected differently by environmental variables contributing to discrepant relationships that would not be expected in simpler systems rainfall which was significantly different between seasons was a significant predictive variable of microbial concentrations in river and ocean models previous studies also found a positive relationship between rainfall and fecal associated microorganisms ahmed et al 2018b curriero et al 2001 laureano rosario et al 2017 shehane et al 2005 interestingly contrasting associations between rainfall and the fecal microorganisms occurred in the rivers and ocean in the rivers cryptosporidium increased with increasing rainfall while novgi was highest when rainfall was lowest while pathogen detection was infrequent in the ocean cryptosporidium tended to increase when rainfall was higher heavy rainfall often results ito increased runoff and saturation of soils which can cause leakage from septic leach field systems such leakage may increase pathogen concentrations in surface waters particularly those pathogens that are usually removed e g unicellular parasites hofstra and vermeulen 2016 neumann et al 2015 of the microorganisms cryptosporidium made the greatest contribution to the differences observed between seasons as it was only detected during rainy season in the river and ocean although this pathogen is not exclusive to humans limited agricultural and livestock activities occur in the jacó beach watershed orozco montoya 2015 it is likely that the high percentage of septic leach field systems combined with intense rainfall led to increased cryptosporidium concentrations in the rainy season the other protozoan parasite analyzed giardia was detected equally across seasons and as frequently as cryptosporidium overall cryptosporidium prevalence in human populations is strongly correlated with precipitation particularly in tropical locations jagai et al 2009 our results suggest that giardia prevalence in fecal contaminated surface waters is not as affected by season as cryptosporidium perhaps because of the presence of a source other than sewage giardia infection in canines is not uncommon even in well cared for dogs hascall et al 2016 many dogs roam jacó beach and canine associated parasites have been frequently detected in jacó beach sand castro et al 2009 salmonella and novgi were detected most frequently during the dry season in the rivers which likely reflects the increased volume of sewage generated when tourism is greatest and possibly the seasonality of the pathogen in the population seasonal variability in novgi concentrations in domestic wastewater is understudied in the tropics nevertheless there is evidence of high concentrations year round on the costa rican pacific coast symonds et al 2017 and increased concentrations have been identified in the dry season in the san josé greater metropolitan area chacon et al 2020 it is likely that novgi was detected most frequently in the rivers during the dry season due to increased tourism in the area borowy 2004 which leads to increased wastewater generated and also increases the potential for the introduction of novgi cases from other countries or areas within costa rica furthermore an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness occurred in jacó during the dry season sampling period in which nov was among the suspected causative agents ministerio de salud 2018 it is also likely that lower river flow in the dry season indicating less dilution by rainwater as well as lower turbidities improved the likelihood of novgi detection in the rivers during the dry season mull and hill 2012 salinity was a dominant predictive variable in the river and ocean models generally correlating negatively with pathogens this relationship was likely due to the greater inflow of untreated and partially treated sewage directly to the rivers thus lower salinity waters almost always contained more pathogens given the higher percentage of riverwater tidal stage also influenced salinity by changing the relative proportion of river and ocean water in samples which was visually apparent in the rainy season when the river discharge created a marked brown mass of low salinity water along the coast this relationship was also identified by previous studies where higher fib and salmonella levels were negatively correlated with salinity ortega et al 2009 walters et al 2011 water temperature was a significant predictor of fecal microorganisms in the ocean in which they clustered according to decreasing temperature several studies have also determined an inverse relationship between fecal microorganisms and water temperature and have found associations between bacterial die off and increasing water temperature walters et al 2011 faust et al 1975 vasconcelos and swarmz 1976 although water temperature was significantly different between seasons in both river and the ocean it was not a significant predictor of microorganism variability in the rivers 4 2 performance of indicator criteria and mst markers with respect to pathogen detection recreational water quality at jacó and many other tropical beaches is regulated by fib criteria originally developed in temperate climates some have recommended regionally specific guidelines for tropical beaches due to the influence of climate on microbial ecology and ineffective wastewater treatment in low income communities e g verhougstraete et al 2020 while epidemiological studies are needed to identify and validate rwqc in the tropics we were able to relate fib rwqc from the united states and costa rica as well as sewage associated mst markers with pathogen detection in this study the predictive capabilities of the cr fecal coliform and enterococci geometric mean rwqc and the us epa enterococci stv rwqc with respect to pathogen presence were similar and most had high sensitivity rwqc exceedance when at least one pathogen was detected this result was unexpected because fecal coliform concentrations are less likely to be correlated with human health outcomes from exposure to recreational water in comparison to enterococci in marine and freshwaters us epa 2012b 2000 wade et al 2003 enterococci were more specific with respect to pathogen presence in river and ocean samples compared to fecal coliforms indicating fewer false positive results when using enterococci criteria fib above rwqc when pathogens were not detected the predictive capability of mst markers hf183 and pmmov to identify pathogen presence was also assessed mst marker detection was used as a permissive criterion for calling a marker positive while criterion based on qmra estimates of execeeding the us epa benchmark were used as a more rigorous criterion the permissive lod criterion detection produced 100 sensitivity marker always present when at least one pathogen was detected but very low specificity marker frequently positive when no pathogen was detected thus it appears that low levels of the markers are unlikely to be associated with sewage borne pathogens particularly in the ocean where positive predictive values were low ahmed et al 2018a calculated that 3220 hf183 gc 100 ml and 544 pmmov gc 100 ml are associated with the us epa benchmark for recreational waters 36 gastroenteritis illnesses 1000 swimmers for pmmov only crank et al 2019 estimated that 5054 pmmov gc 100 ml is associated with the approximate us epa benchmark for recreational waters 30 illnesses 1000 swimmers both studies based risk in part on estimated nov sewage concentrations from the literature which may not accurately describe the nov prevalence in jacó sewage binning mst marker levels according to these qmra estimates greater than or less than the benchmark markedly increased specificity with respect to prediction of pathogen presence in river and ocean samples compared to binning mst markers by lod detected or not detected the sensitivity of pmmov towards pathogens using the ahmed et al 2018a benchmark was markedly greater than that for the crank et al 2019 estimate suggesting that at jacó beach the higher pmmov criterion elevated the false negative results mst marker below criterion pathogens detected this comparison illustrates the variability of qmra estimates developed in different geographic regions the data collected in this study will provide the opportunity to develop a regionally specific qmra and will also be augmented by data from subsequent sampling efforts 4 3 fecal pollution toolbox approach in tropical surface waters relationships between fecal microorganisms are complex making the predictive capabilities of one fecal indicator or mst marker alone inadequate to accurately indicate pathogen presence fujioka et al 2015 symonds and breitbart 2015 viau et al 2011a in this study for example fecal microorganisms formed two distinct clusters based on the influence of environmental parameters in rda ordination plots in both rivers and the ocean furthermore no one fecal indicator or mst marker best correlated with pathogens in the river or ocean waters rather the use of multiple fecal microorganisms best correlated with pathogens which was also previously observed for tropical streams viau et al 2011a in this study different subsets of the fecal microorganisms best correlated with pathogens c perfringens somatic and male specific coliphage and pmmov in the rivers and enterococci male specific coliphage and pmmov in ocean waters fig 5 the best subset of indicator microorganisms and mst markers always included at least two viruses and one fib regardless of the water type the presence of pmmov and male specific coliphage in both the river and ocean subsets of fecal microorganisms that best correlated with pathogens further highlights the importance of these microorganisms as water quality indicators fujioka et al 2015 nappier et al 2019 symonds et al 2018 vergara et al 2015 viau et al 2011a 2011b it also further emphasizes the importance of including viral indicators to increase the likelihood of identifying the presence of pathogens symonds and breitbart 2015 for the river and ocean samples different fib were identified in the best subset of fecal microorganisms that maximized correlations to pathogens c perfringens was best for freshwaters when accompanied by three viral indicators which may reflect previous observations that c perfringens is a useful fecal indicator in tropical environments viau et al 2011 fujioka et al 2015 enterococci and two viral indicators best correcated with pathogens in the ocean previous studies have identified a significant relationship with enterococci concentrations and swimmer gastrointestinal illnesses in marine waters with point source pollution in temperate latitudes as well as in the tropics lamparelli et al 2015 verhougstraete et al 2020 our study further supports enterococci as an indicator of fecal contamination and human health risks in marine tropical waters future studies are needed to confirm the most appropriate combination of fecal indicators as well as their specific rwqc for jacó and other tropical beaches 5 conclusions regardless of season jacó rivers were implicated as sources of human fecal contamination based on percent exceedance rwqc high mst sewage marker concentrations and occurrence of diverse waterborne pathogens environmental variables explained 26 of the microbial variability rainfall was the most important predictor at jacó beach while salinity and water temperature were also significant in river and ocean models fib and mst sewage markers had high positive predictive values for pathogens in rivers when rwqc or qmra estimated criteria were used as benchmarks the us epa enterococci stv criterion had the highest positive 78 and negative 96 predictive value of all indicators in ocean samples c perfringens somatic and male specific coliphages and pmmov together maximized correlations with pathogens in the rivers while male specific coliphages pmmov and enterococci together maximized correlations with pathogens at ocean sites no one fecal indicator or mst sewage marker best correlated with pathogens rather the use of multiple fecal indicators and mst markers maximized pathogen correlations a fecal pollution toolbox approach containing at least one viral indicator is recommended for pathogen
