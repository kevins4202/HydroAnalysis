for in vivo water quality assessment that could be adapted to continuous surveillance nonetheless if avoidance is to be used to detect effluent contamination spikes it is essential that the method is robust and reproducible given the complexity and ever changing nature of wwtp outlets results from previous research on avoidance have only shown success in repeatability under controlled conditions with biosentinel pollution tracking shown to be highly sensitive to external stimuli and locomotor behaviour in amphipods showing inconsistency in baseline activity across independent assays castro et

micropollutant discharge suitable for use in wwtp effluent monitoring for this our study introduces the use of the toxmate technology a new device for invertebrate locomotor behavioural videotracking for both in laboratory and on site application the amphipod species gammarus fossarum was selected as the test organism this sentinel macroinvertebrate species is widespread in western europe s rivers wattier et al 2020 where it can be found at high densities and can be easily identified and selected for their biological characteristics chaumot et al 2015 continuous movement is not essential for g fossarum as it is not a filter feeder and can go prolonged periods without feeding hervant et al 1997 therefore it was deemed appropriate to pursue a strategy where organism conditioning was designed to attain a minimal activity model defined whereby average movement is continuously minimal or null during observation a state of lethargy to demonstrate avoidance sensitivity for varied chemicals both copper an inorganic heavy metal and methomyl an organic pesticide were tested copper is estimated to be one of the metals in wastewater that poses the most risk to aquatic environments aemig et al 2021 al saydeh et al 2017 mutzner et al 2022 shrivastava et al 2009 due to its high value in industry for uses such as metal finishing plastics and fungicides french national micropollutant campaigns in 2021 showed that almost 98 of the 476 evaluated wwtps in 2021 detected copper contamination at entry with almost 50 of treatment plants exceeding allowable concentration levels some with average entry concentration over 100 µg l ineris 2021 methomyl a well characterised carbamate historically used as an insecticide that acts as an acetylcholinesterase ache inhibitor barr et al 2011 lorenz et al 2011 was selected for its relevance as a neurotoxic compound as neurotoxic insecticides are regularly detected in municipal wastewater and surface water münze et al 2017 weston et al 2013 in addition studies have shown amphipod species such as gammarids to be particularly sensitive to such chemicals causing drift beketov et al 2008 nørum et al 2010 švara et al 2021 a type of avoidance araújo et al 2020 johnston et al 2015 our hypotheses for a robust biotest rely firstly on the condition that g fossarum shows an avoidance reaction in response to micropollutant concentration surge in this case for the two model chemicals cu and methomyl and secondly that the minimal activity conditions defined ensure reproducible conditions for avoidance reaction detection we propose that minimising baseline activity will both reduce the influence of environmental conditions which could be viewed as confounding factors and increase signal resolution for activity increase in the case of contaminant induced avoidance to test our hypotheses this article first presents the methods used to attain minimal activity and secondly presents results from g fossarum exposure to spikes of the two different micro pollutants in varying conditions including long term monitoring at a wwtp effluent 2 materials and methods 2 1 g fossarum collection and conditioning organisms were collected 3 weeks prior to experiments at a known unpolluted upstream rhone basin source in the ain department france g fossarum are easily identified at this site and collected as one of the reference uncontaminated populations for all research at the ecotoxicology inrae laboratory lyon alric et al 2019 this source population was genetically characterized by coi barcoding in previous studies cogne et al 2019 prior to experimentation the organisms undergo a 3 week acclimation phase in the regularly controlled drill water source at the laboratory site the stabilisation basins are subject to complete darkness and constant temperature 12 13 ⁰c to replicate test conditions and remove the bias from day night cycle activity variations this method was developed to induce a state of minimal activity by the time of observation organisms are fed regularly over the acclimation to maximise the possible observation time without feeding in individual observation chambers of the toxmate 30 days 2 2 behavioural measurements in laboratory experiments organism tracking is carried out in the toxmate monitoring device using inbuilt viewpoint videotracking software toxmate designed for aquatic organism video tracking is used here for the individual measurement of invertebrate avoidance during exposure to micropollutants the apparatus is made up of a compact cubic chamber unit with three observation panels composed of four columns of four individual chambers allowing for monitoring in continuous water flow conditions fig 1 observation panels are connected to a water tank by hydraulic pumps forming a closed 15 l water circuit for experiments the flowrate is 1 4 l min in each of the three panels meaning organisms are exposed to a flow rate of 0 35 l min in the four column arrangement tested to be quasi laminar across the panel in the scope of this study g fossarum was used to measure behavioural response avoidance to chemical exposure spiking each panel contains 16 isolated gammarids that are tracked individually by the software fig 1 removing any immobile organisms 5 across experiments infrared panels and cameras are used to enable total darkness output data files were calibrated to give the total displacement of each organism for 20 s time steps to limit biological variability homogenously sized males 10 mm are taken from pairs of gammarids in amplexus after the second week of acclimation the selected males are then left for a third week this process controls biotic factors and ensures moult in the week prior to exposition geffard et al 2010 2 3 experimental deployment on wwtp site the toxmate has been adapted for industrial use for wwtp effluent on line monitoring the interior of the compact chamber unit remains unchanged there is an added cooling chamber for thermoregulation as well as a filter system placed in a water control unit upstream of the toxmate fig 1b organism conditioning and acclimation periods remain unchanged from laboratory experiments and new organisms are put in once a month designated water inlets and outlets are added to the system to allow for a continuous bypass of the effluent on site monitoring and copper spiking tests for this study were carried out in 2021 and 2022 in the effluent of the saint fons wwtp in partnership with saur r d in the lyon agglomeration this wwtp serves an equivalent population of 1 million habitants and receives a daily average influx of 200 000 m 3 day with a 9 industrial affluent proportion in chemical oxygen demand 2 4 chemical preparation and spiking protocol both chemicals cu and methomyl were prepared in a highly demineralised water solution a range of spike concentrations were tested for both substances ranging from 30 to 300 µgl 1 all concentrations remained sublethal lc50 as estimated via preliminary 48 h acute mortality testing as well as previous laboratory research xuereb et al 2009 in order to avoid an initial artificially high spike in concentration which can be disproportionately detrimental to organism health berghahn et al 2012 mcdonald et al 2020 a pre dilution is carried out with 300 ml of water from the circuit to ensure near instantaneous mixing the solution is systematically introduced after 96 h of toxmate exposure following results from the development of the minimal activity model see section 3 1 to evaluate the effects of exposure concentration samples were taken and analysed at five even log intervals for both chemicals t 1 min 5 min 20 min 1 h 5 h and 20 h to ensure minimal degradation quick onset of stress shown to occur in less than one minute and minimal overshoot in initial exposure supplementary materials appendix a 2 5 statistical analyses python and r were used for all data treatment and signal processing of the results minimal activity was defined by a 12 h period whereby the median locomotor activity remained stationary according to an augmented dickey fuller test from the movement distribution x i of n 16 gammarids at a given time t corresponding to travelled distance for each individual during 20 s the avoidance response a x i is calculated as the square of quantile q p as indicated in eq 1 for a quantile probability p 0 05 1 a x i q 0 05 2 x i 1 2 n q p x i 1 γ x j 1 γ x j j pn 1 γ pn pn for dose response curves evaluation of total avoidance response during a spiking experiment was calculated by taking the integral over time of the avoidance measures up to 10 h post spike were systematically considered after ensuring minimal chemical decomposition in the exposure system supplementary materials appendix a 3 results and discussion 3 1 minimal activity model control repetitions for g fossarum videotracking showed high initial locomotor activity which subsequently decreased significantly before reaching a stable minimal activity state fig 2 the time required to obtain minimal activity was estimated via both dickey fuller stationarity tests and an intersection estimate between regression fits for the initial activity 0 48 h and the final activity last 24 h both methods showed that a stable baseline activity was consistently reached in around 72 h across repetitions supplementary materials appendix b given the average time taken to reach minimal activity chemicals were introduced during testing at least 96 h after the placement of gammarids in the toxmate observation chambers day night activity cycles along with higher activity variance were notable during the first 48 h of observation however both phenomena dissipated by the time minimal activity was reached fig 2 implying that the stabilisation procedure is effective in creating a reproducible environment providing chemical exposure occurs during minimal activity this result shows that g fossarum minimal activity can be obtained via controlled acclimation conditions which was then also observed in on site wwtp effluent conditions in section 3 3 similar research on behavioural changes in macroinvertebrates by nørum et al 2010 successfully demonstrated rapid surges in behavioural activity in response to comparable chemical exposure but observed that pre exposure mean activity presented high variability even between control and test groups the minimal activity model proposed here is successful in overcoming this obstacle achieving the stable baseline across testing necessary for robustness and comparison of assays it does however impose the use of hyperactivity avoidance as a stress indicator as minimal movement means inhibition cannot be observed 3 2 micropollutant sensitivity initially avoidance behaviour was assessed for cu spikes showing immediate increase in activity as well as a significant decrease in activity variance upon chemical exposure fig 3 the immediate changes in response to the presence of the cu solution at 100 µgl 1 indicate global activity increase and stress avoidance gauthier et al 2016 the measure of a lower quantile q 0 05 from the activity distribution was used to channel avoidance eq 1 as it remained quasi zero in control conditions and only spiked upon chemical exposure giving a sustained response fig 3 avoidance is thus defined in the minimal activity model as uniformly high locomotor activity an extreme event shown not to occur in control conditions which are characterised by the stable null baseline even the short upsurge in avoidance after 18 h was associated with a sustained avoidance reaction as despite a small spike in the high end of the control distribution the avoidance signal remains undisturbed and the onset is decorrelated by over an hour furthermore median activity in the cu sample is unchanged at the time of the avoidance spike the decreased overall activity obtained thanks to the 96 h acclimation period before spiking does not seem to compensate on organism sensitivity to micropollutant spikes as there is a quick clear avoidance response the advantage of using an avoidance metrics based on a lower quantile of individual locomotor activity distribution here q0 05 to increase test repeatability and channel sensitivity to micropollutants is clear when compared to the median activity curve for a cu spike fig 3 where the median values quickly returned to control levels and total variance gives no repeatability in control conditions such short response time on the hourly scale is novel in non lethal bioassay testing and could provide valuable real time information for micropollutant detection and alerting validating avoidance signal sensitivity to copper and methomyl results from four independent experimental repetitions showed repeatability in the onset of avoidance patterns for both model compounds 100 µgl 1 and 125 µgl 1 for cu and methomyl respectively fig 4 a despite differences in amplitude and total avoidance time all repetitions showed avoidance for both chemicals the avoidance triggered by cu was characterised by an instantaneous reaction and high initial gradient followed by a gradual decline in avoidance perhaps linked to the experimental setup whereby organisms cannot escape the contaminated area contrary to the cu response the methomyl avoidance reactions are more gradual with the onset of avoidance only peaking beyond around 3 h of exposure in general there was strong resemblance between reactions for each chemical in onset time and initial response gradient we confirmed via timely chemical analysis that the time required to reach the desired exposure concentration of organisms in the toxmate system occurs within the first minute post spiking for both chemicals supplementary materials appendix a previous studies have shown that for fish immediate response can be explained by olfaction in the case of both metals and insecticides könemann et al 2021 tierney et al 2010 implying that this may be the case for cu whilst it can be assumed that the more gradual onset methomyl reaction implies no immediate olfactive response in the case of gammarids the avoidance pathway is likely something different such as a reaction to the ache inhibition known to occur at such concentrations for g fossarum possibly not appearing toxic before the eventual metabolization of the chemical xuereb et al 2009 in both cases the biotest offers real time information on the presence of the micropollutants in the system for a response time ranging from the minute to a few hours providing novel reaction time amongst comparable bio assays the overall difference in response between the two chemicals is particularly interesting as it suggests that the qualitative differences in the behaviour are caused by the nature of the contamination and the test may even have potential for chemical class identification based on further testing using the defined protocol for screening a large spectrum of chemical compounds ongoing research into behavioural profiling aims to uncover such links between chemical classes and their triggered response following an approach similar to that previously conducted in biomedical research rihel et al 2010 when a range of sublethal concentrations were tested there was a positively correlated dose response curve for both cu and methomyl fig 4b using the integral of the avoidance signal over a 6 h period which ensures a period of stable exposure concentration as supported by sampling analysis in supplementary materials table a 1 there is a significant difference in between avoidance at all tested concentrations when compared to control tests the higher total avoidance measured for cu samples fig 4b are a consequence of the sharp initial gradient and quick onset followed by sustained avoidance despite some variance which can be explained by natural variation in residual movement activity the correlation demonstrates the biotest potential for quantifying organism exposure to micropollutants even at low concentrations 30 50 µgl 1 relevant to wwtps ineris 2021 it also opens the possibility of further study for use within chemical risk assessment procedures with a sensitive and rapid non lethal screening of biological impacts alcívar et al 2021 whilst there is a maintained positive correlation for cu there is a plateau in sensitivity for methomyl beyond 67 µgl 1 because this plateau is an order of magnitude below the maximum recorded avoidance signal for copper this saturation phenomenon supports the hypothesis that for the neurotoxic insecticide methomyl beyond a certain concentration the nerve transmission function is saturated and movement is impeded by ache inhibition xuereb et al 2009 one could alternatively hypothesise that this is due to toxicokinetics toxicodynamics saturation reinforcing the hypothesis that in order to have an impact on avoidance there must be uptake and or metabolisation of the compound by g fossarum thus explaining the latency and saturation 3 3 potential for real time micropollutant detection in wwtp effluents the last part of the study questioned the possible transposition of the laboratory results to real field conditions hence fig 5 shows the g fossarum reaction to copper spiking at 100 µgl 1 in two additional contrasting water types carried out during one laboratory experiment and one on site wwtp deployment of the toxmate apparatus we tested avoidance response to copper spiking in water sampled from the natural habitat of test organisms and in the wastewater effluent at the saint fons wwtp the industrial toxmate unit installed at the saint fons wwtp allowed for the analysis and characterisation of the effluent over two years of data collection with the copper spike shown zoomed on a several week extract of the monitoring period fig 5b and c testing in these two varied water matrices and under laboratory versus on site deployment conditions showed reproducibility in pre exposure minimal activity as well as the onset of avoidance induced by copper spiking fig 5 furthermore both reactions are similar in response duration and latency when compared with those observed for copper repetitions from the first tests performed in laboratory controlled water fig 3 when considering varied water matrices despite higher mean activity in the wastewater the baseline remains negligible for sustained periods and the cu spike was equally prominent showing the biotest to be robust and suitable for monitoring in a complex flow such as that of a wwtp effluent furthermore the avoidance signal observed returns to the null baseline sometime after cu exposure implying a second episode could potentially be captured in case of repeated events of contamination a second data extract from the surveillance study carried out in the saint fons wwtp corresponding to a summer period in 2021 is presented in fig 6 as no controlled spikes were carried out during this period the data reveals naturally occurring transitory avoidance events induced solely by the on line exposure to the wwtp effluent delineated within fig 6 in addition similarly to the copper spiking effluent experiment fig 5b the activity signal consistently returned to a minimal baseline after the transient avoidance events in fig 6 and organisms remained responsive to successive events showing the potential for the biomonitoring strategy over long periods without any need for maintenance or intervention giving unprecedented insight into the effluent nature to deduce that these avoidance activity events are possibly linked to transient unusual discharge in micropollutants in the wwtp effluent complementary tests should be further undertaken to assess avoidance signal sensitivity to changes in common physio chemical variations typical to effluents such as temperature conductivity nitrate levels and phosphates we have initiated in laboratory investigation to successfully reject the hypothesis that avoidance occurs after rapid variations in temperature or conductivity also associated to nitrate phosphate and chloride changes whilst these parameters rarely exhibit such sharp variations in wwtp effluents especially given the toxmate thermoregulation these factors are known to affect locomotor activity and have been shown to trigger avoidance lagerspetz et al 2006 nikitin et al 2019 results from the additional experiments with full details of testing conditions and behavioural monitoring records are provided in supplementary materials appendix c it was concluded from these first investigations that the minimal activity model design ensures diminished sensitivity of the avoidance signal to physico chemical variations hence these results strongly suggest that while avoidance events in fig 6 are almost certainly not triggered by the model micropollutants cu and methomyl transient avoidance events captured during monitoring periods in 2021 in saint fons wwtp can be explained by transitory increases in micropollutant discharge in the effluent this agrees with the description of a highly transient nature associated with micropollutant effluent discharge leading to temporary surges in concentration musolff et al 2009 our results substantiate the identified need for complementary real time monitoring approaches as this would provide novel insight and characterisation of toxic contamination transfer to the aquatic environment bownik et al 2021 our study supports that behaviour change monitoring in sentinel organisms could be added to available biological tools already proposed for water quality assessment via effect based surveillance these methods are of particular interest in the context of effluents as they appear as non specific to known chemicals and focus on impact evaluation regardless of complexity going beyond the handful of chemicals required in current effluent monitoring directives busch et al 2016 wernersson et al 2015 hence by helping to capture temporal dynamics in effluent contamination the development of robust real time biomonitoring such as the one proposed in this study could further help improve waste water management allowing for short term adjustments to dedicated treatment and potentially offering indications to re use suitability and tertiary treatment necessity angelakis et al 2015 4 conclusions beyond confirming gammarid sensitivity to abrupt contamination of two micropollutants our results show that it is possible to effectively channel isolated organisms locomotor activity to better characterise avoidance behaviour for ecotoxicological purposes we showed that with careful stabilisation conditions and the computation of suitable avoidance metrics based on a lower quantile of individual locomotor activities avoidance behaviour can be sufficiently controlled to ensure repeatability of baseline values and response patterns between independent experiments this can even be extended to establish dose response relationships between spike concentration and behavioural change intensity furthermore the minimal activity model adopted in this study minimises the effects on behaviour of major confounding factors related to temperature or major ion composition variation likely to be encountered in outside laboratory applications benefitting from the possibility of toxmate deployment at industrial sites the biotest was used for real time monitoring of an urban wwtp effluent over a continuous two year period results highlighted the potential of our approach for capturing the presence of micropollutant dynamics in real time with the capability of detection over extended long periods of time despite minimal human intervention the observation of the avoidance response in the laboratory for two different classes of micropollutant as well as the capture of avoidance events during the wwtp monitoring is a promising start for non targeted wwtp biomonitoring with this biotest it now calls for testing on a broader spectrum of micropollutants including emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and other relevant pollutant types to establish this biotest as a relevant screening tool for effluent contamination by micropollutant mixtures the real time monitoring and short response time of the avoidance signal offer a novel opportunity in bio surveillance to give complementary understanding of the dynamics of contamination of wwtp effluents and pave the way for diverse

darkness and constant temperature 12 13 ⁰c to replicate test conditions and remove the bias from day night cycle activity variations this method was developed to induce a state of minimal activity by the time of observation organisms are fed regularly over the acclimation to maximise the possible observation time without feeding in individual observation chambers of the toxmate 30 days 2 2 behavioural measurements in laboratory experiments organism tracking is carried out in the toxmate monitoring device using inbuilt viewpoint videotracking software toxmate designed for aquatic organism video tracking is used here for the individual measurement of invertebrate avoidance during exposure to micropollutants the apparatus is made up of a compact cubic chamber unit with three observation panels composed of four columns of four individual chambers allowing for monitoring in continuous water flow conditions fig 1 observation panels are connected to a water tank by hydraulic pumps forming a closed 15 l water circuit for experiments the flowrate is 1 4 l min in each of the three panels meaning organisms are exposed to a flow rate of 0 35 l min in the four column arrangement tested to be quasi laminar across the panel in the scope of this study g fossarum was used to measure behavioural response avoidance to chemical exposure spiking each panel contains 16 isolated gammarids that are tracked individually by the software fig 1 removing any immobile organisms 5 across experiments infrared panels and cameras are used to enable total darkness output data files were calibrated to give the total displacement of each organism for 20 s time steps to limit biological variability homogenously sized males 10 mm are taken from pairs of gammarids in amplexus after the second week of acclimation the selected males are then left for a third week this process controls biotic factors and ensures moult in the week prior to exposition geffard et al 2010 2 3 experimental deployment on wwtp site the toxmate has been adapted for industrial use for wwtp effluent on line monitoring the interior of the compact chamber unit remains unchanged there is an added cooling chamber for thermoregulation as well as a filter system placed in a water control unit upstream of the toxmate fig 1b organism conditioning and acclimation periods remain unchanged from laboratory experiments and new organisms are put in once a month designated water inlets and outlets are added to the system to allow for a continuous bypass of the effluent on site monitoring and copper spiking tests for this study were carried out in 2021 and 2022 in the effluent of the saint fons wwtp in partnership with saur r d in the lyon agglomeration this wwtp serves an equivalent population of 1 million habitants and receives a daily average influx of 200 000 m 3 day with a 9 industrial affluent proportion in chemical oxygen demand 2 4 chemical preparation and spiking protocol both chemicals cu and methomyl were prepared in a highly demineralised water solution a range of spike concentrations were tested for both substances ranging from 30 to 300 µgl 1 all concentrations remained sublethal lc50 as estimated via preliminary 48 h acute mortality testing as well as previous laboratory research xuereb et al 2009 in order to avoid an initial artificially high spike in concentration which can be disproportionately detrimental to organism health berghahn et al 2012 mcdonald et al 2020 a pre dilution is carried out with 300 ml of water from the circuit to ensure near instantaneous mixing the solution is systematically introduced after 96 h of toxmate exposure following results from the development of the minimal activity model see section 3 1 to evaluate the effects of exposure concentration samples were taken and analysed at five even log intervals for both chemicals t 1 min 5 min 20 min 1 h 5 h and 20 h to ensure minimal degradation quick onset of stress shown to occur in less than one minute and minimal overshoot in initial exposure supplementary materials appendix a 2 5 statistical analyses python and r were used for all data treatment and signal processing of the results minimal activity was defined by a 12 h period whereby the median locomotor activity remained stationary according to an augmented dickey fuller test from the movement distribution x i of n 16 gammarids at a given time t corresponding to travelled distance for each individual during 20 s the avoidance response a x i is calculated as the square of quantile q p as indicated in eq 1 for a quantile probability p 0 05 1 a x i q 0 05 2 x i 1 2 n q p x i 1 γ x j 1 γ x j j pn 1 γ pn pn for dose response curves evaluation of total avoidance response during a spiking experiment was calculated by taking the integral over time of the avoidance measures up to 10 h post spike were systematically considered after ensuring minimal chemical decomposition in the exposure system supplementary materials appendix a 3 results and discussion 3 1 minimal activity model control repetitions for g fossarum videotracking showed high initial locomotor activity which subsequently decreased significantly before reaching a stable minimal activity state fig 2 the time required to obtain minimal activity was estimated via both dickey fuller stationarity tests and an intersection estimate between regression fits for the initial activity 0 48 h and the final activity last 24 h both methods showed that a stable baseline activity was consistently reached in around 72 h across repetitions supplementary materials appendix b given the average time taken to reach minimal activity chemicals were introduced during testing at least 96 h after the placement of gammarids in the toxmate observation chambers day night activity cycles along with higher activity variance were notable during the first 48 h of observation however both phenomena dissipated by the time minimal activity was reached fig 2 implying that the stabilisation procedure is effective in creating a reproducible environment providing chemical exposure occurs during minimal activity this result shows that g fossarum minimal activity can be obtained via controlled acclimation conditions which was then also observed in on site wwtp effluent conditions in section 3 3 similar research on behavioural changes in macroinvertebrates by nørum et al 2010 successfully demonstrated rapid surges in behavioural activity in response to comparable chemical exposure but observed that pre exposure mean activity presented high variability even between control and test groups the minimal activity model proposed here is successful in overcoming this obstacle achieving the stable baseline across testing necessary for robustness and comparison of assays it does however impose the use of hyperactivity avoidance as a stress indicator as minimal movement means inhibition cannot be observed 3 2 micropollutant sensitivity initially avoidance behaviour was assessed for cu spikes showing immediate increase in activity as well as a significant decrease in activity variance upon chemical exposure fig 3 the immediate changes in response to the presence of the cu solution at 100 µgl 1 indicate global activity increase and stress avoidance gauthier et al 2016 the measure of a lower quantile q 0 05 from the activity distribution was used to channel avoidance eq 1 as it remained quasi zero in control conditions and only spiked upon chemical exposure giving a sustained response fig 3 avoidance is thus defined in the minimal activity model as uniformly high locomotor activity an extreme event shown not to occur in control conditions which are characterised by the stable null baseline even the short upsurge in avoidance after 18 h was associated with a sustained avoidance reaction as despite a small spike in the high end of the control distribution the avoidance signal remains undisturbed and the onset is decorrelated by over an hour furthermore median activity in the cu sample is unchanged at the time of the avoidance spike the decreased overall activity obtained thanks to the 96 h acclimation period before spiking does not seem to compensate on organism sensitivity to micropollutant spikes as there is a quick clear avoidance response the advantage of using an avoidance metrics based on a lower quantile of individual locomotor activity distribution here q0 05 to increase test repeatability and channel sensitivity to micropollutants is clear when compared to the median activity curve for a cu spike fig 3 where the median values quickly returned to control levels and total variance gives no repeatability in control conditions such short response time on the hourly scale is novel in non lethal bioassay testing and could provide valuable real time information for micropollutant detection and alerting validating avoidance signal sensitivity to copper and methomyl results from four independent experimental repetitions showed repeatability in the onset of avoidance patterns for both model compounds 100 µgl 1 and 125 µgl 1 for cu and methomyl respectively fig 4 a despite differences in amplitude and total avoidance time all repetitions showed avoidance for both chemicals the avoidance triggered by cu was characterised by an instantaneous reaction and high initial gradient followed by a gradual decline in avoidance perhaps linked to the experimental setup whereby organisms cannot escape the contaminated area contrary to the cu response the methomyl avoidance reactions are more gradual with the onset of avoidance only peaking beyond around 3 h of exposure in general there was strong resemblance between reactions for each chemical in onset time and initial response gradient we confirmed via timely chemical analysis that the time required to reach the desired exposure concentration of organisms in the toxmate system occurs within the first minute post spiking for both chemicals supplementary materials appendix a previous studies have shown that for fish immediate response can be explained by olfaction in the case of both metals and insecticides könemann et al 2021 tierney et al 2010 implying that this may be the case for cu whilst it can be assumed that the more gradual onset methomyl reaction implies no immediate olfactive response in the case of gammarids the avoidance pathway is likely something different such as a reaction to the ache inhibition known to occur at such concentrations for g fossarum possibly not appearing toxic before the eventual metabolization of the chemical xuereb et al 2009 in both cases the biotest offers real time information on the presence of the micropollutants in the system for a response time ranging from the minute to a few hours providing novel reaction time amongst comparable bio assays the overall difference in response between the two chemicals is particularly interesting as it suggests that the qualitative differences in the behaviour are caused by the nature of the contamination and the test may even have potential for chemical class identification based on further testing using the defined protocol for screening a large spectrum of chemical compounds ongoing research into behavioural profiling aims to uncover such links between chemical classes and their triggered response following an approach similar to that previously conducted in biomedical research rihel et al 2010 when a range of sublethal concentrations were tested there was a positively correlated dose response curve for both cu and methomyl fig 4b using the integral of the avoidance signal over a 6 h period which ensures a period of stable exposure concentration as supported by sampling analysis in supplementary materials table a 1 there is a significant difference in between avoidance at all tested concentrations when compared to control tests the higher total avoidance measured for cu samples fig 4b are a consequence of the sharp initial gradient and quick onset followed by sustained avoidance despite some variance which can be explained by natural variation in residual movement activity the correlation demonstrates the biotest potential for quantifying organism exposure to micropollutants even at low concentrations 30 50 µgl 1 relevant to wwtps ineris 2021 it also opens the possibility of further study for use within chemical risk assessment procedures with a sensitive and rapid non lethal screening of biological impacts alcívar et al 2021 whilst there is a maintained positive correlation for cu there is a plateau in sensitivity for methomyl beyond 67 µgl 1 because this plateau is an order of magnitude below the maximum recorded avoidance signal for copper this saturation phenomenon supports the hypothesis that for the neurotoxic insecticide methomyl beyond a certain concentration the nerve transmission function is saturated and movement is impeded by ache inhibition xuereb et al 2009 one could alternatively hypothesise that this is due to toxicokinetics toxicodynamics saturation reinforcing the hypothesis that in order to have an impact on avoidance there must be uptake and or metabolisation of the compound by g fossarum thus explaining the latency and saturation 3 3 potential for real time micropollutant detection in wwtp effluents the last part of the study questioned the possible transposition of the laboratory results to real field conditions hence fig 5 shows the g fossarum reaction to copper spiking at 100 µgl 1 in two additional contrasting water types carried out during one laboratory experiment and one on site wwtp deployment of the toxmate apparatus we tested avoidance response to copper spiking in water sampled from the natural habitat of test organisms and in the wastewater effluent at the saint fons wwtp the industrial toxmate unit installed at the saint fons wwtp allowed for the analysis and characterisation of the effluent over two years of data collection with the copper spike shown zoomed on a several week extract of the monitoring period fig 5b and c testing in these two varied water matrices and under laboratory versus on site deployment conditions showed reproducibility in pre exposure minimal activity as well as the onset of avoidance induced by copper spiking fig 5 furthermore both reactions are similar in response duration and latency when compared with those observed for copper repetitions from the first tests performed in laboratory controlled water fig 3 when considering varied water matrices despite higher mean activity in the wastewater the baseline remains negligible for sustained periods and the cu spike was equally prominent showing the biotest to be robust and suitable for monitoring in a complex flow such as that of a wwtp effluent furthermore the avoidance signal observed returns to the null baseline sometime after cu exposure implying a second episode could potentially be captured in case of repeated events of contamination a second data extract from the surveillance study carried out in the saint fons wwtp corresponding to a summer period in 2021 is presented in fig 6 as no controlled spikes were carried out during this period the data reveals naturally occurring transitory avoidance events induced solely by the on line exposure to the wwtp effluent delineated within fig 6 in addition similarly to the copper spiking effluent experiment fig 5b the activity signal consistently returned to a minimal baseline after the transient avoidance events in fig 6 and organisms remained responsive to successive events showing the potential for the biomonitoring strategy over long periods without any need for maintenance or intervention giving unprecedented insight into the effluent nature to deduce that these avoidance activity events are possibly linked to transient unusual discharge in micropollutants in the wwtp effluent complementary tests should be further undertaken to assess avoidance signal sensitivity to changes in common physio chemical variations typical to effluents such as temperature conductivity nitrate levels and phosphates we have initiated in laboratory investigation to successfully reject the hypothesis that avoidance occurs after rapid variations in temperature or conductivity also associated to nitrate phosphate and chloride changes whilst these parameters rarely exhibit such sharp variations in wwtp effluents especially given the toxmate thermoregulation these factors are known to affect locomotor activity and have been shown to trigger avoidance lagerspetz et al 2006 nikitin et al 2019 results from the additional experiments with full details of testing conditions and behavioural monitoring records are provided in supplementary materials appendix c it was concluded from these first investigations that the minimal activity model design ensures diminished sensitivity of the avoidance signal to physico chemical variations hence these results strongly suggest that while avoidance events in fig 6 are almost certainly not triggered by the model micropollutants cu and methomyl transient avoidance events captured during monitoring periods in 2021 in saint fons wwtp can be explained by transitory increases in micropollutant discharge in the effluent this agrees with the description of a highly transient nature associated with micropollutant effluent discharge leading to temporary surges in concentration musolff et al 2009 our results substantiate the identified need for complementary real time monitoring approaches as this would provide novel insight and characterisation of toxic contamination transfer to the aquatic environment bownik et al 2021 our study supports that behaviour change monitoring in sentinel organisms could be added to available biological tools already proposed for water quality assessment via effect based surveillance these methods are of particular interest in the context of effluents as they appear as non specific to known chemicals and focus on impact evaluation regardless of complexity going beyond the handful of chemicals required in current effluent monitoring directives busch et al 2016 wernersson et al 2015 hence by helping to capture temporal dynamics in effluent contamination the development of robust real time biomonitoring such as the one proposed in this study could further help improve waste water management allowing for short term adjustments to dedicated treatment and potentially offering indications to re use suitability and tertiary treatment necessity angelakis et al 2015 4 conclusions beyond confirming gammarid sensitivity to abrupt contamination of two micropollutants our results show that it is possible to effectively channel isolated organisms locomotor activity to better characterise avoidance behaviour for ecotoxicological purposes we showed that with careful stabilisation conditions and the computation of suitable avoidance metrics based on a lower quantile of individual locomotor activities avoidance behaviour can be sufficiently controlled to ensure repeatability of baseline values and response patterns between independent experiments this can even be extended to establish dose response relationships between spike concentration and behavioural change intensity furthermore the minimal activity model adopted in this study minimises the effects on behaviour of major confounding factors related to temperature or major ion composition variation likely to be encountered in outside laboratory applications benefitting from the possibility of toxmate deployment at industrial sites the biotest was used for real time monitoring of an urban wwtp effluent over a continuous two year period results highlighted the potential of our approach for capturing the presence of micropollutant dynamics in real time with the capability of detection over extended long periods of time despite minimal human intervention the observation of the avoidance response in the laboratory for two different classes of micropollutant as well as the capture of avoidance events during the wwtp monitoring is a promising start for non targeted wwtp biomonitoring with this biotest it now calls for testing on a broader spectrum of micropollutants including emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and other relevant pollutant types to establish this biotest as a relevant screening tool for effluent contamination by micropollutant mixtures the real time monitoring and short response time of the avoidance signal offer a novel opportunity in bio surveillance to give complementary understanding of the dynamics of contamination of wwtp effluents and pave the way for diverse

14661,graphene sponge anode functionalized with two dimensional 2d boron i e borophene was applied for electrochemical oxidation of c4 c8 per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass borophene doped graphene sponge outperformed boron doped graphene sponge anode in terms of pfass removal efficiencies and their electrochemical degradation whereas at the boron doped graphene sponge anode up to 35 of the removed pfass was recovered after the current was switched off the switch to a 2d boron enabled further degradation of the electrosorbed pfass borophene doped graphene sponge anode achieved 32 77 removal of c4 c8 pfass in one pass flow through mode from a 10 mm phosphate buffer at 230 a m 2 of anodic current density higher molarity phosphate buffer 100 mm resulted in lower pfass removal efficiencies 11 60 due to the higher resistance of the graphene sponge electrode in the presence of phosphate ions as demonstrated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis analyses electro oxidation of pfass was more efficient in landfill leachate despite its high organic loading with up to 95 and 75 removal obtained for perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa versus 77 and 57 removal in the 10 mm phosphate buffer respectively defluorination efficiencies as determined relative to the electrooxidized fraction of pfass indicated up to 69 and 82 of defluorination of pfos and pfoa in 10 mm phosphate buffer which was decreased to 16 and 29 defluorination respectively for higher buffer molarity 100 mm due to the worsened electrochemical performance of the sponge in landfill leachate relative defluorination efficiencies of pfos and pfoa were 33 and 45 respectively indicating the inhibiting effect of complex organic and inorganic matrix of landfill leachate on the c f bond breakage this study demonstrates that electrochemical degradation of pfass is possible to achieve in complex and brackish streams using a low cost graphene sponge anode without forming toxic chlorinated byproducts even in the presence of 7 g l 1 of chloride keywords chlorine free electrochemical system electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis electrochemical water treatment graphene oxide ion intercalation landfill leachate perfluoroalkyl acids perfluoroalkyl sulfonates reduced graphene oxide coated sponge real water matrix 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are widely used organofluorine compounds that feature high bio accumulative potential toxicity persistency and stability largely due to the c f bonds that replace the typical c h bonds in organic molecules niu et al 2016 ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 zhang et al 2016 the extreme stability of the c f bond combined with the unique physicochemical properties of pfas e g high polarity surfactant properties make the remediation of pfas contaminated water extremely challenging nzeribe et al 2019 thus far these highly durable industrial products have seen widespread usage across several industries resulting in the ubiquitous presence of pfass in water air food wildlife and humans complete biodegradation of pfass using conventional wastewater treatment is not possible ross et al 2018 and many pfass are resistant towards the majority of oxidative and reductive processes used in water treatment existing waste water treatment methods including sequestration or separation are only temporary solutions towards shifting pfas from one part of a waste stream to another as such efforts remain focused on finding ways to fully defluorinate and mineralize pfas altogether this would eliminate the long term health hazards and related financial burdens electrochemical oxidation processes using electrodes with a high overpotential of oxygen evolution such as mixed metal oxide mmo anodes based on sno2 and pbo2 coatings lin et al 2012 zhuo et al 2011 2020 boron doped diamond bdd carter and farrell 2008 liao and farrell 2009 and magnéli phase electrodes ti4o7 le et al 2019 wang et al 2022 are capable of degrading pfas however in the presence of naturally occurring chloride all of the above mentioned anode materials produce free chlorine which can react rapidly with the organic matter to form persistent chlorinated organic byproducts as well as toxic chlorate and perchlorate at higher current densities required for electrochemical defluorination of pfass radjenovic and sedlak 2015 recently developed graphene sponge electrodes demonstrated very limited electrocatalytic activity for chloride oxidation with a low current efficiency of only 0 04 in the presence of 20 mm nacl at anodic current density of 173 a m 2 furthermore there was no chlorate or perchlorate formation baptista pires et al 2021 this in addition to their scalable bottom up synthesis approach and low cost i e less than 50 per m2 of projected surface area makes them extremely attractive for electrochemical water and wastewater treatment applications the cost of bdd and mmo is two orders of magnitude higher i e 4200 and 3000 m 2 respectively wenderich et al 2021 moreover boron doped graphene sponge anode was capable of defluorinating c4 c8 perfluoroalkyl sulfonates and acids in flow through mode in a low conductivity supporting electrolyte solution duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 nevertheless the degradation of pfas was still incomplete with a significant portion being only electrosorbed but not defluorinated in this study we investigated the performance of borophene functionalized graphene sponge anode for electro oxidation of c4 c8 pfas i e perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa perfluorohexane sulfonate pfhxs perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs and perfluorobutanoic acid pfba our previous study showed that functionalization of the graphene sponge anode with the two dimensional 2d borophene instead of boron yielded an order of magnitude higher concentration of oh cuervo lumbaque et al 2022 however it is important to note that the degradation mechanism of pfas differs significantly from that of aromatic contaminants evaluated in the previous study as the reaction is limited by the initial direct electron transfer det step radjenovic et al 2020 electrolytic degradation of pfas is initiated by the electron transfer step to the anode to form a radical i e cnf2n 1 which then reacts further with the electrochemically generated hydroxyl radicals oh o2 and h2o and undergoes a cf2 unzipping reaction le et al 2019 niu et al 2013 thus enhanced electro generation of oh at the borophene functionalized graphene sponge anode should result in a more complete defluorination of pfas the experiments were performed in one pass flow through mode using synthetic electrolyte solutions of both low and high conductivity and the performance of the borophene doped graphene sponge anode was compared to the previously investigated boron doped graphene sponge anode to gain more insight into the impact of the supporting electrolyte on the electrolyte electrode interfacial reaction and electrochemical behaviour of the material borophene functionalized graphene sponge anode was characterized in detail using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and cyclic voltammetry cv finally we investigated the removal and defluorination of pfas in landfill leachate to demonstrate the potential of electrochemical oxidation using graphene sponge electrode for treating complex and brackish pfas laden streams notably the present study demonstrates for the first time the key role of supporting electrolyte on the resulting electrochemical resistance and activity of graphene sponge electrodes and it is the first instance of examining the performance of graphene sponge anode in a challenging environment of brackish landfill leachate 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in the experiments were reagent grade or

reactor operated at a flow rate of 5 ml min 1 resulting in a hydraulic residence time hrt of 3 5 min using a digital gear pump cole palmer graphene sponge anode with a projected surface area of 17 34 cm2 was connected to a stainless steel current collector and coupled with a stainless steel sponge cathode electrochemical removal of six model pfass i e pfos pfoa pfhxs pfhxa pfbs and pfba was evaluated in synthetic electrolyte solutions 10 and 100 mm phosphate buffer pb ph 7 2 electrical conductivity 1 and 8 ms cm 1 respectively and a highly complex and brackish real waste stream of ultrafiltrated uf landfill leachate ph 5 6 7 3 g l 1 cl 30 ms cm 1 table s1 obtained from a near by landfill in girona spain the target pfass were added at 0 2 µm initial concentration each and samples were taken after 10 20 and 30 bed volumes for each condition in polypropylene vials to prevent trace contamination with pfass the use of glassware could lead to adsorption of pfass on the glass surfaces and was therefore avoided to evaluate the possible losses of target pfass through adsorption onto the graphene sponge or other system components the reactor was first operated in initial open circuit ocinitial electrochemical degradation experiments were conducted in chronopotentiometric mode using a biologic multi channel potentiostat galvanostat vmp 300 and a leak free ag agcl reference electrode harvard apparatus placed between the anode and the cathode adjusting the applied current density i e 115 460 a m 2 in the electrolytes of varying electrical conductivity to reach the same ohmic drop corrected anode potentials of 6 v versus standard hydrogen electrode she table s2 the ohmic drop was calculated from the ohmic internal resistance obtained in the eis and the experimental data was fitted using the biologic ec lab software at the end of each chronopotentiometric run the current was switched off for the final oc run i e ocfinal and the effluent was sampled to evaluate the loss of the target pfass by electrosorption only i e without subsequent degradation all electrode potentials were expressed versus she she v when working with landfill leachate stainless steel current feeder was replaced following each experiment to avoid the effect of its corrosion on the reactor performance due to high chloride content of the landfill leachate 2 4 determination of defluorination of pfas and partially defluorinated compounds our previous study showed that electrochemical c f bond breakage at boron doped graphene sponge anode leads to the incorporation of fluoride into the graphene coating due to the high reactivity of the liberated hf duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 the amount of the incorporated fluoride can be quantitatively determined using combustion ion chromatography cic analysis i e by combusting the used graphene sponge and measuring the amount of the released fluoride to evaluate the defluorination efficiency at the bph rgo anode separate experiments were performed with single contaminants namely pfoa and pfos as model pfass which were added at higher initial concentration of 2 µm to allow the detection of fluoride released by the c f bond cleavage defluorination of pfos and pfoa was evaluated in synthetic electrolyte solutions 10 and 100 mm pb ph 7 2 1 and 8 ms cm 1 respectively and uf filtered landfill leachate the applied current densities were adjusted to the conductivities of the treated water stream to obtain a similar ohmic drop corrected anode potentials for each matrix after conducting the experiment with pfoa or pfos and a newly synthesized graphene sponge anode the employed anode was thoroughly washed with 100 mm ammonium acetate methanol and milliq water and the amount of fluoride incorporated into graphene was determined by combusting the used graphene sponge in cic analysis duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 the fluoride in the mass of a blank mineral wool template employed in the graphene based sponge synthesis was also determined by the same cic method and subtracted from the fluoride amount detected after combusting the graphene sponge used for electrochemical degradation of a specific pfas to account for the fluoride originating from the electrochemical defluorination of unknown organofluorine compounds already present in the sampled landfill leachate we analysed a new graphene sponge employed for electrooxidation of landfill leachate without the addition of pfoa pfos and the measured amount of fluoride incorporated into the graphene sponge was subtracted from the one obtained with landfill leachate amended with pfoa pfos 2 5 analytical methods target pfass were analysed with a 5500 qtrap hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer with a turbo ion spray source applied biosystems coupled to a waters acquity ultra performancetm liquid chromatograph milford to account for the matrix effects in leachate

in our previous study duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 to evaluate the presence of organofluoride compounds in the treated water measured as adsorbable organic fluorine aof as well as to determine the amount of fluoride incorporated in the graphene sponge anode we used a cic unit comprised of an aqf 2100h automatic quick furnace mitsubishi chemical analytech and an ic ics 2100 dionex the analytical method for aof analysis was adapted from wagner et al 2013 and is described in detail our previous study duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 chlorine ozone chlorine dioxide cuvette tests lck 310 were used

borophene doped graphene sponge anodes fig 1 illustrates the normalized effluent concentrations of the target pfass in 10 mm pb using b rgo and bph rgo anode for both tested graphene sponge electrodes the effluent concentrations were equal to their influent concentrations during the ocinitial for the six model pfass demonstrating that there was no absorption of pfass on the graphene sponges or any other parts of the reactor pfas anions were also not expected to adsorb through electrostatic interactions onto the uncharged graphene sponge anode given the determined negative ζ potentials of b rgo 36 2 mv norra et al 2022 and bph rgo 33 9 mv cuervo lumbaque et al 2022 application of 230 a m 2 resulted in the ohmic drop corrected anode potential of 6 v she and an average removal efficiency in the range of 26 69 for perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas and 17 41 for perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas at a b rgo anode this is in accordance with our previous study i e 27 67 removal of pfsas and 17 44 removal of pfcas duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 when changing from b to bph rgo anode the average removal efficiencies were increased for all six pfass with 32 77 removal for pfsas and 20 57 removal for pfcas at 230 a m 2 this improvement was more prominent for pfcas e g pfoa removal efficiency was increased from 41 to 57 also from 24 to 30 for pfhxa and from 17 to 20 for pfba in the case of pfsas bph rgo anode enhanced the removal of pfos from 69 to 77 from 33 to 37 for pfhxs and from 26 to 32 for pfbs similar to our previous study duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 pfas removal efficiencies at both b and bph rgo anode decreased with the chain shortening likely due to decreasing molecular polarizabilities αp in the order of pfos 170 c m2 v 1 pfhxs 138 c m2 v 1 pfbs 107 c m2 v 1 and pfoa 140 c m2 v 1 pfhxa 109 c m2 v 1 pfba 77 5 c m2 v 1 the main difference between the b rgo and bph rgo anode can be observed in the measured effluent concentrations of pfass in the ocfinal at the b rgo anode the effluent concentrations rose above their initial pfass concentrations in the ocfinal implying that a fraction of the removed pfass was merely electrosorbed onto the graphene sponge anode during the application of current and released back into the solution when the current was switched off duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 the of the electrosorbed pfass was determined based on the pfass concentrations measured in the fractions collected in the ocfinal and their removal efficiencies fig s2 a text s4 overall 9 33 of pfas was only electrosorbed at the b rgo anode without being degraded whereas 27 58 of the removed pfass was further electrochemically degraded fig s2 a table s3 in the case of bph rgo anode there was no increase in the effluent concentrations of pfass in the ocfinal after the current was switched off this implied that the removed pfass were further electrochemically degraded as there was no fraction that could be assigned to electrosorption only and 100 of the removed pfas was further electrochemically degraded as explained previously functionalization of the graphene sponge with borophene increases the electrocatalytic activity of the anode and enhances the generation of oh cuervo lumbaque et al 2022 electrochemically generated oh radicals react with pfas radicals cnf2n 1 formed by the initial direct electron transfer step from pfas to the anode and assist in the defluorination and removal of the carboxyl and sulfonate group thus contributing to an improved degradation of the electrosorbed pfas hori et al 2008 niu et al 2012 plumlee et al 2009 also the addition of an electron deficient borophene li et al 2018 lowers the resistance at the electrode electrolyte interface through the creation of defects and oxygen vacancies in the rgo structure hu et al 2013 3 2 impact of the supporting electrolyte conductivity and type on the electrooxidation of pfass the electrical conductivity of the supporting electrolyte will impact the double layer thickness and ion transport towards the electrode surface and thus the electrocatalytic activity of the anode radjenovic et al 2020 also electrolysis conducted in low conductivity solutions may be negatively affected by the poor wetting of the electrode surface to investigate the impact of the supporting electrolyte conductivity on the electro oxidation of pfas experiments were performed with a bph rgo anode using 10 and 100 mm pb with electrical conductivities of 1 and 8 ms cm 1 respectively applied current densities were adjusted to obtain similar ohmic drop corrected anode potentials i e 115 and 230 a m 2 for 10 mm pb and 288 and 460 a m 2 for 100 mm pb resulted in ohmic drop corrected anode potentials of 4 and 6 v she respectively table s2 increase in phosphate buffer concentration from 10 to 100 mm pb led to a decrease in the removal efficiencies with 30 pfos 8 pfoa 11 pfhxs 8 pfhxa 6 pfbs and 5 pfba removal at the anode potential of 4 v she fig 2 the detrimental impact of higher phosphate buffer concentration on pfas removal was also observed at higher applied current densities i e ohmic drop corrected anode potentials of 6 v she as pfas removal efficiencies decreased from 30 77 in 10 mm pb to 11 60 in 100 mm pb fig 2 thus despite the higher conductivity of the employed supporting electrolyte solution electrochemical removal of pfas was worsened in 100 mm pb we further investigated the electrochemical performance of the bph rgo anode in the phosphate solution and compared it to chloride and nitrate based supporting electrolyte using eis and cv figs 3 and s2 the nyquist plots were fitted with a modified randles circuit and the results of the z fit are summarized in table s4 ohmic resistance rs i e bulk electrolyte resistance can be derived from the intercepts of the x axis in the nyquist plots in fig 3a in 100 mm pb the rs 1 32 ω was significantly lower than in the 10 mm pb 3 35 ω in line with its higher electrical conductivity the region of high to mid frequency of the nyquist plots marked by the diameter of the semicircle is a measure of the charge transfer and double layer resistance at the electrolyte electrode surface rct the rct values obtained by the z fit were 6 53 and 6 41 ω for 10 and 100 mm pb respectively table s4 a rather minor difference considering the differences in their electrical conductivities especially compared to nano3 and nacl electrolyte as explained further in the text the warburg impedance mid to low frequency of the nyquist plots is a complex element which expresses the difficulty of mass transport of the ion species to and into the electrode lazanas and prodromidis 2023 in a simple example where a solid electrode is submerged into the electrolyte charges experience a single boundary being the electrode electrolyte interface and we can consider a semi infinite linear diffusion from the bulk electrolyte towards the electrode surface the warburg impedance is visualized in this case as a 45 line at the start of the low frequency range of the nyquist plot the line at 45 describes the time dependant diffusion of the ion species over the diffusion layer that starts at the electrode electrolyte interface and extends to an indefinite length only restricted by the size of the bulk solution with a gradually decreasing concentration gradient however in the case of electrodes with apertures where ion species can enter the cavities of the electrode structure the impedimetric response must be described by two boundaries and thus finite diffusion model instead of the semi infinite single boundary linear diffusion lazanas and prodromidis 2023 from within the cavities of the material the ion species will not reach the bulk of the electrolyte through linear diffusion as it is restricted by cavity walls on two sides thus the two boundaries in this case represent the two opposing limitations walls of the apertures of the rgo structure the so called finite diffusion can be subdivided into two distinct conditions 1 a transmissive boundary where the rgo layer itself would be permeable does not apply here and 2 reflective boundary where the finite diffusion region is impermeable to the diffusing species ions accumulating in the apertures of the electrode structure give rise to the formation of double layers and the resulting double layer capacitance at low frequencies the diffusion of charges within the cavities of the rgo structure give rise to a warburg impedance which gets dominated by capacitive behaviour resulting in a line that bends upwards in 100 mm pb due to the higher amount of large hydrated phosphate ions having limited access to and obstructing the apertures of the nanostructured rgo coating the system can be considered as an electrode without apertures the nyquist plots thus visualizes the warburg impedance with a 45 angle in 10 mm pb some phosphate ions can enter the structure due to less obstruction thus the electrode behaviour approaches the reflective boundary finite diffusion model identified by the upwards bend in the low frequency region fig 3a the warburg impedance in 10 mm pb 120 3 ohm s 1 2 was smaller than that in 100 mm pb 138 4 ohm s 1 2 indicating the diminished ion diffusion upon increased phosphate concentration table s4 nyquist plots of the bph rgo anode obtained in 10 mm nacl nano3 and pb solutions exhibit comparable behaviour fig 3b all three supporting electrolytes illustrate the same rs i e 6 17 6 84 ω as expected based on the same electrical conductivities 1 ms cm 1 however the obtained values of rct were decreasing in the order pb 6 53 ω nano3 3 34 ω nacl 2 45 ω table s4 furthermore the warburg line shows dependency on the electrolyte type the warburg coefficient which is related to the warburg element w1 is the diffusion resistance coefficient of ions in solution and it increased in the order cl 61 97 ohm s 2 no3 69 45 ohm s 1 2 po4 3 120 3 ohm s 1 2 implying a much faster diffusion of cl ions within the graphene sponge anode compared to phosphate ions cui et al 2015 table s4 this can be explained by the differences in the hydration energies of phosphate nitrate and chloride ions which beside the ion size determine the interactions of the anions with the graphene sponge anode ions can be classified as chaotropes bind water molecules weekly or kosmotropes bind water molecules strongly depending on their jones dole viscosity b coefficients hpo4 2 no3 and cl have a descending jones dole viscosity b coefficients of 0 382 0 046 and 0 007 respectively zhan et al 2019 thus phosphate ions hpo4 2 and h2po4 at ph 7 act as kosmotropes and are more strongly hydrated compared with the no3 and cl ions having 1 9 h2po4 and 4 hpo4 2 tightly bound water molecules versus zero tightly bound water molecules for no3 and cl collins 2006 in addition larger ions such as phosphate have limited access to the small pores of the rgo coating compared to e g chloride a phenomenon well established in the field of graphene based supercapacitors lin 2018 higher hydration energy and larger size of phosphate ions lead to their slower diffusion within the graphene sponge electrode and a higher rct due to the worsened interfacial reaction of the electrolyte and the electrode on the other hand smaller and more easily dehydrated no3 and cl anions are inserted more readily between the rgo layers of the graphene sponge anode coating thus promoting their access to the inner parts of the material the impact of ion solvation and size on their accessibility to the electrode surface and diffusion is known to be tightly related to electrochemical performance of graphene and carbon based supercapacitor electrodes feng and cummings 2011 pohlmann et al 2013 due to this improved interaction of cl and no3 ions with the graphene sponge anode increase in the molarities of nacl and nano3 supporting electrolytes had a far more prominent impact on the resistances determined by eis compared with the phosphate based electrolyte fig 3c although the highly concentrated supporting electrolytes had the same electrical conductivity 8 ms cm 1 82 mm nacl and 90 mm nano3 exhibited much lower ohmic resistances i e rs 0 82 and 0 76 ω respectively compared with the 100 mm pb 1 32 ω also while higher phosphate concentration led to a somewhat worsened ion diffusion within the graphene sponge anode higher warburg impedance ion mobility was favoured for higher concentrations of nacl and nano3 substantial difference can be observed at medium frequencies where the rct of the bph rgo anode was 0 19 ω for both 82 mm nacl and 90 mm nano3 an order of magnitude lower compared to rct in 100 mm pb 6 41 ω this suggests that in highly concentrated nacl or nano3 electrolyte graphene sponge electrode possesses high electrical conductivity and undergoes a rapid charge transfer reaction with fast cl or no3 ion diffusion within the material this behaviour is unique of the permeable anodes or anodes with apertures lasia 2009 as e g solid mixed metal oxide mmo electrodes do not exhibit the same behaviour and different resistances determined by eis are directly related to the supporting electrolyte concentration only and not its type figure s4 different electrochemical behaviour of the graphene sponge anode in the presence of different anions is also apparent from the cvs recorded in 10 mm nacl nano3 and pb supporting electrolytes figure s3 the effect of enhanced mobility of cl and no3 anions inside the graphene sponge anode is observed in cvs as an increased current passing through the system usually seen in the first cycle weingarth et al 2014 the cv curve for the bph rgo anode in 10 mm nacl shows an activation belt between 1 and 2 v she during the first cycle dashed line for 10 mm nacl and nano3 electrolytes in the case of 10 mm pb strong hydration of phosphate prevents the large h2po4 hpo4 2 ions to enter between the rgo nanosheets and activate the material and thus no activation peak is observed the interfacial reaction between the electrode and electrolyte is closely related to electrochemical properties as is well known from the battery field suo et al 2015 as a consequence of higher resistances as shown by the eis analyses graphene sponge anode polarized at 115 a m 2 in 10 mm pb results in the measured anode potential of 4 7 v she significantly higher compared to 3 3 3 v she measured in 10 mm nano3 and nacl solutions figure s5 it should be noted that it was not possible to perform longer chronopotentiometric experiments in synthetic supporting electrolyte solutions other than phosphate based as highly concentrated and pure synthetic solutions of nacl and nano3 cause a rapid pitting corrosion of the stainless steel current feeder employed to connect the graphene sponge anode yohai et al 2013 figure s6 3 3 electrooxidation of pfass in landfill leachate bph rgo anode was further employed for electrochemical degradation of pfass in a uf filtrated landfill leachate 30 ms cm 1 fig 4 anodic current density of 575 a m 2 was applied to reach the ohmic drop corrected anode potential of 6 v she and allow comparison with the experiments conducted in 10 and 100 mm pb despite the high complexity of landfill leachate in terms of both organic and inorganic content table s1 significantly higher removal efficiencies were obtained for all six pfass except for pfba compared to 10 and 100 mm pb for example the removal of pfos and pfoa was 77 and 57 in 10 mm pb and 95 and 75 in landfill leachate respectively this can be explained by the higher electrochemical activity of the graphene sponge in landfill leachate as demonstrated by the lower electrode resistances both rs and rct recorded in the eis analyses fig 3c the rs and rct values obtained for landfill leachate were 0 18 and 0 25 ω whereas in the case of phosphate buffer they were significantly higher i e 3 45 and 6 53 ω for 10 mm pb and 1 32 and 4 66 ω for 100 mm pb respectively landfill leachate contained 7 3 g l 1 206 mm cl and 1 3 g l 1 21 mm no3 with very low concentration of phosphate present 13 mg l 1 although the landfill leachate contained an extremely high concentration of chloride only 3 78 mg l 1 of free chlorine was measured at 575 a m 2 resulting in the current efficiency for chlorine generation of only 0 18 we did not detect any chlorate and perchlorate in the treated effluent furthermore stainless steel current feeder enabled stable anode potentials during 1 5 h experimental runs in landfill leachate despite the high chloride concentration fig s7 this may be a consequence of a protective effect of the presence of organic cations and other inorganics which prevented a rapid corrosion of the stainless steel current collector observed in pure nacl and nano3 solutions fig s6 this limitation of the stainless steel current feeder for the longer term usage of graphene sponge anode can be resolved by using current feeders coated with protective conductive polymers lu and elsenbaumer 1999 tan and blackwood 2003 or by a layer of iro2 kasian et al 2016 weber et al 2021 3 4 defluorination of pfos and pfoa in synthetic electrolyte and landfill leachate experiments focused on the determination of the defluorination efficiencies at the bph rgo anode were conducted with pfos and pfoa at higher initial concentration 2 µm to enable the detection of the fluoride incorporated into the graphene sponge via cic analyses and in 10 mm pb 100 mm pb and landfill leachate after combusting the sponges employed in each experiment the fluoride concentrations obtained in the cic analyses were used to calculate the fluoride recoveries for both pfos and pfoa the relative fluoride recoveries were calculated as the ratio of the amount of fluoride measured in cic and the theoretical amount of fluoride released from pfos pfoa i e assuming complete defluorination of the electrooxidized fraction text s6 relative f recoveries obtained for the bph rgo anode in 10 mm pb were 69 for pfos and 82 for pfoa values comparable to the previously reported recoveries obtained for the b rgo anode in the same supporting electrolyte i e 75 pfos and 74 pfoa duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 unlike the experiments conducted at lower initial concentration of pfass 0 2 µm where bph rgo anode enhanced the degradation of pfas with no increase in their effluent concentration in the ocfinal higher initial pfass concentrations 2 µm resulted in 34 electrosorption of both pfoa and pfos without further degradation fig s8 this may be a consequence of an insufficient number of active sites at the bph rgo anode for higher pfass concentrations nonetheless the defluorination relative to the removed fraction was 42 pfos and 55 pfoa higher compared with the previously reported defluorination at the b rgo anode 36 for pfos and 49 for pfoa fig 6 the removal efficiencies of both pfos and pfoa were also marginally lower at higher initial concentration 2 µm compared to 0 2 µm which also suggests that their electrochemical degradation became limited by the availability of the active sites at the anode surface when the molarity of pb electrolyte was increased to 100 mm the defluorination were decreased to 7 pfos and 4 pfoa fig 5 in line also with the observed decrease in the pfos and pfoa removal efficiencies in addition to the previously explained higher resistances of the graphene sponge anode in the presence of phosphate higher concentration of phosphate ions enhances the scavenging of the electrogenerated oh and occupies the active sites at the anode surface mirabediny et al 2023 zhuo et al 2020 in landfill leachate the obtained f recoveries relative to the electrooxidized fraction for pfos and pfoa were 33 and 45 respectively thus although experiments conducted in landfill leachate yielded higher removal efficiencies of pfos 86 and pfoa 72 than in the case of 10 and 100 mm pb their defluorination was still incomplete lower defluorination efficiencies of pfos and pfoa in landfill leachate can be ascribed to the presence of organics and inorganics that scavenge the electrogenerated oh and occupy the active centres at the anode surface it should be noted that intense foaming was observed in the experiments conducted in landfill leachate which negatively impacted the graphene sponge anode wetting and its electrochemical performance in summary the overall defluorination efficiencies i e calculated relative to the initial pfass concentration were 29 pfos and 29 pfoa in 10 mm pb 7 pfos and 4 pfoa in 100 mm pb and 25 pfos and 29 pfoa in landfill leachate fig 5 given that the electrochemical defluorination was incomplete the amount of the formed partially defluorinated by products was estimated by measuring the cumulative effluent samples during the chronopotentiometric run in 10 mm pb at 230 a m 2 and in ocf using aof text s3 the measured aof values are represented in quantity of f and compared with the amount of the aof expected based on the measured parent compound pfos and pfoa concentrations duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 during the application of current the measured effluent aof is very similar to the aof expected from the residual amount of the pfoa and pfos fig 7 this indicates that during the application of current organic fluoride in the effluent can be assigned exclusively to the parent compound i e pfoa or pfos however a substantial difference between the measured and expected aof can be observed in the ocf while for pfos the expected value of aof during the ocf was 439 3 10 1 µg f based on the pfos measured in the effluent the aof analysis detected a total of 872 1 63 3 µg f i e 2 fold increase similarly for pfoa a substantial difference between the expected cumulative organic fluorine 229 1 18 5 µg f and the total fluorine detected by aof analysis 537 8 77 2 µg f i e 2 4 fold increase in the ocf can be observed limited availability of active sites at the anode surface for higher initial pfos and pfoa concentrations 2 µm resulted in a fraction of both pfos and pfoa that was merely electrosorbed and not further degraded therefore the predicted aof in the ocf was high partly due to said electrosorption higher measured aof values than the ones expected based on the effluent concentrations of pfos pfoa imply the presence of partially defluorinated by products that remain electrosorbed during the application of current and are released after the current is switched off it should be noted though that the aof analysis is merely semi quantitative as it is conditioned by the adsorption of pfass and other organofluoride compounds on the activated carbon ac cartridge however the difference between the anticipated and measured aof in the ocf of pfos was higher than that for pfoa which suggests a greater proportion of degraded pfos persists in the form of partially defluorinated compounds compared to pfoa this is consistent with the fact that less amount of fluorine was recovered for pfos 69 compared to pfoa 82 the lower fluorine recovery of pfos also indicates that a higher fraction of pfos did not undergo complete defluorination generating partially defluorinated by products which contributed to the higher measured aof value in the ocfinal in one pass treatment with bph rgo anode at 230 a m 2 and using 10 mm pb 30 77 of pfas removal the specific energy consumption was 9 4 0 3 bph rgo kwh m 3 similar to our previous study duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 higher specific energy consumption for the experiments conducted in 100 mm pb 17 2 0 4 kwh m 3 stems from the higher charge transfer resistance of the graphene sponge electrode in 100 mm pb as well as higher current densities needed to obtain similar potentials as in 10 mm pb in the experiments conducted with landfill leachate high current densities needed to be applied to reach comparable anode potentials obtained in 10 and 100 mm pb due to the high conductivity of the solution which consequently led to higher energy consumption of 21 0 2 kwh m 3 current density can be further optimized to achieve more energy efficient treatment of landfill leachate together with the improved reactor geometry that enables better flow distribution and usage of the graphene sponge electrode surface this is the subject of our ongoing studies 4 conclusion in this study we have demonstrated an improved electrochemical removal of c4 c8 pfass when changing from atomic boron to a 2d borophene functionalized graphene sponge anode in the experiments conducted using a bph rgo anode in a low conductivity supporting electrolyte 1 ms cm 1 and using low initial pfass concentration 0 2 µm we achieved higher removal efficiencies compared with the b rgo anode with up to 77 removal of pfos and 57 removal of pfoa increase in the phosphate buffer concentration from 10 to 100 mm had a detrimental effect on the removal of pfas despite the higher electrolyte conductivity which was allocated to the inability of phosphate ions to access the penetrable structure of the electrode eis and cv characterisation of the graphene sponge anode in chloride and nitrate based supporting electrolyte solutions confirmed ion solvation and size along with their accessibility to the apertures of the electrode to be tightly related to electrochemical performance enhanced electrical conductivity and charge transfer reaction was obtained due to fast cl or no3 ion diffusion within the material we also report an enhanced removal of nearly all target pfass in a complex real wastewater matrix i e uf filtrated landfill leachate with 86 and 72 removal observed for pfos and pfoa respectively enhanced electrochemical removal was assigned to an improved interaction of major inorganic anions present in leachate with the graphene sponge electrode due to their chaotropic nature resulting in a higher conductivity and electroactivity of the graphene sponge electrode at higher pfass concentrations 2 µm defluorination ratios determined for pfos and pfoa in three different aqueous matrices 10 and 100 mm pb and landfill leachate with similar defluorination of 29 for both pfos and pfoa in 10 mm pb compared to 25 pfos and 29 pfoa in landfill leachate despite the high concentrations of organics this study

14661,graphene sponge anode functionalized with two dimensional 2d boron i e borophene was applied for electrochemical oxidation of c4 c8 per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass borophene doped graphene sponge outperformed boron doped graphene sponge anode in terms of pfass removal efficiencies and their electrochemical degradation whereas at the boron doped graphene sponge anode up to 35 of the removed pfass was recovered after the current was switched off the switch to a 2d boron enabled further degradation of the electrosorbed pfass borophene doped graphene sponge anode achieved 32 77 removal of c4 c8 pfass in one pass flow through mode from a 10 mm phosphate buffer at 230 a m 2 of anodic current density higher molarity phosphate buffer 100 mm resulted in lower pfass removal efficiencies 11 60 due to the higher resistance of the graphene sponge electrode in the presence of phosphate ions as demonstrated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis analyses electro oxidation of pfass was more efficient in landfill leachate despite its high organic loading with up to 95 and 75 removal obtained for perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa versus 77 and 57 removal in the 10 mm phosphate buffer respectively defluorination efficiencies as determined relative to the electrooxidized fraction of pfass indicated up to 69 and 82 of defluorination of pfos and pfoa in 10 mm phosphate buffer which was decreased to 16 and 29 defluorination respectively for higher buffer molarity 100 mm due to the worsened electrochemical performance of the sponge in landfill leachate relative defluorination efficiencies of pfos and pfoa were 33 and 45 respectively indicating the inhibiting effect of complex organic and inorganic matrix of landfill leachate on the c f bond breakage this study demonstrates that electrochemical degradation of pfass is possible to achieve in complex and brackish streams using a low cost graphene sponge anode without forming toxic chlorinated byproducts even in the presence of 7 g l 1 of chloride keywords chlorine free electrochemical system electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis electrochemical water treatment graphene oxide ion intercalation landfill leachate perfluoroalkyl acids perfluoroalkyl sulfonates reduced graphene oxide coated sponge real water matrix 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are widely used organofluorine compounds that feature high bio accumulative potential toxicity persistency and stability largely due to the c f bonds that replace the typical c h bonds in organic molecules niu et al 2016 ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 zhang et al 2016 the extreme stability of the c f bond combined with the unique physicochemical properties of pfas e g high polarity surfactant properties make the remediation of pfas contaminated water extremely challenging nzeribe et al 2019 thus far these highly durable industrial products have seen widespread usage across several industries resulting in the ubiquitous presence of pfass in water air food wildlife and humans complete biodegradation of pfass using conventional wastewater treatment is not possible ross et al 2018 and many pfass are resistant towards the majority of oxidative and reductive processes used in water treatment existing waste water treatment methods including sequestration or separation are only temporary solutions towards shifting pfas from one part of a waste stream to another as such efforts remain focused on finding ways to fully defluorinate and mineralize pfas altogether this would eliminate the long term health hazards and related financial burdens electrochemical oxidation processes using electrodes with a high overpotential of oxygen evolution such as mixed metal oxide mmo anodes based on sno2 and pbo2 coatings lin et al 2012 zhuo et al 2011 2020 boron doped diamond bdd carter and farrell 2008 liao and farrell 2009 and magnéli phase electrodes ti4o7 le et al 2019 wang et al 2022 are capable of degrading pfas however in the presence of naturally occurring chloride all of the above mentioned anode materials produce free chlorine which can react rapidly with the organic matter to form persistent chlorinated organic byproducts as well as toxic chlorate and perchlorate at higher current densities required for electrochemical defluorination of pfass radjenovic and sedlak 2015 recently developed graphene sponge electrodes demonstrated very limited electrocatalytic activity for chloride oxidation with a low current efficiency of only 0 04 in the presence of 20 mm nacl at anodic current density of 173 a m 2 furthermore there was no chlorate or perchlorate formation baptista pires et al 2021 this in addition to their scalable bottom up synthesis approach and low cost i e less than 50 per m2 of projected surface area makes them extremely attractive for electrochemical water and wastewater treatment applications the cost of bdd and mmo is two orders of magnitude higher i e 4200 and 3000 m 2 respectively wenderich et al 2021 moreover boron doped graphene sponge anode was capable of defluorinating c4 c8 perfluoroalkyl sulfonates and acids in flow through mode in a low conductivity supporting electrolyte solution duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 nevertheless the degradation of pfas was still incomplete with a significant portion being only electrosorbed but not defluorinated in this study we investigated the performance of borophene functionalized graphene sponge anode for electro oxidation of c4 c8 pfas i e perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa perfluorohexane sulfonate pfhxs perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs and perfluorobutanoic acid pfba our previous study showed that functionalization of the graphene sponge anode with the two dimensional 2d borophene instead of boron yielded an order of magnitude higher concentration of oh cuervo lumbaque et al 2022 however it is important to note that the degradation mechanism of pfas differs significantly from that of aromatic contaminants evaluated in the previous study as the reaction is limited by the initial direct electron transfer det step radjenovic et al 2020 electrolytic degradation of pfas is initiated by the electron transfer step to the anode to form a radical i e cnf2n 1 which then reacts further with the electrochemically generated hydroxyl radicals oh o2 and h2o and undergoes a cf2 unzipping reaction le et al 2019 niu et al 2013 thus enhanced electro generation of oh at the borophene functionalized graphene sponge anode should result in a more complete defluorination of pfas the experiments were performed in one pass flow through mode using synthetic electrolyte solutions of both low and high conductivity and the performance of the borophene doped graphene sponge anode was compared to the previously investigated boron doped graphene sponge anode to gain more insight into the impact of the supporting electrolyte on the electrolyte electrode interfacial reaction and electrochemical behaviour of the material borophene functionalized graphene sponge anode was characterized in detail using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and cyclic voltammetry cv finally we investigated the removal and defluorination of pfas in landfill leachate to demonstrate the potential of electrochemical oxidation using graphene sponge electrode for treating complex and brackish pfas laden streams notably the present study demonstrates for the first time the key role of supporting electrolyte on the resulting electrochemical resistance and activity of graphene sponge electrodes and it is the first instance of examining

functionalized reduced graphene oxide rgo sponge anodes b rgo and bph rgo respectively were synthesized according to the previously published protocols baptista pires et al 2021 cuervo lumbaque et al 2022 by adding either boric acid or borophene solution to 4 g l 1 graphene oxide go dispersion prior to the hydrothermal synthesis method borophene solution was obtained through liquid phase exfoliation from bulk boron ranjan et al 2019 wang et al 2020 specifically a 10 g l 1 aqueous solution was subjected to ultrasonication using an ultrasonic homogenizer tefic biotech 650 w for 4 h no

our previous studies baptista pires et al 2021 cuervo lumbaque et al 2022 2 3 electrochemical oxidation experiments electrochemical oxidation experiments were performed in a cylindrical flow through reactor operated at a flow rate of 5 ml min 1 resulting in a hydraulic residence time hrt of 3 5 min using a digital gear pump cole palmer graphene sponge anode with a projected surface area of 17 34 cm2 was connected to a stainless steel current collector and coupled with a stainless steel sponge cathode electrochemical removal of six model pfass i e pfos pfoa pfhxs pfhxa pfbs and pfba was evaluated in synthetic electrolyte solutions 10 and 100 mm phosphate buffer pb ph 7 2 electrical conductivity 1 and 8 ms cm 1 respectively and a highly complex and brackish real waste stream of ultrafiltrated uf landfill leachate ph 5 6 7 3 g l 1 cl 30 ms cm 1 table s1 obtained from a near by landfill in girona spain the target pfass were added at 0 2 µm initial concentration each and samples were taken after 10 20 and 30 bed volumes for each condition in polypropylene vials to prevent trace contamination with pfass the use of glassware could lead to adsorption of pfass on the glass surfaces and was therefore avoided to evaluate the possible losses of target pfass through adsorption onto the graphene sponge or other system components the reactor was first operated in initial open circuit ocinitial electrochemical degradation experiments were conducted in chronopotentiometric mode using a biologic multi channel potentiostat galvanostat vmp 300 and a leak free ag agcl reference electrode harvard apparatus placed between the anode and the cathode adjusting the applied current density i e 115 460 a m 2 in the electrolytes of varying electrical conductivity to reach the same ohmic drop corrected anode potentials of 6 v versus standard hydrogen electrode she table s2 the ohmic drop was calculated from the ohmic internal resistance obtained in the eis and the experimental data was fitted using the biologic ec lab software at the end of each chronopotentiometric run the current was switched off for the final oc run i e ocfinal and the effluent was sampled to evaluate the loss of the target pfass by electrosorption only i e without subsequent degradation all electrode potentials were expressed versus she she v when working with landfill leachate stainless steel current feeder was replaced following each experiment to avoid the effect of its corrosion on the reactor performance due to high chloride content of the landfill leachate 2 4 determination of defluorination of pfas and partially defluorinated compounds our previous study showed that electrochemical c f bond breakage at boron doped graphene sponge anode leads to the incorporation of fluoride into the graphene coating due to the high reactivity of the liberated hf duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 the amount of the incorporated fluoride can be quantitatively determined using combustion ion chromatography cic analysis i e by combusting the used graphene sponge and measuring the amount of the released fluoride to evaluate the defluorination efficiency at the bph rgo anode separate experiments were performed with single contaminants namely pfoa and pfos as model pfass which were added at higher initial concentration of 2 µm to allow the detection of fluoride released by the c f bond cleavage defluorination of pfos and pfoa was evaluated in synthetic electrolyte solutions 10 and 100 mm pb ph 7 2 1 and 8 ms cm 1 respectively and uf filtered landfill leachate the applied current densities were adjusted to the conductivities of the treated water stream to obtain a similar ohmic drop corrected anode potentials for each matrix after conducting the experiment with pfoa or pfos and a newly synthesized graphene sponge anode the employed anode was thoroughly washed with 100 mm ammonium acetate methanol and milliq water and the amount of fluoride incorporated into graphene was determined by combusting the used graphene sponge in cic analysis duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 the fluoride in the mass of a blank mineral wool template employed in the graphene based sponge synthesis was also determined by the same cic method and subtracted from the fluoride amount detected after combusting the graphene sponge used for electrochemical degradation of a specific pfas to account for the fluoride originating from the electrochemical defluorination of unknown organofluorine compounds already present in the sampled landfill leachate we analysed a new graphene sponge employed for electrooxidation of landfill leachate without the addition of pfoa pfos and the measured amount of fluoride incorporated into the graphene sponge was subtracted from the one obtained with landfill leachate amended with pfoa pfos 2 5 analytical methods target pfass were analysed with a 5500 qtrap hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer with a turbo ion spray source applied biosystems coupled to a waters acquity ultra performancetm liquid chromatograph milford to account for the matrix effects in leachate samples we used isotopically labelled internal standards perfluoro n 1 2 13c2 octanoic acid m2pfoa and perfluoro 1 13c8 octane sulfonate m8pfos details of the analytical method employed can be found in our previous study duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 to evaluate the presence of organofluoride compounds in the treated water measured as adsorbable organic fluorine aof as well as to determine the amount of fluoride incorporated in the graphene sponge anode we used a cic unit comprised of an aqf 2100h automatic quick furnace mitsubishi chemical analytech and an ic ics 2100 dionex the analytical method for aof analysis was adapted from wagner et al 2013 and is described in detail our previous study duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 chlorine ozone chlorine dioxide cuvette tests lck 310 were used to quantify free chlorine immediately following sampling using a diethyl p phenylene diamine dpd colorimetric technique hach lange spain sl the dpd method has a detection limit of 0 05 mg l 1 for the measurement of free chlorine hocl ocl high pressure ion chromatography hpic was used to measure chlorate clo3 and perchlorate clo4 using a dionex ics 5000 the quantification limits for the measurements of clo3 and clo4 were 0 015 mg l 1 and 0 004 mg l 1 respectively 2 6 electrochemical characterization of graphene sponge anodes cv and eis were conducted using the previously described reactor set up to evaluate the electrochemical performance of b rgo and bph rgo anodes cv curves were acquired at scan rates of 50 mv s 1 in the positive potential window ranging from 0 to 2 v she the eis frequency ranged from 100 khz to 1 hz to gain insight into the impact of the supporting electrolyte solution on the electrochemical performance of graphene sponge anode eis was conducted in 10 mm and 82 100 mm nacl nano3 and na2hpo4 nah2po4 with electrical conductivities of 1 and 8 ms cm 1 respectively and uf filtrated landfill leachate 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfass removal at boron and borophene doped graphene sponge anodes fig 1 illustrates the normalized effluent concentrations of the target pfass in 10 mm pb using b rgo and bph rgo anode for both tested graphene sponge electrodes the effluent concentrations were equal to their influent concentrations during the ocinitial for the six model pfass demonstrating that there was no absorption of pfass on the graphene sponges or any other parts of the reactor pfas anions were also not expected to adsorb through electrostatic interactions onto the uncharged graphene sponge anode given the determined negative ζ potentials of b rgo 36 2 mv norra et al 2022 and bph rgo 33 9 mv cuervo lumbaque et al 2022 application of 230 a m 2 resulted in the ohmic drop corrected anode potential of 6 v she and an average removal efficiency in the range of 26 69 for perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas and 17 41 for perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas at a b rgo anode this is in accordance with our previous study i e 27 67 removal of pfsas and 17 44 removal of pfcas duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 when changing from b to bph rgo anode the average removal efficiencies were increased for all six pfass with 32 77 removal for pfsas and 20 57 removal for pfcas at 230 a m 2 this improvement was more prominent for pfcas e g pfoa removal efficiency was increased from 41 to 57 also from 24 to 30 for pfhxa and from 17 to 20 for pfba in the case of pfsas bph rgo anode enhanced the removal of pfos from 69 to 77 from 33 to 37 for pfhxs and from 26 to 32 for pfbs similar to our previous study duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 pfas removal efficiencies at both b and bph rgo anode decreased with the chain shortening likely due to decreasing molecular polarizabilities αp in the order of pfos 170 c m2 v 1 pfhxs 138 c m2 v 1 pfbs 107 c m2 v 1 and pfoa 140 c m2 v 1 pfhxa 109 c m2 v 1 pfba 77 5 c m2 v 1 the main difference between the b rgo and bph rgo anode can be observed in the measured effluent concentrations of pfass in the ocfinal at the b rgo anode the effluent concentrations rose above their initial pfass concentrations in the ocfinal implying that a fraction of the removed pfass was merely electrosorbed onto the graphene sponge anode during the application of current and released back into the solution when the current was switched off duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 the of the electrosorbed pfass was determined based on the pfass concentrations measured in the fractions collected in the ocfinal and their removal efficiencies fig s2 a text s4 overall 9 33 of pfas was only electrosorbed at the b rgo anode without being degraded whereas 27 58 of the removed pfass was further electrochemically degraded fig s2 a table s3 in the case of bph rgo anode there was no increase in the effluent concentrations of pfass in the ocfinal after the current was switched off this implied that the removed pfass were further electrochemically degraded as there was no fraction that could be assigned to electrosorption only and 100 of the removed pfas was further electrochemically degraded as explained previously functionalization of the graphene sponge with borophene increases the electrocatalytic activity of the anode and enhances the generation of oh cuervo lumbaque et al 2022 electrochemically generated oh radicals react with pfas radicals cnf2n 1 formed by the initial direct electron transfer step from pfas to the anode and assist in the defluorination and removal of the carboxyl and sulfonate group thus contributing to an improved degradation of the electrosorbed pfas hori et al 2008 niu et al 2012 plumlee et al 2009 also the addition of an electron deficient borophene li et al 2018 lowers the resistance at the electrode electrolyte interface through the creation of defects and oxygen vacancies in the rgo structure hu et al 2013 3 2 impact of the supporting electrolyte conductivity and type on the electrooxidation of pfass the electrical conductivity of the supporting electrolyte will impact the double layer thickness and ion transport towards the electrode surface and thus the electrocatalytic activity of the anode radjenovic et al 2020 also electrolysis conducted in low conductivity solutions may be negatively affected by the poor wetting of the electrode surface to investigate the impact of the supporting electrolyte conductivity on the electro oxidation of pfas experiments were performed with a bph rgo anode using 10 and 100 mm pb with electrical conductivities of 1 and 8 ms cm 1 respectively applied current densities were adjusted to obtain similar ohmic drop corrected anode potentials i e 115 and 230 a m 2 for 10 mm pb and 288 and 460 a m 2 for 100 mm pb resulted in ohmic drop corrected anode potentials of 4 and 6 v she respectively table s2 increase in phosphate buffer concentration from 10 to 100 mm pb led to a decrease in the removal efficiencies with 30 pfos 8 pfoa 11 pfhxs 8 pfhxa 6 pfbs and 5 pfba removal at the anode potential of 4 v she fig 2 the detrimental impact of higher phosphate buffer concentration on pfas removal was also observed at higher applied current densities i e ohmic drop corrected anode potentials of 6 v she as pfas removal efficiencies decreased from 30 77 in 10 mm pb to 11 60 in 100 mm pb fig 2 thus despite the higher conductivity of the employed supporting electrolyte solution electrochemical removal of pfas was worsened in 100 mm pb we further investigated the electrochemical performance of the bph rgo anode in the phosphate solution and compared it to chloride and nitrate based supporting electrolyte using eis and cv figs 3 and s2 the nyquist plots were fitted with a modified randles circuit and the results of the z fit are summarized in table s4 ohmic resistance rs i e bulk electrolyte resistance can be derived from the intercepts of the x axis in the nyquist plots in fig 3a in 100 mm pb the rs 1 32 ω was significantly lower than in the 10 mm pb 3 35 ω in line with its higher electrical conductivity the region of high to mid frequency of the nyquist plots marked by the diameter of the semicircle is a measure of the charge transfer and double layer resistance at the electrolyte electrode surface rct the rct values obtained by the z fit were 6 53 and 6 41 ω for 10 and 100 mm pb respectively table s4 a rather minor difference considering the differences in their electrical conductivities especially compared to nano3 and nacl electrolyte as explained further in the text the warburg impedance mid to low frequency of the nyquist plots is a complex element which expresses the difficulty of mass transport of the ion species to and into the electrode lazanas and prodromidis 2023 in a simple example where a solid electrode is submerged into the electrolyte charges experience a single boundary being the electrode electrolyte interface and we can consider a semi infinite linear diffusion from the bulk electrolyte towards the electrode surface the warburg impedance is visualized in this case as a 45 line at the start of the low frequency range of the nyquist plot the line at 45 describes the time dependant diffusion of the ion species over the diffusion layer that starts at the electrode electrolyte interface and extends to an indefinite length only restricted by the size of the bulk solution with a gradually decreasing concentration gradient however in the case of electrodes with apertures where ion species can enter the cavities of the electrode structure the impedimetric response must be described by two boundaries and thus finite diffusion model instead of the semi infinite single boundary linear diffusion lazanas and prodromidis 2023 from within the cavities of the material the ion species will not reach the bulk of the electrolyte through linear diffusion as it is restricted by cavity walls on two sides thus the two boundaries in this case represent the two opposing limitations walls of the apertures of the rgo structure the so called finite diffusion can be subdivided into two distinct conditions 1 a transmissive boundary where the rgo layer itself would be permeable does not apply here and 2 reflective boundary where the finite diffusion region is impermeable to the diffusing species ions accumulating in the apertures of the electrode structure give rise to the formation of double layers and the resulting double layer capacitance at low frequencies the diffusion of charges within the cavities of the rgo structure give rise to a warburg impedance which gets dominated by capacitive behaviour resulting in a line that bends upwards in 100 mm pb due to the higher amount of large hydrated phosphate ions having limited access to and obstructing the apertures of the nanostructured rgo coating the system can be considered as an electrode without apertures the nyquist plots thus visualizes the warburg impedance with a 45 angle in 10 mm pb some phosphate ions can enter the structure due to less obstruction thus the electrode behaviour approaches the reflective boundary finite diffusion model identified by the upwards bend in the low frequency region fig 3a the warburg impedance in 10 mm pb 120 3 ohm s 1 2 was smaller than that in 100 mm pb 138 4 ohm s 1 2 indicating the diminished ion diffusion upon increased phosphate concentration table s4 nyquist plots of the bph rgo anode obtained in 10 mm nacl nano3 and pb solutions exhibit comparable behaviour fig 3b all three supporting electrolytes illustrate the same rs i e 6 17 6 84 ω as expected based on the same electrical conductivities 1 ms cm 1 however the obtained values of rct were decreasing in the order pb 6 53 ω nano3 3 34 ω nacl 2 45 ω table s4 furthermore the warburg line shows dependency on the electrolyte type the warburg coefficient which is related to the warburg element w1 is the diffusion resistance coefficient of ions in solution and it increased in the order cl 61 97 ohm s 2 no3 69 45 ohm s 1 2 po4 3 120 3 ohm s 1 2 implying a much faster diffusion of cl ions within the graphene sponge anode compared to phosphate ions cui et al 2015 table s4 this can be explained by the differences in the hydration energies of phosphate nitrate and chloride ions which beside the ion size determine the interactions of the anions with the graphene sponge anode ions can be classified as chaotropes bind water molecules weekly or kosmotropes bind water molecules strongly depending on their jones dole viscosity b coefficients hpo4 2 no3 and cl have a descending jones dole viscosity b coefficients of 0 382 0 046 and 0 007 respectively zhan et al 2019 thus phosphate ions hpo4 2 and h2po4 at ph 7 act as kosmotropes and are more strongly hydrated compared with the no3 and cl ions having 1 9 h2po4 and 4 hpo4 2 tightly bound water molecules versus zero tightly bound water molecules for no3 and cl collins 2006 in addition larger ions such as phosphate have limited access to the small pores of the rgo coating compared to e g chloride a phenomenon well established in the field of graphene based supercapacitors lin 2018 higher hydration energy and larger size of phosphate ions lead to their slower diffusion within the graphene sponge electrode and a higher rct due to the worsened interfacial reaction of the electrolyte and the electrode on the other hand smaller and more easily dehydrated no3 and cl anions are inserted more readily between the rgo layers of the graphene sponge anode coating thus promoting their access to the inner parts of the material the impact of ion solvation and size on their accessibility to the electrode surface and diffusion is known to be tightly related to electrochemical performance of graphene and carbon based supercapacitor electrodes feng and cummings 2011 pohlmann et al 2013 due to this improved interaction of cl and no3 ions with the graphene sponge anode increase in the molarities of nacl and nano3 supporting electrolytes had a far more prominent impact on the resistances determined by eis compared with the phosphate based electrolyte fig 3c although the highly concentrated supporting electrolytes had the same electrical conductivity 8 ms cm 1 82 mm nacl and 90 mm nano3 exhibited much lower ohmic resistances i e rs 0 82 and 0 76 ω respectively compared with the 100 mm pb 1 32 ω also while higher phosphate concentration led to a somewhat worsened ion diffusion within the graphene sponge anode higher warburg impedance ion mobility was favoured for higher concentrations of nacl and nano3 substantial difference can be observed at medium frequencies where the rct of the bph rgo anode was 0 19 ω for both 82 mm nacl and 90 mm nano3 an order of magnitude lower compared to rct in 100 mm pb 6 41 ω this suggests that in highly concentrated nacl or nano3 electrolyte graphene sponge electrode possesses high electrical conductivity and undergoes a rapid charge transfer reaction with fast cl or no3 ion diffusion within the material this behaviour is unique of the permeable anodes or anodes with apertures lasia 2009 as e g solid mixed metal oxide mmo electrodes do not exhibit the same behaviour and different resistances determined by eis are directly related to the supporting electrolyte concentration only and not its type figure s4 different electrochemical behaviour of the graphene sponge anode in the presence of different anions is also apparent from the cvs recorded in 10 mm nacl nano3 and pb supporting electrolytes figure s3 the effect of enhanced mobility of cl and no3 anions inside the graphene sponge anode is observed in cvs as an increased current passing through the system usually seen in the first cycle weingarth et al 2014 the cv curve for the bph rgo anode in 10 mm nacl shows an activation belt between 1 and 2 v she during the first cycle dashed line for 10 mm nacl and nano3 electrolytes in the case of 10 mm pb strong hydration of phosphate prevents the large h2po4 hpo4 2 ions to enter between the rgo nanosheets and activate the material and thus no activation peak is observed the interfacial reaction between the electrode and electrolyte is closely related to electrochemical properties as is well known from the battery field suo et al 2015 as a consequence of higher resistances as shown by the eis analyses graphene sponge anode polarized at 115 a m 2 in 10 mm pb results in the measured anode potential of 4 7 v she significantly higher compared to 3 3 3 v she measured in 10 mm nano3 and nacl solutions figure s5 it should be noted that it was not possible to perform longer chronopotentiometric experiments in synthetic supporting electrolyte solutions other than phosphate based as highly concentrated and pure synthetic solutions of nacl and nano3 cause a rapid pitting corrosion of the stainless steel current feeder employed to connect the graphene sponge anode yohai et al 2013 figure s6 3 3 electrooxidation of pfass in landfill leachate bph rgo anode was further employed for electrochemical degradation of pfass in a uf filtrated landfill leachate 30 ms cm 1 fig 4 anodic current density of 575 a m 2 was applied to reach the ohmic drop corrected anode potential of 6 v she and allow comparison with the experiments conducted in 10 and 100 mm pb despite the high complexity of landfill leachate in terms of both organic and inorganic content table s1 significantly higher removal efficiencies were obtained for all six pfass except for pfba compared to 10 and 100 mm pb for example the removal of pfos and pfoa was 77 and 57 in 10 mm pb and 95 and 75 in landfill leachate respectively this can be explained by the higher electrochemical activity of the graphene sponge in landfill leachate as demonstrated by the lower electrode resistances both rs and rct recorded in the eis analyses fig 3c the rs and rct values obtained for landfill leachate were 0 18 and 0 25 ω whereas in the case of phosphate buffer they were significantly higher i e 3 45 and 6 53 ω for 10 mm pb and 1 32 and 4 66 ω for 100 mm pb respectively landfill leachate contained 7 3 g l 1 206 mm cl and 1 3 g l 1 21 mm no3 with very low concentration of phosphate present 13 mg l 1 although the landfill leachate contained an extremely high concentration of chloride only 3 78 mg l 1 of free chlorine was measured at 575 a m 2 resulting in the current efficiency for chlorine generation of only 0 18 we did not detect any chlorate and perchlorate in the treated effluent furthermore stainless steel current feeder enabled stable anode potentials during 1 5 h experimental runs in landfill leachate despite the high chloride concentration fig s7 this may be a consequence of a protective effect of the presence of organic cations and other inorganics which prevented a rapid corrosion of the stainless steel current collector observed in pure nacl and nano3 solutions fig s6 this limitation of the stainless steel current feeder for the longer term usage of graphene sponge anode can be resolved by using current feeders coated with protective conductive polymers lu and elsenbaumer 1999 tan and blackwood 2003 or by a layer of iro2 kasian et al 2016 weber et al 2021 3 4 defluorination of pfos and pfoa in synthetic electrolyte and landfill leachate experiments focused on the determination of the defluorination efficiencies at the bph rgo anode were conducted with pfos and pfoa at higher initial concentration 2 µm to enable the detection of the fluoride incorporated into the graphene sponge via cic analyses and in 10 mm pb 100 mm pb and landfill leachate after combusting the sponges employed in each experiment the fluoride concentrations obtained in the cic analyses were used to calculate the fluoride recoveries for both pfos and pfoa the relative fluoride recoveries were calculated as the ratio of the amount of fluoride measured in cic and the theoretical amount of fluoride released from pfos pfoa i e assuming complete defluorination of the electrooxidized fraction text s6 relative f recoveries obtained for the bph rgo anode in 10 mm pb were 69 for pfos and 82 for pfoa values comparable to the previously reported recoveries obtained for the b rgo anode in the same supporting electrolyte i e 75 pfos and 74 pfoa duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 unlike the experiments conducted at lower initial concentration of pfass 0 2 µm where bph rgo anode enhanced the degradation of pfas with no increase in their effluent concentration in the ocfinal higher initial pfass concentrations 2 µm resulted in 34 electrosorption of both pfoa and pfos without further degradation fig s8 this may be a consequence of an insufficient number of active sites at the bph rgo anode for higher pfass concentrations nonetheless the defluorination relative to the removed fraction was 42 pfos and 55 pfoa higher compared with the previously reported defluorination at the b rgo anode 36 for pfos and 49 for pfoa fig 6 the removal efficiencies of both pfos and pfoa were also marginally lower at higher initial concentration 2 µm compared to 0 2 µm which also suggests that their electrochemical degradation became limited by the availability of the active sites at the anode surface when the molarity of pb electrolyte was increased to 100 mm the defluorination were decreased to 7 pfos and 4 pfoa fig 5 in line also with the observed decrease in the pfos and pfoa removal efficiencies in addition to the previously explained higher resistances of the graphene sponge anode in the presence of phosphate higher concentration of phosphate ions enhances the scavenging of the electrogenerated oh and occupies the active sites at the anode surface mirabediny et al 2023 zhuo et al 2020 in landfill leachate the obtained f recoveries relative to the electrooxidized fraction for pfos and pfoa were 33 and 45 respectively thus although experiments conducted in landfill leachate yielded higher removal efficiencies of pfos 86 and pfoa 72 than in the case of 10 and 100 mm pb their defluorination was still incomplete lower defluorination efficiencies of pfos and pfoa in landfill leachate can be ascribed to the presence of organics and inorganics that scavenge the electrogenerated oh and occupy the active centres at the anode surface it should be noted that intense foaming was observed in the experiments conducted in landfill leachate which negatively impacted the graphene sponge anode wetting and its electrochemical performance in summary the overall defluorination efficiencies i e calculated relative to the initial pfass concentration were 29 pfos and 29 pfoa in 10 mm pb 7 pfos and 4 pfoa in 100 mm pb and 25 pfos and 29 pfoa in landfill leachate fig 5 given that the electrochemical defluorination was incomplete the amount of the formed partially defluorinated by products was estimated by measuring the cumulative effluent samples during the chronopotentiometric run in 10 mm pb at 230 a m 2 and in ocf using aof text s3 the measured aof values are represented in quantity of f and compared with the amount of the aof expected based on the measured parent compound pfos and pfoa concentrations duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 during the application of current the measured effluent aof is very similar to the aof expected from the residual amount of the pfoa and pfos fig 7 this indicates that during the application of current organic fluoride in the effluent can be assigned exclusively to the parent compound i e pfoa or pfos however a substantial difference between the measured and expected aof can be observed in the ocf while for pfos the expected value of aof during the ocf was 439 3 10 1 µg f based on the pfos measured in the effluent the aof analysis detected a total of 872 1 63 3 µg f i e 2 fold increase similarly for pfoa a substantial difference between the expected cumulative organic fluorine 229 1 18 5 µg f and the total fluorine detected by aof analysis 537 8 77 2 µg f i e 2 4 fold increase in the ocf can be observed limited availability of active sites at the anode surface for higher initial pfos and pfoa concentrations 2 µm resulted in a fraction of both pfos and pfoa that was merely electrosorbed and not further degraded therefore the predicted aof in the ocf was high partly due to said electrosorption higher measured aof values than the ones expected based on the effluent concentrations of pfos pfoa imply the presence of partially defluorinated by products that remain electrosorbed during the application of current and are released after the current is switched off it should be noted though that the aof analysis is merely semi quantitative as it is conditioned by the adsorption of pfass and other organofluoride compounds on the activated carbon ac cartridge however the difference between the anticipated and measured aof in the ocf of pfos was higher than that for pfoa which suggests a greater proportion of degraded pfos persists in the form of partially defluorinated compounds compared to pfoa this is consistent with the fact that less amount of fluorine was recovered for pfos 69 compared to pfoa 82 the lower fluorine recovery of pfos also indicates that a higher fraction of pfos did not undergo complete defluorination generating partially defluorinated by products which contributed to the higher measured aof value in the ocfinal in one pass treatment with bph rgo anode at 230 a m 2 and using 10 mm pb 30 77 of pfas removal the specific energy consumption was 9 4 0 3 bph rgo kwh m 3 similar to our previous study duinslaeger and radjenovic 2022 higher specific energy consumption for the experiments conducted in 100 mm pb 17 2 0 4 kwh m 3 stems from the higher charge transfer resistance of the graphene sponge electrode in 100 mm pb as well as higher current densities needed to obtain similar potentials as in 10 mm pb in the experiments conducted with landfill leachate high current densities needed to be applied to reach comparable anode potentials obtained in 10 and 100 mm pb due to the high conductivity of the solution which consequently led to higher energy consumption of 21 0 2 kwh m 3 current density can be further optimized to achieve more energy efficient treatment of landfill leachate together with the improved reactor geometry that enables better flow distribution and usage of the graphene sponge electrode surface this is the subject of our ongoing studies 4 conclusion in this study we have demonstrated an improved electrochemical removal of c4 c8 pfass when changing from atomic boron to a 2d borophene functionalized graphene sponge anode in the experiments conducted using a bph rgo anode in a low conductivity supporting electrolyte 1 ms cm 1 and using low initial pfass concentration 0 2 µm we achieved higher removal efficiencies compared with the b rgo anode with up to 77 removal of pfos and 57 removal of pfoa increase in the phosphate buffer concentration from 10 to 100 mm had a detrimental effect on the removal of pfas despite the higher electrolyte conductivity which was allocated to the inability of phosphate ions to access the penetrable structure of the electrode eis and cv characterisation of the graphene sponge anode in chloride and nitrate based supporting electrolyte solutions confirmed ion solvation and size along with their accessibility to the apertures of the electrode to be tightly related to electrochemical performance enhanced electrical conductivity and charge transfer reaction was obtained due to fast cl or no3 ion diffusion within the material we also report an enhanced removal of nearly all target pfass in a complex real wastewater matrix i e uf filtrated landfill leachate with 86 and 72 removal observed for pfos and pfoa respectively enhanced electrochemical removal was assigned to an improved interaction of major inorganic anions present in leachate with the graphene sponge electrode due to their chaotropic nature resulting in a higher conductivity and

14662,surface runoff is a major pathway for the transport of plastics however most previous studies focus on the transport of microplastics in aquatic environment whereas the migration of plastics from terrestrial environment to aquatic ecosystems receives limited attention in this work we investigated the migration of plastic on different surfaces via surface runoff results indicate that the threshold migration condition increases with the size and density of plastics while decreases as the surface inclination increases plastics show a higher degree of mobility on smooth surfaces but plastic films exhibit lower mobility due to the frictional forces induced by the downward pressure exerted by the water flow conversely rough surfaces such as concrete and macadam can trap small fragments and rigid film plastics and plastics can be embedded within the soil matrix under the water flow in summary smaller size steeper incline and greater water flow rate facilitate the movement of plastics on surfaces results from this work improve the understanding of the process of plastic migration from land to water and are of great significance for the prevention and control of plastic

ease of ingestion by organisms microplastics pose significant risks to the health of both ecosystems and organisms recent studies suggest that surface runoff constitutes the principal route for the migration of plastics from terrestrial to aquatic environments han et al 2022a hitchcock 2020 pinon colin et al 2020 smyth et al 2021 additionally the transport of plastics via surface runoff showed similar pattern to the transport of soil particles ballent et al 2013 besseling et al 2017 nizzetto et al 2016 despite those similarities it is essential to acknowledge the differences in density size and shape between plastics and soil particles khatmullina and isachenko 2017 kooi et al 2016 kaiser et al 2017 other distinct properties such as roughness hardness and surface properties further differentiate plastics from soil particles hossain et al 2019 consequently inferences derived from soil erosion studies may not necessarily apply to plastics previously waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 investigated the vertical and horizontal migration of plastics within water columns and river sediments elucidating the parallels and discrepancies between plastic and sedimentary transportation processes meanwhile yu et al 2022 conducted a study on the initial mobilization of microplastics in open channel flows proposing that the classical sediment initiation model does not accurately reflect the behavior of plastics however these studies are restricted to aquatic systems and did not involve the transport of plastic waste from terrestrial to aquatic environments it has been demonstrated that rainfall and overland flow play important roles in the transport of plastics from terrestrial to aquatic environments han et al 2022b hitchcock 2020 pinon colin et al 2020 waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 investigate the plastic migration on sediments utilizing shields curves revealing that the shear force necessary to instigate plastic migration depends on the properties of both plastic particles and the sediment however the flow dynamics on a terrestrial surface differ from that on a sedimentary surface consequently the shields curve with shear force as the primary parameter may not be applicable therefore this work investigated the threshold migration conditions of plastics under the impact of overland flow to foster a better understanding of microplastic transport behavior within terrestrial environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup four sinks were constructed using pp boards with a dimension of 100 20 5 cm each sink served to simulate a different type of underlying surface including a smooth surface a concrete surface a macadam surface and a soil surface the sink was employed directly as a smooth surface the bottom of the sink was overlaid with sandpaper a blend of macadam and filler and homogeneous soil to simulate a concrete surface a macadam surface and a soil surface respectively detailed parameters and photographic representations of each type of underlying surface are presented in the supplementary material table s1 and fig s1 the sink with varying inclinations was deployed to simulate different surface slopes fig 1 a water tank was positioned above the sink connected to an inlet pipe a porous partition was installed in the tank to ensure uniform water flow a flow meter and a flow valve were integrated into the inlet pipe facilitating controlling of the flow rate entering the sink range of the water flow rate can be adjusted in this experiment varied from 0 to 7 l m 1 s 1 2 2 experimental materials plastics of three morphological types fragments films and fibers were investigated in this study plastic fragment and film were made from pet pvc pa pe and pp while plastic fiber was made from pet and pvc the plastic fragment for each polymer type were trimmed to 0 25 0 5 1 2 4 6 8 10 12 and 14 mm in size plastic fragments exceeding 5 mm were trimmed into cubic forms plastic fragments less than 5 mm considered as microplastics were treated as spherical entities waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 however due to limitations in preparation accuracy these microplastics were processed as irregular granules the plastic film was square shaped with a thickness of 0 1 mm films and fragments used in the study had an equivalent mass the sizes of the films were delineated in relation to the sizes of the corresponding fragments the plastic fiber utilized in the experiment exhibits a diameter of 0 1 mm the length of each fiber plastic corresponded to the diagonal of the square films specifically the lengths were 0 56 1 58 4 47 12 65 35 78 65 73 101 19 141 42 and 185 90 mm respectively photographs of the plastic materials employed in the experiment are presented in figs s2 s4 2 3 experimental methods prepared plastics were placed at 15 25 cm from the outlet of the sink and the sink has a 1 incline then the flow valve was opened and the water flow increased gradually creating a slope flow discharged from the outlet end as the water flow rate increased the plastic began to move this point was recorded as the threshold migration condition for the plastic on a surface at the slope the procedure was repeated with the slope of the surface increased from 1 to 45 in 1 increments the experiment was repeated five times for each treatment pre experimental results indicated that the threshold migration condition for films of different polymer types was predominantly influenced by their hardness rather than their densities consequently films were classified into two categories hard and soft films hard films are made of pet pvc and pp exhibiting a hardness range of 80 120 ha soft films are made of pe and pa which had a hardness range of 50 60 ha the texture of the soft film was similar to that of a plastic bag while the texture of the hard film resembled a billboard additionally it was nearly impossible for hard plastic films to remain completely flat due to the inherent elastic rebound properties of the plastic li et al 2020 bending of the plastic film could significantly influence the migration therefore we conducted separate tests with the convex side and concave side of the film in contact with the surface respectively kmno4 was used as a tracer to measure the flow velocities at flow rates of 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 66 and 72 l min for each incline of the four substrate types flury and wai 2003 the specific flow rate used in measuring the flow velocity was determined through pre experiments 2 4 statistics the threshold unit width flow rate tfr l m 1 s 1 was calculated by dividing the measured threshold flow rate by the width of the sink to generate a spatial scatter plot the slope angle the plastic size and the tfr was plotted on the x axis y axis and z axis respectively a 3d surface was generated using the convolution fitting method in instances where a 3d surface was not appropriate a 2d point line plot was created instead subsequently line graphs were plotted to compare the tfr of plastic materials of varying densities and the results were presented in the si the reynolds number and froude number are dimensionless parameters employed to characterize the fluid flow the reynolds number characterizes the stability of fluid flow determining whether it is laminar or turbulent on the other hand the froude number characterizes the driving force of the fluid flow establishing whether the fluid flow is propelled by inertial force indicative of slow flow or by gravity indicative of rapid flow additionally fluid kinetic energy a quantitative parameter expressed in joules j is utilized to characterize the kinetic energy of the fluid flow reynolds number re was calculated according to eq 1 1 r e v r v where v is the flow velocity r is the hydraulic radius and v is the viscosity coefficient of pure water 1 004 10 6m2 s 1 at 20 c the flow is considered laminar when the re is less than 500 mixed flow when re ranges between 500 and 2400 and turbulent flow when re exceeds 2400 tachie et al 2003 froude number fr was calculated according to eq 2 2 f r v g h 1 2 where v is the flow velocity g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the water depth the flow is considered the slow flow when fr is less than 1 with the primary driving force being inertia conversely when fr exceeds 1 the flow is classified as rapid with gravity being the dominant force acting on the water flow ordonez 2013 fluid kinetic energy ek was calculated using eq 3 3 e k 0 5 ρ q v 2 where ρ is the liquid density q is the flow rate and v is the flow rate chia 1976 the differences between treatments were compared using a two way analysis of variance anova followed by a least significant

quality control in the experiment de ionized water was used and the temperature was maintained at approximately 20 c to ensure a consistent viscosity all plastics were soaked in deionized water for 48 h before the experiment to eliminate static electricity kaiser et al 2017 throughout the experiment cotton lab coats and nitrile gloves were worn to avoid contamination 3 results and discussion 3 1 smooth surface the tfr of lower density plastic tends to be smaller than that of higher density plastic of equivalent size and slope angle fig 2 the tfr of the plastic fragment of different polymer types but similar density showed no difference p 0 05 the variation of tfr with size and slope angle showed similar pattern for plastics of different densities the tfr of the plastic fragment increased with the size of the plastics while decreases as the slope angle increases a lower standard deviation of the replicate was observed when the tfr is less than 2 5 l m 1 s 1 for all the plastic fragments the tfr is close to 0 when the slop exceeds 15 in this case the plastic fragments slide naturally even without the input of water flow the tfr for soft film plastic is higher than that for fragments due to a large frictional force induced by the pressure differential above and below the film when the slope is less than 11 the tfr of soft films on the smooth underlying surface is unstable consequently the plot starts from 11 in the figure similar to fragment the standard deviation of tfr rise when the water flow surpassing 3 l m 1 s 1 the tfr for soft film plastic with smaller sizes shows a sudden shift at 13 which could be attributed to changes in water flow pattern of the overland flow see section 4 for further details although the overall tfr of soft film plastics decreases sharply with the increase of slope angle it generally remains higher than that of fragments when the slope approaches 30 the tfr for soft film plastic becomes 0 hard film larger than 6 mm could not be transported by slope flow within the tested flow range fig 2 conversely hard film 4 mm or smaller can easily be transported by slope flow this might be attributed to the force acting on the hard film fig 3 when the concave side of the hard film plastic contacts the underlying surface the water flow exerts a downward force on it this results in an increased friction between the plastic and the surface inhibiting the plastic s migration in contrast the hard film can be moved easily when the convex side contacts the underlying surface as the water flow exerts an upward force which reduces the friction between the plastic and the underlying surface small hard films exhibited less bending and hence they are less susceptible to the friction mentioned above therefore hard film 4 mm or smaller can move easily regardless of which sides contacts the surface fibers can be easily mobilized by the water flow this could be related to the large specific surface area of fibers which results in reduced friction and higher susceptibility to the action of water flow this finding is consistent with the results of previous studies han et al 2022a nizzetto et al 2016 3 2 concrete surface the trend of the tfr for fragments on the concrete surface is similar to that on the smooth surface fig 4 the tfr increases with the size of fragments and the decrease in slope angle furthermore the trends of the tfr for fragment of different polymer types follows a similar pattern compared with smooth surface changes in the tfr were much smoother fragments slide from the concrete surface naturally when the slope exceeds 45 soft film and hard film with the convex side in contact with the concrete surface showed a low tfr which migrate easily even at a small flow rate this can be attributed to the roughness of the concrete surface which results in large gaps between the film and the surface consequently the friction between the film and the surface is small facilitating the movement conversely larger hard plastic films with the concave side in contact with the concrete surface is difficult to move this phenomenon can be attributed to two factors fig 5 first the water flow exerts a downward force on the film thereby increasing the friction between the film and the surface second the edge of the hard film can become lodged in the gap of the particles on the concrete surface creating a counter thrust force only small size hard film plastics of 4 mm and 2 mm can be moved as they are less likely to form a larger bending angle and are less likely be obstructed by the raised particles for a film of a certain thickness the smaller the edge length the greater the stiffness and thus it is the less likely to be bent flury and wai 2003 similar to smooth surface fibers move easily upon encountering the water flow on the concrete surface this movement can be attributed to their large specific surface area and inherent flexibility which prevents entrapment in rough surface 3 3 macadam surface the tfr trend for plastic fragment on a macadam underlying surface follows a similar pattern to that on smooth and concrete surfaces fig 6 however the trend differs for plastics of different polymer types lower density plastics exhibit lower tfr particularly for those with a small size on the macadam surface high density plastic fragments require higher force to counteract gravity and cross over the rough surface obstacles plastics with densities lower than water are easier to move due to buoyance variations of tfr on the macadam surface present larger standard deviations compared with smooth and concrete surfaces which might be attributed to the roughness of the macadam surface which complicates the water flow pattern it was found that plastics smaller than the macadam were stuck between the gaps of the macadam surface during the experiments fig 6 it should be noted that the macadams in the pavements investigated here differ from those found in gravel riverbeds waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 as illustrated in fig 7 if a large part of a macadam is buried the angle between it and the surface of the filler will exceeds 90 thereby preventing plastics from becoming stuck conversely if only a small part of a macadam is buried and the angle with the filler surface is less than 90 plastic materials can be trapped hence the ability of macadam pavement to intercept plastic depends on the ratio of macadams in the two aforementioned states in real world macadam pavement undergoes flattening by rollers and experiences wear and tear from usage and dust accumulation this often results in few macadams maintaining a pinch angle of less than 90 as a result the majority of plastics are not intercepted by macadam pavement the tfr for films on the macadam surface is discrete and showed abnormally distribution suggesting that the movement of films on the macadam surface is irregular both soft and hard film 6 mm or larger have little resistance on the macadam underlying surface and move once encounter the water flow when the convex sides in contact with the surface however hard films with concave side in contact with the underlying surface get stuck fig 5 films with small size 4 mm exhibit irregular movement under the influence of water flow due to the influence of rough surface on water flow most fibers moved easily upon encountering water however some fibers could not be moved within the tested flow range as the fibers have a chance to get trapped by gravels on the macadam surface 3 4 soil surface the trend of the tfr for plastic fragments on the soil surface is also similar to those observed on other surfaces fig 8 the tfr increases with an increase in the size of the fragments and a decrease in the slope angle plastics with a density lower than water display a lower tfr when the slope angles are less than 25 the tfr of the plastic fragment could not be measured due to soil erosion and burial as the slope angle increases beyond 25 soil erosion gradually reduces and the tfr the plastic fragment can be determined all plastic films show limited mobility on soil surfaces which could be attributed to the interaction between the film and soil particles films adhered strongly to the surface of the wet soil making them difficult to move additionally the movement of soil particles by the water flow can cover the films and thus affect their movement fibers move easily on the soil surface this could be largely attributed to their flexibility and large surface areas additionally the interaction between fibers and soil particles may be weak 3 6 mechanisms and implications 3 6 1 hydrodynamic parameters the re for overland flow is minimally impacted by the slope angle and the material of the underlying surface due to the exceptionally shallow water depth it primarily depends on the flow rate guy et al 2009 as shown in fig 9 a re reaches 500 when the flow rate reaches 0 5 l m 1 s 1 fig 9 a indicating a shift from laminar to mixed flow re exceeds 2400 when the tfr reaches 2 5 l m 1 s 1 indicating a shift from mixed to turbulent flow this may explain why the why the tfr becomes irregular when it approaches or exceeds 2 5l m 1 s 1 the fr exceeds the threshold value of 1 under most of the conditions except for those with exceedingly small slope angles fig 9b this indicates that slope flow is a rapid flow where the inertial force of the water is dominates and any floating objects in the water are subjected to a substantial current lift this also explains why hard plastic films can moved easily when their convex side contacts the surface as they are subjected to an upward buoyancy force the fluid kinetic energy increases as both the slope angle and flow rate increase fig 9c the smooth surface has the highest fluid kinetic energy followed by concrete soil and macadam surfaces respectively a higher fluid kinetic energy implies a substantial force exerted by the water flows to mobilize the plastics this force in concert with other forces determine the plastics movement on a surface 3 6 2 flow rate variation the experiment was conducted under conditions of a smooth and steady flow of water with the flow rate increasing gradually to avoid any surges however the observations drawn from this setup may not entirely capture the dynamics when the flow rate changed rapidly for example we observed that some plastics immobile under steady high tfrs could be mobilized by lower but quickly changing tfrs this phenomenon may be attributed to an abrupt rise in water energy during a surge li et al 2018 therefore further investigation examining the impact of flow surges on plastic migration is needed 3 6 3 comparison with the movement of natural particles plastic particles differ greatly from natural particles in multiple aspects leading to distinct migration behaviors under water flow the lower density of plastics reduces the friction with the underlying surface and enables those with less than water density to float and migrate with relative ease on the other hand the used plastic particles are larger than natural particles in size requiring more kinetic energy to move and increasing the likelihood of obstruction the high specific surface area of plastic particles also makes them more susceptible to shear forces exerted by the water flow moreover due to the soft properties plastic film can often escape entrapment through deformation the soil movement requires overcoming the bonding forces between soil particles by gaining kinetic energy from water flow liu et al 2006 tritthart et al 2012 yan et al 2011a the maximum erosion of the soil surface occurs at an incline angle of 25 and gradually decreases beyond this angle due to the decreasing parting force of the water flow perpendicular to the surface which makes it difficult to strip soil particles asadi et al 2007 zheng et al 2015 film plastics also adhere to flat soil surfaces and exhibit a similar movement pattern with erosion in contrast gravel movement under water flow does not necessitate overcoming soil adhesion and it only requires surmounting friction and gravity li et al 2008 yan et al 2011b yu et al 2017 likewise plastic migration on rough surfaces only needs to surmount friction and gravity as such the movement patterns of plastic on a rough surface is similar to that of gravel the movement of plastic fragments on the macadam surface involves a rolling process facilitated by water flow similar to the saltation load observed on riverbed leapfrogging as opposed to pushing requires greater kinetic energy bai et al 2012 guo et al 2022 in contrast when film plastic is transported on macadam it tumbles irregularly due to its anisotropic morphology resulting in constantly changing direction and magnitude of force by water flow sediment on the other hand has a relatively homogeneous force due to its low anisotropic morphology chen and cao 2003 her and heatwole 2016 knack and shen 2018 given the large proportion of film and fiber within environmental plastic transport of plastics cannot be modeled as reliably as soil and gravel 4 conclusion this study investigated the migration of plastics on different surfaces under the action of overland flow the mobility of plastics varied remarkably across different surfaces under the action of water flow plastics move more easily on smooth surfaces than other surfaces in general smaller size larger tilt angle and higher water flow rate facilitate the movement of plastics fragments are difficult to move on rougher surface while fibrous plastics are easy to move under all conditions due to their relative larger force area furthermore plastics with a density higher than water require more energy to migrate this study illustrates the threshold conditions for plastic movement under the action of overland flow which improves our understanding on the migration behavior of plastics on terrestrial surface and provides valuable information for the development of strategies to control the migration of plastic pollution credit authorship contribution statement naipeng han

is unstable consequently the plot starts from 11 in the figure similar to fragment the standard deviation of tfr rise when the water flow surpassing 3 l m 1 s 1 the tfr for soft film plastic with smaller sizes shows a sudden shift at 13 which could be attributed to changes in water flow pattern of the overland flow see section 4 for further details although the overall tfr of soft film plastics decreases sharply with the increase of slope angle it generally remains higher than that of fragments when the slope approaches 30 the tfr for soft film plastic becomes 0 hard film larger than 6 mm could not be transported by slope flow within the tested flow range fig 2 conversely hard film 4 mm or smaller can easily be transported by slope flow this might be attributed to the force acting on the hard film fig 3 when the concave side of the hard film plastic contacts the underlying surface the water flow exerts a downward force on it this results in an increased friction between the plastic and the surface inhibiting the plastic s migration in contrast the hard film can be moved easily when the convex side contacts the underlying surface as the water flow exerts an upward force which reduces the friction between the plastic and the underlying surface small hard films exhibited less bending and hence they are less susceptible to the friction mentioned above therefore hard film 4 mm or smaller can move easily regardless of which sides contacts the surface fibers can be easily mobilized by the water flow this could be related to the large specific surface area of fibers which results in reduced friction and higher susceptibility to the action of water flow this finding is consistent with the results of previous studies han et al 2022a nizzetto et al 2016 3 2 concrete surface the trend of the tfr for fragments on the concrete surface is similar to that on the smooth surface fig 4 the tfr increases with the size of fragments and the decrease in slope angle furthermore the trends of the tfr for fragment of different polymer types follows a similar pattern compared with smooth surface changes in the tfr were much smoother fragments slide from the concrete surface naturally when the slope exceeds 45 soft film and hard film with the convex side in contact with the concrete surface showed a low tfr which migrate easily even at a small flow rate this can be attributed to the roughness of the concrete surface which results in large gaps between the film and the surface consequently the friction between the film and the surface is small facilitating the movement conversely larger hard plastic films with the concave side in contact with the concrete surface is difficult to move this phenomenon can be attributed to two factors fig 5 first the water flow exerts a downward force on the film thereby increasing the friction between the film and the surface second the edge of the hard film can become lodged in the gap of the particles on the concrete surface creating a counter thrust force only small size hard film plastics of 4 mm and 2 mm can be moved as they are less likely to form a larger bending angle and are less likely be obstructed by the raised particles for a film of a certain thickness the smaller the edge length the greater the stiffness and thus it is the less likely to be bent flury and wai 2003 similar to smooth surface fibers move easily upon encountering the water flow on the concrete surface this movement can be attributed to their large specific surface area and inherent flexibility which prevents entrapment in rough surface 3 3 macadam surface the tfr trend for plastic fragment on a macadam underlying surface follows a similar pattern to that on smooth and concrete surfaces fig 6 however the trend differs for plastics of different polymer types lower density plastics exhibit lower tfr particularly for those with a small size on the macadam surface high density plastic fragments require higher force to counteract gravity and cross over the rough surface obstacles plastics with densities lower than water are easier to move due to buoyance variations of tfr on the macadam surface present larger standard deviations compared with smooth and concrete surfaces which might be attributed to the roughness of the macadam surface which complicates the water flow pattern it was found that plastics smaller than the macadam were stuck between the gaps of the macadam surface during the experiments fig 6 it should be noted that the macadams in the pavements investigated here differ from those found in gravel riverbeds waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 as illustrated in fig 7 if a large part of a macadam is buried the angle between it and the surface of the filler will exceeds 90 thereby preventing plastics from becoming stuck conversely if only a small part of a macadam is buried and the angle with the filler surface is less than 90 plastic materials can be trapped hence the ability of macadam pavement to intercept plastic depends on the ratio of macadams in the two aforementioned states in real world macadam pavement undergoes flattening by rollers and experiences wear and tear from usage and dust accumulation this often results in few macadams maintaining a pinch angle of less than 90 as a result the majority of plastics are not intercepted by macadam pavement the tfr for films on the macadam surface is discrete and showed abnormally distribution suggesting that the movement of films on the macadam surface is irregular both soft and hard film 6 mm or larger have little resistance on the macadam underlying surface and move once encounter the water flow when the convex sides in contact with the surface however hard films with concave side in contact with the underlying surface get stuck fig 5 films with small size 4 mm exhibit irregular movement under the influence of water flow due to the influence of rough surface on water flow most fibers moved easily upon encountering water however some fibers could not be moved within the tested flow range as the fibers have a chance to get trapped by gravels on the macadam surface 3 4 soil surface the trend of the tfr for plastic fragments on the soil surface is also similar to those observed on other surfaces fig 8 the tfr increases with an increase in the size of the fragments and a decrease in the slope angle plastics with a density lower than water display a lower tfr when the slope angles are less than 25 the tfr of the plastic fragment could not be measured due to soil erosion and burial as the slope angle increases beyond 25 soil erosion gradually reduces and the tfr the plastic fragment can be determined all plastic films show limited mobility on soil surfaces which could be attributed to the interaction between the film and soil particles films adhered strongly to the surface of the wet soil making them difficult to move additionally the movement of soil particles by the water flow can cover the films and thus affect their movement fibers move easily on the soil surface this could be largely attributed to their flexibility and large surface areas additionally the interaction between fibers and soil particles may be weak 3 6 mechanisms and implications 3 6 1 hydrodynamic parameters the re for overland flow is minimally impacted by the slope angle and the material of the underlying surface due to the exceptionally shallow water depth it primarily depends on the flow rate guy et al 2009 as shown in fig 9 a re reaches 500 when the flow rate reaches 0 5 l m 1 s 1 fig 9 a indicating a shift from laminar to mixed flow re exceeds 2400 when the tfr reaches 2 5 l m 1 s 1 indicating a shift from mixed to turbulent flow this may explain why the why the tfr becomes irregular when it approaches or exceeds 2 5l m 1 s 1 the fr exceeds the threshold value of 1 under most of the conditions except for those with exceedingly small slope angles fig 9b this indicates that slope flow is a rapid flow where the inertial force of the water is dominates and any floating objects in the water are subjected to a substantial current lift this also explains why hard plastic films can moved easily when their convex side contacts the surface as they are subjected to an upward buoyancy force the fluid kinetic energy increases as both the slope angle and flow rate increase fig 9c the smooth surface has the highest fluid kinetic energy followed by concrete soil and macadam surfaces respectively a higher fluid kinetic energy implies a substantial force exerted by the water flows to mobilize the plastics this force in concert with other forces determine the plastics movement on a surface 3 6 2 flow rate variation the experiment was conducted under conditions of a smooth and steady flow of water with the flow rate increasing gradually to avoid any surges however the observations drawn from this setup may not entirely capture the dynamics when the flow rate changed rapidly for example we observed that some plastics immobile under steady high tfrs could be mobilized by lower but quickly changing tfrs this phenomenon may be attributed to an abrupt rise in water energy during a surge li et al 2018 therefore further investigation examining the impact of flow surges on plastic migration is needed 3 6 3 comparison with the movement of natural particles plastic particles differ greatly from natural particles in multiple aspects leading to distinct migration behaviors under water flow the lower density of plastics reduces the friction with the underlying surface and enables those with less than water density to float and migrate with relative ease on the other hand the used plastic particles are larger than natural particles in size requiring more kinetic energy to move and increasing the likelihood of obstruction the high specific surface area of plastic particles also makes them more susceptible to shear forces exerted by the water flow moreover due to the soft properties plastic film can often escape entrapment through deformation the soil movement requires overcoming the bonding forces between soil particles by gaining kinetic energy from water flow liu et al 2006 tritthart et al 2012 yan et al 2011a the maximum erosion of the soil surface occurs at an incline angle of 25 and gradually decreases beyond this angle due to the decreasing parting force of the water flow perpendicular to the surface which makes it difficult to strip soil particles asadi et al 2007 zheng et al 2015 film plastics also adhere to flat soil surfaces and exhibit a similar movement pattern with erosion in contrast gravel movement under water flow does not necessitate overcoming soil adhesion and it only requires surmounting friction and gravity li et al 2008 yan et al 2011b yu et al 2017 likewise plastic migration on rough surfaces only needs to surmount friction and gravity as such the movement patterns of plastic on a rough surface is similar to that of gravel the movement of plastic fragments on the macadam surface involves a rolling process facilitated by water flow similar to the saltation load observed on riverbed leapfrogging as opposed to pushing requires greater kinetic energy bai et al 2012 guo et al 2022 in contrast when film plastic is transported on macadam it tumbles irregularly due to its anisotropic morphology resulting in constantly changing direction and magnitude of force by water flow sediment on the other hand has a relatively homogeneous force due to its low anisotropic morphology chen and cao 2003 her and heatwole 2016 knack and shen 2018 given the large proportion of film and fiber within environmental plastic transport of plastics cannot be modeled as reliably as soil and gravel 4 conclusion this study investigated the migration of plastics on different surfaces under the action of overland flow the mobility of plastics varied remarkably across different surfaces under the action of water flow plastics move more easily on smooth surfaces than other surfaces in general smaller size larger tilt angle and higher water flow rate facilitate the movement of plastics fragments are difficult to move on rougher surface while fibrous plastics are easy to move under all conditions due to their relative larger force area furthermore plastics with a density higher than water require more energy to migrate this study illustrates the threshold conditions for plastic movement under the action of overland flow which improves our understanding on the migration behavior of plastics on terrestrial surface and provides valuable information for the development of strategies to control the migration of plastic pollution credit authorship contribution statement naipeng han

anaerobic ammonium oxidation dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and nitrous oxide release rates following exposure to the frequently detected sulfonamides sulfamethoxazole smx and its human metabolite n acetylsulfamethoxazole n smx were investigated in lab scale cws over a period of 190 d the denitrification rates were noticeably inhibited in the smx and n smx groups at week 5 subsequently the denitrification rates recovered accompanied by an increase in the relevant nitrogen reduction and antibiotic resistance genes args the composition of the microbial community also changed during this process after the denitrification rates recovered burkholderia paraburkholderia and gordonia exhibited a significant positive correlation with smx exposure which simultaneously reduced nitrate concentrations and degraded antibiotics burkholderia paraburkholderia is a key carrier of args finally nitrogen reduction 90 and antibiotic removal 80 also recovered in both smx and n smx exposed lab scale cws during the operation which revealed the interaction of smx or n smx removal and nitrogen reduction graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords constructed wetland nitrogen reduction sulfamethoxazole removal n acetylsulfamethoxazole removal microbial community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotics have been widely used to improve human and animal health since the 1930s zhang et al 2015 various antibiotics consumed by humans and animals have been detected in the natural aquatic environments due to the discharge of effluents and sludge from domestic wastewater treatment plants hospitals and livestock farms hirsch et al 1999 the adverse effects of frequently used antibiotics on human health potable water supply and bacterial resistance have attracted increased attention from the public and researchers watkinson et al 2007 china is the largest producer and consumer of antibiotics worldwide therefore antibiotics and their residues are relatively abundant in the country s aquatic ecosystems zhang et al 2015 zhou et al 2013 both parent compounds and bioactive metabolites can suppress microbial activity in aquatic ecosystems even in low concentrations ng l 1 μg l 1 of antibiotics maculewicz et al 2022 although environmental heterogeneity could influence the response patterns of microbially processes to antibiotics guan et al 2022 additionally antibiotic resistance genes args develop and disseminate rapidly with antibiotics contamination boger et al 2021 zhu et al 2017 furthermore reactive nitrogen and antibiotics are frequently degraded in the aquatic environment the eutrophication acidification and n2o emissions caused by increasing nitrate pollution are notable problems in ecosystems worldwide galloway 2008 yu et al 2019 the dominant nitrate reduction processes in aquatic environments include denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra gao et al 2021 the emission of n2o during denitrification has a substantial impact on the greenhouse effect even in small amounts canfield et al 2010 kraft et al 2014 these microbially mediated nitrogen reduction processes depended on the expression of nitrogen reduction genes that determine nitrogen loading into aquatic environments kuypers et al 2018 in recent decades constructed wetlands cws have been considered as a reasonable and promising process for treating wastewater as they are eco friendly cost effective and easy to operate afzal et al 2019 cws are designed to use and repeat the physical chemical and biological processes such as filtration adsorption and biodegradation that occur in natural wetlands huang et al 2017a and cws can operate in a more controlled environment and have been widely applied as an effective complementary technology to traditional sewage systems li et al 2017 shehzadi et al 2014 denitrification mainly accounted for more than 60 removal of tn in cws maltais landry et al 2009 and a study has revealed the quantitative response relationships between nitrogen functional genes and nitrogen conversion rates in cws zhi and ji 2014 therefore many researchers have focused on the nitrogen reduction processes in cws after they have been developed to treat various types of waste water delgado et al 2020 rampuria et al 2020 yi et al 2017 ubiquitous antibiotics and their human metabolites pose a major risk to aquatic organisms li et al 2021b consequently reactive nitrogen conversion mediated by biological actions can be sensitive to high concentrations of antibiotics in cws such as 25 μg l 1 and up to 434 μg l 1 li et al 2017 yi et al 2017 researchers have confirmed that antibiotics at environmental concentration level can affect n reduction processes guan et al 2022 hu et al 2020 there were studies which explored antibiotic removal in up flow microbial fuel cell constructed wetland li et al 2019 and nitrogen removal under different c n ratios or flow types li et al 2019 liu et al 2013b zeng et al 2020 however there is still a lack of research on simultaneous nitrogen reduction and antibiotics removal in cws and a study on denitrifying bacteria loading args in wastewater treatment plants yuan et al 2021 inspired us to explore nitrogen reduction processes in cws under the influence of antibiotics and to reveal the relationship between nitrogen reduction function genes and args lab scale cws can achieve water purification using smaller units and facilitate the study of their mechanisms li et al 2019 therefore we built four groups of lab scale cws each with two parallel devices wang et al 2021 we focused on sulfamethoxazole smx and its human metabolized product n acetylsulfamethoxazole n smx which are frequently detected in municipal sewage sludge a et al 2020 geng et al 2016 meffe et al 2021 smx is the most commonly used sulfonamide antibiotic zhu et al 2020 and n smx has been detected at even higher concentrations than smx maculewicz et al 2022 we separately investigated how the individual exposure as well as the co exposure of smx and n smx affect nitrogen reduction and n2o emission rates in lab scale cws we also examined changes in representative microbial communities args and nitrogen reduction genes to elucidate how smx and n smx remove and influence microbe mediated nitrogen reduction in lab scale cws 2 materials and methods 2 1 lab scale setups of cws four types of inflow conditions were maintained in four pairs of cws all of which were of the vertical subsurface downflow type xie et al 2018 each pair of cws was in duplicate the first pair of cws were not treated with antibiotics the second pair was exposed to 100 μg l 1 smx the third pair was exposed to 100 μg l 1 n smx and the fourth pair was exposed to 100 μg l 1 smx and 100 μg l 1 n smx all eight cws were planted with phragmites more information on the cws is provided in text s1 and fig s1 inflow and outflow water samples were collected every 3 d from the inflow tanks and outlets of the cw setups they were separately saved in 50 ml centrifuge tubes and stored at 4 substrate samples were collected on days 0 7 34 65 100 150 and 190 and sampling sites were selected uniformly in the sandy soil one group of substrate samples was stored at 20 for physiochemical analysis while the other group was stored at 80 for molecular analysis 2 2 physicochemical analysis in the overlying water of the cw setups the dissolved oxygen do and temperature t were measured in situ using a portable do meter hach drb 200 usa during every period and ph was measured using a ph meter thermo orion usa fig s2 additionally the water samples of inflow and outflow were filtered by 0 45 μm pore millipore express polyethersulfone syringe filters merck millipore ltd germany the chemical oxygen demand cod and nh4 n concentrations in the filtered water samples were analyzed using a spectrophotometer hach dr 3900 usa and an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer hitachi u 3900 japan respectively while the smx and n smx concentrations in filtered water samples were measured via ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms shimadzu lcms 8050 japan after diluting to 80 with methanol the recovery rates of the quality control samples ranged from 95 to 120 more information on physicochemical characteristics and smx n smx measurement is provided in text s2 3 in the substrate samples the 2 m kcl solution was added at a solid water ratio of 1 5 and then the resulting mixture was rotated for 1 h to completely extract nh4 n no2 n and no3 n the concentrations of which were determined by nessler s reagent spectrophotometry n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine spectrophotometry and ultraviolet spectrophotometry respectively 2 3 measurement of denitrification anammox and dnra rates the 15n tracer technique was used to determine the potential rates of the dominant nitrogen reduction processes after the substrate was incubated different 15n labeled solutions were used to measure the potential rates of denitrification and anammox processes more information on the incubations is provided in text s4 100 μl of 15nh4 15nh4 14no3 and 14nh4 15no3 solutions were injected into vials to obtain positive control negative control and treatment group respectively the concentration of 15n was 100 μm finally subsequently every vial was spiked with 200 μl of 7m zncl2 solution at 0 3 6 9 12 h after spiking with 15n to ensure that the reaction was terminated at least three vials were analyzed at each termination step guan et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 the sacrificed vials at each time point were purged with ar to degas the generated 29n2 and 30n2 after testing denitrification and anammox rates and then injected with nabro and rotated for at least 12 h to completely convert produced 15nh4 to 30n2 to determine dnra potential rates guan et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 isotope ratio mass spectrometry mat253 plus and gasbench ⅱ thermo fisher scientific bremen germany was used to analyze the generated 29n2 and 30n2 the differences in produced 15n n2 at each time point were quantified to calculate the denitrification anammox and dnra potential rates fig s3 2 4 measurement of n2o release rates unlabeled n compound substrates were used to measure the n2o release rate after substrate incubations the headspace equilibrium technique was used to measure the dissolved n2o guan et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 at least three vials were analyzed at each time point a headspace was created by injecting 6 ml of ultrapure ar into the vials subsequently the vials were rotated vigorously for more than 1 h to ensure the complete escape of n2o from the mixture n2o was detected using gas chromatography agilent 7890a usa and the release rates of n2o were calculated based on the bunsen solubility coefficient guan et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 2 5 quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and sequencing analysis the major functional genes for the nitrogen reduction processes narg nirs nosz and hzsb and sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2 of the substrate samples were quantified using real time qpcr assays majorbio company shanghai china in triplicate table s1 the correlation coefficients r2 of the standard curves were all 0 99

version 1 9 1 was used to quality filter demultiplexed raw fastq files metagenomic sequencing of selected substrate samples in the smx n smx and smx mixed n smx exposure groups was also performed on an illumina miseq platform majorbio company the number prjna961325 gives access to raw data deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive database 2 6 statistical analysis the data in the study are shown as the mean standard deviation statistically significant differences p 0 05 were identified using spss ibm 28 0 the relative abundance of the microbial community at the phylum or genus level was statistically analyzed using one way analysis of variance anova r 3 3 1 pearson correlation analysis origin 2022b was used to report the correlation between the denitrification anammox dnra and n2o release rates and the abundances of relevant nitrogen reduction genes 3 results 3 1 both smx and n smx exposure caused short term inhibition of nitrogen reduction over the 190 day period denitrification rates first decreased and then increased fig s4a at 5 weeks 34 d the denitrification rate of the blank group first returned to normal levels and those of the other three groups with antibiotic exposure were very low this indicates that after the system stably adapted to hydraulic disturbances both smx and n smx exposure significantly inhibited denitrification on day 34 fig 2a the anammox rates of the antibiotic exposed groups increased when their denitrification rates were significantly inhibited on day 34 fig 2b moreover the anammox rate in the blank group decreased to undetectable level due to the denitrification rate recovered to a high level 11 18 nmol n g 1 h 1 additionally the change in dnra rates which first decreased and then increased was similar to that of the denitrification rates fig s4 on day 34 the dnra rates in the antibiotic exposed groups were lower than those in the blank group fig 2c regarding the response of the n2o release rates the more thorough the denitrification proceed the more the n2o release was inhibited the initial n2o release rate was 0 01246 nmol g 1 h 1 0 week the n2o release rate in the blank group at week 5 decreased because of stronger denitrification than that at the initial stage the release rate of n2o in the other three groups with smx or n smx exposure also decreased possibly because of increased anammox compare to that at the initial stage however their denitrification rates were inhibited compared to those in the blank group accounting for the higher risk of n2o release than that in the blank group fig 2d anammox on day 34 in the smx n smx exposure groups more predominated in nitrogen reduction process than that in the blank group as denitrification and dnra processes were inhibited fig s5 the relative contributions of both denitrification and dnra were low on day 34 because of the adverse effects of smx or n smx exposure relevant microbial information confirmed the results of nitrogen reduction rates on day 34 the abundances of narg r 0 967 p 0 033 nirs r 0 981 p 0 019 and nosz r 0 977 p 0 023 in the blank smx exposure n smx exposure and smx mixed n smx exposure groups were positively correlated with the potential denitrification rates on day 34 similarly the dnra rates and the abundances of gene narg r 0 864 p 0 136 were consistent among the four groups on day 34 these results confirmed that smx and n smx inhibited microbial activity as a result of which denitrification and dnra rates were very low on day 34 copies of hzsb showed no significant positive correlation with the anammox rate r 0 330 p 0 670 on day 34 possibly because of the low abundance of hzsb n2o release rates were negatively correlated with the abundances of gene nirs r 0 956 p 0 044 and nosz r 0 960 p 0 040 in the blank smx exposure n smx exposure and smx mixed n smx exposure groups on day 34 fig 2e f g h the ratios of nirs nosz also showed a significantly negative correlation with n2o release rates r 0 905 p 0 095 table s2 3 3 2 nitrogen reduction gradually recovered with long term smx or n smx exposure at week 9 65 d the denitrification rates of the three groups exposed to smx or n smx recovered to a level as high as that in the blank group up to day 190 the four groups showed high denitrification rates of 15 20 nmol n g 1 h 1 fig 3a with the exception of the significant inhibition of denitrification rates at week 5 no significant regularity was observed in the inhibition or stimulation of the smx or n smx exposure groups compared to the blank group at each time point the results showed that the antibiotics first inhibited the denitrification rates in the short term and then the denitrification rates recovered to a normal level as that in non antibiotics exposure group and played an important role in nitrogen reduction ward et al 2009 after 5 weeks the denitrification rates recovered and remained high therefore anammox rates were not detected in all four groups tan et al 2020 fig 3b the dnra rates in the antibiotic exposed groups also returned to similar levels as those in the blank group on day 65 fig 3c however on day 150 the dnra rate in each group decreased which may have been due to a decrease in temperature fig s2a as the optimum temperature for dnra is higher than that for denitrification the dnra rates increased again on day 190 because the temperature increased later the n2o release showed a decreasing trend over 190 d fig s6 after 5 weeks n2o release rates decreased continuously and showed fairly negative values because of prominent denitrification activities indicating that n2o emissions were inhibited by complete denitrification fig 3d therefore the dominant pathway among the three nitrogen reduction processes was denitrification both in the blank group as well as in the smx and n smx exposure groups which contributed to 84 50 98 17 of nitrate reduction after 5 weeks text s5 the relative contribution of dnra showed a competitive relationship with denitrification after 5 weeks which was shown in fig s5 when the relative contribution of denitrification slightly decreased the relative contribution of dnra increased this can be explained by the fact that nitrate reduction occurs in both denitrification and dnra however different products are produced denitrification could be better at reducing nitrate than dnra and is superior when nitrate concentrations are sufficient ward et al 2009 the relative contribution of denitrification in the n smx exposure group was similar to that in the smx exposure group fig s5 the abundances of narg nirs and nosz in the smx exposure n smx exposure and smx mixed n smx groups recovered to similar gene abundances as those in the blank group on day 65 and peaked on day 100 however the abundances of narg nirs and nosz in the four groups on day 190 returned to their initial levels on day 0 fig s7 these trends were similar to that of 16s rrna abundance fig s8 comparison of the changing trend of gene abundance with the denitrification rate implied that the denitrification activities of microorganisms recovered on day 65 after being affected by antibiotics on day 34 when the denitrification rate remained fairly high after 100 d the abundances of narg nirs and nosz decreased to a level similar to that of the samples on 0 day and the normalized results also confirmed the abundances of gene nirs were inhibited at week 5 in smx n smx exposure groups and the abundances of gene nosz remained high after week 5 in smx n smx exposure groups fig s9 it was inferred that the microbes were resilient to adverse effects after prolonged antibiotic exposure with gene abundance returning to normal levels under unstimulated conditions moreover the copies of hzsb which ranged from 446 69 54 73 to 215 34 24 44 102 copies g 1 were rather low accounting for the low potential anammox rates in all groups in 190 d among the detected functional genes dominating the nitrogen reduction processes the abundance of the gene nosz 107 copies g 1 peaked at 190 d indicating thorough denitrification and weak n2o emissions fig 3e f g h the ratio of nirs nosz 1 showed that n2o production was continuously inhibited after 34 d fig s10 3 3 microbial community shifts under smx or n smx exposure significant changes in sul1 and sul2 copy numbers were observed after 190 d of antibiotic exposure on day 34 sul1 and sul2 were more abundant in the samples than those on day 0 up to 100 d sul1 and sul2 copy numbers gradually increased to the highest level 108 copies g 1 in the smx and smx mixed n smx exposure groups sul1 and sul2 copy numbers were lower in the n smx exposure group than those in the smx containing group indicating that smx was more likely to induce args than n smx the exposure of smx led to increased abundances of sul1 and sul2 that dominated in smx mixed n smx co exposure fig s11 12 more information about the relation between increased abundances of sul1 and sul2 in smx n smx and smx mixed n smx exposure group were shown in text s6 and fig s13 additionally 16s rrna high throughput sequencing analysis from substrate samples in the four groups also showed variable microbial communities at different times in the initial substrate samples week 0 of the four groups actinobacteriota 32 53 38 46 and proteobacteria 32 12 35 15 were the most predominant phyla when no antibiotics were present after smx or n smx exposure actinobacteriota 23 72 50 52 and proteobacteria 20 31 43 84 remained the dominant phyla although the relative abundance of saccharibacteria 7 64 21 87 increased and that of acidobacteria 1 54 4 16 decreased fig s14a both actinobacteriota and proteobacteria are known to mineralize complex organics wirth et al 2021 xiong et al 2019 previous studies have reported that saccharibacteria play important roles in denitrification albertsen et al 2013 kindaichi et al 2016 bacterial compositions at the genus level were also analyzed to provide detailed information on the microbial community response to smx or n smx fig s14b there was an evolution of dominant denitrifying bacterial genera such as thauera dechloromonas and burkholderials over 190 d as shown in the genus abundance heatmap fig 4a combined with network analysis changes in microbial composition and functional correlation were also discussed before and after nitrogen reduction was inhibited week 5 the network consisted of the detected genes and relevant genera at week 0 the dominant denitrifying genera were pseudarthrobacter and pseudomonas bonin et al 1989 gamble et al 1977 pseudomonas has been found to have anammox capacity simultaneously as an aerobic denitrifying bacterium gamble et al 1977 which confirmed that denitrification and anammox activities exist simultaneously under incomplete anaerobic conditions in cws at startup however relative abundances of pseudarthrobacter and pseudomonas gradually decreased until week 5 the relative abundances of one type of saccharibacteria norank p saccharibacteria nakamurella thauera and dechloromonas increased saccharibacteria not only plays a crucial role in denitrification but also degrades c6h12o6 wang et al 2019 thauera is reported as a genus in which nitrogen reduction genes such as nirs and nosz have been detected liu et al 2013a and thauera can be enriched under anaerobic conditions yang et al 2019 dechloromonas is also an important anaerobic denitrifying bacterial genus singleton et al 2021 thauera and dechloromonas belong to the phylum proteobacteria which are potential hosts of args huang et al 2017b tables s4 5 nakamurella belongs to the phylum actinobacteriota and its abundance gradually increased especially in the smx and n smx exposure groups it is a dominant nitrifying genus that is beneficial in c6h12o6 metabolism feng et al 2020 the network before week 5 contained 27 nodes and 124 edges norank p saccharibacteria nakamurella thauera and dechloromonas were positively correlated with nirs furthermore the correlation between sul1 sul2 and nirs nosz fig 4b indicated that the microbial community could restore nitrogen reduction even though nitrogen reduction was inhibited at week 5 after week 5 the network had 27 nodes and 100 edges the associations between genera decreased slightly in the network after week 5 compared to those before week 5 gordonia and burkholderia paraburkholderia became the new and important nodes fig 4c gordonia is a nitrate reducing bacterial genus that can degrade organic pollutants such as antibiotics fidelis silva et al 2019 and showed a significant positive correlation with the smx contained exposure group at week 27 fig 4a other bacterial genera that can metabolize organic pollutants such as burkholderia paraburkholderia increased in the smx exposed groups han et al 2022 fig 4a it has been reported that it is a key carrier of args and is easily enriched under antibiotic stress conditions cao et al 2021 burkholderials has also been previously identified as keystone denitrifying bacteria in lakes zhou et al 2020 besides candidatus planktophila belongs to the characteristic functional genus of anammox bacteria li et al 2021a and was detected as a rare species in the system more information on microorganisms is provided in text s7 8 and fig s15 20 3 4 nitrogen and smx or n smx removal in water and substrate the removal of cod and nh4 n smx or n smx from the water in every group during 190 d was calculated every 3 d fig 5 in general although each group could stably reduce the cod the nh4 n removal fluctuated compared to the stable removal of nh4 n in the blank group the removal of nh4 n in the smx n smx and smx mixed n smx exposure groups repeatedly decreased and recovered at approximately 34 d 5 weeks a noticeable decrease in nh4 n removal was observed corresponding to the inhibition of nitrogen reduction in the three antibiotic exposure groups respectively after 100 d 14 weeks nh4 n removal in the antibiotic exposed groups gradually recovered to nearly 100 the removal of n smx reached nearly 100 more quickly and was significantly higher than that of smx not only in the smx mixed n smx co exposure group but also in the smx or n smx single exposure groups although the fluctuations in smx removal were higher than those in n smx removal both smx and n smx removals exhibited a decrease and subsequently recovered smx removal gradually recovered to more than 80 after 100 d the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in each substrate sample were measured to verify the presence of nitrogen in the pilot cws fig s21 the nh4 n concentration was always low indicating that nitrification was thorough consistent with the results of continuous removal of nh4 n in water the no3 n concentration showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing and the no3 n in the substrate decreased to a low level at the end of the experiment this indicates that nitrification and denitrification occurred simultaneously and that the denitrification process could offset the no3 n produced and accumulated by nitrification the no2 n concentrations at week 5 were higher than those later because denitrification was inhibited at this time subsequently no2 n was consumed and the concentration decreased to a low level in week 27 and the concentrations of smx and n smx in substrate which were used to test potential rates of denitrification anammox dnra and n2o release were all less than 0 006 μg g 1 fig s22 according to the load calculation we could estimate that the mass of smx and n smx in the substrate accounted for less than 0 5 of the total influent load during 190 d 4 discussion 4 1 interactions between microbial mediated nitrogen reduction and smx or n smx removal microbe mediated nitrogen transformation poses a considerable risk because of the presence of antibiotics in wetland environments guan et al 2022 matiatos et al 2021 four groups of lab scale cws were built and showed changes in nitrogen reduction processes including denitrification anammox dnra and n2o release following 190 day exposure to smx or n smx the results revealed that both smx and n smx inhibited denitrification within a short period of exposure 34 days but the rate of denitrification rate recovered after 34 days the differences in the smx n smx and smx mixed n smx exposure groups were related to the characteristics of smx and n smx n smx retains its core sulfanilamide group and is a representative human metabolite it has been reported that n smx could possibly be transformed back to smx during water treatment or in the water sediment system maculewicz et al 2022 smx is poorly adsorbed and polar in nature therefore microbial activities dominate the removal of smx a et al 2020 the soil adsorption coefficient koc of n smx was 238 l kg significantly higher than that of smx 91 6 l kg n smx could still inhibit microbial activities similar to smx within a short exposure period 34 d however n smx was easier to be removed by adsorption than smx resulting in a lower abundance of args gordonia and paraburkholderia in the n smx exposed group fig s14 confirming the results presented in fig 4a therefore smx plays a dominant role in the smx mixed n smx exposure group additionally as sulfonamide antibiotics have a small transfer to the plant geng et al 2016 we mainly focused on smx n smx concentration in the water and substrate fig 5c d fig s22 when a certain amount of carbon source and antibiotics was added continuously during the 190 day period nitrogen reduction rate changes were found to be related to antibiotic degradation as the denitrification rates and the abundance of 16s gene in smx or n smx exposure groups were significantly inhibited in week 5 35 days the removal of nh4 n and smx or n smx dropped to a low level in contrast the removal rate of nh4 n in the blank group was higher and remained stable throughout the period corresponding to an unaffected denitrification process without antibiotic exposure this interactive relationship can indicate that the exposure of antibiotics and their metabolites like smx and n smx in a period could stress the nitrogen reduction processes in cws and possibly lead to or aggravate water eutrophication it can also improve our understanding on how the nitrogen reduction potential in cws responds to the cumulative effects of smx n smx exposure such as the generation of antibiotic resistance moreover we explored different functional microorganisms related to the nitrogen reduction which also play a role in the degradation of smx n smx so as to realize the simultaneous removal of antibiotics and nitrogen reduction in cws it enhanced our understanding of how cws cope with the risks of nitrogen enrichment and antibiotic exposure at the same time 4 2 proposed mechanisms of nitrogen reduction under smx or n smx exposure in cws after 5 weeks nh4 n removal in the smx or n smx exposure groups recovered gradually after their denitrification rates first recovered and the copies of the nitrogen reduction genes sul1 and sul2 increased significantly after 14 weeks nh4 n and smx removal increased to a level comparable to that of the blank group and remained stable the recovery of nitrogen and antibiotics removal lagged behind the recovery of denitrification rates and functional gene abundance this indicated that antibiotic exposed groups gradually achieved antibiotic resistance and recovery potential under exposure to 100 μg l 1 levels of smx and n smx the pilot scale cws took approximately 100 d to fully recover the antibiotic resistance and recovery potential of cws were reflected in the microbial community which evolved to remove nitrogen and antibiotics simultaneously the functional bacteria for nitrogen reduction were significantly associated with the smx n smx exposure group such as burkholderia paraburkholderia and gordonia which can also degrade organic pollutants fidelis et al 2019 han et al 2022 fig 4a additionally burkholderia paraburkholderia is a key carrier of args cao et al 2021 both nitrogen reduction genes and sulfonamide args were detected in proteobacteria tables s4 5 it is important to further explore specific co hosts for nitrogen reduction genes and args the evolution of the microbial communities also showed an interaction between nitrogen reduction and antibiotic degradation however the environmental health risks caused by increased args remain an issue that needs to be explored fig 6 5 conclusions in conclusion this study demonstrated the interaction between nitrogen reduction and smx or n smx removal in lab scale cws we investigated how denitrification anammox dnra and n2o release rates responded to smx and n smx exposure over 190 d denitrification and dnra rates were significantly inhibited by smx or n smx within a short period 35 d and gradually recovered when the denitrification rates returned to high levels after 35 d n2o release was significantly reduced the abundance of the relevant functional genes involved in nitrogen transformation confirmed these results anammox related bacteria were less abundant therefore the change was not significant the composition of microbial communities changed over a long period under smx or n smx exposure genera that can both denitrify and degrade antibiotics such as burkholderia paraburkholderia were more positively correlated with gradual smx exposure after 35 d and are key carriers of args after the denitrification rates recovered after 35 d in smx or n smx exposure groups the removal of nitrogen smx and n smx in the water and substrate also gradually recovered and reached a high level thus the present study revealed the interactions between smx n smx removal and nitrogen reduction including the response of nitrogen reduction potential to smx n smx exposure as well as the removal of both nitrogen and smx n smx in cws author statement we declare that we do not have any commercial or associative interest that represents a conflict of interest in connection with the work submitted

anaerobic ammonium oxidation dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and nitrous oxide release rates following exposure to the frequently detected sulfonamides sulfamethoxazole smx and its human metabolite n acetylsulfamethoxazole n smx were investigated in lab scale cws over a period of 190 d the denitrification rates were noticeably inhibited in the smx and n smx groups at week 5 subsequently the denitrification rates recovered accompanied by an increase in the relevant nitrogen reduction and antibiotic resistance genes args the composition of the microbial community also changed during this process after the denitrification rates recovered burkholderia paraburkholderia and gordonia exhibited a significant positive correlation with smx exposure which simultaneously reduced nitrate concentrations and degraded antibiotics burkholderia paraburkholderia is a key carrier of args finally nitrogen reduction 90 and antibiotic removal 80 also recovered in both smx and n smx exposed lab scale cws during the operation which revealed the interaction of smx or n smx removal and nitrogen reduction graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords constructed wetland nitrogen reduction sulfamethoxazole removal n acetylsulfamethoxazole removal microbial community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotics have been widely used to improve human and animal health since the 1930s zhang et al 2015 various antibiotics consumed by humans and animals have been detected in the natural aquatic environments due to the discharge of effluents and sludge from domestic wastewater treatment plants hospitals and livestock farms hirsch et al 1999 the adverse effects of frequently used antibiotics on human health potable water supply and bacterial resistance have attracted increased attention from the public and researchers watkinson et al 2007 china is the largest producer and consumer of antibiotics worldwide therefore antibiotics and their residues are relatively abundant in the country s aquatic ecosystems zhang et al 2015 zhou et al 2013 both parent compounds and bioactive metabolites can suppress microbial activity in aquatic ecosystems even in low concentrations ng l 1 μg l 1 of antibiotics maculewicz et al 2022 although environmental heterogeneity could influence the response patterns of microbially processes to antibiotics guan et al 2022 additionally antibiotic resistance genes args develop and disseminate rapidly with antibiotics contamination boger et al 2021 zhu et al 2017 furthermore reactive nitrogen and antibiotics are frequently degraded in the aquatic environment the eutrophication acidification and n2o emissions caused by increasing nitrate pollution are notable problems in ecosystems worldwide galloway 2008 yu et al 2019 the dominant nitrate reduction processes in aquatic environments include denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra gao et al 2021 the emission of n2o during denitrification has a substantial impact on the greenhouse effect even in small amounts canfield et al 2010 kraft et al 2014 these microbially mediated nitrogen reduction processes depended on the expression of nitrogen reduction genes that determine nitrogen loading into aquatic environments kuypers et al 2018 in recent decades constructed wetlands cws have been considered as a reasonable and promising process for treating wastewater as they are eco friendly cost effective and easy to operate afzal et al 2019 cws are designed to use and repeat the physical chemical and biological processes such as filtration adsorption and biodegradation that occur in natural wetlands huang et al 2017a and cws can operate in a more controlled environment and have been widely applied as an effective complementary technology to traditional sewage systems li et al 2017 shehzadi et al 2014 denitrification mainly accounted for more than 60 removal of tn in cws maltais landry et al 2009 and a study has revealed the quantitative response relationships between nitrogen functional genes and nitrogen conversion rates in cws zhi and ji 2014 therefore many researchers have focused on the nitrogen reduction processes in cws after they have been developed to treat various types of waste water delgado et al 2020 rampuria et al 2020 yi et al 2017 ubiquitous antibiotics and their human metabolites pose a major risk to aquatic organisms li et al 2021b consequently reactive nitrogen conversion mediated by biological actions can be sensitive to high concentrations of antibiotics in cws such as 25 μg l 1 and up to 434 μg l 1 li et al 2017 yi et al 2017 researchers have confirmed that antibiotics at environmental concentration level can affect n reduction processes guan et al 2022 hu et al 2020 there were studies which explored antibiotic removal in up flow microbial fuel cell constructed wetland li et al 2019 and nitrogen removal under different c n ratios or flow types li et al 2019 liu et al 2013b zeng et al 2020 however there is still a lack of research on simultaneous nitrogen reduction and antibiotics removal in cws and a study on denitrifying bacteria loading args in wastewater treatment plants yuan et al 2021 inspired us to explore nitrogen reduction processes in cws under the influence of antibiotics and to reveal the relationship between nitrogen reduction function genes and args lab scale cws can achieve water purification using smaller units and facilitate the study of their mechanisms li et al 2019 therefore we built four groups of lab scale cws each with two parallel devices wang et al 2021 we focused on sulfamethoxazole smx and its human metabolized product n acetylsulfamethoxazole n smx which are frequently detected in municipal sewage sludge a et al 2020 geng et al 2016 meffe et al 2021 smx is the most commonly used sulfonamide antibiotic zhu et al 2020 and n smx has been detected at even higher concentrations than smx maculewicz et al 2022 we separately investigated how the individual exposure as well as the co exposure of smx and n smx affect nitrogen reduction and n2o emission rates in lab scale cws we also examined changes in representative microbial communities args and nitrogen reduction genes to elucidate how smx and n smx remove and influence microbe mediated nitrogen reduction in lab scale cws 2 materials and methods 2 1 lab scale setups of cws four types of inflow conditions were maintained in four pairs of cws all of which were of the vertical subsurface downflow type xie et al 2018 each pair of cws was in duplicate the first pair of cws were not treated with antibiotics the second pair was exposed to 100 μg l 1 smx the third pair was exposed to 100 μg l 1 n smx and the fourth pair was exposed to 100 μg l 1 smx and 100 μg l 1 n smx all eight cws were planted with phragmites more information on the cws is provided in text s1 and fig s1 inflow and outflow water samples were collected every 3 d from the inflow tanks and outlets of the cw setups they were separately saved in 50 ml centrifuge tubes and stored at 4 substrate samples were collected on days 0 7 34 65 100 150 and 190 and sampling sites were selected uniformly in the sandy soil one group of substrate samples was stored at 20 for physiochemical analysis while the other group was stored at 80 for molecular analysis 2 2 physicochemical analysis in the overlying water of the cw setups the dissolved oxygen do and temperature t were measured in situ using a portable do meter hach drb 200 usa during every period and ph was measured using a ph meter thermo orion usa fig s2 additionally the water samples of inflow and outflow were filtered by 0 45 μm pore millipore express polyethersulfone syringe filters merck millipore ltd germany the chemical oxygen demand cod and nh4 n concentrations in the filtered water samples were analyzed using a spectrophotometer hach dr 3900 usa and an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer hitachi u 3900 japan respectively while the smx and n smx concentrations in filtered water samples were measured via ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms shimadzu lcms 8050 japan after diluting to 80 with methanol the recovery rates of the quality control samples ranged from 95 to 120 more information on physicochemical characteristics and smx n smx measurement is provided in text s2 3 in the substrate samples the 2 m kcl solution was added at a solid water ratio of 1 5 and then the resulting mixture was rotated for 1 h to completely extract nh4 n no2 n and no3 n the concentrations of which were determined by nessler s reagent spectrophotometry n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine spectrophotometry and ultraviolet spectrophotometry respectively 2 3 measurement of denitrification anammox and dnra rates the 15n tracer technique was used to determine the potential rates of the dominant nitrogen reduction processes after the substrate was incubated different 15n labeled solutions were used to measure the potential rates of denitrification and anammox processes more information on the incubations is provided in text s4 100 μl of 15nh4 15nh4 14no3 and 14nh4 15no3 solutions were injected into vials to obtain positive control negative control and treatment group respectively the concentration of 15n was 100 μm finally subsequently every vial was spiked with 200 μl of 7m zncl2 solution at 0 3 6 9 12 h after spiking with 15n to ensure that the reaction was terminated at least three vials were analyzed at each termination step guan et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 the sacrificed vials at each time point were purged with ar to degas the generated 29n2 and 30n2 after testing denitrification and anammox rates and then injected with nabro and rotated for at least 12 h to completely convert produced 15nh4 to 30n2 to determine dnra potential rates guan et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 isotope ratio mass spectrometry mat253 plus and gasbench ⅱ thermo fisher scientific bremen germany was used to analyze the generated 29n2 and 30n2 the differences in produced 15n n2 at each time point were quantified to calculate the denitrification anammox and dnra potential rates fig s3 2 4 measurement of n2o release rates unlabeled n compound substrates were used to measure the n2o release rate after substrate incubations the headspace equilibrium technique was used to measure the dissolved n2o guan et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 at least three vials were analyzed at each time point a headspace was created by injecting 6 ml of ultrapure ar into the vials subsequently the vials were rotated vigorously for more than 1 h to ensure the complete escape of n2o from the mixture n2o was detected using gas chromatography agilent 7890a usa and the release rates of n2o were calculated based on the bunsen solubility coefficient guan et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 2 5 quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and sequencing analysis the major functional genes for the nitrogen reduction processes narg nirs nosz and hzsb and sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2 of the substrate samples were quantified using real time qpcr assays majorbio company shanghai china in triplicate table s1 the correlation coefficients r2 of the standard curves were all 0 99 and the amplification coefficients ranged from 80 to 100 pe250 strategies paired end sequenced 250 2 were used in sequencing which was performed on an illumina miseq platform majorbio company qiime version 1 9 1 was used to quality filter demultiplexed raw fastq files metagenomic sequencing of selected substrate samples in the smx n smx and smx mixed n smx exposure groups was also performed on an illumina miseq platform majorbio company the number prjna961325 gives access to raw data deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive database 2 6 statistical analysis the data in the study are shown as the mean standard deviation statistically significant differences p 0 05 were identified using spss ibm 28 0 the relative abundance of the microbial community at the phylum or genus level was statistically analyzed using one way analysis of variance anova r 3 3 1 pearson correlation analysis origin 2022b was used to report the correlation between the denitrification anammox dnra and n2o release rates and the abundances of relevant nitrogen reduction genes 3 results 3 1 both smx and n smx exposure caused short term inhibition of nitrogen reduction over the 190 day period denitrification rates first decreased and then increased fig s4a at 5 weeks 34 d the denitrification rate of the blank group first returned to normal levels and those of the other three groups with antibiotic exposure were very low this indicates that after the system stably adapted to hydraulic disturbances both smx and n smx exposure significantly inhibited denitrification on day 34 fig 2a the anammox rates of the antibiotic exposed groups increased when their denitrification rates were significantly inhibited on day 34 fig 2b moreover the anammox rate in the blank group decreased to undetectable level due to the denitrification rate recovered to a high level 11 18 nmol n g 1 h 1 additionally the change in dnra rates which first decreased and then increased was similar to that of the denitrification rates fig s4 on day 34 the dnra rates in the antibiotic exposed groups were lower than those in the blank group fig 2c regarding the response of the n2o release rates the more thorough the denitrification proceed the more the n2o release was inhibited the initial n2o release rate was 0 01246 nmol g 1 h 1 0 week the n2o release rate in the blank group at week 5 decreased because of stronger denitrification than that at the initial stage the release rate of n2o in the other three groups with smx or n smx exposure also decreased possibly because of increased anammox compare to that at the initial stage however their denitrification rates were inhibited compared to those in the blank group accounting for the higher risk of n2o release than that in the blank group fig 2d anammox on day 34 in the smx n smx exposure groups more predominated in nitrogen reduction process than that in the blank group as denitrification and dnra processes were inhibited fig s5 the relative contributions of both denitrification and dnra were low on day 34 because of the adverse effects of smx or n smx exposure relevant microbial information confirmed the results of nitrogen reduction rates on day 34 the abundances of narg r 0 967 p 0 033 nirs r 0 981 p 0 019 and nosz r 0 977 p 0 023 in the blank smx exposure n smx exposure and smx mixed n smx exposure groups were positively correlated with the potential denitrification rates on day 34 similarly the dnra rates and the abundances of gene narg r 0 864 p 0 136 were consistent among the four groups on day 34 these results confirmed that smx and n smx inhibited microbial activity as a result of which denitrification and dnra rates were very low on day 34 copies of hzsb showed no significant positive correlation with the anammox rate r 0 330 p 0 670 on day 34 possibly because of the low abundance of hzsb n2o release rates were negatively correlated with the abundances of gene nirs r 0 956 p 0 044 and nosz r 0 960 p 0 040 in the blank smx exposure n smx exposure and smx mixed n smx exposure groups on day 34 fig 2e f g h the ratios of nirs nosz also showed a significantly negative correlation with n2o release rates r 0 905 p 0 095 table s2 3 3 2 nitrogen reduction gradually recovered with long term smx or n smx exposure at week 9 65 d the denitrification rates of the three groups exposed to smx or n smx recovered to a level as high as that in the blank group up to day 190 the four groups showed high denitrification rates of 15 20 nmol n g 1 h 1 fig 3a with the exception of the significant inhibition of denitrification rates at week 5 no significant regularity was observed in the inhibition or stimulation of the smx or n smx exposure groups compared to the blank group at each time point the results showed that the antibiotics first inhibited the denitrification rates in the short term and then the denitrification rates recovered to a normal level as that in non antibiotics exposure group and played an important role in nitrogen reduction ward et al 2009 after 5 weeks the denitrification rates recovered and remained high therefore anammox rates were not detected in all four groups tan et al 2020 fig 3b the dnra rates in the antibiotic exposed groups also returned to similar levels as those in the blank group on day 65 fig 3c however on day 150 the dnra rate in each group decreased which may have been due to a decrease in temperature fig s2a as the optimum temperature for dnra is higher than that for denitrification the dnra rates increased again on day 190 because the temperature increased later the n2o release showed a decreasing trend over 190 d fig s6 after 5 weeks n2o release rates decreased continuously and showed fairly negative values because of prominent denitrification activities indicating that n2o emissions were inhibited by complete denitrification fig 3d therefore the dominant pathway among the three nitrogen reduction processes was denitrification both in the blank group as well as in the smx and n smx exposure groups which contributed to 84 50 98 17 of nitrate reduction after 5 weeks text s5 the relative contribution of dnra showed a competitive relationship with denitrification after 5 weeks which was shown in fig s5 when the relative contribution of denitrification slightly decreased the relative contribution of dnra increased this can be explained by the fact that nitrate reduction occurs in both denitrification and dnra however different products are produced denitrification could be better at reducing nitrate than dnra and is superior when nitrate concentrations are sufficient ward et al 2009 the relative contribution of denitrification in the n smx exposure group was similar to that in the smx exposure group fig s5 the abundances of narg nirs and nosz in the smx exposure n smx exposure and smx mixed n smx groups recovered to similar gene abundances as those in the blank group on day 65 and peaked on day 100 however the abundances of narg nirs and nosz in the four groups on day 190 returned to their initial levels on day 0 fig s7 these trends were similar to that of 16s rrna abundance fig s8 comparison of the changing trend of gene abundance with the denitrification rate implied that the denitrification activities of microorganisms recovered on day 65 after being affected by antibiotics on day 34 when the denitrification rate remained fairly high after 100 d the abundances of narg nirs and nosz decreased to a level similar to that of the samples on 0 day and the normalized results also confirmed the abundances of gene nirs were inhibited at week 5 in smx n smx exposure groups and the abundances of gene nosz remained high after week 5 in smx n smx exposure groups fig s9 it was inferred that the microbes were resilient to adverse effects after prolonged antibiotic exposure with gene abundance returning to normal levels under unstimulated conditions moreover the copies of hzsb which ranged from 446 69 54 73 to 215 34 24 44 102 copies g 1 were rather low accounting for the low potential anammox rates in all groups in 190 d among the detected functional genes dominating the nitrogen reduction processes the abundance of the gene nosz 107 copies g 1 peaked at 190 d indicating thorough denitrification and weak n2o emissions fig 3e f g h the ratio of nirs nosz 1 showed that n2o production was continuously inhibited after 34 d fig s10 3 3 microbial community shifts under smx or n smx exposure significant changes in sul1 and sul2 copy numbers were observed after 190 d of antibiotic exposure on day 34 sul1 and sul2 were more abundant in the samples than those on day 0 up to 100 d sul1 and sul2 copy numbers gradually increased to the highest level 108 copies g 1 in the smx and smx mixed n smx exposure groups sul1 and sul2 copy numbers were lower in the n smx exposure group than those in the smx containing group indicating that smx was more likely to induce args than n smx the exposure of smx led to increased abundances of sul1 and sul2 that dominated in smx mixed n smx co exposure fig s11 12 more information about the relation between increased abundances of sul1 and sul2 in smx n smx and smx mixed n smx exposure group were shown in text s6 and fig s13 additionally 16s rrna high throughput sequencing analysis from substrate samples in the four groups also showed variable microbial communities at different times in the initial substrate samples week 0 of the four groups actinobacteriota 32 53 38 46 and proteobacteria 32 12 35 15 were the most predominant phyla when no antibiotics were present after smx or n smx exposure actinobacteriota 23 72 50 52 and proteobacteria 20 31 43 84 remained the dominant phyla although the relative abundance of saccharibacteria 7 64 21 87 increased and that of acidobacteria 1 54 4 16 decreased fig s14a both actinobacteriota and proteobacteria are known to mineralize complex organics wirth et al 2021 xiong et al 2019 previous studies have reported that saccharibacteria play important roles in denitrification albertsen et al 2013 kindaichi et al 2016 bacterial compositions at the genus level were also analyzed to provide detailed information on the microbial community response to smx or n smx fig s14b there was an evolution of dominant denitrifying bacterial genera such as thauera dechloromonas and burkholderials over 190 d as shown in the genus abundance heatmap fig 4a combined with network analysis changes in microbial composition and functional correlation were also discussed before and after nitrogen reduction was inhibited week 5 the network consisted of the detected genes and relevant genera at week 0 the dominant denitrifying genera were pseudarthrobacter and pseudomonas bonin et al 1989 gamble et al 1977 pseudomonas has been found to have anammox capacity simultaneously as an aerobic denitrifying bacterium gamble et al 1977 which confirmed that denitrification and anammox activities exist simultaneously under incomplete anaerobic conditions in cws at startup however relative abundances of pseudarthrobacter and pseudomonas gradually decreased until week 5 the relative abundances of one type of saccharibacteria norank p saccharibacteria nakamurella thauera and dechloromonas increased saccharibacteria not only plays a crucial role in denitrification but also degrades c6h12o6 wang et al 2019 thauera is reported as a genus in which nitrogen reduction genes such as nirs and nosz have been detected liu et al 2013a and thauera can be enriched under anaerobic conditions yang et al 2019 dechloromonas is also an important anaerobic denitrifying bacterial genus singleton et al 2021 thauera and dechloromonas belong to the phylum proteobacteria which are potential hosts of args huang et al 2017b tables s4 5 nakamurella belongs to the phylum actinobacteriota and its abundance gradually increased especially in the smx and n smx exposure groups it is a dominant nitrifying genus that is beneficial in c6h12o6 metabolism feng et al 2020 the network before week 5 contained 27 nodes and 124 edges norank p saccharibacteria nakamurella thauera and dechloromonas were positively correlated with nirs furthermore the correlation between sul1 sul2 and nirs nosz fig 4b indicated that the microbial community could restore nitrogen reduction even though nitrogen reduction was inhibited at week 5 after week 5 the network had 27 nodes and 100 edges the associations between genera decreased slightly in the network after week 5 compared to those before week 5 gordonia and burkholderia paraburkholderia became the new and important nodes fig 4c gordonia is a nitrate reducing bacterial genus that can degrade organic pollutants such as antibiotics fidelis silva et al 2019 and showed a significant positive correlation with the smx contained exposure group at week 27 fig 4a other bacterial genera that can metabolize organic pollutants such as burkholderia paraburkholderia increased in the smx exposed groups han et al 2022 fig 4a it has been reported that it is a key carrier of args and is easily enriched under antibiotic stress conditions cao et al 2021 burkholderials has also been previously identified as keystone denitrifying bacteria in lakes zhou et al 2020 besides candidatus planktophila belongs to the characteristic functional genus of anammox bacteria li et al 2021a and was detected as a rare species in the system more information on microorganisms is provided in text s7 8 and fig s15 20 3 4 nitrogen and smx or n smx removal in water and substrate the removal of cod and nh4 n smx or n smx from the water in every group during 190 d was calculated every 3 d fig 5 in general although each group could stably reduce the cod the nh4 n removal fluctuated compared to the stable removal of nh4 n in the blank group the removal of nh4 n in the smx n smx and smx mixed n smx exposure groups repeatedly decreased and recovered at approximately 34 d 5 weeks a noticeable decrease in nh4 n removal was observed corresponding to the inhibition of nitrogen reduction in the three antibiotic exposure groups respectively after 100 d 14 weeks nh4 n removal in the antibiotic exposed groups gradually recovered to nearly 100 the removal of n smx reached nearly 100 more quickly and was significantly higher than that of smx not only in the smx mixed n smx co exposure group but also in the smx or n smx single exposure groups although the fluctuations in smx removal were higher than those in n smx removal both smx and n smx removals exhibited a decrease and subsequently recovered smx removal gradually recovered to more than 80 after 100 d the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in each substrate sample were measured to verify the presence of nitrogen in the pilot cws fig s21 the nh4 n concentration was always low indicating that nitrification was thorough consistent with the results of continuous removal of nh4 n in water the no3 n concentration showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing and the no3 n in the substrate decreased to a low level at the end of the experiment this indicates that nitrification and denitrification occurred simultaneously and that the denitrification process could offset the no3 n produced and accumulated by nitrification the no2 n concentrations at week 5 were higher than those later because denitrification was inhibited at this time subsequently no2 n was consumed and the concentration decreased to a low level in week 27 and the concentrations of smx and n smx in substrate which were used to test potential rates of denitrification anammox dnra and n2o release were all less than 0 006 μg g 1 fig s22 according to the load calculation we could estimate that the mass of smx and n smx in the substrate accounted for less than 0 5 of the total influent load during 190 d 4 discussion 4 1 interactions between microbial mediated nitrogen reduction and smx or n smx removal microbe mediated nitrogen transformation poses a considerable risk because of the presence of antibiotics in wetland environments guan et al 2022 matiatos et al 2021 four groups of lab scale cws were built and showed changes in nitrogen reduction processes including denitrification anammox dnra and n2o release following 190 day exposure to smx or n smx the results revealed that both smx and n smx inhibited denitrification within a short period of exposure 34 days but the rate of denitrification rate recovered after 34 days the differences in the smx n smx and smx mixed n smx exposure groups were related to the characteristics of smx and n smx n smx retains its core sulfanilamide group and is a representative human metabolite it has been reported that n smx could possibly be transformed back to smx during water treatment or in the water sediment system maculewicz et al 2022 smx is poorly adsorbed and polar in nature therefore microbial activities dominate the removal of smx a et al 2020 the soil adsorption coefficient koc of n smx was 238 l kg significantly higher than that of smx 91 6 l kg n smx could still inhibit microbial activities similar to smx within a short exposure period 34 d however n smx was easier to be removed by adsorption than smx resulting in a lower abundance of args gordonia and paraburkholderia in the n smx exposed group fig s14 confirming the results presented in fig 4a therefore smx plays a dominant role in the smx mixed n smx exposure group additionally as sulfonamide antibiotics have a small transfer to the plant geng et al 2016 we mainly focused on smx n smx concentration in the water and substrate fig 5c d fig s22 when a certain amount of carbon source and antibiotics was added continuously during the 190 day period nitrogen reduction rate changes were found to be related to antibiotic degradation as the denitrification rates and the abundance of 16s gene in smx or n smx exposure groups were significantly inhibited in week 5 35 days the removal of nh4 n and smx or n smx dropped to a low level in contrast the removal rate of nh4 n in the blank group was higher and remained stable throughout the period corresponding to an unaffected denitrification process without antibiotic exposure this interactive relationship can indicate that the exposure of antibiotics and their metabolites like smx and n smx in a period could stress the nitrogen reduction processes in cws and possibly lead to or aggravate water eutrophication it can also improve our understanding on how the nitrogen reduction potential in cws responds to the cumulative effects of smx n smx exposure such as the generation of antibiotic resistance moreover we explored different functional microorganisms related to the nitrogen reduction which also play a role in the degradation of smx n smx so as to realize the simultaneous removal of antibiotics and nitrogen reduction in cws it enhanced our understanding of how cws cope with the risks of nitrogen enrichment and antibiotic exposure at the same time 4 2 proposed mechanisms of nitrogen reduction under smx or n smx exposure in cws after 5 weeks nh4 n removal in the smx or n smx exposure groups recovered gradually after their denitrification rates first recovered and the copies of the nitrogen reduction genes sul1 and sul2 increased significantly after 14 weeks nh4 n and smx removal increased to a level comparable to that of the blank group and remained stable the recovery of nitrogen and antibiotics removal lagged behind the recovery of denitrification rates and functional gene abundance this indicated that antibiotic exposed groups gradually achieved antibiotic resistance and recovery potential under exposure to 100 μg l 1 levels of smx and n smx the pilot scale cws took approximately 100 d to fully recover the antibiotic resistance and recovery potential of cws were reflected in the microbial community which evolved to remove nitrogen and antibiotics simultaneously the functional bacteria for nitrogen reduction were significantly associated with the smx n smx exposure group such as burkholderia paraburkholderia and gordonia which can also degrade organic pollutants fidelis et al 2019 han et al 2022 fig 4a additionally burkholderia paraburkholderia is a key carrier of args cao et al 2021 both nitrogen reduction genes and sulfonamide args were detected in proteobacteria tables s4 5 it is important to further explore specific co hosts for nitrogen reduction genes and args the evolution of the microbial communities also showed an interaction between nitrogen reduction and antibiotic degradation however the environmental health risks caused by increased args remain an issue that needs to be explored fig 6 5 conclusions in conclusion this study demonstrated the interaction between nitrogen reduction and smx or n smx removal in lab scale cws we investigated how denitrification anammox dnra and n2o release rates responded to smx and n smx exposure over 190 d denitrification and dnra rates were significantly inhibited by smx or n smx within a short period 35 d and gradually recovered when the denitrification rates returned to high levels after 35 d n2o release was significantly reduced the abundance of the relevant functional genes involved in nitrogen transformation confirmed these results anammox related bacteria were less abundant therefore the change was not significant the composition of microbial communities changed over a long period under smx or n smx exposure genera that can both denitrify and degrade antibiotics such as burkholderia paraburkholderia were more positively correlated with gradual smx exposure after 35 d and are key carriers of args after the denitrification rates recovered after 35 d in smx or n smx exposure groups the removal of nitrogen smx and n smx in the water and substrate also gradually recovered and reached a high level thus the present study revealed the interactions between smx n smx removal and nitrogen reduction including the response of nitrogen reduction potential to smx n smx exposure as well as the removal of both nitrogen and smx n smx in cws author statement we declare that we do not have any commercial or associative interest that represents a conflict of interest in connection with the work submitted

14664,anaerobic co digestion of sulfur rich vegetable waste svw with waste activated sludge was and the underlying mechanisms associated with methane production and phosphorus p release were investigated four types of svw chinese cabbage cabbage rapeseed cake and garlic were utilized for co digestion with was and the methane yield increased by 7 3 35 3 in the meantime the p release amount from was was enhanced by 9 8 24 9 the organic carbon in svw promoted methane production while organic sulfur and the formation of fes facilitated p release among the four types of svw rapeseed cake was identified as the most suitable co digestion substrate for enhancing both methane production and p release due to its balanced nutrients and relatively high sulfur content syntrophic bacteria working with hydrogenotrophic methanogens iron reducing bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were enriched metabolic pathways related to sulfate reduction and methanogenesis were facilitated especially hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis enzymes involved in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis were promoted by 76 05 407 98 with the addition of chinese cabbage cabbage or rapeseed cake this study provides an eco friendly technology for promoting p resource and energy recovery from was and an in depth understanding of the corresponding microbial mechanisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge sulfur rich vegetable waste sulfate reduction anaerobic co digestion phosphorus release hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 1 introduction as a by product of wastewater treatment waste activated sludge was is rich in resources such as organic matter nitrogen phosphorus potassium etc but may also cause environmental risks such as the pollution of refractory organic matters heavy metals and pathogenic microorganisms etc verlicchi and zambello 2015 anaerobic digestion ad is one of effective treatment methods for was reduction valorization and environmentally sound management the abundant organic matter in was can be converted into fuels with high calorific value in the form of methane and hydrogen h2 moreover nitrogen n and phosphorus p can be released into the supernatant during ad and can be recovered as resources li et al 2019a however due to the low c n ratio high percentage of refractory substances and the presence of inorganic metal phosphate precipitates in was the ad performance of was has not been satisfactory resulting in inefficient methane production and low p release melia et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 iron phosphorus compounds feps are commonly found in was and their transformation can be influenced by organic compounds redox potential and microorganisms lu et al 2022 wilfert et al 2015 during the ad of was p is difficult to be released from feps due to the stability of feps and the reprecipitation of soluble phosphate with metal ions hu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 which influence p recovery from the ad supernatant co digestion of was with food waste fw is a method to facilitate p release and promote methane production by balancing the c n ratio and weakening toxicity of was chen et al 2020 yang et al 2019 dai et al 2013 found that adding fw to was for co digestion not only improved the system stability by diluting inhibitors such as ammonia and sodium but also promoted biogas production li et al 2019b achieved efficient p recovery from was containing feps by acidogenic co fermentation with fw our previous study found that co fermentation of protein rich biomass and was can facilitate p release due to the reaction of feps and sulfide produced by protein degradation zhang et al 2022 suggesting that sulfur rich biomass plays an important role in p release from feps bearing was apart from proteins allicin glucosinolates and sulfated polysaccharides are also widespread sulfur containing organics in biomass ishida et al 2014 tao et al 2020 zhang et al 2023 sulfur containing organics in plants are protective agents against pests and are also natural antiseptics that may affect the growth and metabolism of microorganisms deng et al 2015 tao et al 2020 it has been reported that thiosulfinate allicin which is abundant in garlic and onions can inhibit the production of volatile fatty acids vfas and methane during the co digestion of was and fw by interfering with metabolic processes of microorganisms tao et al 2020 brassica plants including chinese cabbage cabbage rape etc consumed widely by humans are rich in glucosinolates ishida et al 2014 a large amount of vegetable waste is generated during agricultural production transportation storage retail and consumption ji et al 2017 so far co digestion of brassica plants with was or manure have been investigated it was reported that co digestion of brassica plants with was doubled biogas production and co digestion of brassica plants with sheep manure at ts ratios of 1 4 2 1 increased biogas production by 1 5 3 times grübel et al 2019 liu et al 2022 however the effect of their sulfur rich characteristics on ad has not been concerned herein we hypothesized that sulfur rich vegetable waste svw can facilitate p release and may influence methane production if they are co digested with was the aim of this work was to investigate the performance of the co digestion of was with four kinds of svw including brassica plants chinese cabbage cabbage rapeseed cake and garlic for p release and methane production the transformation of organic compounds p release and the fate of sulfur in co digestion systems were investigated by chemical analysis the effects of different svw on bacteria and archaea were illustrated by microbial community analysis in order to reveal the mechanism of methane production and p release in genetic level changes in functional enzymes and the microbial contribution to particular functions were explored using metagenomic analysis the suitable svw substrate for co digestion with was was recommended by comparing the methane production efficiency and p release amount an eco friendly strategy for simultaneous p and biofuel recovery from was and vegetable waste is proposed in this study which provides a novel perspective for organic solid waste disposal 2 materials and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge and sulfur rich vegetable waste the was was obtained from an anaerobic anoxic oxic aao reactor with a small amount of fecl3 dosing for p removal in the laboratory the was discharged from the aao reactor was collected and concentrated and then kept in a refrigerator at 4 c for use the inoculum was taken from a lab scale semi continuous anaerobic digester the properties of the was and inoculum are shown in table s1 chinese cabbage cabbage and garlic waste were collected at a food market in shanghai china rapeseed cake was collected in huainan anhui province china after being transported to the laboratory chinese cabbage cabbage and garlic waste were chopped into 2 3 cm pieces all svw were dried individually in an oven at 65 c for 48 h and then were ground into small particles and sieved to below 0 18 mm the properties of svw are shown in table 1 2 2 batch anaerobic digestion tests a total of four co digestion groups and a control group were set up for batch ad tests the co digestion groups with the addition of chinese cabbage cabbage rapeseed cake and garlic were named as cca ca ra and ga respectively identical serum bottles with a final working volume of 450 ml were used as digesters for each experimental group 370 ml was was poured into each bottle first then inoculum and the svw were separately added to the bottles according to the ts weight ratio of 1 1 1 for was inoculum svw a group without svw addition was the control another four groups with the addition of svw and inoculum but without was were set up to exclude the p release from the svw before ad the mixture in bottles was stirred to mix thoroughly and the air was removed by blowing n2 for 2 min then the bottles were immediately sealed and placed in an air bath shaker at 35 1 c and 200 rpm for 40 47 days each group was in triplicate sludge and gas samples were taken on day 0 4 h after mixing 2 4 7 10 15 21 27 and 40 the sludge samples were centrifuged at 4 c and 8000 rpm for 15 min and then filtered with 0 45 μm cellulose membranes to obtain supernatant all data were presented as mean standard deviation 2 3 analytical methods the ph was measured using a 6010 m ph meter jenco usa ts vs nh3 n fe ii and po4 p were tested according to the standard methods apha 2012 van soest method van soest et al 1991 was used to determine the contents of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin the protein lipid ash and carbohydrate contents of svw were measured according to association of official analytical collaboration aoac standard method aoac 2005 a dr3900 visible light spectrophotometer hach usa was used to analyze tcod and scod the modified lowry method frølund et al 1996 and the anthrone sulfuric acid method trevelyan et al 1952 were used to determine proteins and polysaccharides respectively the chemical forms of fe and s in sludge were characterized by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps with a k alpha spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa the biogas fraction was tested using a gas chromatograph agilent 6890a usa equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd the methane production potential was simulated and calculated by the modified gompertz model another gas chromatograph agilent 7280a usa equipped with a flame ionization detector fid was used to measure the vfas the vfas were calculated as cod contents according to stoichiometric conversion coefficients 1 07 for acetic acid 1 51 for propionic acid 1 82 for n butyric acid and iso butyric acid and 2 04 for n valeric and isovaleric acid as previously reported zhang et al 2021 2 4 microbial community analysis the digested sludge samples were taken from each bottle at 10 15 and 27 d for microbial community analysis e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek usa was applied to extract dna from sludge samples and nanodrop 2000 thermo scientific usa was used for quantification the follow up details are described in text s1 2 5 metagenomic analysis after using e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek usa to extract dna from sludge samples on day10 and 27 the quality of extracted dna was evaluated by 1 agarose gel the purity and concentration of extracted dna were tested by nanodrop 2000 thermo scientific usa and quantus fluorometer promega usa respectively the subsequent analysis processes are detailed in text s2 and more details can be found in our previous study ping et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 anaerobic co digestion performance 3 1 1 effects of svw types on methane production fig 1 presents the cumulative methane yield during the ad of was with and without svw addition the cumulative methane yields of cca ca ra and ga groups were 295 43 0 72 287 64 9 29 292 37 6 01 and 234 28 10 07 ml g vs respectively they were improved by 35 3 31 7 33 9 and 7 3 respectively compared with that in the control group 218 38 2 90 ml g vs in addition the optimum digestion time depended on the svw type the shortest optimum digestion time was 27 days for the ra group and the longest was 42 days for the ga group the methane production was simulated using the modified gompertz equation and estimated by three kinetic parameters namely the maximum methane yield pmax ml g vs methane production rate rmax ml g vs day and lag phase time λ day it was observed that the modified gompertz equation described methane production well with r2 0 98 in all cases the addition of svw increased both pmax and rmax but the calculated λ was extended to 3 20 d the garlic had the most significant effect on extending the lag phase time ga group garlic is rich in allicin which prevents the proliferation of bacteria or kills cells directly and has been reported to have a negative impact on ad borlinghaus et al 2014 tao et al 2020 therefore adding svw promoted methane production but prolonged the period of ad svw with a higher c n ratio 8 26 19 07 than was 4 55 provided more easy to use organic matters for microorganisms to produce methane among the four svw the chinese cabbage and rapeseed cake performed better in terms of methane production this is caused by their different material composition and the corresponding effects on microbial community structure and metabolism which will be illustrated in the following parts 3 1 2 variations in soluble organic compounds it can be observed from fig 2 a and b that vfas were accumulated first and then gradually consumed the maximum tvfas concentrations in cca ca ra and ga groups were 3671 02 24 87 day 7 4210 41 29 41 day 10 1564 22 4 44 day 7 4474 19 119 71 day 15 mg cod l respectively the ph showed the opposite trend fig 2c it dropped from near neutral to 5 1 4 8 5 9 and 4 9 in cca ca ra and ga groups respectively and then gradually returned to neutral in contrast relatively less vfas were observed and only a small amount of acetic acid in the supernatant were detected during the ad in the control group meaning vfas were quickly utilized for methanogenesis consequently in the control there was little accumulation of vfas and no significant decrease in ph acetic acid propionic acid and n butyric acid were the dominant vfas in co digestion digesters the accumulation of n butyric acid was present in cca ca and ga groups while little butyric acid was detected in ra group the vfas in ra group were consumed fast and exhausted on day 21 and an efficient methane production was observed the acid inhibition in cca ca and ga groups was manifested by the accumulation of vfas 3671 02 4474 19 mg cod l the decrease of ph 5 1 4 8 and the prolongation of lag phase time for methane production 3 20 d which might be related to the higher carbohydrate content in these svw the carbohydrate content of chinese cabbage cabbage rapeseed cake and garlic were 62 67 0 96 70 25 0 68 50 12 1 18 and 83 99 0 75 respectively carbohydrates are the preferred substrate for anaerobic bacteria and are preferentially degraded before proteins markou et al 2013 the acidification rate of carbohydrates is faster than proteins and lipids leading to vfas accumulation ph decrease and methanogenesis inhibition yang et al 2015 the accumulation of vfas in ca and ga groups induced a drop in ph below 5 at which the activity of methanogenic communities preferring ph 6 8 7 2 was suppressed yuan and zhu 2016 therefore the high carbohydrate content of cabbage and garlic resulted in suppression of methanogenesis in ca and ga groups furthermore allicin and its derivatives were found to inhibit methane production during the co digestion of fw and was tao et al 2020 which also negatively affected methanogenesis in the ga group the scod content increased significantly with the addition of svw and then decreased over time fig 2d corresponding to the dissolution and consumption of abundant organic matters in svw powdered svw was dissolved immediately after being added resulting in a rapid increase in the concentration of soluble polysaccharides and soluble proteins fig s1 after adding chinese cabbage cabbage and garlic the soluble polysaccharide soared from 2 54 0 64 mg l in the control group to 425 58 6 82 1690 97 200 97 and 2144 27 33 61 mg l respectively while it was only 39 98 2 99 mg l in the ra group the carbohydrates in plants are mainly derived from monosaccharides disaccharides oligosaccharides and polysaccharides the first three of which make up the water soluble carbohydrates klevenhusen and zebeli 2021 the main polysaccharides in plants namely starch cellulose and hemicellulose are insoluble carbohydrates starch is mainly found in cereals and rarely in green plants klevenhusen and zebeli 2021 so cellulose and hemicellulose are the main insoluble carbohydrates in svw the value of carbohydrate content minus cellulose and hemicellulose content can represent the major water soluble carbohydrate content in svw which were more abundant in chinese cabbage 39 9 0 9 cabbage 48 7 0 6 and garlic 39 1 0 1 than in rapeseed cake 30 7 1 6 rapid dissolution of water soluble carbohydrates such as glucose sucrose and raffinose caused elevated soluble polysaccharides in cca ca and ga groups during the acidification process saccharides were quickly utilized and reduced fig s1a among the four types of svw the rapeseed cake had the highest protein content of 34 41 0 49 and the highest lipid content of 8 22 0 14 table 1 which was in accordance with the fact that both the highest soluble protein concentration fig s1b 393 11 13 30 mg l on day 7 and the highest ammonia nitrogen concentration fig 2e 492 36 11 94 mg l on day 40 occurred in ra group the calculated free ammonia concentrations 0 25 5 08 mg l shown in fig s2 were well below the inhibitory concentrations reported in literatures 80 150 mg l jiang et al 2019 therefore the ad in this study was not inhibited by ammonia released from the biomass due to the relatively low carbohydrate content high protein and lipid contents in the rapeseed cake the concentrations of scod and tvfas in ra group were in a lower level throughout the co digestion process carbohydrates proteins and lipids are the three main components of was and fw carbohydrates can be rapidly hydrolyzed into simple saccharides and then fermented into vfas while proteins are hydrolyzed to amino acids and lipids are hydrolyzed to glycerol and long chain fatty acids at a lower rate before being further degraded to vfas when carbohydrates were rapidly degraded the degradation of proteins would be temporarily stalled yang et al 2015 consequently the hydrolysis and acidification processes in the ra group were relatively mild the progressive hydrolysis and acidification of carbohydrates proteins and lipids could avoid acid inhibition and maintain a balanced environment for methanogenic microorganisms overall rapeseed cake is a more suitable candidate for co digestion with was for methane production since its balanced nutrient profile 50 12 1 18 carbohydrate 34 41 0 49 protein and 8 22 0 14 lipids does not lead to excessive accumulation of vfas and too low ph value 3 2 effects of svw types on p release from was figs 3 a and s3 show the variation in soluble po4 p and p release efficiency during the co digestion of was with different svw respectively the addition of svw facilitated p release but the effect depended on the type of svw the soluble po4 p concentration increased quickly within the first 2 days and kept increasing within 10 days and then decreased since svw also released p we set up another group of experiments to test the p release from sole svw and the results are shown in fig s4 after deducting the soluble po4 p released from svw p release from was increased by 9 8 15 5 24 9 and 13 4 on day 10 by adding chinese cabbage cabbage rapeseed cake and garlic respectively there are several mechanisms for p release from was in an ad system 1 biological p release due to disintegration and hydrolysis of microbial cellular material 2 the decomposition of polyphosphate in polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos 3 metal phosphate dissolution under acidic conditions 4 p release resulted from biological activities related to iron reduction and sulfate reduction saoudi et al 2022 paos can achieve more than 90 of the p release when enough carbon is available guilayn et al 2017 all co digestion groups in this work had sufficient carbon sources for p release by paos as evidenced by the abundance of vfas the ph decrease can promote p release by dissolving inorganic p such as feps however although the ra group had the lowest concentration of vfas and the highest ph the best enhancement of p release was achieved this suggests microbial activities such as iron reduction and sulfate reduction might play an important role in p release as shown in fig 3b the soluble fe ii in co digestion groups increased first and then gradually decreased in the course of ad the solid fe ii also increased at the end of co digestion fig s5 indicating that fe iii was reduced to fe ii and finally precipitated in the solid phase dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria are capable of reducing fe iii to fe ii using organics such as vfas wu et al 2021 during the reduction of fe iii p to fe ii p a portion of phosphate could be released into the liquid phase eq 1 and soluble fe ii could react with sulfides to form iron sulfides eqs 2 and 3 which further promoted p release haaning nielsen et al 2005 hu et al 2019 yu et al 2021 1 3 f e p o 4 f e 3 p o 4 2 p o 4 3 2 f e 2 h s f e s h 3 f e 2 s 2 f e s to further prove the occurrence of iron reduction anaerobic sludge samples taken from the control and co digestion groups on day 40 were collected freeze dried and characterized by xps in fe 2p spectra fig 4 a the peaks centered at 709 9 ev represent fe ii s yu et al 2020 suggesting that the sulfur contained in svw and was was transformed to sulfide and then reacted with fe ii to form fes during co digestion the peaks at 162 9 ev that appear in s 2p spectra also confirm the existence of fes fig 4b ahmed et al 2019 the peaks at 711 6 ev are ascribed to fe iii po4 wang and sherwood 2002 which was not biologically reduced it can be observed that there was more unreduced fe iii in the control group therefore the higher p release in ra group was probably resulted from the higher sulfur content in the rapeseed cake three sulfur species organic sulfur sulfate and sulfide and two sulfur conversion pathways organic sulfur conversion and sulfate reduction during the ad of was or fw have been demonstrated forouzanmehr et al 2022 li et al 2020 during the ad process organic sulfur can be hydrolyzed and degraded by anaerobes to sulfides hs s2 and h2s and volatile sulfur compounds methyl mercaptan ethanethiol dimethyl sulfide dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide and volatile sulfur compounds are subsequently converted to sulfides by sulfate reducing bacteria methanogens etc zhang et al 2023 sulfides are also the products of sulfate reduction and play a key role in the p release as shown in eqs 4 5 6 and 7 sulfides have the ability to induce the reduction of fe iii to fe ii and to release p from feps while forming iron sulfides and elemental sulfur hu et al 2019 wilfert et al 2020 yu et al 2021 4 2 f e 3 h s 2 f e 2 s 0 h 5 2 f e 3 3 s 2 2 f e s s 0 6 3 f e p o 4 1 5 s 2 f e 3 p o 4 2 1 5 s 0 p o 4 3 7 f e 3 p o 4 2 3 s 2 3 f e s 2 p o 4 3 after 10 days vfas were gradually consumed fig 2b and the ph increased fig 2c creating an environment conducive to metal precipitation therefore soluble po4 p decreased due to the precipitation of po4 p with metal ions at higher ph or adsorption of po4 p to precipitates melia et al 2017 not only iron but also other metal ions such as aluminum magnesium and calcium are abundant in sludge which can react with dissolved phosphate to form precipitates thus resolidifying p melia et al 2017 yu et al 2021 3 3 microbial community analysis 3 3 1 microbial diversity shannon index is one of the most commonly used alpha diversity indices for estimating the microbial community diversity of samples a higher shannon index indicates a larger community diversity as shown in fig s6 compared with the control the shannon index decreased by 18 3 28 8 26 1 and 33 7 at day 10 in the cca ca ra and ga groups respectively but increased slightly at day 27 the initial decline of microbial community diversity should be due to the release of bactericidal substances from svw hydrolysis and the acidic environment formed by acidification as the digestion proceeded microorganisms were acclimated to the new environment and the proliferation of new dominant microorganisms might occur in co digestion groups resulting in a slightly higher shannon index in addition different types of svw promoted the colonization of different species of microorganisms as shown in fig 5 a the bacterial community compositions of the co digestion groups with svw addition were significantly different from the control group the ra group exhibited the closest resemblance to the control group whereas the other co digestion groups cca ca ga were more similar to one another which may be related to the similar properties of chinese cabbage cabbage and garlic as well as the occurrence of acid inhibition in the corresponding co digestion groups the similarity of the archaeal community composition of co digested sludge samples in fig 5b is consistent with the regularity of bacterial community composition fig 5a 3 3 2 microbial composition and variation the results of microbial community in the control and co digestion groups at 10 and 27 d show that svw promoted the proliferation of bacteria with functions such as organics degradation h2 production iron reduction and sulfate reduction fig 6 firmicutes bacteroidota proteobacteria chloroflexi acidobacteriota and actinobacteriota were dominant bacteria in co digestion systems fig 6a most bacteria belonging to these phyla contribute to degrading organics and fermenting vfas ariesyady et al 2007 xu et al 2018 the phylum firmicutes and bacteroidota in all co digestion groups were enriched but proteobacteria and chloroflexi were weakened it was reported that firmicutes was the dominant bacteria for lignocellulosic substrates degradation and had a good tolerance with low ph zheng et al 2015 meanwhile firmicutes are syntrophic bacteria that can degrade vfas and produce h2 for hydrogenotrophic methanogens rivière et al 2009 bacteroidota plays a crucial role in protein hydrolysis positively correlated with proteins input and vfas production yi et al 2014 with the addition of svw the content of organic matters like lignocellulose and protein increased so that firmicutes and bacteroidota in co digestion groups were enriched the relative abundance of chloroflexi decreased due to its sensitivity to ph fluctuation xu et al 2018 with the accumulation of vfas and the decline of ph in co digestion groups bacteria unable to adapt to low ph decreased and firmicutes gradually dominated eventually firmicutes and bacteroidota dominated in acidic environments bacteria associated with hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as the family clostridiaceae synergistaceae sprirochaetaceae and rikenecellaceae were enriched with the addition of svw on day 10 the relative abundance of clostridiaceae increased from 0 85 control to 27 36 25 39 1 89 and 29 33 in cca ca ra and ga groups respectively the family clostridiaceae has been reported to associate with high h2 production and most members can undergo syntrophic acetate oxidation in the presence of hydrogenotrophic methanogen cabrol et al 2017 the rikenecellaceae increased more significantly in cca ca and ga groups which can degrade amino acids and collaborate with hydrogenotrophic methanogen in a syntrophic relationship serna garcía et al 2020 members of the families synergistaceae and sprirochaetaceae are acetogenic bacteria capable of syntrophic acetate oxidation and can cooperate with hydrogenotrophic methanogens suksong et al 2019 which were more apparently enriched in the ra group in addition because members of the family synergistaceae are related to protein hydrolysis and can release acetate propionate and butyrate from peptides serna garcía et al 2020 synergistaceae could facilitate the degradation of proteins derived from rapeseed cake on the level of genus the relative abundance of clostridium sensu stricto 12 in cca ca ra and ga groups on day 10 enhanced from 0 062 control to 19 09 12 23 0 87 and 5 17 respectively the clostridium sensu stricto 1 was enriched mainly in ca and ga groups which increased from 0 69 control to 2 89 and 18 70 on day 10 respectively both clostridium sensu stricto 12 and clostridium sensu stricto 1 were the predominant h2 producing genus in co digestion groups li et al 2022 notably clostridium may also play a role in p release because it can reduce iron during anaerobic fermentation lovley 1991 bacteroides were reported to have high fe iii reduction capability by metabolizing glucose wang et al 2010 which can facilitate p release from was the relative abundance of bacteroides in cca ca ra and ga groups on day 10 were 9 57 0 64 26 56 and 0 012 respectively among all svw rapeseed cake was the most effective in promoting p release from was probably due to the high relative abundance of bacteroides in the ra group norank f norank o bacteroidales were acetic acid producers zhang et al 2014 that increased in ca and ga groups resulting in high concentrations of vfas in these groups as a result of the high polysaccharides content in chinese cabbage cabbage and garlic addition parabacteroides were enriched in cca ca and ga groups which are saccharolytic bacteria transforming polysaccharides to acetate and succinate zhang et al 2016 caldisericum desulfovibrio and smithella capable of reducing sulfate kremer and hansen 1988 tang et al 2022 increased in all co digestion groups it was reported that low molecular organic acids and h2 could be used as electron donors by caldisericum to reduce sulfate to sulfide kremer and hansen 1988 wang et al 2019 overall it can be observed that more h2 producing bacteria iron reducing bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria were enriched by adding svw which contributed to the methane production and p release in the archaea community the co digestion groups with svw addition were dominated by methanogens capable of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis including methanobacterium methanobrevibacter and unclassified f methanobacteriaceae while the acetoclastic methanogen methanosaeta decreased the rda analysis in fig 5b demonstrates that methanosaeta showed a significant negative correlation with tvfas and a positive correlation with ph indicating that methanosaeta were inhibited due to acid accumulation and ph reduction whereas other hydrogenotrophic methanogens were less inhibited it was also observed that substrates such as polysaccharides proteins and vfas had significant effects on the composition of archaea in detail the hydrogenotrophic methanogens prefer acidic environments whereas acetoclastic methanogens are more adapted to neutral ph li et al 2018 the relative abundance of methanosaeta on day 27 decreased from 28 17 control to 0 35 0 13 27 82 and 0 18 in cca ca ra and ga groups respectively methanosaeta is a representative acetoclastic methanogen and usually predominates at low acetate concentration which can be replaced by methanosarcina under extreme conditions such as high salt ammonia nitrogen and vfas kurade et al 2019 methanosaeta and methanosarcina are the only two known acetoclastic methanogenesis genera currently methanosarcina is considered as a powerful and versatile methanogen because of its high growth rates resistance to ph changes and the ability to perform three types of methanogenesis acetoclastic hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogenesis de vrieze et al 2012 due to the accumulation of vfas decrease in ph and release of sulfur containing antimicrobial substances in all co digestion groups with the addition of svw methanosarcina increased to overtake methanosaeta in cca ca ra and ga groups on day 27 the relative abundance of methanosarcina increased from 0 41 control to 33 76 28 11 20 38 and 16 88 respectively both methanosaeta and methanosarcina were able to survive in the ra group owing to the more balanced nutrition and less vfas accumulation thus methanosaeta did not decrease obviously and the population of various archaea remained balanced in the ra group among hydrogenotrophic methanogens the methanobacterium has a shorter doubling time and the highest average growth rate which is more adaptable to dynamic environments guo et al 2022 consequently methanobacterium augmented and dominated in cca ca and ra groups with relative abundances of 63 13 61 60 and 45 45 respectively another typical hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanobrevibacter predominated in the ga group with a relative abundance of 68 17 the correlation analysis between archaea and bacteria proved the positive correlation between h2 producing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens fig s7 methanobrevibacter and unclassified f methanobacteriaceae were found to be positively correlated with clostridiaceae another methanogen capable of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis methanosarcina was also positively correlated with synergistaceae and rikenecellaceae in summary the addition of svw changed the diversity and abundance of bacteria and archaea and the interaction between microorganisms was the key mechanism promoting methanogenesis and p release fig 7 the simultaneous enrichment of h2 producing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens illustrated the conversion of acetoclastic methanogenesis to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis resulting from svw addition the cooperation between h2 producing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens alleviated acid inhibition and improved methane production the promotion in p release was attributed to the proliferation of iron reducing and sulfate reducing bacteria 3 4 metagenomic analysis a further metagenomic analysis was conducted to investigate the influence of svw on the metabolic pathways of methane production and sulfate reduction the results demonstrated that metabolism of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and sulfate reduction were strengthened while the acetoclastic methanogenesis was weakened which coincided with microbial community variations key functional enzymes of these two metabolic pathways are summarized in figs 8 10 and table s2 overall most functional enzymes associated with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis increased significantly but those related to acetoclastic methanogenesis decreased compared to the control functional enzymes involved in the co2 reduction pathway associated with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis including formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase ec 1 2 7 12 formylmethanofuran tetrahydromethanopterin formyltransferase ec 2 3 1 101 methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase ec 3 5 4 27 and methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase ec 1 5 98 1 increased by 76 05 407 98 in ca cca and ra groups especially in the cca group the 5 10 methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase ec 1 5 98 2 coenzyme f420 hydrogenase ec 1 12 98 1 tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase ec 2 1 1 86 and methyl com reductase ec 2 8 4 1 were also enriched by 25 32 336 45 which were functional enzymes of the last step of methane generation pathway shared by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis in summary a great majority of functional enzymes associated with methanogenesis were promoted with svw addition thereby promoting methane production efficiency at the genetic level the microbial contribution to specific functions were evaluated by correlation analysis on the basis of the correspondence between microorganisms and functional traits as illustrated in fig 9 for the contribution of the top 10 methanogens to methanogenic enzymes methanosaeta and methanolinea were the main contributors of methanogenic enzymes in the control the major contributors of methanogenic enzymes in the ra group were similar to the control mainly including methanosaeta methanobacterium and methanolinea after the addition of svw the contributions of methanosaeta to formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase ec 1 2 7 12 phosphoenolpyruvate synthase ec 2 7 9 2 glycine hydroxymethyltransferase ec 2 1 2 1 methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase ec 1 5 98 1 tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase ec 2 1 1 86 and methyl com reductase ec 2 8 4 1 were reduced in all co digestion groups in cca and ca groups the contribution of methanosaeta to all methanogenic enzymes decreased but the contributions of methanosarcina and methanobacterium were strengthened the contributions of methanobacterium increased significantly to 28 10 ec 1 2 7 12 63 31 ec 2 3 1 101 52 60 ec 3 5 4 27 44 59 ec 1 5 98 1 44 82 ec 1 12 98 1 58 40 ec 1 5 98 2 37 04 ec 2 1 1 86 50 11 ec 2 8 4 1 in the cca group and 21 77 ec 1 2 7 12 57 14 ec 2 3 1 101 29 31 ec 3 5 4 27 51 27 ec 1 5 98 1 27 82 ec 1 12 98 1 12 59 ec 1 5 98 2 32 63 ec 2 1 1 86 36 03 ec 2 8 4 1 in the ca group the contribution of methanosarcina to methanogenic enzymes increased in all co digestion groups and it was a main contributor to methanogenic enzymes in cca ca and ga groups as the largest contributor of methanogenic enzymes in the ga group the contributions of methanobrevibacter were enhanced to 38 63 ec 1 2 7 12 59 86 ec 2 3 1 101 66 67 ec 3 5 4 27 54 10 ec 1 5 98 1 45 77 ec 1 12 98 1 53 68 ec 1 5 98 2 51 80 ec 2 1 1 86 and 56 73 ec 2 8 4 1 microbial contribution analysis demonstrated that the contribution to methanogenic enzymes in co digestion groups was mainly made by methanogens capable of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis including methanobacterium methanobrevibacter and methanosarcina which was consistent with the variation pattern of microbial community the addition of svw improved sulfur metabolism and had an effect on p release for sulfate reduction the enhancements in relative abundance of assimilatory sulfate reduction m00176 in cca ca and ga groups were 4 20 14 52 and 19 15 respectively and the relative abundance of dissimilatory sulfate reduction m00596 increased by 4 82 16 83 and 10 78 respectively compared to the control fig 10 however in the ra group both m00176 and m00596 were attenuated implying that sulfate reduction was not the major reason for the p release in the ra group the best p release in the ra group should be attributed to the synergistic effect of fermentative bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria iron reducing bacteria and methanogens as well as the higher sulfur content in the rapeseed cake rapeseed cake had more organic sulfur than other svw which can be converted to sulfides by fermentative bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogens and then phosphate in feps was released owing to the reaction between sulfides and feps li et al 2020 zhang et al 2023 moreover the highest relative abundance of bacteroides was found in the ra group 26 56 which could perform fe iii reduction and thus promote p release wang et al 2010 as a module related to organic sulfur conversion the relative abundance of cysteine biosynthesis m00021 rose in all co digestion groups with 11 00 23 20 10 29 and 15 94 improvement in cca ca ra and ga groups respectively the metabolism of cysteine is associated with sulfur containing proteins which should contribute to the transformation of organic sulfur the transformation pathway of various sulfur containing organics in svw during ad and their role in p release need further investigation 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that the co digestion of svw and was improved methane production and p release when was was co digested with chinese cabbage cabbage rapeseed cake and garlic methane production increased by 35 3 31 7 33 9 and 7 3 respectively meanwhile the p release from was was improved by 9 8 15 5 24 9 and 13 4 respectively with the addition of svw more fes was formed compared with the control there was a significant enrichment in bacteria cooperating with hydrogenotrophic methanogens iron reducing bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens archaea metabolic pathways for methane production and sulfate reduction were strengthened especially hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis the addition of chinese cabbage cabbage or rapeseed cake significantly boosted enzymes involved in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis by 76 05 407 98 in which methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase ec 1 5 98 1 was promoted the most rapeseed cake was an appropriate co substrate for simultaneously enhancing methane production and p release from was this study not only provides a prospective strategy for the ecological disposal of such kind of organic solid wastes but also provides an insight into the co digestion of svw with was to improve energy and p recovery efficiencies declaration

14664,anaerobic co digestion of sulfur rich vegetable waste svw with waste activated sludge was and the underlying mechanisms associated with methane production and phosphorus p release were investigated four types of svw chinese cabbage cabbage rapeseed cake and garlic were utilized for co digestion with was and the methane yield increased by 7 3 35 3 in the meantime the p release amount from was was enhanced by 9 8 24 9 the organic carbon in svw promoted methane production while organic sulfur and the formation of fes facilitated p release among the four types of svw rapeseed cake was identified as the most suitable co digestion substrate for enhancing both methane production and p release due to its balanced nutrients and relatively high sulfur content syntrophic bacteria working with hydrogenotrophic methanogens iron reducing bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were enriched metabolic pathways related to sulfate reduction and methanogenesis were facilitated especially hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis enzymes involved in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis were promoted by 76 05 407 98 with the addition of chinese cabbage cabbage or rapeseed cake this study provides an eco friendly technology for promoting p resource and energy recovery from was and an in depth understanding of the corresponding microbial mechanisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge sulfur rich vegetable waste sulfate reduction anaerobic co digestion phosphorus release hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 1 introduction as a by product of wastewater treatment waste activated sludge was is rich in resources such as organic matter nitrogen phosphorus potassium etc but may also cause environmental risks such as the pollution of refractory organic matters heavy metals and pathogenic microorganisms etc verlicchi and zambello 2015 anaerobic digestion ad is one of effective treatment methods for was reduction valorization and environmentally sound management the abundant organic matter in was can be converted into fuels with high calorific value in the form of methane and hydrogen h2 moreover nitrogen n and phosphorus p can be released into the supernatant during ad and can be recovered as resources li et al 2019a however due to the low c n ratio high percentage of refractory substances and the presence of inorganic metal phosphate precipitates in was the ad performance of was has not been satisfactory resulting in inefficient methane production and low p release melia et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 iron phosphorus compounds feps are commonly found in was and their transformation can be influenced by organic compounds redox potential and microorganisms lu et al 2022 wilfert et al 2015 during the ad of was p is difficult to be released from feps due to the stability of feps and the reprecipitation of soluble phosphate with metal ions hu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 which influence p recovery from the ad supernatant co digestion of was with food waste fw is a method to facilitate p release and promote methane production by balancing the c n ratio and weakening toxicity of was chen et al 2020 yang et al 2019 dai et al 2013 found that adding fw to was for co digestion not only improved the system stability by diluting inhibitors such as ammonia and sodium but also promoted biogas production li et al 2019b achieved efficient p recovery from was containing feps by acidogenic co fermentation with fw our previous study found that co fermentation of protein rich biomass and was can facilitate p release due to the reaction of feps and sulfide produced by protein degradation zhang et al 2022 suggesting that sulfur rich biomass plays an important role in p release from feps bearing was apart from proteins allicin glucosinolates and sulfated polysaccharides are also widespread sulfur containing organics in biomass ishida et al 2014 tao et al 2020 zhang et al 2023 sulfur containing organics in plants are protective agents against pests and are also natural antiseptics that may affect the growth and metabolism of microorganisms deng et al 2015 tao et al 2020 it has been reported that thiosulfinate allicin which is abundant in garlic and onions can inhibit the production of volatile fatty acids vfas and methane during the co digestion of was and fw by interfering with metabolic processes of microorganisms tao et al 2020 brassica plants including chinese cabbage cabbage rape etc consumed widely by humans are rich in glucosinolates ishida et al 2014 a large amount of vegetable waste is generated during agricultural production transportation storage retail and consumption ji et al 2017 so far co digestion of brassica plants with was or manure have been investigated it was reported that co digestion of brassica plants with was doubled biogas production and co digestion of brassica plants with sheep manure at ts ratios of 1 4 2 1 increased biogas production by 1 5 3 times grübel et al 2019 liu et al 2022 however the effect of their sulfur rich characteristics on ad has not been concerned herein we hypothesized that sulfur rich vegetable waste svw can facilitate p release and may influence methane production if they are co digested with was the aim of this work was to investigate the performance of the co digestion of was with four kinds of svw including brassica plants chinese cabbage cabbage rapeseed cake and garlic for p release and methane production the transformation of organic compounds p release and the fate of sulfur in co digestion systems were investigated by chemical analysis the effects of different svw on bacteria and archaea were illustrated by microbial community analysis in order to reveal the mechanism of methane production and p release in genetic level changes in functional enzymes and the microbial contribution to particular functions were explored using metagenomic analysis the suitable svw substrate for co digestion with was was recommended by comparing the methane production efficiency and p release amount an eco friendly strategy for simultaneous p and biofuel recovery from was and vegetable waste is proposed in this study which provides a novel perspective for organic solid waste disposal 2 materials and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge and sulfur rich vegetable waste the was was obtained from an anaerobic anoxic oxic aao reactor with a small amount of fecl3 dosing for p removal in the laboratory the was discharged from the aao reactor was collected and concentrated and then kept in a refrigerator at 4 c for use the inoculum was taken from a lab scale semi continuous anaerobic digester the properties of the was and inoculum are shown in table s1 chinese cabbage cabbage and garlic waste were collected at a food market in shanghai china rapeseed cake was collected in huainan anhui province china after being transported to the laboratory chinese cabbage cabbage and garlic waste were chopped into 2 3 cm pieces all svw were dried individually in an oven at 65 c for 48 h and then were ground into small particles and sieved to below 0 18 mm the properties of svw are shown in table 1 2 2 batch anaerobic digestion tests a total of four co digestion groups and a control group were set up for batch ad tests the co digestion groups with the addition of chinese cabbage cabbage rapeseed cake and garlic were named as cca ca ra and ga respectively identical serum bottles with a final working volume of 450 ml were used as digesters for each experimental group 370 ml was was poured into each bottle first then inoculum and the svw were separately added to the bottles according to the ts weight ratio of 1 1 1 for was inoculum svw a group without svw addition was the control another four groups with the addition of svw and inoculum but without was were set up to exclude the p release from the svw before ad the mixture in bottles was stirred to mix thoroughly and the air was removed by blowing n2 for 2 min then the bottles were immediately sealed and placed in an air bath shaker at 35 1 c and 200 rpm for 40 47 days each group was in triplicate sludge and gas samples were taken on day 0 4 h after mixing 2 4 7 10 15 21 27 and 40 the sludge samples were centrifuged at 4 c and 8000 rpm for 15 min and then filtered with 0 45 μm cellulose membranes to obtain supernatant all data were presented as mean standard deviation 2 3 analytical methods the ph was measured using a 6010 m ph meter jenco usa ts vs nh3 n fe ii and po4 p were tested according to the standard methods apha 2012 van soest method van soest et al 1991 was used to determine the contents of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin the protein lipid ash and carbohydrate contents of svw were measured according to association of official analytical collaboration aoac standard method aoac 2005 a dr3900 visible light spectrophotometer hach usa was used to analyze tcod and scod the modified lowry method frølund et al 1996 and the anthrone sulfuric acid method trevelyan et al 1952 were used to determine proteins and polysaccharides respectively the chemical forms of fe and s in sludge were characterized by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps with a k alpha spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa the biogas fraction was tested using a gas chromatograph agilent 6890a usa equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd the methane production potential was simulated and calculated by the modified gompertz model another gas chromatograph agilent 7280a usa equipped with a flame ionization detector fid was used to measure the vfas the vfas were calculated as cod contents according to stoichiometric conversion coefficients 1 07 for acetic acid 1 51 for propionic acid 1 82 for n butyric acid and iso butyric acid and 2 04 for n valeric and isovaleric acid as previously reported zhang et al 2021 2 4 microbial community analysis the digested sludge

scientific usa was used for quantification the follow up details are described in text s1 2 5 metagenomic analysis after using e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek usa to extract dna from sludge samples on day10 and 27 the quality of extracted dna was evaluated by 1 agarose gel the purity and concentration of extracted dna were tested by nanodrop 2000 thermo scientific usa and quantus fluorometer promega usa respectively the subsequent analysis processes are detailed in text s2 and more details can be found in our previous study ping et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 anaerobic co digestion performance 3 1 1 effects of svw types on methane production fig 1 presents the cumulative methane yield during the ad of was with and without svw addition the cumulative methane yields of cca ca ra and ga groups were 295 43 0 72 287 64 9 29 292 37 6 01 and 234 28 10 07 ml g vs respectively they were improved by 35 3 31 7 33 9 and 7 3 respectively compared with that in the control group 218 38 2 90 ml g vs in addition the optimum digestion time depended on the svw type the shortest optimum digestion time was 27 days for the ra group and the longest was 42 days for the ga group the methane production was simulated using the modified gompertz equation and estimated by three kinetic parameters namely the maximum methane yield pmax ml g vs methane production rate rmax ml g vs day and lag phase time λ day it was observed that the modified gompertz equation described methane production well with r2 0 98 in all cases the addition of svw increased both pmax and rmax but the calculated λ was extended to 3 20 d the garlic had the most significant effect on extending the lag phase time ga group garlic is rich in allicin which prevents the proliferation of bacteria or kills cells directly and has been reported to have a negative impact on ad borlinghaus et al 2014 tao et al 2020 therefore adding svw promoted methane production but prolonged the period of ad svw with a higher c n ratio 8 26 19 07 than was 4 55 provided more easy to use organic matters for microorganisms to produce methane among the four svw the chinese cabbage and rapeseed cake performed better in terms of methane production this is caused by their different material composition and the corresponding effects on microbial community structure and metabolism which will be illustrated in the following parts 3 1 2 variations in soluble organic compounds it can be observed from fig 2 a and b that vfas were accumulated first and then gradually consumed the maximum tvfas concentrations in cca ca ra and ga groups were 3671 02 24 87 day 7 4210 41 29 41 day 10 1564 22 4 44 day 7 4474 19 119 71 day 15 mg cod l respectively the ph showed the opposite trend fig 2c it dropped from near neutral to 5 1 4 8 5 9 and 4 9 in cca ca ra and ga groups respectively and then gradually returned to neutral in contrast relatively less vfas were observed and only a small amount of acetic acid in the supernatant were detected during the ad in the control group meaning vfas were quickly utilized for methanogenesis consequently in the control there was little accumulation of vfas and no significant decrease in ph acetic acid propionic acid and n butyric acid were the dominant vfas in co digestion digesters the accumulation of n butyric acid was present in cca ca and ga groups while little butyric acid was detected in ra group the vfas in ra group were consumed fast and exhausted on day 21 and an efficient methane production was observed the acid inhibition in cca ca and ga groups was manifested by the accumulation of vfas 3671 02 4474 19 mg cod l the decrease of ph 5 1 4 8 and the prolongation of lag phase time for methane production 3 20 d which might be related to the higher carbohydrate content in these svw the carbohydrate content of chinese cabbage cabbage rapeseed cake and garlic were 62 67 0 96 70 25 0 68 50 12 1 18 and 83 99 0 75 respectively carbohydrates are the preferred substrate for anaerobic bacteria and are preferentially degraded before proteins markou et al 2013 the acidification rate of carbohydrates is faster than proteins and lipids leading to vfas accumulation ph decrease and methanogenesis inhibition yang et al 2015 the accumulation of vfas in ca and ga groups induced a drop in ph below 5 at which the activity of methanogenic communities preferring ph 6 8 7 2 was suppressed yuan and zhu 2016 therefore the high carbohydrate content of cabbage and garlic resulted in suppression of methanogenesis in ca and ga groups furthermore allicin and its derivatives were found to inhibit methane production during the co digestion of fw and was tao et al 2020 which also negatively affected methanogenesis in the ga group the scod content increased significantly with the addition of svw and then decreased over time fig 2d corresponding to the dissolution and consumption of abundant organic matters in svw powdered svw was dissolved immediately after being added resulting in a rapid increase in the concentration of soluble polysaccharides and soluble proteins fig s1 after adding chinese cabbage cabbage and garlic the soluble polysaccharide soared from 2 54 0 64 mg l in the control group to 425 58 6 82 1690 97 200 97 and 2144 27 33 61 mg l respectively while it was only 39 98 2 99 mg l in the ra group the carbohydrates in plants are mainly derived from monosaccharides disaccharides oligosaccharides and polysaccharides the first three of which make up the water soluble carbohydrates klevenhusen and zebeli 2021 the main polysaccharides in plants namely starch cellulose and hemicellulose are insoluble carbohydrates starch is mainly found in cereals and rarely in green plants klevenhusen and zebeli 2021 so cellulose and hemicellulose are the main insoluble carbohydrates in svw the value of carbohydrate content minus cellulose and hemicellulose content can represent the major water soluble carbohydrate content in svw which were more abundant in chinese cabbage 39 9 0 9 cabbage 48 7 0 6 and garlic 39 1 0 1 than in rapeseed cake 30 7 1 6 rapid dissolution of water soluble carbohydrates such as glucose sucrose and raffinose caused elevated soluble polysaccharides in cca ca and ga groups during the acidification process saccharides were quickly utilized and reduced fig s1a among the four types of svw the rapeseed cake had the highest protein content of 34 41 0 49 and the highest lipid content of 8 22 0 14 table 1 which was in accordance with the fact that both the highest soluble protein concentration fig s1b 393 11 13 30 mg l on day 7 and the highest ammonia nitrogen concentration fig 2e 492 36 11 94 mg l on day 40 occurred in ra group the calculated free ammonia concentrations 0 25 5 08 mg l shown in fig s2 were well below the inhibitory concentrations reported in literatures 80 150 mg l jiang et al 2019 therefore the ad in this study was not inhibited by ammonia released from the biomass due to the relatively low carbohydrate content high protein and lipid contents in the rapeseed cake the concentrations of scod and tvfas in ra group were in a lower level throughout the co digestion process carbohydrates proteins and lipids are the three main components of was and fw carbohydrates can be rapidly hydrolyzed into simple saccharides and then fermented into vfas while proteins are hydrolyzed to amino acids and lipids are hydrolyzed to glycerol and long chain fatty acids at a lower rate before being further degraded to vfas when carbohydrates were rapidly degraded the degradation of proteins would be temporarily stalled yang et al 2015 consequently the hydrolysis and acidification processes in the ra group were relatively mild the progressive hydrolysis and acidification of carbohydrates proteins and lipids could avoid acid inhibition and maintain a balanced environment for methanogenic microorganisms overall rapeseed cake is a more suitable candidate for co digestion with was for methane production since its balanced nutrient profile 50 12 1 18 carbohydrate 34 41 0 49 protein and 8 22 0 14 lipids does not lead to excessive accumulation of vfas and too low ph value 3 2 effects of svw types on p release from was figs 3 a and s3 show the variation in soluble po4 p and p release efficiency during the co digestion of was with different svw respectively the addition of svw facilitated p release but the effect depended on the type of svw the soluble po4 p concentration increased quickly within the first 2 days and kept increasing within 10 days and then decreased since svw also released p we set up another group of experiments to test the p release from sole svw and the results are shown in fig s4 after deducting the soluble po4 p released from svw p release from was increased by 9 8 15 5 24 9 and 13 4 on day 10 by adding chinese cabbage cabbage rapeseed cake and garlic respectively there are several mechanisms for p release from was in an ad system 1 biological p release due to disintegration and hydrolysis of microbial cellular material 2 the decomposition of polyphosphate in polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos 3 metal phosphate dissolution under acidic conditions 4 p release resulted from biological activities related to iron reduction and sulfate reduction saoudi et al 2022 paos can achieve more than 90 of the p release when enough carbon is available guilayn et al 2017 all co digestion groups in this work had sufficient carbon sources for p release by paos as evidenced by the abundance of vfas the ph decrease can promote p release by dissolving inorganic p such as feps however although the ra group had the lowest concentration of vfas and the highest ph the best enhancement of p release was achieved this suggests microbial activities such as iron reduction and sulfate reduction might play an important role in p release as shown in fig 3b the soluble fe ii in co digestion groups increased first and then gradually decreased in the course of ad the solid fe ii also increased at the end of co digestion fig s5 indicating that fe iii was reduced to fe ii and finally precipitated in the solid phase dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria are capable of reducing fe iii to fe ii using organics such as vfas wu et al 2021 during the reduction of fe iii p to fe ii p a portion of phosphate could be released into the liquid phase eq 1 and soluble fe ii could react with sulfides to form iron sulfides eqs 2 and 3 which further promoted p release haaning nielsen et al 2005 hu et al 2019 yu et al 2021 1 3 f e p o 4 f e 3 p o 4 2 p o 4 3 2 f e 2 h s f e s h 3 f e 2 s 2 f e s to further prove the occurrence of iron reduction anaerobic sludge samples taken from the control and co digestion groups on day 40 were collected freeze dried and characterized by xps in fe 2p spectra fig 4 a the peaks centered at 709 9 ev represent fe ii s yu et al 2020 suggesting that the sulfur contained in svw and was was transformed to sulfide and then reacted with fe ii to form fes during co digestion the peaks at 162 9 ev that appear in s 2p spectra also confirm the existence of fes fig 4b ahmed et al 2019 the peaks at 711 6 ev are ascribed to fe iii po4 wang and sherwood 2002 which was not biologically reduced it can be observed that there was more unreduced fe iii in the control group therefore the higher p release in ra group was probably resulted from the higher sulfur content in the rapeseed cake three sulfur species organic sulfur sulfate and sulfide and two sulfur conversion pathways organic sulfur conversion and sulfate reduction during the ad of was or fw have been demonstrated forouzanmehr et al 2022 li et al 2020 during the ad process organic sulfur can be hydrolyzed and degraded by anaerobes to sulfides hs s2 and h2s and volatile sulfur compounds methyl mercaptan ethanethiol dimethyl sulfide dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide and volatile sulfur compounds are subsequently converted to sulfides by sulfate reducing bacteria methanogens etc zhang et al 2023 sulfides are also the products of sulfate reduction and play a key role in the p release as shown in eqs 4 5 6 and 7 sulfides have the ability to induce the reduction of fe iii to fe ii and to release p from feps while forming iron sulfides and elemental sulfur hu et al 2019 wilfert et al 2020 yu et al 2021 4 2 f e 3 h s 2 f e 2 s 0 h 5 2 f e 3 3 s 2 2 f e s s 0 6 3 f e p o 4 1 5 s 2 f e 3 p o 4 2 1 5 s 0 p o 4 3 7 f e 3 p o 4 2 3 s 2 3 f e s 2 p o 4 3 after 10 days vfas were gradually consumed fig 2b and the ph increased fig 2c creating an environment conducive to metal precipitation therefore soluble po4 p decreased due to the precipitation of po4 p with metal ions at higher ph or adsorption of po4 p to precipitates melia et al 2017 not only iron but also other metal ions such as aluminum magnesium and calcium are abundant in sludge which can react with dissolved phosphate to form precipitates thus resolidifying p melia et al 2017 yu et al 2021 3 3 microbial community analysis 3 3 1 microbial diversity shannon index is one of the most commonly used alpha diversity indices for estimating the microbial community diversity of samples a higher shannon index indicates a larger community diversity as shown in fig s6 compared with the control the shannon index decreased by 18 3 28 8 26 1 and 33 7 at day 10 in the cca ca ra and ga groups respectively but increased slightly at day 27 the initial decline of microbial community diversity should be due to the release of bactericidal substances from svw hydrolysis and the acidic environment formed by acidification as the digestion proceeded microorganisms were acclimated to the new environment and the proliferation of new dominant microorganisms might occur in co digestion groups resulting in a slightly higher shannon index in addition different types of svw promoted the colonization of different species of microorganisms as shown in fig 5 a the bacterial community compositions of the co digestion groups with svw addition were significantly different from the control group the ra group exhibited the closest resemblance to the control group whereas the other co digestion groups cca ca ga were more similar to one another which may be related to the similar properties of chinese cabbage cabbage and garlic as well as the occurrence of acid inhibition in the corresponding co digestion groups the similarity of the archaeal community composition of co digested sludge samples in fig 5b is consistent with the regularity of bacterial community composition fig 5a 3 3 2 microbial composition and variation the results of microbial community in the control and co digestion groups at 10 and 27 d show that svw promoted the proliferation of bacteria with functions such as organics degradation h2 production iron reduction and sulfate reduction fig 6 firmicutes bacteroidota proteobacteria chloroflexi acidobacteriota and actinobacteriota were dominant bacteria in co digestion systems fig 6a most bacteria belonging to these phyla contribute to degrading organics and fermenting vfas ariesyady et al 2007 xu et al 2018 the phylum firmicutes and bacteroidota in all co digestion groups were enriched but proteobacteria and chloroflexi were weakened it was reported that firmicutes was the dominant bacteria for lignocellulosic substrates degradation and had a good tolerance with low ph zheng et al 2015 meanwhile firmicutes are syntrophic bacteria that can degrade vfas and produce h2 for hydrogenotrophic methanogens rivière et al 2009 bacteroidota plays a crucial role in protein hydrolysis positively correlated with proteins input and vfas production yi et al 2014 with the addition of svw the content of organic matters like lignocellulose and protein increased so that firmicutes and bacteroidota in co digestion groups were enriched the relative abundance of chloroflexi decreased due to its sensitivity to ph fluctuation xu et al 2018 with the accumulation of vfas and the decline of ph in co digestion groups bacteria unable to adapt to low ph decreased and firmicutes gradually dominated eventually firmicutes and bacteroidota dominated in acidic environments bacteria associated with hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as the family clostridiaceae synergistaceae sprirochaetaceae and rikenecellaceae were enriched with the addition of svw on day 10 the relative abundance of clostridiaceae increased from 0 85 control to 27 36 25 39 1 89 and 29 33 in cca ca ra and ga groups respectively the family clostridiaceae has been reported to associate with high h2 production and most members can undergo syntrophic acetate oxidation in the presence of hydrogenotrophic methanogen cabrol et al 2017 the rikenecellaceae increased more significantly in cca ca and ga groups which can degrade amino acids and collaborate with hydrogenotrophic methanogen in a syntrophic relationship serna garcía et al 2020 members of the families synergistaceae and sprirochaetaceae are acetogenic bacteria capable of syntrophic acetate oxidation and can cooperate with hydrogenotrophic methanogens suksong et al 2019 which were more apparently enriched in the ra group in addition because members of the family synergistaceae are related to protein hydrolysis and can release acetate propionate and butyrate from peptides serna garcía et al 2020 synergistaceae could facilitate the degradation of proteins derived from rapeseed cake on the level of genus the relative abundance of clostridium sensu stricto 12 in cca ca ra and ga groups on day 10 enhanced from 0 062 control to 19 09 12 23 0 87 and 5 17 respectively the clostridium sensu stricto 1 was enriched mainly in ca and ga groups which increased from 0 69 control to 2 89 and 18 70 on day 10 respectively both clostridium sensu stricto 12 and clostridium sensu stricto 1 were the predominant h2 producing genus in co digestion groups li et al 2022 notably clostridium may also play a role in p release because it can reduce iron during anaerobic fermentation lovley 1991 bacteroides were reported to have high fe iii reduction capability by metabolizing glucose wang et al 2010 which can facilitate p release from was the relative abundance of bacteroides in cca ca ra and ga groups on day 10 were 9 57 0 64 26 56 and 0 012 respectively among all svw rapeseed cake was the most effective in promoting p release from was probably due to the high relative abundance of bacteroides in the ra group norank f norank o bacteroidales were acetic acid producers zhang et al 2014 that increased in ca and ga groups resulting in high concentrations of vfas in these groups as a result of the high polysaccharides content in chinese cabbage cabbage and garlic addition parabacteroides were enriched in cca ca and ga groups which are saccharolytic bacteria transforming polysaccharides to acetate and succinate zhang et al 2016 caldisericum desulfovibrio and smithella capable of reducing sulfate kremer and hansen 1988 tang et al 2022 increased in all co digestion groups it was reported that low molecular organic acids and h2 could be used as electron donors by caldisericum to reduce sulfate to sulfide kremer and hansen 1988 wang et al 2019 overall it can be observed that more h2 producing bacteria iron reducing bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria were enriched by adding svw which contributed to the methane production and p release in the archaea community the co digestion groups with svw addition were dominated by methanogens capable of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis including methanobacterium methanobrevibacter and unclassified f methanobacteriaceae while the acetoclastic methanogen methanosaeta decreased the rda analysis in fig 5b demonstrates that methanosaeta showed a significant negative correlation with tvfas and a positive correlation with ph indicating that methanosaeta were inhibited due to acid accumulation and ph reduction whereas other hydrogenotrophic methanogens were less inhibited it was also observed that substrates such as polysaccharides proteins and vfas had significant effects on the composition of archaea in detail the hydrogenotrophic methanogens prefer acidic environments whereas acetoclastic methanogens are more adapted to neutral ph li et al 2018 the relative abundance of methanosaeta on day 27 decreased from 28 17 control to 0 35 0 13 27 82 and 0 18 in cca ca ra and ga groups respectively methanosaeta is a representative acetoclastic methanogen and usually predominates at low acetate concentration which can be replaced by methanosarcina under extreme conditions such as high salt ammonia nitrogen and vfas kurade et al 2019 methanosaeta and methanosarcina are the only two known acetoclastic methanogenesis genera currently methanosarcina is considered as a powerful and versatile methanogen because of its high growth rates resistance to ph changes and the ability to perform three types of methanogenesis acetoclastic hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogenesis de vrieze et al 2012 due to the accumulation of vfas decrease in ph and release of sulfur containing antimicrobial substances in all co digestion groups with the addition of svw methanosarcina increased to overtake methanosaeta in cca ca ra and ga groups on day 27 the relative abundance of methanosarcina increased from 0 41 control to 33 76 28 11 20 38 and 16 88 respectively both methanosaeta and methanosarcina were able to survive in the ra group owing to the more balanced nutrition and less vfas accumulation thus methanosaeta did not decrease obviously and the population of various archaea remained balanced in the ra group among hydrogenotrophic methanogens the methanobacterium has a shorter doubling time and the highest average growth rate which is more adaptable to dynamic environments guo et al 2022 consequently methanobacterium augmented and dominated in cca ca and ra groups with relative abundances of 63 13 61 60 and 45 45 respectively another typical hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanobrevibacter predominated in the ga group with a relative abundance of 68 17 the correlation analysis between archaea and bacteria proved the positive correlation between h2 producing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens fig s7 methanobrevibacter and unclassified f methanobacteriaceae were found to be positively correlated with clostridiaceae another methanogen capable of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis methanosarcina was also positively correlated with synergistaceae and rikenecellaceae in summary the addition of svw changed the diversity and abundance of bacteria and archaea and the interaction between microorganisms was the key mechanism promoting methanogenesis and p release fig 7 the simultaneous enrichment of h2 producing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens illustrated the conversion of acetoclastic methanogenesis to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis resulting from svw addition the cooperation between h2 producing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens alleviated acid inhibition and improved methane production the promotion in p release was attributed to the proliferation of iron reducing and sulfate reducing bacteria 3 4 metagenomic analysis a further metagenomic analysis was conducted to investigate the influence of svw on the metabolic pathways of methane production and sulfate reduction the results demonstrated that metabolism of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and sulfate reduction were strengthened while the acetoclastic methanogenesis was weakened which coincided with microbial community variations key functional enzymes of these two metabolic pathways are summarized in figs 8 10 and table s2 overall most functional enzymes associated with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis increased significantly but those related to acetoclastic methanogenesis decreased compared to the control functional enzymes involved in the co2 reduction pathway associated with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis including formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase ec 1 2 7 12 formylmethanofuran tetrahydromethanopterin formyltransferase ec 2 3 1 101 methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase ec 3 5 4 27 and methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase ec 1 5 98 1 increased by 76 05 407 98 in ca cca and ra groups especially in the cca group the 5 10 methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase ec 1 5 98 2 coenzyme f420 hydrogenase ec 1 12 98 1 tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase ec 2 1 1 86 and methyl com reductase ec 2 8 4 1 were also enriched by 25 32 336 45 which were functional enzymes of the last step of methane generation pathway shared by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis in summary a great majority of functional enzymes associated with methanogenesis were promoted with svw addition thereby promoting methane production efficiency at the genetic level the microbial contribution to specific functions were evaluated by correlation analysis on the basis of the correspondence between microorganisms and functional traits as illustrated in fig 9 for the contribution of the top 10 methanogens to methanogenic enzymes methanosaeta and methanolinea were the main contributors of methanogenic enzymes in the control the major contributors of methanogenic enzymes in the ra group were similar to the control mainly including methanosaeta methanobacterium and methanolinea after the addition of svw the contributions of methanosaeta to formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase ec 1 2 7 12 phosphoenolpyruvate synthase ec 2 7 9 2 glycine hydroxymethyltransferase ec 2 1 2 1 methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase ec 1 5 98 1 tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase ec 2 1 1 86 and methyl com reductase ec 2 8 4 1 were reduced in all co digestion groups in cca and ca groups the contribution of methanosaeta to all methanogenic enzymes decreased but the contributions of methanosarcina and methanobacterium were strengthened the contributions of methanobacterium increased significantly to 28 10 ec 1 2 7 12 63 31 ec 2 3 1 101 52 60 ec 3 5 4 27 44 59 ec 1 5 98 1 44 82 ec 1 12 98 1 58 40 ec 1 5 98 2 37 04 ec 2 1 1 86 50 11 ec 2 8 4 1 in the cca group and 21 77 ec 1 2 7 12 57 14 ec 2 3 1 101 29 31 ec 3 5 4 27 51 27 ec 1 5 98 1 27 82 ec 1 12 98 1 12 59 ec 1 5 98 2 32 63 ec 2 1 1 86 36 03 ec 2 8 4 1 in the ca group the contribution of methanosarcina to methanogenic enzymes increased in all co digestion groups and it was a main contributor to methanogenic enzymes in cca ca and ga groups as the largest contributor of methanogenic enzymes in the ga group the contributions of methanobrevibacter were enhanced to 38 63 ec 1 2 7 12 59 86 ec 2 3 1 101 66 67 ec 3 5 4 27 54 10 ec 1 5 98 1 45 77 ec 1 12 98 1 53 68 ec 1 5 98 2 51 80 ec 2 1 1 86 and 56 73 ec 2 8 4 1 microbial contribution analysis demonstrated that the contribution to methanogenic enzymes in co digestion groups was mainly made by methanogens capable of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis including methanobacterium methanobrevibacter and methanosarcina which was consistent with the variation pattern of microbial community the addition of svw improved sulfur metabolism and had an effect on p release for sulfate reduction the enhancements in relative abundance of assimilatory sulfate reduction m00176 in cca ca and ga groups were 4 20 14 52 and 19 15 respectively and the relative abundance of dissimilatory sulfate reduction m00596 increased by 4 82 16 83 and 10 78 respectively compared to the control fig 10 however in the ra group both m00176 and m00596 were attenuated implying that sulfate reduction was not the major reason for the p release in the ra group the best p release in the ra group should be attributed to the synergistic effect of fermentative bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria iron reducing bacteria and methanogens as well as the higher sulfur content in the rapeseed cake rapeseed cake had more organic sulfur than other svw which can be converted to sulfides by fermentative bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogens and then phosphate in feps was released owing to the reaction between sulfides and feps li et al 2020 zhang et al 2023 moreover the highest relative abundance of bacteroides was found in the ra group 26 56 which could perform fe iii reduction and thus promote p release wang et al 2010 as a module related to organic sulfur conversion the relative abundance of cysteine biosynthesis m00021 rose in all co digestion groups with 11 00 23 20 10 29 and 15 94 improvement in cca ca ra and ga groups respectively the metabolism of cysteine is associated with sulfur containing proteins which should contribute to the transformation of organic sulfur the transformation pathway of various sulfur containing organics in svw during ad and their role in p release need further investigation 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that the co digestion of svw and was improved methane production and p release when was was co digested with chinese cabbage cabbage rapeseed cake and garlic methane production increased by 35 3 31 7 33 9 and 7 3 respectively meanwhile the p release from was was improved by 9 8 15 5 24 9 and 13 4 respectively with the addition of svw more fes was formed compared with the control there was a significant enrichment in bacteria cooperating with hydrogenotrophic methanogens iron reducing bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens archaea metabolic pathways for methane production and sulfate reduction were strengthened especially hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis the addition of chinese cabbage cabbage or rapeseed cake significantly boosted enzymes involved in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis by 76 05 407 98 in which methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase ec 1 5 98 1 was promoted the most rapeseed cake was an appropriate co substrate for simultaneously enhancing methane production and p release from was this study not only provides a prospective strategy for the ecological disposal of such kind of organic solid wastes but also provides an insight into the co digestion of svw with was to improve energy and p recovery efficiencies declaration
