15000,the removal of dissolved and particulate iron fe from contaminated mine drainage is an omnipresent challenge in and legacy of the mining industry worldwide the sizing of settling ponds and surface flow wetlands for passive fe removal from circumneutral ferruginous mine water is based either on a linear concentration independent area adjusted removal rate or flat assignment of an experience based retention time neither of which reflects the underlying fe removal kinetics in this study we evaluated the fe removal performance of a pilot scale passive system operating in three identical parallel lines for treatment of mining influenced ferruginous seepage water to determine and parameterise a robust application orientated model approach for sizing of settling ponds and surface flow wetlands each by systematically varying flow rates and thus residence time we were able to demonstrate that the sedimentation driven removal of particulate hydrous ferric oxides in settling ponds may be approximated by a simplified first order approach at low to moderate fe levels the first order coefficient was found in the order of 2 1 0 7 10 2 h 1 which corresponds well with previous laboratory studies the sedimentation kinetics may be combined with the preceding fe ii oxidation kinetics to estimate the required residence time for pre treatment of ferruginous mine water in settling ponds in contrast fe removal in surface flow wetlands is more complex due to the phytologic component which is why we advanced the established area adjusted fe removal approach by parameterising the underlying concentration dependency for polishing of pre treated mine water the quantitative results of this study provide a novel conservative approach for customised sizing of

introduction industrial scale coal lignite and metal mining are commonly associated with the generation of contaminated mine drainage that requires treatment to protect receiving freshwater environments mine water treatment is increasingly facilitated in eco technological passive systems that harness and enhance natural biogeochemical and physical processes for removal of various contaminants skousen et al 2017 passive systems are often regarded as a more sustainable and cost effective approach for mine water treatment especially for circumneutral ferruginous mine waters that predominantly require the removal of iron fe as ubiquitous contaminant in mining environments hedin 2008 passive fe removal is commonly achieved in surface flow systems through oxidation of dissolved fe ii and subsequent sedimentation or filtration of the resultant particulate hydrous ferric oxides hereinafter fe oh 3 hedin et al 1994 skousen et al 2017 aerobic passive systems for iron removal commonly consist of consecutive aeration cascades for oxygenation settling ponds for pre treatment and surface flow wetlands for polishing hedin et al 1994 basically settling ponds provide retention time for oxidation of fe ii and sedimentation of the bulk fe oh 3 load whereas subsequent wetlands facilitate sedimentation or filtration of the remaining colloidal fe oh 3 in the dense vegetation to reliably meet specific discharge limits opitz et al 2021 the assembly of consecutive treatment stages in integrated systems for treatment of circumneutral ferruginous mine water is rather vaguely defined in the literature broadly aiming at 50 to 80 fe removal in settling ponds depending on fe loading to protect the subsequent wetlands from overloading kruse et al 2009 parker 2003 this latent ambiguity is attributable to the underlying sizing practice for both settling ponds and wetlands that is largely based on concentration independent rules of thumb which are ill defined for more customised designing and sizing of integrated passive systems banks 2003 sapsford 2013 only few approaches for sizing of settling ponds are to be found in the literature as compiled in tab s1a none of which became standard practice to date kruse et al 2009 early recommendations were derived from the wastewater sector for instance assigning an overflow rate of 1 10 5 m s to broadly allow for settling of clay sized particles national coal board 1982 however mine discharges often require additional retention time to allow for fe ii oxidation and it was also found that the aggregation and sedimentation behaviour of freshly precipitated fe oh 3 distinctly differs from soil or sewage particles hove et al 2008 sapsford 2013 commonest in the literature is the experience based assignment of either a flat hydraulic retention time hrt in the order of 8 to 48 h or a hydraulic loading rate in the order of 100 m² l s to broadly allow for both fe ii oxidation and settling of larger particles tab s1b overall banks 2003 noted that performance evaluation of settling ponds is rather scarce relative to wetlands which is why wetland sizing is at times transferred to settling ponds various sizing approaches for surface flow wetlands were developed for treatment of acidic and neutral mine water most of which are based on empirical area adjusted fe removal rates as compiled in tab s1b eventually a recommendation for areal sizing of wetlands was issued by the former us bureau of mines hedin et al 1994 that was henceforth adopted in various guidelines e g piramid consortium 2003 skousen et al 1998 watzlaf et al 2004 the wetland area a is calculated from fe loading and an empirical area adjusted sizing constant ra 1 a q f e i n f e o u t r a with q as volumetric flow rate and fe in and fe out as inflow and target effluent fe concentration respectively this approach suggests that fe removal rates in wetlands are constant over time and independent of concentration which corresponds to a zero order removal process the areal sizing coefficient ra was estimated from operational full scale wetlands ranging from 10 g m² d for formal approval procedures to 20 g m² d for basic water quality improvement at legacy mine sites however it should be noted that the established sizing criteria were derived from passive systems treating highly ferruginous mine discharges which is why hedin et al 1994 noted that the areal approach is subject to a loading limitation accordingly a wide range from 1 up to and above 50 g m² d were reported for full scale settling ponds and wetlands as compiled in tab s2 most observations are markedly below 10 g m² d and it was shown that areal fe removal is predominantly governed by fe loading and ph mayes et al 2009 younger 2000 although the areal approach is commonly considered and has proven to be relatively robust for classic ferruginous coal mine discharges there is general agreement that the multicausal relationship between overall fe removal on the one hand and the size of settling ponds or wetlands on the other hand is inadequately described by a linear relationship e g flanagan et al 1994 johnson and hallberg 2002 kruse et al 2009 mayes et al 2009 sapsford 2013 stark and williams 1995 from a process based perspective passive fe removal in settling ponds proceeds along two major presumably rate determining steps namely 1 oxidation of dissolved fe ii followed by 2 sedimentation of the resultant fe oh 3 the oxidative transition from ferrous to ferric fe has been investigated intensively and respective kinetics are well described in the literature e g millero et al 1987 stumm and morgan 1996 the basic homogeneous fe ii oxidation process may be approximated by the following kinetic equation where the oxidation constant kox is substituted by a pseudo first order constant k ox at stable ph and oxygen levels that is second order with respect to h or oh and first order with respect to o2 2 d f e i i d t k o x f e i i o 2 h 2 k o x f e i i this relationship was broadly confirmed for mining environments by extensive field studies dempsey et al 2001 kirby et al 1999 although it is important to note that the process is considerably accelerated in ferruginous mine waters by heterogeneous fe ii oxidation owing to the autocatalytic effect of omnipresent freshly precipitated fe oh 3 as demonstrated by dietz and dempsey 2017 a quantitative assessment of fe oh 3 sedimentation in mining environments was made by sapsford and watson 2011 and sapsford 2013 reporting that settling of these precipitates can be described by a first order process with rates varying for different mine waters 3 d f e o h 3 d t k s e d f e o h 3 the first order sedimentation coefficient ksed was initially estimated in the order of 9 4 10 3 to 3 2 10 1 h 1 based on column experiments by sapsford 2013 whereas laboratory experiments containing both ferrous and ferric fe displayed rather complex or inconclusive patterns a targeted experiment with oxygenated mine water containing only fe oh 3 displayed an exponential decay curve with ksed 2 3 10 2 h 1 sutton et al 2015 sapsford and warson 2011 noted that application of fe removal kinetics may be a way forward to describe the performance of passive mine water treatment systems more accurately encouraging abandonment of the established areal approach for more application orientated model approaches governed by hrt when designing integrated passive treatment schemes such empirical simplified first order models are frequently utilised in ecological engineering sciences above all for passive wastewater treatment systems to estimate the exponential removal or decay of dissolved and suspended compounds through natural biogeochemical and physical processes kadlec and wallace 2009 in a recent sedimentation study opitz et al 2022a we were able to demonstrate that fe oh 3 sedimentation across a wide concentration range 3 240 mg l may be described by a mixed first and second order model the sedimentation process is governed by two interrelated regimes with a rapid aggregation driven step of second order at high iron levels followed by a slower settling step of first order at lower iron levels the respective coefficients were determined with kr1 9 4 10 3 m³ g h and kr2 5 4 10 3 h 1 4 d f e o h 3 d t k r 2 f e o h 3 k r 1 f e o h 3 2 moreover we were able to demonstrate that fe oh 3 removal at moderate fe levels 10 mg l may be reasonably well approximated by the simplifying first order relationship in eq 3 as proposed by sapsford 2013 the respective sedimentation coefficient ksed was determined with 2 4 0 4 10 2 h 1 in column experiments opitz et al 2022a which is consistent with the initial estimates reported by sapsford 2013 and sutton et al 2015 in summary the current state of knowledge implies that it is necessary to advance the established sizing practices for both settling ponds and wetlands to account for fe removal dynamics especially in the face of progressively strict environmental regulation in this study we evaluated the fe oh 3 removal performance of a trifurcated pilot system for passive treatment of a mining influenced ferruginous seepage water variation of flow rates in the identical triplicate system lines allowed for evaluation of fe oh 3 removal as a function of mass flow further on fe oh 3 removal in the pilot scale settling ponds and wetlands was evaluated regarding different model approaches as outlined above the overall objective was to determine and parameterise robust application orientated fe removal models that could also be used for sizing of settling ponds and wetlands the dual approach combining fundamental laboratory studies with pilot scale field trials offers considerable prospects to advance our knowledge on fe removal mechanisms and kinetics in passive mine water treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and pilot plant the westfield study site is a former open pit in the historic lignite district of upper palatinate southeast germany the pit was only partly backfilled with waste rock and power plant ashes leaving a morphological depression behind seepage water collecting in a drainage pond at the lowest point of the former pit is ferruginous and highly mineralised owing to pyrite oxidation and lixiviation of soluble compounds from the backfill yet circumneutral due to the alkalising character of the dumped electrostatic precipitator ashes tab s3 the seepage water is continuously pumped out from the drainage pond for protection of adjacent aquifers to a conventional physico chemical treatment plant for fe removal opitz et al 2022b the westfield pilot plant was implemented in 2017 next to the operational conventional treatment plant to test an integrated three stage passive scheme with settling ponds for pre treatment surface flow wetlands for polishing and sediment filters for purification as long term alternative for treatment of the mining influenced seepage water fig 1 the three consecutive treatment stages were built as identical parallel triplicates such that hydraulic variation in the three system lines generated a comprehensive database the primary objective of the pilot plant was to lower total fe below the strict site specific discharge limit of 1 mg l the basic setup and performance of the multistage pilot plant for removal of relevant contaminants e g fe mn as nh4 turbidity are detailed in opitz et al 2022b in this study we focus on fe oh 3 removal in settling ponds and wetlands standard roll off containers 7 0 2 35 1 25 m were utilised as both settling ponds and wetlands with water depth adjusted to approx 1 0 and 0 45 m respectively the wetlands were planted with common reed at 20 plants m² in a sandy 0 3 m substrate the steel containers were embedded into the ground for isolation and connected by a polyethylene pipework system ten monitoring points mp01 mp10 for sensor installation and sample collection were installed in protected concrete manholes before and after the containers with settling ponds fed from mp01 settling pond outflows corresponding to wetland inflows mp02 mp04 and wetland outflows corresponding to sediment filter inflows mp05 mp07 as schematically illustrated in fig 1 the ferruginous seepage water is thoroughly oxygenated within the seepage water distribution system which is why the pilot plant s inflow fe concentration was relatively low with ferrous and total fe in the order of 1 and 8 mg l respectively thus the westfield pilot plant provided a comparatively rare opportunity to quantify fe oh 3 removal kinetics independent of fe ii oxidation 2 2 hydraulic characterisation flow rates in the three parallel system lines of the pilot plant were adjusted by ball valves and recorded by flowmeters stübbe dfm200 at a 30 s interval in the three feeding lines branching off mp01 fig 1 in addition impulse response tracer tests were conducted for hydraulic characterisation of the container based system several tracer tests were conducted in both settling ponds and wetlands at incremental steady flow rates by pulse injection of rhodamin wt acros organics into the inlets outflow fluorescence was recorded by a cyclops 7 fluorometer turner designs at a 30 s interval tracer tests were conducted in winter when plant density and thermal mixing are relatively low to obtain a conservative estimate of the actual residence time distribution rtd braskerud 2001 fluorescence measurements were corrected for temperature following smart and laidlaw 1977 and converted to tracer concentration following bodin et al 2012 to determine concentration normalised and cumulative rtd functions e t and f t 5 e t q c t i 1 n q c i t δ t 6 f t i 1 n e t δ t flow rate q and effluent tracer concentration c were averaged to a 10 min interval t for ease of handling and to smooth tracer response curves cumulative effluent tracer mass mout mean hrt tm and variance σ² were calculated as the zeroth first and second moments of the rtd to determine tracer recovery centroid and spread of the tracer response curves respectively 7 m o u t i 1 n q c i t δ t 8 t m i 1 n t e t δ t 9 σ 2 i 1 n t m t 2 e t δ t the hydraulic efficiency λ of settling ponds and wetlands was calculated as the ratio of nominal hrt tn and tracer peak time tp following persson et al 1999 with the intrinsic nominal hrt calculated from the container geometry with water depth z and volume v 10 t n a z q v q 11 λ t p t n 2 3 hydrochemical monitoring water samples for fe analysis were collected twice weekly at all measuring points over approx one year 07 2018 to 06 2019 two samples were collected one filtered at 0 45 µm and acidified with 150 µl of 1 m hcl to immediately quench fe ii oxidation the other unfiltered and acidified with 150 µl of 12 m hcl to additionally re dissolve dispersed fe oh 3 samples were cooled to 4 c before transport to the laboratory for spectrophotometric analysis at 512 nm hach dr 3800 vis using acetate buffer solution and 1 10 phenantroline filtered samples were analysed for dissolved fe ii and unfiltered samples for total fe using ascorbic acid for fe iii reduction this procedure allowed determination of not only dissolved species but also particulate and total fe opitz et al 2020 all chemicals used for stabilisation calibration or standards were analytical grade 2 4 data analysis fe removal in the pilot plant was evaluated based on inflow outflow fe concentration system geometry flow rate and hrt as illustrated in fig 2 to generate a comprehensive dataset flow rates in the three parallel system lines were alternated between 100 and 500 l h to vary hydraulic loading flow rates were aggregated as medians around the fe samplings to smooth hydraulic fluctuations thus the final semi weekly dataset based on fe analyses and respectively aggregated flow rates includes 270 measurements 90 per system line for settling ponds and wetlands each in a first step fe oh 3 removal rates in both settling ponds and wetlands were evaluated as the change in concentration from inflow to outflow over retention time assuming approximatively stationary conditions in the containers as fe ii was negligible throughout the pilot system total fe concentration fe was used for evaluation of fe oh 3 removal 12 δ f e δ t f e o u t f e i n t n as the surface area of the pilot scale settling ponds and wetlands remained constant throughout the study eq 12 basically evaluates fe mass flow through the system as governed by flow rate from this it follows that fe removal rates as fe t are directly proportional to the area adjusted fe removal rate ra from eq 1 13 δ f e δ t f e o u t f e i n t n f e i n f e o u t q a z r a z 1 the water depth z of settling ponds and especially wetlands is usually infinitesimal relative to length and width although it should be noted that water depth effects in shallow wetlands are complex and not yet fully understood guo and cui 2021 shih and wang 2020 in a second step the extensive datasets were used to assess fe removal kinetics in the westfield pilot system based on the preceding column experiments it is reasonable to assume that fe oh 3 removal in bare settling ponds is ultimately governed by sedimentation and may thus be approximated by the relationships provided by opitz et al 2022a as the inflow fe level of the westfield pilot plant was consistently below 15 mg l the simplified first order approach rather than the mixed first second order model was used with the coefficient ksed obtained through integration and rearrangement of eq 3 14 k s e d ln f e o u t f e i n t n 1 the investigation of contaminant removal kinetics in passive treatment systems is generally complicated by the fact that usually just two datapoints namely inflow and outflow are measured that can only be related to system geometry and or hrt as illustrated in fig 2 also the westfield pilot plant was inevitably subject to various technical environmental and hydrodynamic effects including but not limited to small constructional differences between the three parallel system lines increasing reed density in wetlands during the second vegetation period intermittent flow rates and fe spikes in the reservoir feed caused by filling flushes wind driven currents rainfall or buoyancy in the open system such intrinsic and external spatiotemporal effects are commonly the primary limitation of pilot scale field trials all the more because most efficiency and performance criteria are developed for full scale systems with small dispersion indices chang et al 2016 philips et al 2005 therefore three strategies were adopted in this study to minimise potential errors firstly a comprehensive dataset was gathered from a trifurcated system to smooth inevitable fluctuations secondly collection of data extended over one year to ensure that different environmental conditions are represented in the dataset thus avoiding seasonal phytologic or meteorologic biases thirdly tracer tests were conducted to assess potential hydraulic or hydrodynamic shortcomings of the pilot scale system 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulics generally both settling ponds and wetlands show unimodal positively skewed breakthrough curves with elongated tails the tracer tests were terminated after 192 h to minimise imminent re cycling of tracer dye to the pilot plant via the westfields seepage water distribution system the lengthy exponential tail of the curves was extrapolated beyond truncation if needed not only for the sake of completeness but also to ensure a conservative estimate of the median hrt headley and kadlec 2007 extrapolation accounted for a small dye fraction only e g an average of 3 4 of total tracer mass for wetlands in depth evaluation revealed significant differences between settling ponds and wetlands settling pond rtd curves are characterised by an early tracer peak after only 3 to 11 h that is broadly independent of flow rate followed by a pronounced tail fig 3 a the shape indicates that part of the dye was transported through advective zones and exited the container early whereas the remaining dye scattered throughout the container before slowly bleeding out of mixed or stagnant zones these findings are in accordance with visual observations of the spreading dye wetland rtd curves show a more consistent classic shape fig 3b stretching of the curves with decreasing flow rate indicates increased mixing which is substantiated by a negative correlation between flow rate and variance r² 0 80 apparently preferential flow paths that are relevant at higher flow rates are stalled at lower flow rates table 1 the tracer peak is observed close to the nominal hrt with tn tp ratios of 0 68 0 08 visual observations showed effective flow distribution by the dense reed stands with dead zones confined to edge areas although rhodamin wt may be lost in wetlands due to sorption or photolysis lin et al 2003 average tracer recovery was around 90 results compiled in table 1 should be regarded with caution as to potential re cycling of tracer dye and tailing effects which was particularly problematic for prolonged tracer retention in settling ponds stephenson and sheridan 2021 nevertheless the tracer tests provide valuable insights into the hydraulics and hydrodynamics of the pilot plant according to the classification by persson et al 1999 hydraulic efficiency was poor in settling ponds and satisfactory in wetlands poor settling pond hydraulics are likely attributable to the unfavourable geometry i e low surface to depth ratio that is prone to preferential flow and dead zones shih and wang 2020 better wetland hydraulics are likely attributable to the higher surface to depth ratio shih et al 2013 and flow distribution by the dense vegetation verschoren et al 2017 altogether the hydraulic and hydrodynamic limitations of the westfield pilot plant prevent a robust linking of temporal fe removal and rtd guo and cui 2021 sheridan et al 2014 von sperling 2002 consequently the nominal hrt was used as a simplistic yet conservative estimate of actual residence time for evaluation of inversely exponential fe oh 3 removal because the pre nominal water portion discharged from the containers is subject to the highest removal rates whereas the post nominal water portion is subject to receding removal rates sapsford 2013 wahl et al 2010 3 2 iron removal inflow fe levels ranged from 2 7 to 14 5 mg l average 8 3 2 2 mg l in settling ponds and 0 64 to 7 3 mg l average 2 4 1 0 mg l in subsequent wetlands combined with the respective flow rates fe loading of settling ponds and wetlands as first to third quartiles ranged from 41 4 to 67 9 and 9 3 to 21 2 g h respectively over the course of the study period the westfield pilot plant was successful in reducing effluent fe levels below the site specific discharge limit of 1 mg l fig s1 the excellent treatment performance and operational reliability are attributable to the multistage setup where residual effluent concentrations are reliably polished in the successive stage s thus optimising overall treatment performance and mitigating natural performance fluctuations in the open system opitz et al 2022b as noted in the introduction the major fe removal mechanisms are expected to be nonlinearly correlated with inflow concentration to examine the relevance of the initial fe level on removal the fe removal rates in settling ponds and wetlands are plotted against the respective initial fe concentration for all 270 samplings both datasets in fig 4 show a significant concentration dependency with fe removal rates increasing with increasing initial concentration for settling ponds the concentration dependency in fig 4 may be reasonably well described by a linear regression although the adumbrated increase of the slope at higher fe levels could be indicative of a transition from settling to aggregation driven fe removal as suggested by the mixed model in eq 4 unfortunately the range of inflow fe concentrations max 14 5 mg l is insufficient for respective in depth evaluation interestingly the x intercept of the regression at 1 5 mg l indicates that sedimentation based fe removal in settling ponds is inherently limited at residual fe levels which corresponds with similar observations in the preceding sedimentation experiments where a residual colloidal fraction remained suspended for long time spans opitz et al 2022a for wetlands the concentration dependency in fig 4 is best described by a superlinear regression implying that fe removal in densely vegetated wetlands follows a more complex overall mechanism compared to bare settling ponds the multicausal polishing process may include but not be limited to sedimentation filtration adsorption and heteroaggregation verschoren et al 2017 hence there is good reason to assume that fe removal in wetlands is inadequately described by the same sedimentation model approach as in bare settling ponds it is however interesting to note that the regression asymptotically approaches the origin illustrating that wetlands in contrast to settling ponds are effective in retaining even finely dispersed residual colloids in the dense hydrophyte stands altogether the direct juxtaposition of both treatment stages highlights the superior treatment efficiency of densely vegetated wetlands relative to unvegetated settling ponds especially for polishing at low fe levels a tentative indication of the order of fe removal can be obtained by the double logarithmic plot of fe removal rates vs initial fe concentration in fig 5 for settling ponds the plot provides limited information due to the relatively stable inflow fe level from the reservoir with 50 of datapoints clustered between 7 2 and 9 6 mg l nevertheless the slope in the order of 1 3 indicates that fe removal may be reasonably well approximated by the simplified first order model at low to moderate fe levels such as observed in the westfield pilot plant moreover it is conceivable that the slope of 1 3 may in fact split in slopes of 1 sedimentation driven and 2 aggregation driven at lower and higher fe levels respectively as observed in the preceding column experiments yet again fig 5 gives no indication of the development of fe removal kinetics at higher initial fe levels and thus no empirical confirmation of the aggregation driven increase of fe removal dynamics evaluation of the settling ponds dataset for first order removal via eq 14 yields an overall coefficient ksed of 2 1 0 7 10 2 h 1 fig s1a which corresponds well with initial laboratory findings noted in the introduction the spread in ksed is attributable to a slight concentration dependency which is in accordance with the preceding column experiments that showed a similar effect due to receding homoaggregation of dispersed fe at lower fe levels opitz et al 2022a in wetlands the complexity of fe removal is substantiated by both the double logarithmic plot in fig 5 which clearly shows a broken order relationship over the dataset and by the scattering observed in fig s1b for the coefficient ksed as evaluated on a trial basis via eq 14 as fe removal in wetlands should also be expected to vary depending on ecological factors macrophyte species plant density water depth etc we propose to advance the established areal sizing approach by incorporating the concentration dependency empirically determined in this study rather than trying to establish an overall kinetic equation for the multicausal process to parameterise the extended areal fe removal model the removal rates in fig 4 were converted to areal fe removal rates following eq 13 the concentration dependency of ra for the pilot scale wetlands was fitted as r a m fe in n with m 0 2 and n 1 4 as illustrated by the superlinear regression in fig s2b 3 3 comparison with literature data in order to compare the westfield pilot plant data with literature data the area adjusted fe removal rates from tab s2 are compared to the converted areal fe removal rates from this study from fig s2 all passive systems compiled in tab s2 were implemented at abandoned coal mines in the anglo american area for treatment of ferruginous weakly acidic to weakly alkaline mine water ph range 4 7 to 8 1 it should be noted that the literature reports are often individual measurements rather than robust aggregated long term monitoring data and should thus be treated with caution for settling ponds the literature data corresponds reasonably well with the relationship derived in this study especially at low and moderate inflow fe levels this is somewhat surprising considering the wide range of pond configurations ferrous ferric ratios and ph of the literature data notably settling ponds with higher inflow fe levels display higher areal fe removal rates relative to the extrapolated relationship presumably owing to homoaggregation effects as demonstrated in the preceding column experiments opitz et al 2022a the three outliers marked in fig 6 a correspond to exceptionally deep settling ponds z 2 5 m indicating a maximised residence time per unit area such mass flux effects are altogether disregarded by an area based approach further evaluation of fe oh 3 removal kinetics from the data in tab s2a is precluded by missing data on hrt and or pond geometry as well as the usually large fe ii fraction in the inflow for wetlands an inconclusive pattern is observed in fig 6b with literature reports scattered both below and above the relationship from this study largely well below the established sizing criteria the main difficulty in comparing and evaluating wetland performance is the heterogeneity in not only mine water chemistry ph fe loading ferrous ferric ratio etc but also wetland configuration shape water depth substrate amendment macrophyte species plant density hydraulic efficiency etc as noted in respective surveys e g cravotta and brady 2015 stark and williams 1995 tarutis et al 1999 wieder 1989 the concentration dependant relationship developed in this study applies to polishing of residual colloidal fe from pre treated ferruginous mine water in relatively deep reed planted wetlands and is to the best of our knowledge the first such relationship developed for mine water treatment wetlands 3 4 simulation of iron removal in full scale settling ponds coupling of contaminant removal and retention time is increasingly used to model fe transport transformation and removal in mining impacted waters e g baken et al 2015 cravotta 2021 garcia rios et al 2021 yazbek et al 2021 as noted above in depth evaluation of passive fe removal in full scale treatment systems regarding the underlying kinetics is however generally limited because only inflow and outflow datapoints are available having said that the marchand system in pennsylvania listed in tab s2 is one of the largest and best characterised passive mine water treatment systems worldwide consisting of six consecutive settling ponds a to f with a combined surface area of 2 5 ha followed by a 2 9 ha wetland hedin 2008 according to long term monitoring data from 2007 to 2012 the circumneutral and highly ferruginous discharge from the abandoned marchand coal mine is estimated at an average 426 m³ h with an inflow fe concentration of 72 4 mg l that is successfully lowered below the discharge limit of 3 mg l hedin 2013 the intermediate sampling points of the consecutive settling ponds provide a rare opportunity to model the underlying fe removal kinetics by relative least square fitting of the concentration development along the flow path fig 7 based on nominal hrt of the settling ponds and assuming 80 oxygen saturation as well as a moderate average temperature of 10 c k ox was fitted at 3 3 10 2 h 1 which corresponds to a ph of 6 7 this assorts well with the ph range 6 3 to 7 1 and temperature annual average 13 to 14 c reported by hedin 2008 the first order coefficient ksed was fitted at 3 8 10 2 h 1 exceeding estimates from this study and thus substantiating the general impression from fig 6a as further discussed below altogether the kinetics based model approach works quite well to reproduce the observed fe concentration levels especially considering the fluctuation of critical parameters flow rate inflow fe hrt etc as reported by hedin 2008 2013 4 implications 4 1 rate determining iron removal processes as noted in the introduction research on fe removal in passive mine water treatment systems initially focussed on fe ii oxidation as the assumed rate determining step e g kirby et al 1999 tarutis et al 1999 while this is certainly applicable in acidic mine drainage fe ii oxidation in circumneutral mine water occurs demonstrably rapid dietz and dempsey 2017 therefore it is assumed that fe ii oxidation is only rate determining for unfavourable conditions such as acidic ph suboxic conditions or low temperatures e g flanagan et al 1994 hedin 2008 sapsford 2013 based on the results of this study we are now able to approximatively delineate the rate determining fe removal process at moderate fe levels to that end overall fe removal via consecutive fe ii oxidation and fe oh 3 sedimentation is analytically described by coupled integration of eqs 2 and 3 with 15 f e o u t f e i i i n e k o x t k o x f e i i i n e k o x t e k s e d t k s e d k o x f e o h 3 i n e k s e d t for two consecutive processes of first order the process with the smaller reaction constant is considered rate limiting capellos and bielski 1980 as k ox increases hundredfold with a ph increase by one unit the ph is ultimately the critical parameter stumm and morgan 1996 as illustrated in fig 8 fe ii oxidation is rate determining for overall fe removal under acidic conditions ph 6 whereas fe oh 3 sedimentation becomes rate determining under neutral or alkaline conditions ph 7 as previously suggested by sapsford 2013 the two processes are roughly equally paced at weakly acidic conditions ph 6 to 7 where k ox and ksed converge and where variations in ph temperature or oxygenation may play a critical role 4 2 transferability the model approaches developed in this study were derived from and tailored to the site specific challenges and boundary conditions of the westfield site i e a fully oxygenated moderately ferruginous seepage water subject to a strict fe discharge limit this starting situation differs from classic coal mine discharges that often exhibit high ferrous fe levels and moderate fe discharge limits therefore the model approaches developed in this study explicitly provide a conservative basis for sizing of settling ponds and wetlands in integrated passive systems focussing on low to moderate fe levels and aiming at utmost operational reliability in due consideration of strict discharge permit criteria in this context it is important to note that the kinetics based model approach for settling ponds oxidation and or sedimentation as combined in eq 15 disregards any catalytic effects such as heterogeneous fe ii oxidation dietz and dempsey 2017 aggregation driven fe oh 3 sedimentation chikanda et al 2021 or biogeochemical processes kappler et al 2021 melton et al 2014 therefore the simplified model is expected to underestimate overall fe removal at higher fe levels by way of example the elevated ksed fitted in fig 7 is likely attributable to the much higher fe level throughout the marchand system where fe oh 3 is expected to peak at 25 mg l after 24 h in settling ponds b and c providing sufficient dispersed solids for aggregation driven sedimentation the tendency of the model approaches developed in this study to underestimate overall fe removal dynamics by either disregarding or simplifying catalytic effects is to a certain extent intentional and imperative not only for the sake of simplification but also because engineering model approaches are expected to intrinsically err on the conservative side to avoid operational failure and resultant pollution of receiving surface waters this is particularly important in light of the complex interrelation of fe ii oxidation dynamics with gas transfer processes o2 diffusion and co2 degassing aggregation driven fe oh 3 sedimentation and actual rtd in passive systems as demonstrated by dempsey et al 2001 these aspects could not be investigated at the westfield site due to the seepage water chemistry and should thus be the focus of future studies on full scale systems to optimise the model approaches developed in this study 5 conclusions and outlook in light of the contemporary spreading of passive technologies whilst also tightening of environmental regulations worldwide it is inalienable to advance the sizing of passive mine water treatment systems the insights and quantitative results from the westfield pilot plant provide a novel scientific and technical basis for customised sizing of settling ponds and wetlands in due consideration of fe removal kinetics for settling ponds we propose utilising a kinetics based model approach for approximation of sedimentation driven fe oh 3 removal 16 a q ln fe out ln fe in k sed z the first order sedimentation coefficient ksed from the pilot scale settling ponds of 2 1 0 7 10 2 h 1 corresponds well with previous laboratory reports the approach may be extended to further consider the preceding fe ii oxidation step according to eq 15 with only a small set of standard input parameters fe concentration flow rate ph and simplifying assumptions e g moderate temperature steady ph as well as technical pre conditions e g pre aeration sound hydraulic design required to estimate the necessary hrt and thus pond size for overall fe removal the kinetics based model approach provides a more realistic sizing foundation compared to assignment of a flat hrt or areal fe removal rate especially at low to moderate fe levels that are ultimately relevant for strict discharge criteria for wetlands we propose to advance the established area adjusted sizing approach in eq 1 by incorporating the concentration dependency parameterised in this study such practical simplification of complex natural mitigation processes is common in the field of waste water treatment where sizing of engineered systems is typically achieved by conservative empirical formulae 17 a q fe in fe out m fe in n the coefficients m and n were empirically determined as 0 2 and 1 4 respectively for reliable polishing of finely dispersed colloidal fe in dense reed stands following pre treatment in settling ponds under these conditions the extended areal approach provides a more realistic approximation of the complex sedimentation and filtration mechanisms compared to the established linear approach finally eqs 16 and 17 show that the pond or wetland size is expected to be linearly correlated with flow rate whereas fe removal per unit area exponentially increases with increasing fe concentration therefore dilution or blending of mine discharges should generally be avoided to minimise not only pollutant dispersion but also the overall effort and land consumption of passive mine water treatment

15001,many aquatic environments contain cohesive sediments that flocculate and create flocs with a wide range of sizes the population balance equation pbe flocculation model is designed to predict the time dependent floc size distribution and should be more complete than models based on median floc size however a pbe flocculation model includes many empirical parameters to represent important physical chemical and biological processes we report a systematic investigation of key model parameters of the open source pbe based size class flocculation model flocmod verney lafite claude brun cottan and le hir 2011 using the measured temporal floc size statistics reported by keyvani and strom 2014 at a constant turbulent shear rate s results show that the median floc size d 50 in terms of both the equilibrium floc size and the initial floc growth is insufficient to constrain the model parameters a comprehensive error analysis shows that the model is capable of predicting three floc size statistics d 16 d 50 and d 84 which also reveals a clear trend that the best calibrated fragmentation rate inverse of floc yield strength is proportional to the floc size statistics considered motivated by this finding the importance of floc yield strength is demonstrated in the predicted temporal evolution of floc size by modeling the floc yield strength as microflocs and macroflocs giving two corresponding fragmentation rates the model shows a significantly improved agreement in matching the measured floc size statistics keywords flocculation population balance equation cohesive sediment yield strength data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction unlike non cohesive sediment such as sand cohesive sediments exhibit a unique physical process called flocculation that causes individual particles to stick together when two or more particles collide through flocculation the role of cohesive sediments in aquatic environments has a crucial impact on the ecosystem when particulate concentrations in the water column are high aquatic organisms face severe consequences due to the absence of photosynthesis low levels of dissolved oxygen and depletion of energy sources jones et al 2012 vaz et al 2019 simultaneously cohesive sediments exert a fundamental control on the fate of nutrients and organic matter and hence alter the water quality asmala et al 2022 furthermore low density hydrophobic substances such as oil droplets can be deposited on the seafloor due to flocculation with suspended particulate matters daly et al 2016 ye et al 2021 therefore studying flocculation dynamics of cohesive sediment is an important and thriving research subject in aquatic science and engineering flocculation is defined by two main processes that coexist simultaneously aggregation and fragmentation breakup aggregation may take place when cations from dissolved salt in water create surface bridging around clay particles and decrease their repulsion force sutherland et al 2015 moreover cohesion between particles can be significantly increased by bio cohesion such as extra cellular polymeric substance eps malpezzi et al 2013 passow and alldredge 1995 for energetic aquatic systems flow turbulence is considered as the dominant mechanism driving particle collision which is quantified by the turbulent shear rate mhashhash et al 2018 spicer and pratsinis 1996 this is directly responsible for floc formation and the growth of different floc sizes and their respective densities porosity e g lawrence et al 2022 simultaneous with the aggregation process the flocs can experience a fragmentation breakup that decreases their size due to turbulent shear in energetic environments flocs can maintain their complex structures up to a specific size because of the floc strength maintained by inter particle bonds bache et al 1999 jarvis et al 2005 the flocs become more fragile as their size increases and flocs can be broken up when a shear or tensile stress overcomes the floc strength yeung and pelton 1996 unfortunately quantifying the floc strength is not trivial due to difficulties in direct measurement and a variety of factors such as mineral types zeta potential floc structures turbulent shear must be quantified jarvis et al 2005 sharp et al 2006 spencer et al 2022 thus most of the numerical models use a constant value of the floc strength for simplicity maggi et al 2007 verney et al 2011 winterwerp 1998 in this study we investigate the limitation of the constant floc yield strength assumption and begin to explore an alternative with satisfactory results the single floc size statistic method winterwerp 1998 is usually implemented to track the temporal evolution of the median floc size d 50 although this method has been used in many studies kuprenas et al 2018 son and hsu 2009 it is not designed to represent the complex floc size distribution on the other hand the most detailed method is to simulate flocculation using a grain resolved approach since it tracks all the individual cohesive particles in a fully resolving turbulence field vowinckel et al 2019 this allows to compute the floc strength and the fractal dimension by analyzing the bonds between the primary particles and the floc size shape the challenge lies in its limitation to represent practical flocculation problems due to its high computational cost the middle ground approaches are to model the floc size distributions the distribution based model maerz and wirtz 2009 requires the assumption of a fixed distribution which constrains the bimodal floc behaviors observed in aquatic systems lee et al 2011 manning and dyer 2007 soulsby et al 2013 this limitation can be overcome by solving population balance equations pbe that calculate the number of flocs for each given size class while maintaining the mass balance verney et al 2011 mietta et al 2011 many studies focus on calibrating multiple model parameters in the pbe based size class flocculation model using the equilibrium or temporal evolution of median floc size d 50 jeldres et al 2015 shen et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 or floc size distribution at the equilibrium state coufort et al 2007 a systematic pbe model calibration was carried out by mietta et al 2011 using temporal evolution of the median floc size d 50 and the equilibrium floc size distribution for a wide variety of compositions clay type salt type and different salinity importantly using the temporal evolution of d 50 this study showed an inverse proportionality between the collisional efficiency and the zeta potential however it is unclear whether the optimal model parameters can be well constrained by these limited physical quantities motivated by the increasing popularity of pbe flocculation models for cohesive sediment transport applications liu et al 2019 sherwood et al 2018 the main goal of this study is to advance the understanding of several key model parameters of the pbe flocculation model and how they determine the resulting temporal evolution of floc size statistics driven by a constant turbulent shear rate motivated by the earlier studies on pbe modeling verney et al 2011 mietta et al 2011 and floc yield strength e g jarvis et al 2005 the specific objectives of this study are to 1 confirm whether the median floc size statistics d 50 in terms of both the equilibrium floc size and the initial floc growth is sufficient to constrain the model parameters 2 investigate if the model parameters can be better constrained by using the temporal evolution of different floc size statistics and 3 understand the importance of floc yield strength in the predicted floc size statistics the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a description of the pbe based size class flocculation model and the laboratory data used section 3 focuses on extensive model investigations and error analyses for predicting the measured data section 4 is dedicated to investigating the floc yield strength in the flocculation model and section 5 concludes this study 2 flocculation model description and configuration 2 1 pbe based size class flocculation model the pbe based size class flocculation model flocmod verney et al 2011 is adopted to study the physics of flocculation the model is based on solving pbes namely the temporal evolution of the number concentration of each floc size class i e number based distribution in a homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow and it can be written as 1 d n k d t g a g g r k g b r e a k s h e a r k l a g g r k l b r e a k s h e a r k where n unit m 3 is the number concentration number of flocs per unit volume of the k t h floc size class t is time s g and l with subscripts represent the gain and loss of class k flocs due to aggregation subscript a g g r or breakup induced by turbulent shear stress subscript b r e a k s h e a r in estuarine and coastal environments flows are generally energetic and the model assumes that the turbulent shear is the dominant mechanism driving flocculation other aggregation mechanisms resulting from brownian motion and differential settling are neglected maggi et al 2007 for the low sediment concentration considered in this study we also neglect the gain and loss of class k due to collision induced breakup the gain g a g g r and loss l a g g r by aggregation are written as 2 g a g g r k 1 2 i j k α a i j n i n j 3 l a g g r k i 1 n α a i k n i n k where a is the two body collision probability function for spherical particles and α is the collisional efficiency which parameterizes the sticking properties of flocs and other physical processes not modeled by a e g preferential accumulation that encourages collision or the effect of porosity this parameter α is assumed constant for the calibration process following verney et al 2011 since we assume that the main driving force for flocculation is the turbulent shear the two body collision probability function depends on the turbulent shear rate s and the diameters of two colliding flocs written as 4 a i j 1 6 s d i d j 3 where d i and d j are the spherical equivalent diameters of two colliding flocs of discrete classes i and j the gain g b r e a k s h e a r and loss l b r e a k s h e a r by breakup driven by turbulent shear stress s are defined as 5 g b r e a k s h e a r k i k 1 f d b s k i b i n i 6 l b r e a k s h e a r k b k n k where f d b s is the distribution function of fragmented flocs representing the gain of daughter flocs from larger floc size classes following verney et al 2011 we specify the binary distribution assuming that the mass of a floc after breakup is divided in half the rate at which flocs break due to the turbulent shear rate s is given by the function b and it is defined as 7 b i β s 3 2 d i d i d p d p 3 f d where d p is the primary particle diameter f d is the fractal dimension kranenburg 1994 for equivalent spherical diameter and β is the fragmentation rate the fragmentation rate is in fact a dimensional quantity s 1 2 m 1 and it is written as maggi et al 2007 winterwerp 1998 8 β e μ f y 1 2 where μ p a s is the dynamic viscosity of water e is an empirical dimensionless parameter and f y n is the floc yield strength although β is a dimensional quantity it is assumed to be an empirical constant in verney et al 2011 this inevitably presumes that the floc yield strength f y is a constant which is consistent with the fractal approach kranenburg 1994 because the direct measurement of floc yield strength is difficult the assumption of a constant f y is commonly adopted by many other studies e g maggi et al 2007 wang et al 2013 verney et al 2011 have pointed out that both the collisional efficiency α and fragmentation rate β are sensitive model parameters that need to be calibrated first with a given cohesive sediment sample although the fractal dimension f d has been estimated from many laboratory and field experiments e g manning et al 2010 to be around 2 to 2 5 and there may be a floc size dependency khelifa and hill 2006 maggi 2007 such that larger flocs are more porous and the interparticle bonds are smaller assuming a constant fractal dimension within a given flocculation experiment remains to be the most practical approach to successfully calibrate these three empirical parameters concurrently for a given experiment sufficient information from the measured data is necessary and a proper calibration strategy may also benefit from a more thorough examination of the governing equations to be solved by substituting equations 2 to 6 into the equation 1 the resulting number concentration equation of each floc size class k is written as 9 d n k d t 1 2 i j k α 1 6 s d i d j 3 n i n j i k 1 f d b s k i β s 3 2 d i d i d p d p 3 f d n i i 1 n α 1 6 s d i d j 3 n i n k β s 3 2 d k d k d p d p 3 f d n k during the initial stage of the flocculation i e floc growth stage the breakup terms can be neglected the second and fourth term on the right hand side rhs of equation 9 since flocs must grow from small flocs or primary particles and the aggregation terms first and third terms on the rhs are dominant this means that a model calibration focusing on the initial flow growth stage allows us to mainly calibrate α mietta et al 2011 however beyond the initial floc growth stage the breakup terms must become important because there must be a balance between aggregation and breakup so that an equilibrium can be reached following the analysis presented in winterwerp 1998 mean equilibrium floc size must depend on the ratio of r α β and fractal dimension f d therefore both the equilibrium stage and the initial floc growth stage should be considered for a complete calibration procedure further insights into equilibrium floc size distribution can be gained by setting d n k d t 0 in equation 9 which renders an expression for number concentration of each floc size class as 10 n k 1 12 r s 1 2 i j k d i d j 3 n i n j i k 1 f d b s k i d i d i d p d p 3 f d n i 1 6 r s 1 2 i 1 n d i d j 3 n i d k d k d p d p 3 f d in addition to r α β and f d the breakup distributions functions f d b s k i also control the floc size distribution and must be considered in the calibration however the physical evidence of floc breakup distribution function is limited and most studies assume a binary breakup nevertheless if we focus on very large floc fractions e g macroflocs their gain due to breakup g b r e a k s h e a r and loss due to aggregation l a g g r can be assumed insignificant compared with the smaller size fraction therefore equation 10 for the very large floc size fraction can be reduced approximately to 11 n k 1 12 r s 1 2 i j k d i d j 3 n i n j d k d k d p d p 3 f d where the breakup distribution function f d b s k i disappears comparing the modeled large floc size statistic with measured data allows calibrating the parameters α β and f d with minimum impact of f d b s k i on the other hand the breakup distribution function f d b s k i must be important for fine floc fractions thus calibrating different size class statistics is valuable particularly for the coarse floc fraction to avoid uncertainty in f d b s k i additional analysis of equation 9 is performed to compare the aggregation and breakup timescales following winterwerp 1998 we estimate the initial floc growth timescale using the aggregation term in the equation 9 and it is written as 12 t agg 1 α s ϕ f k where ϕ f k is the volumetric concentration of floc of size class k the above expression shows that the collisional efficiency α controls the initial floc growth timescale and an appropriate calibration process for α should be based on the initial growth time series mietta et al 2011 on the other hand at the later stage of the floc growth before reaching equilibrium the floc breakup must play an important role to counteract aggregation we can examine the breakup timescale as inversely proportional to β and s 3 2 as 13 t b r k 1 β s 3 2 for example to expedite floc growth at the later transient stage the breakup timescale must be decreased by increasing β i e increase the effect of breakup which is equivalent to reducing floc yield strength this point will be revisited in section 4 2 2 experimental data keyvani and strom 2014 report a flocculation experiment in a mixing tank using a mixture of kaolinite and montmorillonite clay the flocculation experiment was performed for approximately 1800 m i n by using a total sediment mass concentration of c 0 05 k g m 3 and a homogeneous turbulence shear rate s of 35 s 1 hence the study neglects more complex transport mechanism such as differential advection and settling although homogeneous turbulence is highly idealized it allows a comprehensive calibration of model parameters before the model can be used in conditions with increasing complexity in addition to the measured median floc diameter d 50 at equilibrium keyvani and strom 2014 also provide measured temporal evolutions of three different floc size statistics d 16 d 50 and d 84 see fig 1 by computing a series of image ensemble every 1 to 5 minute depending on the phase growth or equilibrium this comprehensive dataset is selected to calibrate key empirical model parameters in the pbe based size class flocculation model of verney et al 2011 we simulate three important aspects in the measured time series the equilibrium state t 700 m i n in fig 1 the floc growth stage t 200 m i n in fig 1 and the entire time series in particular matching the modeled initial floc growth stage with measured data allows us to evaluate the model s ability to predict the flocculation rate which has been used by other studies to further quantify the stickiness of flocs ye et al 2021 and to calibrate collisional efficiency mietta et al 2011 the abundance of measured data allows a deeper calibration of the model parameters 2 3 flocculation model configuration following keyvani and strom 2014 the total mass concentration and turbulent shear rate from the experiment are prescribed accordingly in the flocculation model the minimum floc size diameter is established as d min 4 μ m which corresponds to the diameter of the primary particle typically used for flocculation modeling winterwerp 1998 the maximum floc size is specified to be d max 300 μ m to ensure the modeled distribution is sufficiently wide and to avoid fluctuations in the distributed mass concentration at the equilibrium state see figure s1 in supplementary material since keyvani and strom 2014 did not discuss the initial floc size distribution our exploratory numerical experiments show that using a log normal distribution represents the experimental data better than punctual distribution especially at the early stage of floc growth see figure s2 in supplementary material following verney et al 2011 an explicit euler time integrator is implemented to solve the pbes equation 1 with an initial time step size equal to 1 s which is also specified as the maximum allowable time step size throughout the integration if this value is insufficient to preserve the total sediment mass within a threshold the time step is decreased by half and the cycle is recomputed until the mass conservation criterion is satisfied the flocculation model of verney et al 2011 requires the use of many classes to discretize the floc diameter distribution therefore establishing the minimum number needed for an accurate numerical solution of the size distribution is an important step the evaluation is carried out with different numbers of size class n c to discretize the distribution verney et al 2011 recommended n c 15 to be sufficient based on calibrating the median floc size d 50 at the equilibrium state however our results suggest that even at n c 25 the low resolution negatively affects the predicted temporal evolution and hence the flocculation rate see the first 80 minutes of floc growth in fig 2 a for fine median and coarse fractions another issue is the pronounced step like feature during the floc growth when n c is small careful examination of the model results indicates that the step like feature is due to coarse numerical discretization of the floc size distribution but not the time step the absence of certain size classes causes a jump in modeled size statistics during floc growth a converged solution can be obtained when n c 75 in fig 2b we evaluate this convergence by using the root mean square error r m s e c from the target solution using n c 200 large errors are observed when n c 15 especially for the coarse fraction r m s e c d 84 40 μ m by increasing the n c to 25 and 50 the errors decrease significantly our additional numerical experiments suggest that the convergence evaluation is not sensitive to a variation of model parameter of α β and f d within a reasonable range in the rest of the paper we use n c 75 to maintain an affordable computational time around 20 minutes per simulation in workstation with r m s e c d 16 50 84 0 5 3 μ m 3 results motivated by the previous study of verney et al 2011 we concurrently calibrate α and β to match measured data and evaluate if the resulting fractal dimension f d falls within the expected range 6 400 simulations were carried out using α 5 10 2 80 10 2 with an interval of 5 10 2 and β 2 10 3 80 10 3 with an interval of 2 10 3 for ten different fractal dimension values in the range of 1 7 to 2 9 all simulations use a computational time of 1800 m i n using the measured data keyvani and strom 2014 as reference three different rmse are computed to evaluate the model performance at the equilibrium state r m s e e q t 700 m i n the growth stage of flocculation r m s e f r t 200 m i n and the entire flocculation time series r m s e f p for the tri temporal floc size statistics d 16 d 50 and d 84 see figures s3 s5 in the supplemental material in section 3 1 and 3 2 the search for the optimized parameters α β and f d is carried out exclusively to match measured d 50 by these three criteria namely minimizing the errors at the equilibrium state min r m s e e q d 50 at the initial growth stage of flocculation min r m s e f r d 50 and for the entire time series min r m s e f p d 50 in section 3 3 two more criteria are imposed objective functions by matching measured fine and coarse fractions i e min r m s e f p d 16 and min r m s e f p d 84 3 1 temporal evolution of median floc size d 50 the median floc size d 50 is the most widely reported quantity in laboratory experiments and field observations we analyze the model s capability to represent the flocculation process using exclusively d 50 with constraints of the parameters α β and f d moreover since many studies only report the median floc size in the equilibrium state it is important to investigate if the model can reproduce the entire measured time series by solely calibrating model parameters using the equilibrium median floc size using the measured data from keyvani and strom 2014 as reference the rsme at the equilibrium state r m s e e q d 50 t 700 m i n is calculated for the 6 400 simulations and results are summarized in fig 3 for all combinations of the parameters α β for any given f d each interaction between these parameters is examined in a simulation with the error magnitudes demarcated by a hot colormap the dark red color represents excellent agreement with measured d 50 in the equilibrium state importantly all the fractal dimensions f d 1 7 2 9 show multiple choices of α and β that are in very good agreement r m s e e q d 50 1 72 μ m the finite value of 1 72 μ m reflects the variabilities in the measured data with the measured d 50 at the equilibrium state clearly low error values cluster around a line with a constant slope for each fractal dimension indicating that the best agreement is obtained at a nearly constant α β ratio regardless of the individual α and β values this finding is consistent with that reported by verney et al 2011 in addition to the multiple choices of the α and β pair another important limitation of using only the equilibrium d 50 data to calibrate the flocculation model is that excellent agreement can be found for very large e g f d 2 9 or very low e g f d 1 7 fractal dimension values outside the typical range for mud as we will discuss next despite the multiple options for α and β pairs to match the equilibrium d 50 the predicted time series of d 50 for some of the options are not acceptable see fig 4 at this point we can conclude that sole measurement of d 50 in the equilibrium state is insufficient to narrow the values of α β and f d additional characteristics of the flocculation statistics should be considered for an improved model calibration since there are multiple pairs of α β values that satisfy minimizing errors in the equilibrium state with min rmseed50 1 72 μm we sequentially applied the second criterion of minimizing the error values at the initial stage of the flocculation t 200 min min rmsefrd50 the predicted time series associated with the best and the worst agreement with measured data for the initial stage of flocculation rmsefrd50 are presented for the fractal dimension in the range of f d 1 9 2 9 see fig 4 the calibrated parameter values and respective minimum errors at a given fractal dimension are detailed in table 1 the predicted time series using the pair of α β that matches the equilibrium d 50 but having large error of rmsefrd50 are clearly far from satisfactory see red lines in fig 4 this confirms that using solely the first criterion of minimizing the equilibrium median floc size errors is insufficient to predict the entire time series of median floc size evolution however applying first the criterion of min rmsefrd50 followed by the second criterion of min rmsefrd50 yields generally good agreement with the measured data for the entire time series when f d 2 2 2 7 see blue lines in figure 4c 4i with a rmsefrd50 2 8 μm see best in table 1 further analysis confirmed that the same results can be obtained by simply minimizing the errors of the entire flocculation time series i e using the objective function min rmsefpd50 nevertheless we emphasize our main point that one should proceed with caution when utilizing the equilibrium data as the only model calibration criterion this result also confirms the importance of matching the flocculation time series to obtain adequate aggregation timescale t a g g because it provides a nearly independent data to calibrate α mietta et al 2011 we further explore the benefits of simply minimizing the errors present at the initial floc growth stage the best calibrated model parameters and error values can be found in table 2 as expected this approach decreases the errors in the predicted flocculation rate cf rmsefrd50 in table 1 and table 2 the equilibrium state is affected negatively rmseeqd50 values increase from 1 72 μ m to 6 06 μ m for fractal dimension f d 2 2 2 7 but only slightly fig 5 illustrates visually these consequences where the floc growth stage is predicted well but the agreement in the equilibrium value is slightly reduced this approach also allows us to narrow down the choice of fractal dimension based on the best three min rmsefrd50 to be f d 2 4 2 5 2 6 when evaluating the agreement for the entire time series we observe that rmsefpd50 is around 5 7 μ m for f d 2 4 2 6 this is considered good agreement as only one criterion of min rmsefrd50 is adopted we can also conclude that the pbe based size class flocculation model has a good capability of predicting equilibrium median floc size once the key model parameters are calibrated for predicting the initial growth of flocculation i e the flocculation rate 3 2 tri temporal floc size statistics using min rmsefrd50 since the best calibrated cases that match the measured temporal evolution of median floc size are obtained for a wide range of fractal dimension f d 2 2 2 7 see fig 4 rmsefpd50 2 8 μm the selection of a unique set of α β parameters is not yet conclusive fortunately keyvani and strom 2014 provide two more measured floc size statistics of d 16 and d 84 and these are added to the model calibration to evaluate the possibility of further constraining the model parameters fig 6 illustrates the predicted tri temporal floc size statistics d 50 d 16 and d 84 at the six fractal dimension values f d 2 2 2 7 using the α β parameters that achieve the best agreement for the temporal evolution of the median floc size d 50 recall fig 4 at the initial floc growth stage t 30 m i n good agreement can be seen for both the fine d 16 and coarse d 84 fractions fig 6 however larger discrepancies arise before reaching the equilibrium stage 30 m i n t 200 m i n for the coarse floc fraction as discussed before see equation 13 this means that the breakup timescale t b r k for d 84 should be reduced increase the effect of breakup moreover it becomes clear that by minimizing the error for the median floc size d 50 the equilibrium floc statistics for the finer fraction d 16 is under predicted by the model while the coarse fraction d 84 is over predicted identifying the optimum parameters hierarchically to represent the tri temporal floc size statistics from fig 6 can be difficult based on its similar trend across the fractal dimension values therefore we evaluate the error values during the initial growth stage of the flocculation r m s e f r and the entire flocculation time series r m s e f p in a wider range of fractal dimension f d 1 7 2 9 see fig 7 the r m s e f r confirms the discrimination process for the lowest f d 2 1 and highest f d 2 9 fractal dimension since their errors increase considerably regarding the fractal dimensions f d 2 2 2 7 the r m s e f r for the median floc size statistics d 50 behaves in a quasi stable way however the error values for d 16 and d 84 show opposite trends when one of them is minimized see f d 2 3 and f d 2 7 looking at the average performance for these floc fractions the first second and third option are f d 2 7 2 6 and 2 4 respectively see dashed black line in fig 7a this result can also be obtained when computing the mean value of r m s e f p see fig 7b 3 3 tri temporal floc size statistics using min r m s e f p d 16 or min r m s e f p d 84 through a systematic error analysis of d 50 for the initial floc growth and the entire flocculation process presented in the previous sections optimal model parameters are obtained however the predicted fine d 16 and coarse d 84 floc fractions are adversely affected that is better agreement in the fine fraction comes at the expense of worse agreement in the coarse fraction now we evaluate the possibility to narrow the flocculation model parameters and improve the overall agreement by minimizing the fine or coarse floc sizes statistic errors i e min r m s e f p d 16 or min r m s e f p d 84 using the same systematic error analysis the criterion of minimizing the fine fraction min r m s e f p d 16 produces non satisfactory results for the overall floc size statistics since the coarse fraction d 84 stands out for its high error values r m s e f p d 84 34 62 μ m this magnitude is higher than r m s e f p d 84 obtained by using the previous criterion min r m s e f p d 50 error comparisons are presented in the supplementary material figure s6 and they are not further discussed here conversely applying the criterion min r m s e f p d 84 shows satisfactory results especially in the r m s e f r values since the best value is distinguished from the other acceptable errors see f d 2 5 in fig 8 a however the minimum value of r m s e f p averaged over the three size statistics is located at f d 2 9 fig 8b this is a limitation in the flocculation model since f d 2 9 is a much higher than expected value for typical flocs considering the error analysis criterion for the initial floc growth stage the optimum fractal dimension is selected to be f d 2 5 see black line in fig 8a the tri temporal floc size statistics for three selected cases are presented in fig 9 we established previously for the equilibrium state that minimizing the median floc size errors leads to over and under predicted results for coarse and fine flocs respectively see also fig 9a and 9b hence the difference between case 1 with f d 2 4 and case 2 with f d 2 7 lies mainly in the degree of agreement to represent the coarse fraction d 84 see r m s e e q values in table 2 since case 2 with f d 2 7 shows 49 12 better agreement compared to case 1 this contrast can also be noticed in the distributed mass concentration at the equilibrium state see blue dashed line vs red solid line in fig 10 comparing with case 1 case 2 relocates a small amount of sediment mass in the coarse fraction to the median and fine fractions due to a relatively larger breakup effect signified by smaller r α β 7 432 value in case 2 using a lower fractal dimension of f d 2 5 in case 3 allows for an even lower r 6 7 i e the breakup is stronger in case 3 than in case 1 and 2 which significantly reduces the sediment mass in the coarse fraction see smaller d 84 in fig 9c and this is evidently due to a more significant relocation of mass from the coarse fraction to the finer fraction see a shift of sediment mass distribution to the left represented by the black dashed line in fig 10 case 3 proves the need of increasing the effect of breakup or lower breakup timescale t b r k for the coarse fraction which can be achieved by increase the fragmentation rate β section 4 investigates this possibility by considering a lower floc yield strength for larger flocs 4 discussion effect of floc yield strength the results presented in section 3 indicate that by rigorously calibrating the pbe based size class flocculation model against measured tri temporal floc size statistics d 16 d 50 and d 84 we can identify several combinations of the model parameters α β and f d that show good agreement with measured data however there are still uncertainties in the selection of the best model parameters particularly in case 2 which has the best agreement but with a high value of the fractal dimension of 2 7 in this section we include one other significant physical quantity in the model parameters to improve the overall agreement to avoid overfitting model results the choice of the additional physics to be included must first be justified motivated by improving the limited capability of the model to represent the coarse and fine fractions simultaneously and the need to increase floc breakup or decrease t b r k for the coarse floc fraction we evaluate the effect of considering the fragmentation rate β as a function of floc size as shown in equation 8 the fragmentation rate β is a function of the empirical coefficient e fluid viscosity μ and floc yield strength f y the justification of treating β as a constant is to assume the floc yield strength is a constant in the literature floc yield strength is routinely assumed to be f y 10 10 n in flocculation modeling and the model calibrations are carried out either through the coefficient e or directly using the parameter β maggi et al 2007 verney et al 2011 winterwerp 1998 however in the water quality literature jarvis et al 2015 presented a review of many laboratory measurements of floc yield strength or yield stress which indicated that the floc yield strength f y is inversely proportional to the floc size e g bache et al 1999 yeung and pelton 1996 in other words when a floc grows to a sufficient size the larger the floc size is the easier the floc can be broken by turbulent shear this fact is supported by our error analysis presented in section 3 fig 11 presents the best calibrated β values by minimizing the error in the three size fractions d 16 d 50 and d 84 plotted as a function of fractal dimension between 2 3 and 2 6 we observe a clear trend in each fractal dimension that the larger the size fraction when the error is minimized the larger β or smaller f y is required moreover this trend agrees with the need to decrease the breakup timescale t b r k for coarse fraction as has been stated in the previous section hence we investigate the effect of considering the floc yield strength f y inversely proportional to floc size since measuring the floc yield strength as a function of floc size can be difficult and most studies of cohesive sediment transport do not report such data as a first step we propose to model the floc yield strength in terms of microflocs and macroflocs manning and dyer 2007 and divide the fragmentation rate β into two different values accordingly to distinguish these two groups a floc size limit d l is defined such that the fragmentation rate of flocs with a size smaller larger than d l is specified as β micro while the fragmentation rate of flocs larger than d l is specified as β macro we investigate the effect of applying the two value fragmentation rate by simulating case 1a and case 3a which are variants of case 1 and case 3 having the same values of α and f d found in section 3 2 as for β micro and β macro the mean value between these two fragmentation rates in case 1a and case 3a match with the constant β value used in case 1 and case 3 respectively while satisfying the physical behavior of higher tendency for breakup in macroflocs with β macro β micro the use of the two value β micro β macro fragmentation rate in case1a shows a remarkable improvement compared to using a constant β method in case 1 with f d 2 4 for the coarse fraction d 84 under the criterion min r m s e f p d 50 the over predicted errors r m s e f p d 84 for the entire time series in case 1 fig 12 a are significantly reduced from 16 43 μ m to 4 66 μ m nearly a factor 4 reduction of error compare table 3 and 4 the same improvement can be seen for the fine fraction d 16 with an error value r m s e f p d 16 reducing from 11 27 μ m to 3 38 μ m furthermore these improvements preserve the excellent agreement of d 50 because the r m s e e q d 50 maintains its low error values errors slightly increase by 5 from 2 54 μ m to 2 67 μ m for the floc growth stage using the two value β micro β macro fragmentation rate in case 1a significantly improves the agreement for the coarse fraction r m s e f r d 84 decreases from 20 3 μ m to 9 87 μ m about a factor 2 smaller while only marginally decreasing the agreement for the median 11 increase of error and fine 42 increase of error fraction evaluating the overall performance through the mean error values we observe a factor 3 reduction of errors for the entire time series m e a n r m s e f p reduces from 10 08 μ m to 3 57 μ m the improvement by using the two value β micro β macro fragmentation rate is particularly significant for equilibrium floc sizes relatively minor improvement is observed for case 3a f d 2 5 see table 4 when the two value fragmentation rate is applied see fig 12b this is partly because the agreement in the coarse fraction when using a single value β is already good see case 3 in table 3 e g r m s e f p for d 84 is only 3 77 μ m however the improvement for median fraction and fine fractions by using the two value fragmentation rate for the entire time series is evident as it is quantified by an error reduction from 10 15 μ m to 5 68 μ m and from 16 45 μ m to 11 3 μ m respectively as for the floc growth stage the two value fragmentation rate also reduces the errors by a factor of about 1 6 and 2 5 for d 16 and d 50 correspondingly however the error for the coarse fraction shows a small increase of 39 a numerical experiment has been carried out for case 2 with a high fractal dimension of 2 7 we obtain the similar conclusion that the improvement by using a two value fragmentation rate in case 2 is very good but not as effective as in case 1 the distributed mass concentration at the equilibrium state is another important characteristic that can be used to compare the two value fragmentation rate approach with the constant β approach see fig 12c and 12d when the fractal dimension is f d 2 4 a reduction of the mass concentration in case 1a is observed for floc classes lower than 55 25 μ m and higher than 118 μ m compare the red line with the black line in fig 12c as a result of mass conservation the mass concentration distribution over the floc size classes is squeezed laterally and the concentration between the floc classes 55 25 118 μ m increases consequently the equilibrium floc statistics for coarse d 84 fine d 16 fraction must decrease increase a similar behavior can be seen when the fractal dimension is f d 2 5 in case 3a but with a different feature for instance using a single value fragmentation rate the equilibrium floc size for the coarse fraction d 84 is already in good agreement with measured data interestingly the use of a two value fragmentation rate effectively decreases the mass concentration in the fine fraction and moves the mass toward the median fraction fig 12d while the coarse fraction is nearly unchanged specifically the mass concentration increases between 69 77 157 9 μ m see fig 12d and decreases in finer fraction d i 69 77 μ m there is a very small increase of mass concentration in the coarser fraction d i 157 9 μ m conclusion we present a systematic investigation of the key model parameters for the pbe based size class flocculation model of verney et al 2011 using the experimental data reported by keyvani and strom 2014 an analysis on constraining the key model parameters namely the collisional efficiency fragmentation rate and fractal dimension is first carried out for the median floc size statistics d 50 a criterion based on minimizing the equilibrium state median floc size errors provides multiple options of model parameters with many of them misleading since they fail to match the measured initial floc growth the agreement can be significantly improved by applying a second criterion sequentially minimizing the error for the floc growth stage or equivalently by minimizing the entire flocculation time series of d 50 interestingly utilizing the objective function of simply minimizing the error for the floc growth stage min r m s e f r d 50 shows generally good agreement with the entire measured time series of flocculation confirming a good predictive ability of the present pbe flocculation model the resulting model parameters are constrained to multiple options of fractal dimension in the range of f d 2 2 2 7 and we conclude that the median floc size d 50 alone is insufficient to constrain the flocculation model parameters the pbe flocculation model can reasonably predict d 16 and d 84 using solely the calibration results from the median floc sizes d 50 in the range of f d 2 2 2 7 the best two options with minimum errors are selected for f d 2 4 and f d 2 7 with the latter selected because of its good agreement with measured coarse fraction d 84 even though the f d value is higher than expected evaluating two different criteria based on minimizing the entire temporal floc size statistic errors of d 16 and d 84 indicates that minimizing the errors in the fine fraction is not viable due to the high errors in the coarse fraction on the contrary minimizing the error in the coarse fraction shows good agreement with the measured floc growth at f d 2 5 and suggests that the coarse fraction requires lower breakup timescale or increased breakup to balance the aggregation to improve the model s predictive ability for fine median and coarse fractions at typically expected fractal dimension ranges for cohesive sediment we propose a two value fragmentation rate approach floc yield strength is smaller for macroflocs than microflocs motivated by limited measured data in the water quality literature and the present model analysis for a single fragmentation rate β which clearly shows a positive correlation between calibrated β and floc size see fig 11 the results from the two value fragmentation rate approach demonstrate significant improvement in representing the tri temporal floc size statistics compared with data from using a constant β especially for the case of lower fractal dimension at f d 2 4 findings reported in this study are based on modeling the measured three floc size statistics in homogenous turbulence for a single type of clay reported by keyvani and strom 2014 therefore this work calls for future research on expanding the knowledge of floc yield strength for more diverse configurations for instance more laboratory data of temporal floc size distribution for a wide range of turbulence intensity and clay types are needed moreover direct measurements of floc yield strength as a function of floc size are needed for numerical modeling coupling the pbe model with a boundary layer sediment transport model to further investigate the role of flocculation dynamics on settling advection and turbulent suspension of

15002,the mechanistic study of soil and groundwater remediation in petroleum contaminated lands significantly demands rapid qualitative and quantitative identification of petroleum substances however most traditional detection methods cannot provide the on site or in situ information of petroleum compositions and contents simultaneously even with multi spot sampling and complex sample preparation in this work we developed a strategy for the on site detection of petroleum compositions and in situ monitoring of petroleum contents in soil and groundwater using dual excitation raman spectroscopy and microscopy the detection time was 0 5 h for the extraction raman spectroscopy method and one minute for the fiber raman spectroscopy method the limit of detection was 94 ppm for the soil samples and 0 46 ppm for the groundwater samples meanwhile the petroleum changes at the soil groundwater interface were successfully observed by raman microscopy during the in situ chemical oxidation remediation processes the results revealed that hydrogen peroxide oxidation released petroleum from the interior to the surface of soil particles and then to groundwater during the remediation process while persulfate oxidation only degraded petroleum on the soil surface and in groundwater this raman spectroscopic and microscopic method can shed light on the petroleum degradation mechanism in contaminated lands and facilitate the selection of suitable soil and groundwater remediation plans graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords petroleum contaminants soil and groundwater in

mixture of hydrocarbons with different molecular weights petroleum contaminants seriously endanger the environmental quality due to the rapid industrial development and massive occurrence of petroleum contaminated lands and therefore needs to be well controlled bruckberger et al 2020 kim et al 2013 li et al 2016 zakaria et al 2000 zhen et al 2021 in situ chemical oxidation isco remediation has attracted tremendous attention for degrading petroleum substances in the soil and groundwater of contaminated lands shao et al 2022 wang et al 2022b 2021 2023 among the widely used oxidants alkaline activated persulfate treatment is often employed owing to its high redox potential convenience stability and relatively low cost liang and lei 2015 lin et al 2022 lominchar et al 2018 sra et al 2012 fenton reagents such as iron catalyzed h2o2 treatment is also a popular strategy to degrade the petroleum contaminants due to its high treatment efficiency quick process and wide application range bergendahl et al 2003 chen et al 2022 sutton et al 2014 usman et al 2022 in order to evaluate different isco remediation plans by monitoring the pollution levels of petroleum contaminated lands it is necessary to analyze the petroleum compositions and contents in soil and groundwater on the site and in situ on the site not necessarily in situ refers to the measurements at the field the accurate and efficient on site and in situ detection will facilitate understanding the remediation dynamics and targeting the remediation goal the current identification of petroleum substances usually requires complex laboratory operation of gas chromatography gc and or mass spectrometry ms bumbrah et al 2017 snyder et al 2016 wang et al 2022a they are not suitable for the on site or in situ detection gieg and suflita 2002 olsen et al 1982 the gravimetric method and ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry uv vis can be utilized on the site to detect the total petroleum content due to their portability banan khorshid et al 2021 mills et al 1999 in addition in light of the sensitive fluorescence caused by the electronic transitions of the conjugated structures in the hydrocarbon mixture laser induced fluorescence lif spectroscopy has been developed to quantify the total petroleum content on the site fedotov et al 2019 mu et al 2016 however neither of them can provide specific information of the petroleum composition therefore there is still lack of rapid detection methods to simultaneously identify the petroleum compositions and contents on the site or in situ in contaminated soil and groundwater raman scattering provides abundant vibrational information of molecular bonds and may characteristically detect the petroleum composition ahmadjian and brown 1976 cialla may et al 2019 huang et al 2022 meanwhile raman spectroscopy is able to collect fluorescent emissions excited by appropriate laser sources allowing for the quantification of petroleum content based on the emission intensity in addition the device of raman spectroscopy can be portable for the facile on site and in situ detection by combining with microscopy raman spectroscopy may further visualize the in situ changes of petroleum distribution at the microscopic soil groundwater interface despite these many advantages raman spectroscopy is challenged by separating raman signals from fluorescent signals because the quantum yields of vibrational transitions are substantially lower than the electronic transitions it is not easy to simultaneously obtain a distinct raman spectrum for the composition characterization and an intense fluorescence spectrum for the content determination fortunately the lower excitation efficiency of fluorescence at longer wavelength rusk 2009 inspired us to develop a method of dual excitation raman spectroscopy microscopy to identify the petroleum composition based on distinct raman bands at 785 nm and to quantify the petroleum content based on fluorescent signals at 532 nm fig 1 using this methodology we obtained the petroleum compositions and contents of soil and groundwater samples in a contaminated land in yangtze delta of china and monitored the isco remediation dynamics the results provided an insight of the remediation mechanism and facilitated the evaluation of remediation plans for the land petroleum control 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the offshore oil gbe e 080 913 was purchased from the china national marine environmental monitoring center the paraffin 8002 74 2 were purchased from the bidepharm heavy gasoline h gasoline and diesel fuel were purchased from a gas station in nanjing acetic acid acetonitrile and methanol hplc grade were supplied by merck kgaa all the other chemicals were obtained from sinopharm chemical aladdin and alfa 2 2 characterization methods the petroleum contents were independently measured by a gas chromatographer shimadzu gc2014 equipped with the flame ionization detector fid a fluorescence spectrophotometer varian fl1008m018 and a confocal laser scanning microscope leica clsm sp8 were used to measure and confirm the petroleum fluorescence the raman spectra for quantifying the petroleum compositions and contents were obtained by a portable spectrometer equipped with 532 nm and 785 nm lasers qepro raman ocean insight the soil water interface imaging data were measured by a renishaw invia reflex confocal raman microscope the raman spectra were automatically smoothed when needed the average sizes of soil particle were detected by a malvern zen 3600 zetasizer nanosystem the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface areas of soil particles were detected by a microtracbel belsorp max instrument the contact angles were obtained by a dataphysics instrument gmbh oca20 the morphologies of soil samples were recorded by a scanning electron microscope hitachi sem su8010 other characterization details were included in text s1 of the supporting information 2 3 land and land sample information the study area was located in nanjing at yangtze delta of china where groundwater flowed from southwest to northeast fig s1 on the land a former automobile parts processing plant was established in 1999 and began to be restored in 2019 the land experiment was conducted in the winter of 2019 monitoring wells were set up one meter away from the injection wells for adding the remediation reagents soil and groundwater samples were collected with a soil sampler and a baylor tube respectively the compositions of the land samples were characterized text s1 of the supporting information and shown in fig s2 the soil contained 56 7 si 13 0 ca 11 2 al 6 9 fe and 5 6 k the main components were quartz sio2 albite naalsi3o8 and chlorite al fe sio2 o minerals the organic matter was 83 g kg and the water content was 19 4 the total organic carbon content of groundwater was 2149 mg l the pollutants were mainly petroleum substances with the carbon chain length of c12 c40 2 4 sample preparations the sample preparation of extraction rs for the soil and groundwater samples followed a previously reported gc method united states environmental protection agency 2007 and a funnel liquid liquid extraction method national standards of the people s republic of china 2018 other detailed sample preparation procedures about the land column and micro area isco remediation experiments were included in text s2 3 and fig s3 4 of the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 detection of petroleum compositions in soil and groundwater with extraction rs the contaminated soil and groundwater samples were obtained from a land in nanjing at yangtze delta of china we extracted the soil and groundwater samples by organic solvent n hexane and obtained the petroleum substances as viscous solids fig 2 a since the major petroleum substances in the soil and groundwater samples were consisted of c12 c40 based on the gc characterization fig 2b to find out whether extraction rs was able to identify the property of hydrocarbon chain lengths we obtained three standard samples from the nearby providers for the comparative characterization the standard samples were paraffin diesel fuel and h gasoline heavy gasoline consistent with the literature reports cheng et al 2023 frança et al 2018 lominchar et al 2018 singh et al 2003 the major components of the paraffin diesel fuel and h gasoline samples were c29 c40 c12 c29 and c8 c12 respectively fig 2c based on extraction rs the auto fluorescence of petroleum substances was suppressed at 785 nm excitation and their raman vibrational fingerprints were clearly identified fig 2d the soil and groundwater petroleum had similar raman spectra representing the major characteristic peaks of ch stretch at 2900 cm 1 ch2 ch3 bend at 1450 cm 1 ch2 twist at 1305 cm 1 ch2 twist at 1150 cm 1 and terminal ch3 rock at 850 cm 1 respectively chung and ku 2000 cordeiro dantas et al 2017 li et al 2020 the spectral similarity evidenced their similar compositions in addition raman spectra of the soil and groundwater petroleum were similar to those of paraffin and diesel fuel instead of h gasoline this indicated the major components of the soil and groundwater petroleum were long chain hydrocarbons c12 c40 instead of short chain ones c8 c12 compared with the standard laboratory gc method extraction rs provided portable raman measurements for conveniently characterizing petroleum compositions in terms of hydrocarbon chain lengths 3 2 determination of total petroleum contents in soil and groundwater with extraction rs the fluorescent properties of petroleum contaminated soil and groundwater samples were observed under a fluorescence microscope fig 3 a and with a fluorimeter fig s5 different from the solid form soil the groundwater contained both micro size oil droplets and solid form substances the extracted solids were viscous and fluorescent with the high quantum yields of 0 75 and 2 69 for the soil and groundwater samples respectively these fluorescent properties were consistent with previous reports isak and eyring 1992 katoh et al 2009 magde et al 1979 and also agreed with those of another contaminated land in qingyang china fig s6 in the supporting information the consistent fluorescent properties of petroleum substances in representative contaminated lands validated the the method of quantifying the petroleum content according to the signal intensity the total petroleum hydrocarbon tph in this study was defined as the total petroleum contents of c10 c40 united states environmental protection agency 2007 international organization for standardization 2004 comite europeen de normalisation 2004 saari et al 2007 to quantify the tph contents of the samples we dissolved the petroleum extracts in dmso to obtain a series of standard samples representative picture in the insets of fig 3b and c when the standard samples were measured by extraction rs at 532 nm excitation the auto fluorescence of petroleum substances was clearly observed and utilized for the quantitative detection the signal intensity at the peak of 1000 cm 1 was selected for the quantification of the petroleum content the relative intensities of the bands at 1000 cm 1 were normalized to the raman peak of dmso at 868 cm 1 text s2 in the supporting information while the tph contents were independently determined by gc according to the comparison between the measured relative intensities and the gc tph contents the signals obtained by the extraction rs method were proportional to the tph contents thus the tph calibration curves produced a linear detection ranges of 0 00 1 51 104 ppm and 0 59 4 ppm for the soil and groundwater samples respectively considering the standard deviations of the blank soil and groundwater samples the limits of detection lod for soil and groundwater samples were determined to be 94 0 ppm and 0 460 ppm respectively text s1 in the supporting information in addition extraction rs was employed to determine the tph contents of engine oil offshore oil and anthracene fig s7 8 in the supporting information these results evidenced that extraction rs may provide a general method to rapidly measure the tph contents of petroleum related substances in complex environmental samples 3 3 rapid determination of petroleum contents in soil and groundwater with fiber rs in order to further improve the measurement simplicity and time efficiency we utilized a fiber optical raman spectroscopy fiber rs method qi and berger 2007 schorn et al 2021 to directly and rapidly measure the soil and groundwater samples from the same land without the extraction step fig s3 the measured signals were averaged for all the soil particles in the laser focus area and therefore could be used to reflect the soil petroleum content the standard gc method generally takes a couple of days to obtain the tph contents for soil and groundwater samples including the time for sample collection delivery and preparation in comparison the fiber rs measurements took about one minute using the portable raman spectroscopic instrument on the site to simplify data analysis we performed a two point calibration based on two standard samples containing relatively low and high tph contents in soil 1 73 102 and 4 51 103 ppm and in groundwater 0 150 and 82 2 ppm respectively fig 4 a after that six unknown soil and groundwater samples were measured by fiber rs the measured signal intensities versus the gc determined tph contents were compared with the calibration curves the detection accuracies were represented in fig 4b d the median and mean values of the disagreement between the extraction rs and gc methods were minor careful observation of the extraction rs results evidenced no data point outliers for the soil samples in the box plot of discrepancy there were 2 outliers in the 6 data points for the groundwater samples with high discrepancies of 17 and 19 which were not surprising due to their most diluted petroleum contents for the fiber rs method the median and mean values of the disagreement from the gc method were 24 and 22 for the soil samples and 5 and 1 for the groundwater samples although the average discrepancy levels were acceptable for the purpose of rapid on site or in situ detection the individual discrepancy values were distributed sparsely e g a few outliers far from the statistical prediction this is because the insoluble oily and or solid petroleum substances were distributed heterogeneously in soil and groundwater dependent on the local environment the higher discrepancy levels for the groundwater samples with very low petroleum content levels e g outlier points in fig 4b and for the soil samples e g larger boxes in fig 4b reflected their authentic heterogeneity compared with the gc method that minimized the influence of sample heterogeneity with such a capability of measuring local petroleum contents rapidly at different sampling locations fiber rs may evaluate the environmental quality risk of soil and groundwater more comprehensively in terms of simultaneously accessing the average petroleum contents and their heterogeneous distribution over the entire land 3 4 on site and in situ monitoring of petroleum remediation in soil and groundwater the isco method is an effective technique for degrading petroleum contaminants by injecting the remediation reagents in situ kim and lee 2012 sutton et al 2014 xu et al 2017 we conducted the isco remediation on the site and also simulated the process through the column experiment in the laboratory hou et al 2018 jia et al 2017 fig 5 two types of isco methods hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and sodium hydroxide activated persulfate naoh ps oxidation were employed for the soil and groundwater remediation by injecting h2o2 and naoh ps for multiple times shevah and waldman 1995 the on site land experiment was based on a large distance scale of meters and time scale of days fig 5a c the tph contents were then monitored by sampling the soil and groundwater for fiber rs measurements for the comparison the in situ column experiments were conducted on a smaller distance scale of centimeters and shorter time scale of hours fig 5d f we monitored the tph changes using in situ fiber rs by pointing the laser beam directly towards randomly selected soil or groundwater locations in the column during the land experiments the naoh ps method reduced the tph contents in soil and groundwater which was consistent with the expectation sutton et al 2014 the remediation rate was rapid within 6 days after the first addition of naoh ps after two additional naoh ps treatments the tph contents in soil and groundwater decreased by 94 and 83 respectively the soil tph was reduced to 232 ppm while the groundwater tph was reduced to 7 5 ppm at day 18 similar to the naoh ps remediation the soil tph significantly decreased after the first h2o2 addition however the soil and groundwater tph were not continuously degraded but fluctuated during the h2o2 treatments specifically the groundwater tph increased by 50 after the first h2o2 addition and then decreased dramatically to 5 after two additional h2o2 injections despite the tph fluctuations during the h2o2 isco process the soil tph was reduced to 237 ppm and the groundwater tph was reduced to 2 3 ppm at day 18 for the in situ column experiments similar tph decrease trends were observed for the soil and groundwater naoh ps remediation during the h2o2 isco column experiment we observed tph fluctuations again for the soil and groundwater remediation that included a tph decrease a resilience and a second decrease although the minimum and maximum tph occurred at different time points compared with the land experiments these more dynamic tph fluctuations were not fully tracked during the land experiment because the smaller volume scale and time scale phenomenon was concealed in the land experiment case we further studied the tph degradation kinetics fig 5g h by analyzing the column experimental data at the beginning 1 5 h of remediation processes and eliminating the influence of the mass transfer in the land experiments and the petroleum release caused by the h2o2 treatment based on the tph degradation rates of the column experiments h2o2 degraded petroleum substances 5 12 times faster than naoh ps these column experimental results inferred an insight to the groundwater tph increase for the first h2o2 treatment during the land experiments when h2o2 was in contact with groundwater and then diffused to soil it may vigorously degrade the existing petroleum in the local area of groundwater and soil surface simultaneously h2o2 might penetrate the soil particles react with them and release the inner petroleum to the soil surface and then into the groundwater thus we observed a more obvious tph increase in groundwater than in soil during the early stage of remediation in both the land and column experiments because the fast transfer of the released petroleum from soil to groundwater possibly overwhelmed the tph degradation in the groundwater 3 5 micro area in situ studies of petroleum remediation at the soil groundwaterinterface considering the complexity of land experiments on a macroscopic scale in situ observation of the soil and groundwater remediation on the microscopic scale may provide a deeper understanding of the remediation mechanism cao et al 2019 therefore we simulated the micro area of soil groundwater interface fig s4 and imaged its dynamic changes on the time scale of minutes during the remediation processes fig 6 a meanwhile we carefully observed the petroleum distribution on single soil particles after the remediation reagents were added fig 6b the signal intensity levels in the raman channels represented the in situ tph distribution distinct tph distribution interfaces were seen in the micro area raman images because the initial tph contents in the soil were significantly higher than those in the groundwater fig 5a and d in the case of naoh ps remediation the tph distribution interface remained stationary compared to the soil groundwater interface in the bright field images fig 6a top series after two naoh ps additions the tph redistributed in the soil and some petroleum aggregation and or particles started to diffuse into groundwater at the right bottom corner of the soil groundwater interface the total tph signals decreased slightly by 10 fig 6c this indicated a slow petroleum degradation on the time scale of minutes although the relative dosage of naoh ps was significantly higher than that in the land experiments and column experiments see text s3 and table s1 in the supporting information in comparison the h2o2 remediation produced a different result after two h2o2 additions the tph distribution interface continuously moved from the bulk soil towards groundwater while the soil groundwater interface remained stationary fig 6a bottom series the total signals increased significantly indicating new tph being generated in the imaged area fig 6c however for the soil particle imaging the signal on the particle surface decreased slightly after the h2o2 additions fig 6b bottom series and fig 6c these different observations indicated a possible petroleum generation on the soil particles and the subsequent fast transfer of the generated petroleum from the soil particles towards groundwater during the h2o2 treatment while on the surface of soil particles the petroleum degradation occurred simultaneously ossai et al 2020 inside the soil particles there might exist vigorous reaction with h2o2 causing the petroleum accumulation and the subsequent release from the soil interior to its surface and then to groundwater this prediction might account for the continuous tph increase over the large interface area based on the imaging results the soil particle size remained similar after the naoh ps additions but reduced considerably after the h2o2 additions figs 6d and s10 in the supporting information in agreement with the imaging results the average size of bulk soil particles changed slightly after the naoh ps additions but reduced considerably after the h2o2 additions figs 6e and s11d in the supporting information the results also found that the average specific surface area of the soil particles increased after they were treated by h2o2 but did not change after the naoh ps treatments these property changes of bulk soil particles inferred that h2o2 altered the particle morphologies while reducing their sizes and creating more pores but naoh ps did not impact these soil properties also see fig s11 in the supporting information suggesting that h2o2 was more reactive to the soil particles than naoh ps one of the reasons for the reactivity difference might relate to the hydrophilicity of the soil in contact with the reagents the hydrophilicity was 12 5 higher for the soil sample in contact with the h2o2 solution compared to that in contact with the naoh ps solution figs 6e s11a c and s12a in the supporting information it evidenced that h2o2 might enter the soil particles and get in contact with the petroleum substances more easily in addition h2o2 degraded petroleum substances faster than naoh ps figs 5g h and s13 in the supporting information which might be due to a larger amount of oh being produced fig s11e in the supporting information during the degradation process h2o2 was catalyzed by iron minerals in the soil sample to produce oh and ho2 o2 he et al 2016 lin and gurol 1998 shao et al 2022 usman et al 2022 while oh was the major reactive species to degrade petroleum substances the side reactions also produced h in the soil sample to maintain a steady ph eqs 2 4 figs s11e and s12b in the supporting information however when naoh ps was catalyzed by oh or the iron minerals to degrade the petroleum substances eq 7 9 the system ph was basic and facilitated the mineral crystallization process fig 6e and fig s11f in the supporting information cristelo et al 2012 furman et al 2010 huang et al 2021 rao et al 2022 wang et al 2022b zhang et al 2021 therefore the basic ph during the naoh ps treatment might yield a negative effect on the hydrophilicity of the soil sample and a higher mineral crystallization level on the soil surface might result in clogging the soil pores preventing the release of petroleum substances from the soil interior to its surface different from this the produced oxygen during the h2o2 treatment might generate pressure inside the soil particles break the particles into smaller pieces create more pores in the soil and then push the remaining petroleum substances from the interior to the surface 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h o h 2 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h h o 2 3 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 2 h o 2 4 f e 3 h o 2 f e 2 h o 2 5 f e 3 o 2 f e

in this study we developed a raman spectroscopic and microscopic method to rapidly measure heterogeneous soil and groundwater in situ and visualized the dynamic tph distribution at the soil groundwater interface using extraction rs we determined the petroleum compositions and total petroleum contents with simple sample preparation for the soil and groundwater from a contaminated land using fiber rs we rapidly monitored the isco remediation dynamics for petroleum contaminated soil and groundwater on the site or in situ through the micro area raman imaging of the soil groundwater interface we observed the petroleum release in situ from the soil interior to it surface and then to the groundwater with the h2o2 treatment while the in situ dynamic information of land isco remediation processes is crucial for understanding the efficiency and effect of utilizing oxidants combined with the remediation goal for a petroleum contaminated land e g the reuse of the land for an industrial commercial or farming purpose this study may help the selection of an appropriate isco reagent and remediation plan by taking into account whether deep remediation is desirable the limitations of this raman spectroscopic and microscopic method may exist for future evaluation based on the current fiber rs instrumentation it is challenging to fully eliminate the reflected light from the optical fiber coupling interface cong et al 2017 and to significantly improve the probe depth and detection sensitivity meanwhile although two representative petroleum contaminated lands and a few organic pollutants were researched for validating this method fig s6 8 in the supporting information different lands may vary significantly in their soil and groundwater compositions ph and other physical chemical geographic information thus the method may require optimization or may work unsuccessfully according to specific studies in addition considering specific remediation strategies for specific lands e g using the injection well and pump to add the isco reagents h2o2 may not be very efficient and cause flue gas therefore the control of safety risk as well as economic expense possibly outweighs the consideration of achieving a deep remediation goal in such cases the significance becomes minor to study the in situ remediation process with the raman spectroscopic and

15003,microplastics mps are increasingly released into the environment due to the widespread usage and improper management of plastics considerable research efforts have been devoted to the remediation of mps froth flotation has been demonstrated as an effective method to remove mps in water and sediment however there is a lack of knowledge on the regulation of the hydrophobicity hydrophilicity of mps surfaces we found that exposure to the natural environment resulted in the increased hydrophilicity of mps the flotation efficiencies of polyvinyl chloride pvc polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyethylene glycol terephthalate pet mps decreased to zero after six months of natural incubation in rivers according to various characterizations the hydrophilization mechanism is mainly correlated with surface oxidation and the deposition of clay minerals inspired by surface wettability conversion we applied surfactants collectors to enhance mps hydrophobicity and flotation efficiency anionic sodium oleate naol and cationic dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dtac were used to regulate surface hydrophobicity the effects of collector concentration ph conditioning time and metal ions on mps flotation were thoroughly elucidated characterizations and adsorption experiments were performed to describe the heterogeneous adsorption of surfactants on mps surfaces the interaction between surfactants and mps was explained through density functional theory dft simulations the dispersion energy between hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains attracts collectors on the mps surface and the collector molecules wrap and laminate to mps surfaces flotation using naol exhibited a higher removal efficiency and naol was environmentally friendly subsequently we investigated the activation of ca2 fe3 and al3 to further improve the collecting efficiency of naol under the optimized conditions mps in natural rivers could be removed by froth flotation this study shows the great promise of froth flotation for the application of mps removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics removal froth flotation collector hydrophilization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics mps pollution is an emerging environmental issue due to its potentially harmful effects on ecosystems mps are plastic particles less than 5 mm in size with the increasing global production of plastics 4 8 12 7 million metric tons of mps are estimated to enter the ocean every year and approximately 80 of mps in the ocean are derived from land based sources rochman 2018 mps result in decreased feeding activity dwindling reserves altered immune and inflammatory responses and neurotoxic effects on organisms dawson et al 2018 some evidence has confirmed that the concentration of mps in human blood reaches 1 6 µg ml leslie et al 2022 and the correlation between mps and inflammatory bowel disease ibd status has been demonstrated to be significant yan et al 2022 in addition the accumulation of heavy metals organic pollutants and viruses may increase the toxicity of mps to biota tang et al 2021 in the past two decades worldwide research has contributed to advances concerning the sources transportation occurrence chemical behavior toxicology and ecological effects of mps fei et al 2022 due to human activity the abundance of mps in canal rivers can exceed 140 items l leslie et al 2017 researchers found that mps in the surface water of the yellow river even reached 930 items l han et al 2020 with the increase in mps contamination the development of mps removal technology is critical regarding mps separation from the aquatic environment many researchers have focused on quantitative analysis by using density extraction grause et al 2022 magnetic separation ramage et al 2022 adsorption luo et al 2022 electrostatic separation enders et al 2020 and oil separation scopetani et al 2020 however many methods are limited to the bench scale extraction of mps therefore several strategies for water treatment are considered such as chemical coagulation rajala et al 2020 electrocoagulation shen et al 2022 and membrane filtration nabi et al 2022 however many techniques have focused on the size and concentration of mps for removal but have neglected the surface hydrophobicity of mps the intrinsic hydrophobicity of plastic is stronger than that of environmental media therefore froth flotation developed for mineral separation has the potential to remove mps the adherence of air bubbles on mps forms an aggregation of mps and air bubbles which can float from water due to their lower density jiang et al 2020 flotation can remove mps of different densities in surface water and be applied to remediate localized contamination by mps several studies have investigated the flotation of mps real time monitoring of mp bubble interactions at the microscale and mp concentrations has been realized swart et al 2022 in addition modified or functionalized microbubbles have drawn much interest because of their efficiency in capturing mps increasing the effectiveness of removal zhang et al 2021a according to the findings of the life cycle assessment lca froth flotation had a significantly lower cost and environmental impact than that of alternative removal processes jiang et al 2022a however plastics undergo a series of surface changes in their natural environment that alter surface wettability this work assumes that mps increase hydrophilicity in natural water bodies and flotation removal can be achieved by restoring hydrophobicity through surfactant regulation mps can interact with environmental media and undergo oxidation and increasing oxygen containing groups and roughness can enhance the hydrophilicity of mps in addition mps may contain different active sites and exhibit varying sensitivities to oxidation zhang et al 2020 the interaction between mps and metal ions also depends on chelation with oxygen containing groups tang et al 2020 nevertheless low concentrations of organic matter and metal ions in the natural environment make it difficult for mps to be hydrophilic and sink in the flotation process zhang et al 2021b the energy barrier between mps and sediment particles can be weakened as a result of the bridge effect of metal ions which causes the spontaneous deposition of sediment particles on mps surfaces jiang et al 2022a it is possible that mps are easily hydrophilized in the environment and that flotation removal is significantly hampered however the hydrophilization process of mps in the natural environment has not been thoroughly investigated the development of mps flotation should resolve these major stumbling blocks given the intrinsic hydrophobicity of mps long chain surfactants with hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties may adhere to mps surfaces and enhance the hydrophobicity of mps through van der waals forces and the hydrophobic forces jiang et al 2022b because mineral particles are hydrophilic surfactants namely collectors are often used in mineral engineering to selectively enhance the hydrophobicity of mineral particles and separate them in flotation because of its great effectiveness low cost and environmental friendliness sodium oleate naol a typical anionic collector has been extensively employed in the flotation of oxide and silicate minerals gao et al 2022b apart from the essential contribution of hydrophobic interactions the electrostatic attraction may significantly enhance the adsorption between mps and the cationic collector shen et al 2021 compared to other cationic collectors quaternary ammonium salts are more stable are less hazardous and exhibit stronger collecting abilities thus we chose dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dtac as a promising candidate jiang et al 2018 herein this study aimed to investigate the hydrophilization process of mps in the aquatic environment and its impact on subsequently applied froth flotation in the removal of mps for these purposes the main objectives were a to comprehensively simulate the natural exposure of polyvinyl chloride pvc polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyethylene glycol terephthalate pet mps b to systematically investigate the hydrophilization mechanism of mps in aquatic environments c to study the flotation removal of mps using naol and dtac d to analyze the interaction between mps and collectors aided by density functional theory dft simulation and e to optimize the removal process by activating mps surfaces and verify the feasibility of mps flotation 2 materials and methods 2 1 mps and reagents polyvinyl chloride pvc polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyethylene glycol terephthalate pet were derived from wastewater pipes textiles packages lampshades and bottles respectively these waste plastics were crushed into debris with a diameter of 500 1000 μm for the preparation of mps recently some reports mentioned that the mps in the surface water of the estuary region were larger 0 5 mm 81 9 due to more frequent human activities huang et al 2023 these mps were rinsed with distilled water and dried at room temperature all reagents used in this experiment included terpineol sodium hydroxide naoh hydrochloric acid hcl sodium oleate naol dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dtac sodium chloride nacl calcium chloride cacl2 ferric chloride fecl3 and aluminum chloride alcl3 figure s1 shows the structures of naol and dtac which are typical anionic and cationic collectors in mineral processing 2 2 natural incubation of mps we prepared round shrimp traps with a diameter of 40 cm and 100 mesh pore size 150 μm nylon bags first we placed 10 g of mps 500 1000 μm into the nylon sample bag and sealed it the mps in the bags can fully interact with the aquatic environment and the mps sample could not leak out fig 1 mps less than 74 μm for characterization were placed in 300 mesh pore size 53 μm sample bags the nylon bag was fixed at the bottom of the trap the shrimp cage was suspended 10 30 cm below the river surface as shown in fig 1 the outdoor exposure experiment of mps began in october 2021 and was conducted in the yudai river changsha china the mps in the bags were collected at 0 1 2 3 and 6 months the collected mps were washed with distilled water three times to remove sediment particles and animal and plant residues in sample bags guan et al 2020 then the mps were dried at room temperature for further flotation tests 2 3 flotation removal and surfactant regulation the flotation system consisted of a self designed flotation column with a diameter of 6 cm and a length of 50 cm an air pump and a sphere air stone naturally aged mps 0 1 g were mixed with 1 4 l of distilled water to simulate mps pollution in our pre experiment the mps concentration did not affect the removal efficiency fig s2 the concentration of mps used in this work was close to that of some rivers contaminated by mps leslie et al 2017 and a detailed discussion about mps concentration is provided in the supplementary materials text s1 terpineol 5 mg l was dosed in the flotation column to generate air bubbles and the bubbles and mps formed a lighter than water aggregate thus floating out of the flotation column after the exposure experiments hydrophilic mps might not float in the flotation process in the conditioning process we added collectors and stirred the mixed solution at 180 rpm for 2 min to restore the hydrophobicity of the mps then the mixed solution was poured into the column and flotation lasted for 4 min the floated mps were regarded as the removed mps in addition several factors including conditioning time 1 10 min ph 3 11 collector concentration 1 100 mg l na concentration 0 500 mg l and ca2 concentration 0 50 mg l were considered the presence of metal ions may promote the adsorption of organic matter on mps surfaces lv et al 2023 therefore we set an activation process before the conditioning and tried to reduce the naol concentration to less than 10 mg l trace amounts of ca2 0 05 0 5 mg l fe3 0 05 0 5 mg l or al3 0 05 0 5 mg l were added into the solution and stirred at 180 rpm the activation duration was regulated at 15 min to obtain the optimal efficiency figure s3 after the activation the flotation process was the same as the previous steps with a specific naol concentration 2 5 10 mg l finally an optimal condition was determined based on the removal efficiency 2 4 adsorption experiment the adsorption capacities of naol and dtac on mp surfaces were determined via the change in collector concentration in solution the adsorption capacities of the collectors were calculated as depicted by eq 1 1 c q v c 1 c 2 m where cq mg g is the adsorption capacity of the collector c1 mg l and c2 mg l are the initial and residual concentrations of the collector respectively m g was the mass of mps a total of 50 mg mps was mixed with 50 ml of specific concentrations 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l of the collector after conditioning for 30 min the mixed solution was filtered by a ptfe membrane with a pore diameter of 0 22 μm and the residue collector concentration was determined by total organic carbon toc gao et al 2021a we employed langmuir and freundlich models to fit the adsorption isotherm results wang and guo 2020 a detailed description of these models is listed in the supplementary materials text s2 2 5 characterization a contact angle meter was used to measure the hydrophilicity of the mps surface jjc i changchun optical instrument factory china we employed a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir nicolet 6700 thermofisher scientific usa to record the change of functional groups x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps nicolet avatar 360 nicolet magua corporation usa was used to characterize the elemental composition of the mps we needed the high resolution spectra of c 1s and si 2p to describe the chemical state information of key elements on the mps surface and the quantification and analysis platform were provided by avantage xps software the surface morphology of mps before and after natural incubation was analyzed by a scanning electron microscope sem evo18 carl zeiss of germany the results of energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds can be obtained from sem scanning and we can obtain the element distribution on mps surfaces the composition of particles coated on mps was revealed by x ray diffraction xrd siemens electronic instruments d500 germany the concentration of collectors naol and dtac in the solution was determined by an automated total organic carbon analyzer toc lcph shimadzu japan the uv spectrum of naol was obtained by a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan in a wavelength range between 190 and 400 nm and the formation of flocs changed the uv spectrum of naol gao et al 2021a density functional theory dft simulations were performed by using the gaussian 16 software package for geometry optimization frequency analysis and energy calculation of ps naol and dtac in order to investigate the interaction between mps and collectors detailed information about dft simulation was listed in supplementary materials text s3 the type and number of natural mps were characterized by a laser direct infrared spectroscopy ldir agilent 8700 usa and the detailed pretreatment was listed in supplementary materials text s4 the test of river water quality was presented in supplementary materials text s5 an optical microscope was used to observe the natural mps in water before and after the flotation olympus cx23 japan 2 6 bench scale flotation test surface water was taken from the xiangjiang river at the xiangjiang river changsha comprehensive hub changsha china the water sample was collected 10 30 cm below the surface water using a stainless steel water quality sampler hossain et al 2022 immediately the collected sample was then placed in a glass bottle and maintained at room temperature until further investigation one l of surface water was added to 0 1 mg l fe3 and stirred for 15 min after activation the solution was mixed with 2 5 mg l naol to enhance the hydrophobicity of the mps and 5 mg l terpineol was used as a frother the mixed solution was transferred to the flotation column after flotation particles after the same purification were analyzed by ldir 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface hydrophilization of mps induced by the aquatic environment to test the effectiveness of their removal by froth flotation and to characterize their functional groups elemental composition and surface topography we collected mps throughout various periods of natural incubation the floatability of mps served as an indication of the removal efficiency due to their intrinsic hydrophobicity the removal of original mps performed remarkably well in the flotation however plastic granules only gradually become hydrophilic after being incubated in an aquatic environment the removal efficiency of mps was in the order of pp pet ps pvc pvc floatability vanished within the first month fig 2 a after an incubation period of three months the removal efficiencies of pet and ps were completely eliminated however pp retains its floatability for the first two months and its floatability gradually decreases in the next four months given the abundance of nonpolar cc chains in pp mps we hypothesized that the low density and hydrophobic surface of pp mps might be the causes of their high floatability although the sensitivity of mps to incubation duration varies natural incubation can cause hydrophobic mps to gradually transform into their hydrophilic counterparts as shown in fig 2b 2e the surface of pvc mps has characteristic peaks of c cl 638 and 696 cm 1 and the asymmetric stretching vibration of aliphatic c h 2966 cm 1 raval et al 2018 pet mps possessed stretching vibration peaks of co 1727 and 1673 cm 1 stretching vibration peaks of c o c 1265 and 1124 cm 1 and the in plane deformation vibration of oco 976 cm 1 rivaton 1993a the following adsorption bands on ps are consistent with their composition stretching vibrations of aliphatic ch 2919 and 2848 cm 1 bending vibration of aromatic cc 1600 1582 1492 and 1449 cm 1 and vibration of aromatic ch 756 and 657 cm 1 cheng et al 2017 notably ft ir spectra implied that the pp mps contained abundant plasticizer the ft ir spectra of mps have similar profiles before and after natural incubation except for the co 1030 cm 1 and co 1672 cm 1 adsorption bands which is strong evidence for surface oxidation of mps table s2 also shows an increased proportion of o which was derived from surface oxidation and mineral deposition of mps as shown in fig 3 the xps spectra of synthetic polymers were composed of sp3 c 284 5 ev c o 286 2 ev and o co 289 ev aging is the main reason for the substitution of ch by co and co in the preincubated mps the contents of o co and co of pvc ps pet and pp dramatically rose after six months of natural incubation further demonstrating the occurrence of surface oxidation according to relevant literature ester bonds in pet mps can easily breakdown into co and co groups in an oxidative environment fávaro et al 2007 rivaton 1993b for ps mps the aliphatic ch is easily oxidized as co and oco groups with stable aromatic rings dupont gillain et al 2000 oxidation can introduce co and o co on pvc and pp mps through a chain reaction consisting of proton substitution and chain breaking where cc is a main intermediate product dong et al 2020 thanh truc and lee 2017 c o accounted for the major section on incremental oxygen containing functional groups additionally the amounts of si and al elements in polymer samples rose with the duration of incubation supporting the adherence of clay minerals to plastic surfaces table s2 the si 2p spectra of mps after the six months of natural incubation also confirmed the aluminosilicate on mps surfaces fig s4 according to the water quality the increase in n may be due to the adsorption of nh4 n on mps surfaces table s1 in addition the colonization of biofilms can increase n on mps surfaces guan et al 2020 but we did not detect s and p in xps and eds analyses fig s5 sem images also showed that mps surfaces were mainly covered by si containing particles compared with other work biofilm colonization may not be a major factor for mps hydrophilization in this experiment as seen in fig 4 the polymers in the control group exhibit a smooth and regular surface whereas the plastics that were incubated show a rough and granular surface with ridges pits fractures and scratches crack encircled debris may be scraped off of mps matrices to produce mps with tiny diameters according to the xrd patterns fig s6 yeelinite gismondine mirabilite quartz and calcite amorphous particles comprising ca si al and mg were found on the surface of mps the aging effect of mps introduced abundant oxygen containing functional groups co and oco subsequently chemical bonds with strong polarity induce mps to adsorb fine mineral particles in aquatic environments mahadevi and sastry 2013 some studies also mention that sediment particles can be spontaneously deposited onto the surface of plastics based on interaction energy calculations li et al 2019 in conclusion the incubation in aquatic environments leads to surface oxidation and deposition of aluminosilicate particles thereby resulting in the hydrophilization of mps therefore the hydrophilicity of mps is greatly enhanced and the adhesion of air bubbles on mps is weakened threfore there is an urgent need to restore the hydrophobicity of mps 3 2 hydrophobicity recovery of mps in mineral engineering when mineral particles are hydrophilic surfactants are often used to enhance the hydrophobicity of mineral particles and to selectively separate them in flotation de medeiros and baltar 2018 in this work we used naol as an anionic collector to restore the hydrophobicity of the aged mps ph collector concentration and conditioning time were key factors for the hydrophobicity recovery wei et al 2021 at the same concentration of naol pp showed higher removal efficiency than that of other mps because it was not completely hydrophilic after six months of natural exposure naol concentration significantly contributed to the increase in the removal efficiency of mps from 0 to approximately 80 fig 5 a notably the high concentration of naol 100 mg l was still less than the critical micelle concentration cmc of naol sun et al 2022 at the same naol concentration 50 mg l the flotation removal of pp pet and ps was more efficient in acidic environments alkalinity may inhibit the flotation process naol in solution can be hydrolyzed into na oleate in alkaline environments and oleic acid in acidic environments the oleic acid molecules play a vital role in the hydrophobicity recovery of mps in the alkaline environment the electrostatic repulsion between more negatively charged mps and oleate may be stronger gao et al 2022a interestingly the pvc removal efficiency increased with increasing ph and then gradually decreased at ph 9 fig 5b the previous xrd and sem results indicated the presence of caco3 filler on the pvc surface caco3 may generate ca2 in acid and form calcium oleate deposits which hinder the adsorption of oleate on the mps surface metal ions can activate mineral surfaces and promote the adsorption of some collectors gao et al 2021b the addition of na at high concentrations can significantly improve the removal efficiency fig 5c which followed the order of pp pet ps pvc metal ions in higher valence states can promote the adsorption of organic matter on mps surfaces lv et al 2023 ca2 inevitably adhered to the negatively charged surfaces of mps and activated mps surfaces therefore the electrostatic repulsion between oleate and mps can be weakened we assumed that electrostatic interactions could significantly affect the adsorption of surfactants on mps surfaces the low concentration of ca2 0 1 mg l promoted the removal of pp pet and ps but inhibited that of pvc fig 5d the ca2 on the mps surfaces strengthened the adsorption of oleate thereby enhancing the hydrophobicity recovery of mps however pvc has inherent ca2 on its surface due to the presence of caco3 filler furthermore the mixture of ca2 and naol might generate nanocolloid particles of calcium oleate feng et al 2018 because the uv absorbance of naol increased with the flocs and a higher ca2 concentration could form more calcium oleate fig 5f the addition of ca2 decreased the cmc of the solution and the formation of calcium oleate consumed some oleate thus the removal was less effective wang et al 2021 a low dosage of ca2 can improve mps flotation removal using naol while excessive ca2 might form flocs with oleate and hinder flotation the effect of the conditioning time on the removal efficiency was not significant fig 5e the hydrophobic recovery of mps was achieved almost instantaneously indicating a rapid adsorption of naol on mps to alleviate the electrostatic repulsion between mps and the collector we used cationic dtac to enhance the flotation removal of mps the promoting effect of dtac at low concentrations less than 50 mg l on mps removal was considerably higher than that of naol fig 6 a nevertheless the improvement in the removal efficiency of pvc was not as expected because ca2 leached from pvc interfered with the action of dtac besides the inherent hydrophilicity of naturally incubated pvc was strong and many collectors were needed to restore the hydrophobicity of pvc when the dtac concentration was further increased to 100 mg l approximately 80 of pp pet and ps could be removed which was close to the results of naol conditioning the collection capacity of dtac was affected by the ph value and a stark 2 4 fold increase in the removal efficiency of mps was observed as the ph value increased from 3 to 11 fig 6b the interaction between mps and dtac was stronger in alkaline environments ionic strength can enhance the electrostatic interaction between mps and naol gao et al 2021b conversely the presence of na did not improve the removal efficiency even though the flotation removal of ps was mildly inhibited fig 6c na could cause an increase in surface potentials on mps weakening the electrostatic interaction between mps and dtac the inhibition effect of ca2 was more significant and dtac showed almost no effect on pvc recovery at a ca2 concentration of 10 mg l fig 6d likewise dtac could efficiently restore the hydrophobicity of mps within 1 min fig 6e the activation of cations decreased the collection ability of dtac but increased that of naol previous research found that dtac concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mg l could cause genotoxicity in mammalian or plant cells ferk et al 2007 compared to cationic dtac anionic naol tended to be more biodegradable and less toxic tatini et al 2021 as a result naol has superior application potential in the flotation removal of mps 3 3 adsorption of naol and dtac we conducted adsorption isotherm experiments to investigate the interaction between collectors and mps the correlated fitting parameters and correlation coefficients are listed in table s3 based on ft ir and xps results all mps contained inherent oxygen containing groups which might improve the adsorption capacity of the collectors according to the naol conditioning the adsorption isotherm of mps was better fitted using the freundlich adsorption model r2 0 97 0 99 than the langmuir model r 2 0 90 0 99 physical adsorption may dominate the interactions between mps and collectors these results supported that the adsorption of naol molecules on mps surfaces was heterogeneous the adsorption capacity of naol followed the order pvc pp pet ps fig 7 a while this order was inconsistent with the removal efficiency the adsorption capacity of naol by pvc was greater than that of other mps which could be attributed to the higher proportion of oxygen containing groups and the polarity of the ccl bond zou et al 2020 although electrostatic repulsion might hinder the adsorption of naol on the mp surface van der waals forces and lewis acid ab attraction contribute to adsorption peng and wang 2022 sun et al 2023 at a dtac of 50 mg l the adsorption capacities of dtac of pvc pet ps and pp only reached 0 78 mg g 0 55 mg g 0 39 mg g and 0 65 mg g fig 7b respectively similarly the heterogeneous adsorption of dtac on mps was well described by the freundlich adsorption model r 2 0 96 and the adsorption was favorable n 1 text s2 a surfactant consists of a polar headgroup and a nonpolar tail and the polar groups provide electrostatic attraction or repulsion interestingly despite the stronger electrostatic attraction of cationic dtac to negatively charged mps the adsorption capacity of dtac was much lower than that of naol indicating that the contribution by polar groups was limited therefore the nonplar groups of the surfactant dominate the adsorption the longer chain length can generate stronger hydrophobic interactions between the surfactant and mps atkin et al 2003 due to the different lengths of hydrocarbon chains figure s1 the adsorption capacities of dtac and naol on mps vary 3 4 characterization of surfactant on mps after conditioning with naol intense peaks were observed at 1540 cm 1 2853 cm 1 and 2919 cm 1 on the pvc surface corresponding to the carboxyl cooh asymmetric and symmetric ch vibrations respectively which confirmed the highest adsorption capacity of naol on pvc fig 8 a besides the enhanced peaks of cooh and ch bonds appeared on the pet surfaces after the naol conditioning fig 8d due to the low adsorption capacity of naol the ft ir spectra of the treated ps showed only a weak change in cooh fig 8c no new peaks appeared under the effect of dtac on the one hand the adsorption capacity of dtac on mps was much lower than that of naol according to the previous adsorption results on the other hand the stretching of the cn bond at 1481 cm 1 and the bending vibration of the nh bond at 1140 cm 1 might overlap with the original peaks of hydrophilic mps warsi et al 2022 in addition the abundant ammonia nitrogen in natural water bodies may be adsorbed on the mps surfaces resulting in insignificant changes in the ft ir of naturally incubated mps after dtac conditioning li et al 2021 contact angle measurements provided a more visual indication of the hydrophilic variation on the mps surfaces the original mps exhibit hydrophobic surfaces with higher contact angles after natural incubation for 6 months the contact angles of mps significantly decreased fig 8e the adsorption of dtac and naol both contributed to the increased contact angles of mps indicating the enhanced hydrophobicity of mps by collectors according to fig 9 a and 9 c the extrema of electrostatic potential only exist in carboxyl groups and trimethylammoniums of collectors implying a slight electrostatic potential difference between ps and collector molecules the electrostatic potential difference is a driving factor for the molecular interaction which causes the ps and collectors to attract each other however there is no notable attraction between ps and collector molecules the visualized weak interaction energy reveals the combination of electrostatic repulsion and dispersion energy among mps and collectors fig 9b and 9d lu and chen 2021 the repulsion energy may be induced by the steric hindrance of aromatic rings and the dispersion energy is a main contributor to molecular attraction that may be attributed to hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains table s4 in addition the interactions between ps and collectors involve ambiguous hydrogen bond components therefore the hydrocarbon chains of oleic acid and dtac tend to laminate and wrap on the mps surface and endow a hydrophobic surface for naturally incubated mps 3 5 ionic activation to conserve naol considering the cost and pollution of reagents we wanted to confine the naol concentration to less than 10 mg l at this concentration active sludge exhibited a high tolerance to naol toxicity alves et al 2001 metal ions with higher valence have proven to be effective in improving flotation efficiency with the activation of ca2 the removal ratio of most mps was increased except for pvc as mentioned in our previous discussion due to the caco3 filler the surface of pvc discharged ca2 and excess ca2 generated calcium oleate that inhibited the collection process the removal efficiencies of pet pp and ps peaked at a ca2 concentration of 0 10 mg l fig s7 and gradually declined with increasing ca2 concentration in general it was difficult to achieve 80 removal of mps with the activation by ca2 interestingly metal ions with higher valences such as al3 and fe3 exhibited a more significant activation effect fig s7 in addition although the flotation of pvc could not be activated by ca2 over 80 pvc could be removed after the activation of 0 10 mg l al3 5 00 mg l naol or 0 10 mg l fe3 2 50 mg l naol higher concentrations of naol did not determine the highest removal ratio and the ratio of metal ions to naol also mattered under the combined effect of 0 05 mg l fe3 and 2 50 mg l naol approximately 100 of pvc could be removed by flotation due to the cost and sustainability of the reagents we determined 0 10 mg l fe3 and 2 50 mg l naol as the optimized conditions under these conditions the flotation removal process not only obtained high removal efficiency 80 of all mps but also reduced the environmental burden of reagent consumption according to figure s8 hydrophilic mps first experienced the activation of metal ions and the adsorption of abundant metal ions increased the surface potential of the mps the bridging effect of ions promoted the adsorption of oleate and oleic acid on mps finally air bubbles adhered to mps to form a bubble mps aggregate that floated out of the water 3 6 application of mps flotation we used fe3 to activate the collection of mps and performed flotation removal on natural water samples from the xiangjiang river flotation removal could reduce the turbidity of water to some extent however the comparison of microscope images suggested the presence of plastic fiber in untreated and treated water fig 10 a and b ldir was used to analyze the polymer content in water samples fig 10c shows that silicon resin accounted for the greatest proportion 59 0 of mps in the xiangjiang river followed by pu 34 1 silicon resin could originate from the coating of vessels because the xiangjiang river is an important waterway lagerström et al 2022 after flotation scarce plastic particles were observed in the water samples fig 10d flotation significantly reduced the numbers of silicon resin and pu and those of other mps fluctuated slightly the flotation removal of mps statistically reached 52 1 which is lower than that in the simulated removal experiments the collector can be adsorbed and consumed by suspended particles and we need to find a balance between collector dosage and pollution control besides the collision probability played a vital role in flotation removal and tiny mps might require smaller denser air bubbles to improve the collision probability therefore surfactant selectivity and nano bubble production may promote mps removal even so flotation removal has the potential to treat localized mps pollution such as the effluent of wastewater treatment plants the development of mps flotation would benefit from the technology of micro and nanobubbles 4 conclusion in this work we thoroughly investigated the application of flotation for mps removal and found that the hydrophilization of mps in the natural environment might obstruct flotation after naturally incubating mps in aquatic environments for six months the removal efficiency decreased from 100 to 0 the hydrophilization order of mps is as follows pvc ps pet pp several characterizations were employed to investigate the hydrophilization mechanism of mps in aquatic environments which were induced by a rise in oxygen containing groups and clay mineral adhesion a collection process before flotation was necessary to enhance the hydrophobicity of mps we innovatively utilized cationic and anionic collectors namely naol and dtac for the flotation removal of mps the effects of ph reagent concentration time and ionic strength were thoroughly investigated the adsorption isotherm suggested that heterogeneous adsorption of naol and dtac on mps occurred considering the pollution and the applied range we preferred to use naol based on the dft analysis it could be concluded that the hydrocarbon chains of collectors tend to laminate and wrap on mps surface and endow a hydrophobic surface for naturally incubated mps furthermore the activation of metal ions was used to improve the flotation process and the optimal conditions were 0 10 mg l fe3 and 2 50 mg l naol the significant reduction in natural mps confirmed the utility of froth flotation these findings provide valuable insights into the hydrophilization process of mps in the aquatic environment and the interaction mechanism of collectors with mps prompting the application of froth flotation in mps removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15004,co pollution of soil with pesticide residues and antibiotic resistance genes args is increasing due to the substantial usage of pesticides and organic fertilizers in greenhouse based agricultural production non antibiotic stresses including those from agricultural fungicides are potential co selectors for the horizontal transfer of args but the underlying mechanism remains unclear intragenus and intergenus conjugative transfer systems of the antibiotic resistant plasmid rp4 were established to examine conjugative transfer frequency under stress from four widely used fungicides triadimefon chlorothalonil azoxystrobin and carbendazim the mechanisms were elucidated at the cellular and molecular levels using transmission electron microscopy flow cytometry rt qpcr and rna seq techniques the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 between escherichia coli strains increased with the rising exposure concentrations of chlorothalonil azoxystrobin and carbendazim but was suppressed between e coli and pseudomonas putida by a high fungicide concentration 10 µg ml triadimefon did not significantly affect conjugative transfer frequency exploration of the underlying mechanisms revealed that i chlorothalonil exposure mainly promoted generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species stimulated the sos response and increased cell membrane permeability while ii azoxystrobin and carbendazim primarily enhanced expression of conjugation related genes on the plasmid these findings reveal the fungicide triggered mechanisms associated with plasmid conjugation and highlight the potential role of non bactericidal pesticides on the dissemination of args graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fungicide antibiotic resistance gene conjugation conjugative plasmid rna seq data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotic resistance is gradually becoming a global public health problem the estimated death toll attributable to antibiotic resistance will reach 10 million people by 2050 if no immediate action is taken o neill 2014 indeed antibiotic resistance has gone far beyond the clinical context and was ranked as number one of six emerging issues of environmental concern in frontiers 2017 by unep 2017 due to the discharge of municipal sewage and livestock manure antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes args are rapidly transferred into aquatic and soil environments elder et al 2021 ondon et al 2021 these environments carrying args may also be contaminated by other organic and inorganic pollutants posing a more serious risk to the ecological environment and human health zhang et al 2022 zhou and hu 2017 zhou et al 2022 various studies have shown that horizontal gene transfer hgt is the main driver of the rapid spread of args in the environment larsson and flach 2022 von wintersdorff et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 args often relate to mobile genetic elements e g plasmids transposons integrative and conjugative elements and bacteriophages that can be shared between species via hgt partridge et al 2018 among the three horizontal transfer processes i e conjugation transformation and transduction plasmid mediated conjugation is considered to be the most efficient method for arg dissemination due to their prevalence in environment dang et al 2017 von wintersdorff et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 hgt of args is affected by several factors including temperature ph nutrients and external stresses qiu et al 2012 antibiotic stress is regarded as an important driving force for horizontal transfer of args larsson and flach 2022 conjugation of plasmid mediated args was enhanced by exposure to sublethal doses of some antibiotics e g levofloxacin cephalexin tetracycline and kanamycin wu et al 2020 fang et al 2015 reported that the abundance of args was related to the levels of residual antibiotics in agricultural soils moreover heavy metal stress can provide a co selective pressure for horizontal transfer of args in the environment beltrán de heredia et al 2023 zhou et al 2020 recent studies have characterized a variety of exogenous substances that enhance conjugation of plasmid borne args including disinfectants pharmaceuticals organic pollutants and microplastics ding et al 2022 lu et al 2020 2018 xia et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 these reports indicate that non antibiotic stress plays a crucial role in horizontal transmission of args pesticides are an important group of non antibiotic selectors for the environmental dissemination of args guo et al 2022 liao et al 2021 fungicides are pesticides that prevent fungal infestations of crops and most of which will eventually enter the environment zubrod et al 2019 triadimefon tdf chlorothalonil ctl azoxystrobin azo and carbendazim cbd are triazole chloronitrile strobilurin and benzimidazole fungicides respectively and dominate the fungicide market the environmental residual concentrations of these fungicides ranged from μg kg to mg kg tao et al 2021 wang et al 2020 which not only affected the population size community structure and enzyme activities of soil microorganisms but also shifted the pollution induced resistance to antibiotics in the microbial community for example the resistance of the soil bacterial community to chlortetracycline increased by 2 63 fold in the cbd treatment than that in the control fang et al 2016 furthermore exposure to these four fungicides increased the abundance of args in agricultural soils by about twice which was related to hgt mediated by mobile genetic elements e g conjugative plasmid r485 zhang et al 2020 in addition oxidative stress accompanied by the generation of reactive oxygen species ros is a common mechanism behind the toxicological effects of many pollutants including fungicides sharma et al 2022 zhou et al 2019 an increasing number of studies have shown that oxidative stress was crucial to the conjugation of plasmids between bacteria and accelerated the dissemination of args under non antibiotic stress ding et al 2022 liao et al 2021 wang et al 2019a it is therefore reasonable to speculate that these four fungicides may promote the spread of args through plasmid mediated conjugation however the underlying molecular mechanism involved in fungicide triggered hgt of plasmid mediated args remains unclear in this study intragenus from escherichia coli mg1655 to e coli hb101 and intergenus from e coli mg1655 to pseudomonas putida kt2440 conjugative transfer systems were established with the antibiotic resistant plasmid rp4 to examine conjugative transfer frequency under fungicide stress the underlying mechanisms were elucidated at the cellular and molecular levels using transmission electron microscopy flow cytometry real time quantitative pcr rt qpcr and genome wide rna sequencing rna seq we hypothesize that i fungicides promote the transfer frequency of args via plasmid mediated conjugation as increases in args in fungicide polluted soil are closely related to mobile genetic elements and ii this effect on conjugative transfer frequency is related to the specific fungicide as different chemical structures will determine distinct mechanisms these findings will provide evidence for the involvement of fungicides in the spread of args in the agricultural environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and culture media fungicide standards including tdf purity 98 5 ctl purity 99 0 azo purity 99 9 and cbd purity 99 0 were

as described above thiourea 100 μm was added before exposure to 1 0 µg ml fungicides to determine the capacity of the ros scavenger to prevent the excess accumulation of intracellular ros in addition the bacterial suspensions approximately 106 cfus ml were also treated with propidium iodide pi 10 μg ml to determine bacterial cell membrane permeability the fluorescence intensities of dcfh da and pi were measured using a cytoflex flow cytometer beckman coulter usa all tests were performed in triplicate 2 7 transmission electron microscopy tem to characterize the cell and membrane morphologies of

expression levels in the donor recipient and plasmid rp4 in the intergenus conjugation systems with fungicide concentrations of 0 and 1 μg ml rna isolation rrna removal strand specific cdna library construction and sequencing were conducted by novogene co ltd beijing china the raw data were filtered to discard low quality reads using the ngs qc toolkit patel and jain 2012 the clean data were mapped to the reference genomes of e coli k12 nc 000913 1 and p putida kt2440 nc 002947 4 and the rp4 plasmid nc 001621 1 retrieved from national center for biotechnology information ncbi htseq software anders et al 2015 was used to calculate gene expression levels using the unit fpkm fragments per kilobase of a gene per million mapped reads tables s8 s9 changes between treatments were calculated using log2 fold change values with a false positive correction test 2 10 statistical analysis statistical differences in the conjugative transfer frequency and gene expression levels between treatments were determined using one way analysis of variance anova and tukey s honest significant difference hsd significant differences between treatments are indicated by lowercase letters p 0 05 bar graphs volcano plots venn diagrams generatio plots and heatmaps were created using the ggplot2 and pheatmap packages all statistical analyses were performed in the r 3 6 0 environment 3 results and discussion 3 1 fungicides enhanced conjugative transfer frequency as expected mics and agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed that plasmid rp4 was successfully transferred into the recipients table s4 and figs s2 s5 the conjugative transfer frequencies of plasmid rp4 from e coli mg1655 to e coli hb101 1 93 10 5 to 1 20 10 4 were significantly higher than from e coli mg1655 to p putida kt2440 1 27 10 6 to 3 21 10 5 p 0 01 anova table s10 this was highly consistent with previous studies reporting the conjugative transfer frequencies of plasmid rp4 within or across genera lu et al 2018 wang et al 2015 in the intragenus system transfer frequencies under 10 µg ml ctl azo and cbd stress significantly increased to 2 62 2 38 and 3 03 fold respectively compared with the control fig 1 in the intergenus system the highest transfer frequencies were in the presence of 1 0 µg ml ctl azo and cbd with frequencies being 3 52 4 40 and 2 77 fold higher respectively table s11 by contrast no significant change in intragenus or intergenus conjugative transfer frequency was observed at any of the five tdf concentrations 0 001 to 10 µg ml these results support the hypothesis that fungicides are capable of increasing the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmids they can also be viewd as molecular based evidence for our previous finding that exposure to fungicides increased the abundance of args in agricultural soils via hgt zhang et al 2020 moreover this enhancement of conjugative transfer frequency depended on the particular fungicide involved we initially hypothesized that the distinct enhancing effects of a fungicide can be attributed to its chemical structure fig s1 this is in agreement with a recent study that the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 varied between non antibiotic pharmaceuticals including propranolol ibuprofen naproxen gemfibrozil and iopromide wang et al 2021 thus fungicides can increase the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmids and exert selective pressure for the dissemination of plasmid borne args via conjugation 3 2 fungicides stimulated ros generation and sos response oxidative stress plays a role in promoting conjugative transfer qiu et al 2012 wang et al 2021 in the presence of the four fungicides intracellular ros production in the donor e coli mg1655 and recipient e coli hb101 increased by 1 24 to 1 39 fold and by 1 06 to 1 25 fold respectively fig 2 a intracellular ros production in the recipient p putida kt2440 gradually increased as fungicide concentrations increased except for tdf with the highest increase 2 33 fold being observed when the bacteria were exposed to 10 µg ml ctl similarly lu et al 2018 reported that triclosan triggered ros generation was involved in the increased conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 between e coli mg1655 and p putida kt2440 the conjugative transfer frequencies of plasmid rp4 with and without an ros scavenger were also compared fig 2b as expected thiourea treatment significantly decreased both intragenus and intergenus conjugative transfer frequencies of plasmid rp4 indicating that ros production induced by fungicides is an important factor affecting conjugation lu et al 2020 2018 wang et al 2019a oxidative stress can induce two regulatory defense systems in most gram negative bacteria 1 the oxyr soxr and soxs systems and 2 the rpos related system we quantified the expression of the ros regulatory genes soxs soxr oxyr and rpos under fungicide stress figs s6 s9 the expression of these genes differing significantly between the intragenus and intergenus systems this may be related to the distinctly regulation of superoxide stress observed in p putida kt2440 and e coli park et al 2006 expression of soxs soxr oxyr and rpos was most strongly enhanced by the ctl and cbd treatments followed by azo while tdf treatment had no significant effect strong positive correlations were observed between gene expression levels and conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 under fungicide stress fig 2c for example expression of soxs oxyr and rpos was significantly correlated with intragenus conjugative transfer frequency under cbd stress suggesting that cbd can promote conjugation transfer via up regulation of these genes xie et al 2019 rna seq results showed that a variety of ros related genes ahpc hmp and sodb in e coli mg1655 and tpx srka and soda in p putida kt2440 were up regulated after exposure to fungicides fig 2d it has also been reported that exposure to carbamazepine triclosan and copper silver ions and nanoparticles increased the expression of ahpc ahpf and sodb in bacteria lu et al 2020 2018 wang et al 2019a the sos response can be induced by various environmental factors and can increase conjugative transfer frequency beaber et al 2004 lu et al 2018 wang et al 2019a in brief the enhancement by fungicides of lexa and umud gene expression was dependent on the conjugative transfer system the specific fungicide and fungicide concentration figs s10 s11 for example expression of lexa was significantly increased 1 35 to 3 55 fold in the presence of 0 01 µg ml ctl in the intragenus system but this effect was not statistically significant in the intergenus system similarly previous studies have indicated that exposure to fine particulate matter such as petrol and diesel exhaust particles stimulate expression of lexa and umud genes and accelerate horizontal transfer of plasmid mediated args xie et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 furthermore the transcriptional expression of sos response related genes cho recx rpna rpnb rpnc yafn yafo and yebg in e coli mg1655 and tpx srka soda and ruva in p putida kt2440 increased following treatment with the four fungicides fig 2d this is consistent with a previous study showing that exposure to both silver ions and nanoparticles increased the expression of rexx and yebg genes in donor bacteria and promoted conjugative transfer of plasmids lu et al 2020 overall the greatest increase in expression of genes related to ros and sos responses was observed when samples were treated with ctl suggesting that these responses are crucial for an increase in conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 under ctl stress 3 3 fungicides increased cell membrane permeability increased production of intracellular ros during fungicide exposure can damage the bacterial cell membrane and increase its permeability jaime et al 2012 which could promote horizontal transfer of plasmids between bacteria wang et al 2021 bacterial cell membrane permeability varied depending on strain and fungicide treatment fig 3 a the cell membrane permeability of p putida kt2440 was more susceptible to fungicide treatment than e coli mg1655 and e coli hb101 presumably due to differences between the two genera similarly lu et al 2020 reported that changes in cell membrane permeability were greater in p putida kt2440 than e coli le392 when treated with silver ions and nanoparticles furthermore the cell membrane boundary was clearly visible and the cytoplasm appeared compact in the control bacteria whereas some cell membranes were irregular and the boundary was incomplete in the treated samples indicating that the cell membrane was damaged by fungicide exposure figs 3b and s12 the most serious cell membrane damage was observed with 1 µg ml ctl treatment previous studies have reported increased cell membrane damage in donor and recipient bacteria following copper and aluminum nanoparticle treatments qiu et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 although no significant change was observed in the number of bacteria exhibiting cell membrane damage in the intragenus systems with tdf and ctl damage i increased significantly with azo and cbd treatments it is concluded that the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmids between e coli mg1655 and e coli hb101 is accelerated by exposure to high concentrations of azo and cbd lu et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the outer cell membrane is a formidable barrier that regulates the penetration of specific substrates delcour 2009 thus we quantified in two conjugative transfer systems exposed to fungicides the expression of three genes ompa ompc and ompf that encode the representative outer membrane porin proteins achouak et al 2001 choi and lee 2019 only a few significant changes in gene expression were detected in tdf treatment figs s13 s15 however when in the intragenus system was exposed to ctl azo or cbd the expression levels of the genes were increased with higher fungicide concentrations indicating concentration dependent expression of the outer membrane protein encoding genes within the same genus wang et al 2015 as shown in figs s14 s15 high concentrationof ctl and cbd 10 µg ml reduced the expression of ompc and ompf in the intergenus system which is consistent with a previous study showing ompf gene expression was suppressed by dimethyl phthalate 40 and 80 µg ml wang et al 2019b this may lead to the reduction of intergenus conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 when exposed to high concentrations of ctl and cbd moreover pearson correlation analysis showed that the intragenus conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 was positively related to the expression of ompa ompc and ompf after fungicide exposure fig 3c which was consistent with previous studies involving glyphosate microcystin and urban fine particulate matter stresses xie et al 2019 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 additionally rna seq analysis showed that 12 and 19 genes relevant to the outer membrane were up regulated in e coli mg1655 and p putida kt2440 respectively after fungicide exposure fig 3d this is consistent with previous studies reporting that the expression of ompw ompt ompf yejo ompq pp 2069 and pp 2669 increased after exposure to copper nanoparticles carbamazepine silver ions and silver nanoparticles lu et al 2020 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 under ctl treatment the expression of bhsa oprn yiad pagl i and tolb was even up to 309 73 times higher than the control which might be related to the effects on transport function observed under cbd stress fernandez et al 2009 machas et al 2021 roca et al 2008 it can be concluded that the fungicide induced up regulation of these outer membrane related genes increased cell membrane permeability and accelerated the conjugative transfer of plasmids lu et al 2020 wang et al 2019a 2021 3 4 fungicides enhanced expression of conjugation related genes on plasmid rp4 the conjugative transfer of plasmids is regulated by the mating pair formation system dna transfer replication system and other regulators lessl et al 1993 expression of these genes in the intragenus system was higher than in the intergenus system which may explain the high frequency of conjugation within the same genus wang et al 2015 the expression of trbbp traf trfap traj and kila gradually increased as fungicide concentrations increased fig 4 a this is consistent with a recent study showing that the expression of trbbp traf trfap and traj in e coli was enhanced by glyphosate in a concentration dependent manner zhang et al 2021 meanwhile expression of kora korb and kila in the presence of fungicides decreased in the intragenus system figs s16 s18 which may also enhance the conjugative transfer of plasmids thomson et al 1993 in the intergenus system exposure to ctl and azo had significant effects on expression of conjugation related genes but only a few significant changes were observed under tdf and cbd treatments furthermore some positive correlations were found between conjugative transfer frequency and the expression levels of the aforementioned genes fig 4b indicating that fungicide induced regulation of conjugative transfer related genes may have been involved in plasmid rp4 contains a variety of genes involved in the conjugation process miyakoshi et al 2020 wang et al 2019a compared with the control the four fungicide treatments 1 µg ml increased expression of the conjugation transfer regulatory factor genes trai tram and traj conjugative transfer protein encoding genes trbh trbm and trbo conjugative transfer initiator gene trfa and conjugative transfer secretion protein related gene trak fig 4c similarly wang et al wang et al 2019a reported that carbamazepine treatment increased expression of trai tram and traj on plasmid rp4 and thus enhanced its conjugation transfer azo and cbd had a significant positive effect on expression of genes involved in plasmid conjugation transfer especially the conjugative transfer protein encoding genes trbe trbf trbg trbi trbj trbl and trbn miyakoshi et al 2020 increased expression of these genes following azo and cbd exposure could result in the acceleration of plasmid conjugative transfer in addition the tdf and ctl treatments reduced the expression of the entry rejection protein encoding gene trbk which may facilitate higher frequency entry of the plasmid rp4 into recipient bacteria miyakoshi et al 2020 3 5 other factors contributing to conjugative transfer pilin increases bacteria mobility and contact between individual cells thus promoting plasmid conjugation transfer guglielmini et al 2014 wang et al 2015 the expression of ppdd in e coli mg1655 was 3 52 4 59 and 3 61 times higher when exposed to tdf ctl and azo respectively fig 5 a the ppdd gene encodes a precursor protein in the pili which are heavily involved in the type iv secretion system and play a role in cell adhesion and motility sauvonnet et al 2000 the expression of the pilin encoding sfma gene in the ctl and cbd treated donors was 2 27 and 1 47 times higher than that the control overexpression of this gene improves the adsorption capacity of the bacterial surface korea et al 2010 similarly expression of fimd pile pilf and piln in the recipient was up regulated by exposure to the four fungicides overexpression of these genes triggered by fungicides may have contributed to enhancement of plasmid conjugative transfer through the promotion of the assembly of bacterial pore proteins and type iv pilin biosynthesis proteins jain et al 2011 watson et al 1994 these results indicate that the increased expression of pilin encoding genes may be involved in the conjugative transfer of plasmids under fungicide stress wang et al 2015 differentially expressed genes were identified in the donor and recipient bacteria and used for kegg pathway enrichment analysis figs 5b and s19 s20 ctl azo and cbd treatments induced up regulation of the flagella assembly function in the recipient p putida kt2440 which could contribute to bacterial motility and increased contact and attachment of bacteria robertson et al 2019 thomson and pallen 2020 overall up regulation of flagellin gene expression under fungicide stress may also promote the conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 but further study is required to verify this pathway 4 conclusions this study shows that fungicides are potential selectors for the dissemination of args via plasmid mediated conjugation the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid borne args was related to the type of fungicides the exposure concentration and the species of donor and recipient bacteria the underlying fungicide specific mechanisms were i ctl exposure mainly enhanced generation of intracellular ros stimulated the sos response and increased cell membrane permeability while ii azo and cbd primarily enhanced expression of conjugation related genes on the plasmid these findings provide novel insights into the potential role of agricultural fungicides in the spread of args in the environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

15005,carbapenems are last resort antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections unsuccessfully treated by most common categories of antibiotics in humans most of their dosage is secreted unchanged as waste thereby making its way into the urban water system there are two major knowledge gaps addressed in this study to gain a better understanding of the effects of their residual concentrations on the environment and environmental microbiome development of a uhplc ms ms method of detection and quantification from raw domestic wastewater via direct injection and study of their stability in sewer environment during the transportation from domestic sewers to wastewater treatment plants the uhplc ms ms method was developed for four carbapenems meropenem doripenem biapenem and ertapenem and validation was performed in the range of 0 5 10 μg l for all analytes with limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq values ranging from 0 2 0 5 μg l and 0 8 1 6 μg l respectively laboratory scale rising main rm and gravity sewer gs bioreactors were employed to culture mature biofilms with real wastewater as the feed batch tests were conducted in rm and gs sewer bioreactors fed with carbapenem spiked wastewater to evaluate the stability of carbapenems and compared against those in a control reactor ctl without sewer biofilms over a duration of 12 h significantly higher degradation was observed for all carbapenems in rm and gs reactors 60 80 as opposed to ctl reactor 5 15 which indicates that sewer biofilms play a significant role in the degradation first order kinetics model was applied to the concentration data along with friedman s test and dunn s multiple comparisons analysis to establish degradation patterns and differences in the degradation observed in sewer reactors as per friedman s test there was a statistically significant difference in the degradation of carbapenems observed depending on the reactor type p 0 0017 0 0289 the results from dunn s test indicate that the degradation in the ctl reactor was statistically different from that observed in either rm p 0 0033 0 1088 or gs p 0 0162 0 1088 with the latter two showing insignificant difference in the degradation rates observed p 0 2850 0 5930 the findings contribute to the understanding about the fate of carbapenems in urban wastewater and the potential application of wastewater

belonging to the wider beta lactam antibiotic category which are used to treat multi drug resistant pathogens they are used as last resort antibiotics due to their effectiveness and broad spectrum of activity against gram negative gram positive and anaerobic bacteria wang et al 2020 in recent years pathogenic bacteria have developed resistance to carbapenems carbapenem resistant bacteria with the evidence of carbapenem resistance genes and resistant bacterial isolates in a range of environmental compartments such as wastewater and wastewater impacted marine coastal zones luczkiewicz et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 hospital wastewater chandran et al 2014 rivers and lakes zurfluh et al 2013 sediments marathe et al 2017 soil wang and sun 2014 sludge zhang et al 2019 animal feces and feed getahun e agga 2021 environmental water shah and zahra 2014 drinking water and seepage walsh et al 2011 some gram negative pathogens known to possess carbapenem resistance genes like acinetobacter baumannii pseudomonas aeruginosa and esbl producing enterobacteriaceae have been identified as water borne ramírez castillo et al 2015 carbapenem resistant gram negative pathogens are of serious concern as they in turn account for total antibiotic resistance adegoke et al 2020 environmental water matrices must therefore be premeditated in estimating emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance pertaining to carbapenem resistant pathogenic bacteria adegoke et al 2020 it is known that microbial communities adapt and evolve with selective environmental pressures resulting from a range of sources including antibiotics studies have also shown that very low environmental concentrations of antimicrobials even below the minimum inhibitory concentration mic of microbes can favor the development of antibiotic resistance bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 gullberg et al 2011 at sub mic level resistance development is not drastic however it can slowly alter the growth and genetic mutations of microbes whereby maintenance and selection for resistant bacteria becomes plausible gullberg et al 2011 for instance the lowest mics for doripenem meropenem and ertapenem have been shown to be 2 μg l for all however the concentrations for resistance selection predicted no effect concentrations were reported to be as low as 0 125 μg l for doripenem ertapenem and 0 064 μg l for meropenem respectively bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 while the data linking observed antibiotic levels to resistance selection is presently lacking for carbapenems the inevitability of resistance development and transfer for carbapenems within environment cannot be ignored sewer networks may serve as a source of transportation and spread of carbapenem residues and carbapenem resistant pathogens from the hospitals manufacturing plants and community into the environment these can also act as a host of antibiotic residues and resistance genes which can potentially turn it into a hotspot for resistance accrual and proliferation mclellan and roguet 2019 sewer networks are essentially composed of major structural elements like pumping stations gravity sewers gs rising main sewers rm and some other components e g manholes septic tanks etc that aid in the transportation from domestic households to wwtps they essentially are dynamic bioreactors with complex physical chemical and biological processes hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 biofilms on the walls of the sewer networks are formed by various biotic and abiotic factors within wastewater that continually reside and transfer through the channels inherent wastewater parameters e g ph dissolved oxygen organic matter solids nutrients and temperature along with the physical factors like pipe dimensions flow rates and hydraulic retention time hrt of wastewater can all impact biofilm development composition and activities schilperoort et al 2012 sharma et al 2013 research has shown that the transformation and degradation of chemical compounds pharmaceuticals hazardous chemicals drugs metabolites and population biomarkers are not only dependent on the characteristics of the carrying wastewater but also that of the highly reactive biofilm activity in sewers mccall et al 2016b o brien et al 2019 much research has been conducted in recent years to delineate the impacts of wastewater properties sewer biofilms and sediments on the in sewer transformation of various wbe biomarkers gao et al 2018 jelic et al 2015b li et al 2018a mccall et al 2016a however the same cannot be said for antibiotics especially the last resort categories like carbapenems as their in sewer degradation and transformation data is absent to study the transformation or degradation of antibiotics like carbapenems sophisticated analytical methods are important due to the required analyte detection capabilities reliability and sensitivity analytical methods have previously been developed for carbapenems in a range of environmental matrices like river water swine wastewater wang et al 2020 drinking water ben jaballah 2022 voigt et al 2020 and lagoon water bedding soil silage liu et al 2017 whereby no carbapenems were observed from river and swine wastewater wang et al 2020 while only one positive silage sample was identified in the second study with an observed concentration of 68 μg kg of ertapenem liu et al 2017 no detection method of carbapenems from domestic wastewater has yet been published however several studies have reported the presence of carbapenem resistance genes carbapenemases in wastewater and wwtps araújo et al 2021 hoelle et al 2019 hrenovic et al 2017 rodríguez et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 making wastewater a vital matrix to study and evaluate carbapenem residues and resistance the quality of wastewater can be greatly variable due to geographical factors its composition concentration and flow rate friedler et al 2013 some major components of wastewater that can influence the behavior of targeted chemical compounds may include organic materials pesticides fat oil detergents solvents nutrients nitrogen phosphorus ammonium metals mercury lead copper nickel acids bases and microorganisms henze and comeau 2008 to address issues concerning the complexity of the matrix and variability of analyte behavior within the matrix matrix matched quantification has been performed in some recent biological studies kumar et al 2021 liu et al 2019 for a last resort antibiotic colistin similar approach can be applied to quantify carbapenems from wastewater to address the effects of matrix during quantitation quantification methods have been developed for individual carbapenem members from biological matrices barco et al 2015 koal et al 2006 martens lobenhoffer and bode böger 2017 or in combination with one or two other members lefeuvre et al 2017 liu et al 2017 rehm and rentsch 2020 multiple carbapenems have been quantified simultaneously using an in house developed method from river and swine wastewater by one study wang et al 2020 however this study did not incorporate a crucial carbapenem member ertapenem imipenem was the first carbapenem member to be formulated and extensive resistance to it has been reported in recent years kwon et al 2007 oteo et al 2008 zilberberg et al 2010 which has limited its use considering practical factors pertaining to the availability of standards unavailability of faropenem and applicability of current research to future studies only meropenem doripenem biapenem and ertapenem were selected for this study this study therefore aims to develop and validate a method of detection and quantification for carbapenems meropenem doripenem biapenem and ertapenem in wastewater by direct injection using uhplc ms ms and then employ the method to investigate the degradation of carbapenems in domestic wastewater with the presence of sewer biofilms batch tests employed the systematic spiking of carbapenems in wastewater and laboratory scale sewer reactors to determine the degradation of carbapenems in the presence or absence of different types of sewer biofilms findings of this study not only improve the wbe back estimation of carbapenem use by reducing the uncertainties related to biomarker losses in sewers but also contribute to the understanding about the fate of carbapenems in urban wastewater systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals reagents and standards all chemicals and solvents used for extraction purposes were of lc ms grade these were all used without further purification methanol and acetonitrile were obtained from merck millipore darmstadt germany while formic acid lc ms grade was obtained from thermo fischer scientific pty ltd australia ultrapure water was obtained from milli q iq 7000 ultrapure lab water system installed with emd millipore millipak 0 22 µm filter the reference standards for doripenem 98 purity meropenem 98 purity biapenem 98 purity and ertapenem sodium 98 purity were obtained from sapphire bioscience pty ltd australia stock solutions of mixed reference standards were prepared in milli q water at a concentration of 1 mg ml and stored as multiple aliquots at 20 c for a maximum of one week standards were diluted with milli q water freshly on the day for both calibration and sample analyses 2 2 analytical instrumentation uhplc ms ms a waters acquity ultra high performance liquid chromatography system coupled to a absciex qtrap5500 triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer uhplc ms ms was used to analyze carbapenems separation was carried out using a waters acquity beh c18 column 100 mm 2 1 mm id 1 7 μm particle size coupled with an acquity uhplc beh c18 vanguard pre column 5 mm 2 1 mm id 1 7 μm particle size for carbapenems quantification eluents of two mobile phases 0

3 0 1 30 3 0 3 5 30 and 3 6 5 0 1 the injection volume was 10 μl and the column temperature was 30 c detection was performed through multiple reaction monitoring mrm in the positive ionization mode signal intensity and ms ms fragmentation were optimized using a 10 μg ml solution of a mixed carbapenem standard solution infused using a sge syringe needle trajan scientific australia optimized ionization parameters for all carbapenems included a source temperature of 650 c an ion spray voltage of 5500 v and a curtain gas of 30 psi the analytes were quantified by an external standard method using the highest intensity precursor ion transition table 1 ab sciex analyst software v 1 6 2 was used for calibration data analysis and quantitation purposes 2 3 uhplc ms ms method validation validation was performed by evaluating selectivity linearity calibration curves limit of detection lod limit of quantification loq accuracy recovery precision cv and stability selectivity was identified by analysing 6 individual blank matrix samples wastewater via direct injection to study any interference around the retention times of the target analytes calibration curves were initially generated in both blank matrix and water and matrix effects calculation was performed as per eq 1 these were identified to be significant meropenem 18 1 enhancement doripenem 10 6 suppression biapenem 17 2 enhancement ertapenem 6 9 suppression hence matrix matched calibration was considered more appropriate for quantification to ensure compensation for wastewater induced matrix effects on all analytes 1 m a t r i x e f f e c t s a n a l y t e r e s p o n s e i n w a s t e w a t e r a n a l y t e r e s p o n s e i n w a t e r 1 100 linearity calibration curves was thereby performed by analysing carbapenem standards spiked at concentrations of 0 5 1 0 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 μg l in blank matrix matrix matched all quantification was carried out by external calibration curves lod and loq were calculated as the lowest concentrations with a signal to noise ratio of 3 and 10 respectively intra and inter day accuracy recovery and precision were calculated by analysing 6 identically prepared blank matrix wastewater samples spiked at 4 different concentrations of a mixed carbapenem standard solution 1 0 2 5 5 0 and 10 μg l these were analysed in three separate runs over two different days and measured concentrations were expressed as recovery percentages and relative coefficient of variation cv respectively 2 4 sewer reactor setup operation and parameter testing the laboratory scale sewer bioreactors were employed to mimic the rising main rm and gravity sewer gs conditions figure s2 briefly both reactors had a liquid capacity of 0 75 l rm 80 mm d 150 mm h gs 80 mm d 200 mm h 150 mm water depth plus 50 mm head space and were made of perspex the rm reactor was operated under anaerobic conditions to mimic anaerobic sewers by keeping the setup airtight while the gs reactor was kept partially filled with wastewater to allow a gas phase and to mimic gravity sewers with both anaerobic and aerobic sections biofilm carriers of 10 mm diameter were suspended on three stainless steel rods to aid with the surface availability for biofilm growth the total biofilm area in each reactor was approximately 0 05 m2 while the area to volume ratio was 70 9 m2 m3 the sewer reactors were shown to have biological activities similar to typical real sewer conditions choi et al 2020 li et al 2018b o brien et al 2019 o brien et al 2017 shi et al 2022 biofilm cultivation was achieved by regular feeding the rm and gs reactors with domestic wastewater for 6 months while no flow was subjected to the control reactor to maintain biofilm free conditions the feed wastewater was collected fortnightly from the inlet of wollongong wwtp australia the typical wastewater properties measured are outlined in table 2 wastewater was stored at 4 c after every fortnightly collection and was fed into the reactors every 6 h a typical hrt of wastewater in sewers after being heated up to room temperature 22 c using a water bath set at 35 c with titanium heating coils using a peristaltic pump masterflex l s all pumping events were set to last for 2 min to account for a feed volume equivalent to the reactor volume 0 75 l and magnetic stirring mls8 velp scientifica italy was performed at 250 rpm in each reactor to facilitate continuous mixing of wastewater biofilm activity was verified in rm and gs reactors by testing for relevant parameters ph do tss vss sulfate soluble cod and total cod to ensure a steady condition prior to batch tests for carbapenem degradation 2 5 reactor batch tests for carbapenem degradability batch tests were performed in triplicate by feeding wastewater spiked to 10 μg l with mixed standard solution of carbapenems prepared in water and was immediately pumped into the reactors using the peristaltic pump to avoid any undue degradation or transformation within the wastewater the control reactor figure s2 was treated the same as the other reactors and fed with spiked raw wastewater the only difference being the absence of the biofilm component continuous mixing was ensured in all reactors 250 rpm to maintain homogeneity of the resident wastewater after the feeding event reached the appropriate volume of each reactor the pumping was halted and samples were withdrawn at 0 0 5 1 2 3 6 9 and 12 h following the pumping event in addition ph and sulfate reduction was monitored for the first hour to inform on the biological activity of the biofilm in both reactors collected samples were immediately filtered using 0 22 μm pes membrane filter sarstedt australia into 1 5 ml hplc vials and frozen at 20 c prior to uhplc ms ms analysis 2 6 data analysis the degradability of all four carbapenems in sewer reactors were assessed by comparing the concentration observed at time point t c t with that observed at time point 0 initial spiked concentration c 0 for all analytes via uhplc ms ms percentage compared to initial concentration of all analytes at any given time point was thus calculated as c t c 0 10 0 first order kinetics one phase degradation were applied to the above calculated concentration data using graphpad prism 9 version 9 3 1 to determine the best fit for degradability of all target analytes i e carbapenems the goodness of fit for all analytes was examined by their respective r2 values for the simplification of equation used and further calculations the plateau was set to 0 and all values were interpreted by the model accordingly the equation used to calculate concentration of carbapenems at a given time using the one phase degradation model li et al 2018b is as shown in eq 2 below 2 c t c 0 e k t c 0 e k w w k b i o t where k h 1 refers to the degradation rate constant representing the overall degradation of carbapenems observed in sewer reactors chemical and or biological kww h 1 refers to the degradation rate constant in wastewater alone and was estimated based on the data obtained from the control reactor kbio h 1 refers to the degradation rate constant in the presence of sewer biofilms i e rm and gs reactors and was estimated using data obtained from rm and gs bioreactors kbio h 1 can be classified under two categories depending on the biofilm type as highlighted in eq 3 below 3 k b i o k b i o a n k b i o a where kbio an h 1 is the degradation rate constant in the presence of anerobic biofilm rm while kbio a h 1 refers to the degradation rate constant in the presence of aerobic biofilm gs furthermore half life data t 50 was obtained from the one phase degradation model also t 10 and t 90 were calculated as shown below in eq 4 and 5 4 t 10 l n 0 1 k 5 t 90 l n 0 9 k friedman s test non parametric coupled with dunn s multiple comparisons was performed to compare impacts of sewer conditions rm gs and ctl on the degradation of all carbapenems using graphpad prism 9 version 9 3 1 p values obtained from this analysis were interpreted to outline significance in degradation observed between reactor types 3 results and discussion 3 1 uhplc ms ms method development and sample preparation as the developed method follows direct injection methodology samples were filtered with 0 22 μm pes membrane filter to ensure suitability and cleaner extracts for uhplc ms ms analysis ms parameters were optimized by injecting a 10 μg ml carbapenem mixed standard solution prepared in water in a steam of lc flow rate of 0 3 μl min the ms scans were all acquired using a positive electrospray ionization mode for better sensitivity and resolution as all analytes exhibited the most intense ms signal for their singly positively charged ion m h as similarly evidenced by previous research carlier et al 2014 pickering and brown 2013 wang et al 2020 compound identity and retention time was confirmed by using their respective two transitions of highest intensities while compound quantification was carried using only the transition of the highest intensity the transitions and optimized ms parameters used for all target analytes are presented in table 1 after several iterations of chromatography columns elution mobile phase types composition and elution gradient data not shown all targeted carbapenems compounds were found to elute under optimized conditions section 2 2 by 3 4 min selected lc column acquity beh allowed for good separation and resolution for all target analytes allowing for a total method run time of only 5 minutes including column re equilibration time during optimization the addition of acid in both the mobile phases 0 1 formic acid was adopted as it significantly improved lc peak shape and enhanced intensity of the ms signal refer to figure s3 for uhplc chromatograms of all carbapenems analysed the analytical instrumentation uhplc ms ms possesses the disadvantage of a relatively higher limit of detection and quantification usually in µg l range when the direct injection is performed complex sample matrices like urban wastewater can also affect the integrity of the instrument and analytical column s performance via the direct injection methodology the expected concentrations of carbapenems in real wastewater may be lower than the spiking concentration in this study for greater sample clean up and successful quantification of carbapenems at realistic and lower soluble concentrations sophisticated and targeted sample preparation techniques like solid phase extraction can be employed for future studies 3 2 uhplc ms ms method validation the results from the method validation are summarized in table 3 matrix blank wastewater samples analysed for specificity showed no interference within 1 minute of the retention time of any target analyte thereby verifying selectivity of the method developed calibration curves generated in blank matrix showed a good linear fit for all analytes with r2 ranging from 0 9986 to 0 9996 intra and inter day accuracy and precision measured at 1 2 5 5 and 10 μg l concentration was under the recommended range with recoveries ranging from 93 9 to 109 8 and cv ranging between 5 1 13 4 for all analytes the analytes all showed stability 95 over a period of 24 h in blank matrix at neutral ph refer to the table s2 and s3 for full validation data including the 24 h stability analysis and figure s4 for matrix matched calibration curves for all carbapenems 3 3 biological activities and biofilm characterization in sewer reactors this study for the first time revealed the degradation of carbapenems under the influence of sewer biofilms in real wastewater it is well known that transformation and degradation of chemical compounds like population biomarkers is enhanced by the activity of the predominant microbial communities found in biofilms i e sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogenic archaea li et al 2019 mccall et al 2016a mccall et al 2016b for instance studies have reported a higher transformation rate of some biomarkers amphetamine 6 acetylcodeine norketamine mephedrone in sewer in the presence of biofilms in comparison to chemical or physical processes gao et al 2017b mccall et al 2016b this study showed the significant role of sewer biofilms in enhancing the degradation of carbapenems the measured degradation kinetics can be applied to the back estimation of wastewater based epidemiology for a higher accuracy two sewer reactors with biofilms rm and gs were used in this study along with a control reactor ctl to assess the role of biofilms in the degradation of carbapenems figure s2 the reactivity and maturity of biofilm in both reactors was verified by evaluating their sulfate reduction rates figure s1 ph and cod over a duration of 6 h typical hrt for sewers the results from preliminary sewer tests are summarized in table s1 the obtained results confirmed that the reactors showed suitability for testing and had attained semi steady state in terms of sulfate reducing rate jiang et al 2011 li et al 2018b rm sewers usually form anaerobic biofilms due to being fully filled with wastewater gs on the other hand being partially filled with wastewater and relying on gravity driven flow facilitates both anaerobic and aerobic conditions hvitved jacobsen 2001 rm reactor induced to anaerobic conditions showed biological activities of sulfate reducing bacteria 5 0 mg s l h and tcod scod in the range of 300 500 mg l and 50 150 mg l respectively which is comparable with previous studies o brien et al 2017 thai et al 2014 additionally gs reactor is known to incorporate both aerobic and anaerobic conditions which can be confirmed by its low sulfate reduction 2 7 mg s l h o brien et al 2017 dissolved oxygen measured in the wastewater in gs was slightly lower than that in wastewater alone 0 6 mg l which points towards oxygen consumption due to aerobic activity as was highlighted by previous research o brien et al 2017 the results all verified the biofilm conditions for a similar laboratory scale bioreactor setup and typical real sewer conditions choi et al 2020 o brien et al 2017 shi et al 2022 in addition sulfate reduction rate and ph were monitored over the first 1 h of each of the triplicate batch tests to inform on biological activities of the biofilm the results also indicated that presence of carbapenems at the spiked concentration did not influence the biological activity of sewer biofilms factors affecting the integrity and composition of biofilms in turn affect the degradation transformation of chemical compounds like antibiotics one study evaluated the role of aerobic or anaerobic biofilms on the transformation of biomarkers and concluded that the microbial transformation is dependent on the redox condition for most of the evaluated biomarkers morphine glucuronide codeine narcodeine ramin et al 2016 similarly another study evaluated the effects wastewater conditions like ph temperature and suspended solids on the transformation of biomarkers and concluded that the rate of biological and ph induced transformation was quite significant in comparison to that of temperature and suspended solids related activity li et al 2021 real sewers were employed for a range of experiments to study the transformation of chemical compounds under uncontrolled and or limited conditions gao et al 2019 jelic et al 2015a li et al 2019 however studying in sewer stability of antibiotics poses great challenges with difficulties in practical conduct control quantification and interpretation of results pilot sewers were employed for some studies to evaluate chemical transformation of compounds but similar restrictions follow their employability in studies along with accessibility related concerns gao et al 2018 li et al 2018a in comparison laboratory scale sewer reactors can be operated under well controlled conditions with a range of operational and wastewater properties feed biofilms hrt temperature ph etc choi et al 2020 jiang et al 2011 jiang et al 2009 various studies have employed the use of laboratory scale rm and gs reactors and assessed the stability of targeted compounds by comparing the sewer type rm vs gs sewer condition anaerobic vs aerobic biomass suspended sludge vs biofilm and wastewater properties gao et al 2017a mccall et al 2016b o brien et al 2017 ramin et al 2017 ramin et al 2016 thai et al 2014 however the degradation data obtained in this study is only reproducible to an extent as the a v ratio of a typical sewer is about 2 10 times lower than that of the laboratory sewer reactors 70 9 m2 m3 employed in this study o brien et al 2017 a high a v ratio may enable greater interaction between the biofilm component and carbapenems potentially triggering higher degradation in rm gs more research is needed to identify the significance and impact of differing a v ratios on biofilm induced degradation of carbapenems thai et al 2014 not much evidence exists at present to investigate stability or degradation of compounds in larger sewer systems like pressure sewers with dynamic hydraulics and controlled hrt hence real sewer research is crucial to validate the data obtained from laboratory scale setups li et al 2018b 3 4 degradation of carbapenems in sewer reactors the degradation of four carbapenem members namely meropenem doripenem biapenem and ertapenem was investigated in two bioreactor types rm and gs mimicking typical sewer conditions in comparison to wastewater only condition ctl reactor without sewer biofilms fig 1 studying the degradation of vital last resort antibiotics like carbapenems within the sewer network addresses a multitude of concerns surrounding their environmental presence and persistence and consequential selection for clinically highly relevant antibiotic resistances carbapenem resistance is an severe emerging issue owing to its accompanied extensive drug resistance and potential to lead to total drug resistance via exposure to residual antibiotics mutagens metals and biocides adegoke et al 2020 it has therefore become vital to understand the distribution of their concentrations in the environment and their relative impact on environmental microbiome dissemination of resistance genes and residual antibiotics may be facilitated into the environment via wastewater and sewer networks adegoke et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 degradation of carbapenems within sewers whether chemical or biological may help counteract the selection of resistance amongst microbial communities within the sewer environment this may also prevent transfer of resistance from environmental microbiome to the pathogens of concern via horizontal gene transfer due to a decline in the exposed carbapenem concentrations all of the above further emphasize the need for more focused research in this area for the observed results it was noted that one phase degradation model fits well with the degradation data from all three sewer reactors fig 1 the r2 values for all analytes in rm and gs reactors were 0 81 indicating a strong compliance to the first order kinetics model while the results from run s test p values imply that the deviation of results from the chosen regression model was insignificant table 4 r2 for ctl reactor results were low 0 5357 due to the little variability of the temporal concentrations of analytes with higher stability from their relative concentrations it is evident that 60 80 of degradation was observed within rm and gs reactors over the testing duration of 12 h as opposed to the ctl reactor which only showed a degradation in the range of 5 15 for all carbapenems the results are consistent with other previous studies where degradation was observed for different antibiotics pharmaceutical compounds illicit drugs and their metabolites in laboratory scale sewer reactors in the presence of biofilms li et al 2018b o brien et al 2019 o brien et al 2017 table 4 shows the values of degradation constants k ww k bio an and k bio a estimated for all carbapenems using the model as per eq 1 and 2 from the observed data it can be clearly established that the degradation rate observed in wastewater alone ctl was much lower than the degradation rate in either rm k bio an or gs k bio a fig 2 also the degradation rate in rm k bio an is higher than gs k bio a for meropenem doripenem and biapenem this implies the anaerobic biofilms and microorganisms in rm sewers might lead to higher degradation of these three carbapenem members the lowest degradation rate observed was for ertapenem with k ww of 0 0058 h 1 while biapenem showed the highest degradation in wastewater with a k ww of 0 0183 h 1 as can be confirmed by the degradation trend established above however ertapenem showed comparable or slightly higher degradation rate in both rm k bio an 0 1037 h 1 and gs k bio a 0 1142 h 1 amongst all other carbapenem members it is interesting that biological degradation for ertapenem in gs is higher than rm which shows the significant role of the type of sewer biofilms and the diverse degradation patterns even within the same carbapenem antibiotic group studies conducted with laboratory scale sewer reactors at room temperature found that some chemicals remain stable with little to no

comparable to the t 10 observed in gravity sewer 0 9 1 1 h table 4 meropenem doripenem and biapenem showed longer half lives by 0 9 1 4 h in gravity sewer as opposed to rising main sewer in contrast ertapenem was slightly more stable under rm condition t 50 rm 6 3 h t 50 gs 5 8 h none of the carbapenems showed 90 degradation t 90 within the testing duration of 12 h the trend observed in the t 10

90 gs 19 5 23 2 h under control condition meropenem doripenem and biapenem showed 10 degradation within the testing duration which is nearly 7 8 times longer than in sewer biofilm reactors t 10 ctl 5 8 6 4 h ertapenem showed a higher stability with t 10 18 1 h in the control reactor the half lives for all members within ctl environment ranged from 38 0 to 119 3 h while their t 90 values ranged from 126 2 to 396 4 h with the highest and the lowest stabilities observed for ertapenem and biapenem respectively typically one way anova and two way anova analysis are performed to identify differences between two or more variable groups respectively in this instance two way anova would be appropriate to compare the degradation observed between the three variable groups i e rm gs and ctl reactors however two way anova assumes that the population from which the samples were drawn is normally distributed i e it follows gaussian distribution which in turn implies that distribution of sample means is close to a normal gaussian distribution this underlying assumption isn t compliant with the observations from this degradation study as the regression analysis clearly shows that the variability between reactors was significant with significant loss of concentrations of targeted carbapenems observed in reactors with and without biofilms hence non parametric analysis was chosen for the given data to compare the significance of degradation between reactors non parametric test was performed for three matched groups rm gs ctl and friedman s test p values were obtained as a result table 5 however this test ranks the values from low to high and only looks at the distribution of sum of ranks between groups hence it cannot be used to compare degradability between individual reactors for that purpose dunn s multiple comparisons test was used to determine the significance of degradation observed between the reactors with biofilm rm gs and that without ctl table 5 as per friedman s test there was a statistically significant difference in the degradation of carbapenems observed depending on the reactor type p 0 0017 0 0289 furthermore the results from dunn s test indicate that the degradation in the ctl reactor was statistically different from that observed in either rm p 0 0033 0 1088 or gs p 0 0162 0 1088 with the latter two showing non significant difference in the degradation rates observed p 0 2850 0 5930 another approach to draw a comparison is to assume an approximate gaussian distribution of data and perform parametric analysis tukey s multiple comparisons test was therefore conducted with two way anova in graphpad prism 9 table s4 the p values obtained in the test for ctl vs rm or ctl vs gs showed statistical difference p 0 05 with values ranging from 0 003 0 03 however values obtained from the rm vs gs analysis obtained p values in the range of 0 75 0 94 for different carbapenems showing no statistical significance p 0 05 in the degradation rate hence tukey s test further establishes that the degradation observed between rm and gs was similar to one another but significantly different to that detected in the ctl reactor no in sewer research has been performed for carbapenems till date thus making it impossible to perform comparative analysis properties like ph do hrt and sewer conditions anaerobic aerobic can also influence the biofilm conditions and thus the stability of target analytes jelic et al 2015a mccall et al 2016c for instance in sample stability studies have demonstrated that ph fluctuations can play a significant role in deciding the fate of chemical compounds prone to hydrolysis baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 senta et al 2014 changes in temperature can alter dissolved oxygen viscosity diffusion and hence have a combined impact on the in sewer processes and the rate of degradation of chemical compounds baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 li et al 2021 senta et al 2014 some studies have also demonstrated that analyte sorption does not affect their transformation in wastewater matrices to a significant extent baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 chen et al 2013 mccall et al 2016b it is also known that sewage hrt can determine the rate of degradation of population biomarkers and potentially antibiotics depending on their residence times and duration of contact with biofilms li et al 2018b hence future research needs to evaluate the impacts of inherent wastewater properties on the degradation of carbapenems in sewer it has been clearly established that the degradation of carbapenems in reactors with biofilms rm gs was significantly higher than that observed in the biofilm free reactor ctl the observed degradation could be due to a multitude of factors chemical or biological the complexity of the matrix along with the presence of biofilm plays a significant role in determining the fate and transformation of carbapenems however the underlying mechanisms such as microbial induced degradation and bioaccumulation cannot be disregarded unfortunately there is a significant lack of data on the transformation products of carbapenems in the sewer which constitutes a major gap in our understanding future studies can therefore work on analysing individual biofilm carriers to establish the extent of sorption of carbapenems onto biofilms plus evaluate the magnitude of degradation enzymes released into the reservoir volume facilitating the decomposition of carbapenems 4 conclusions this study established and validated an analytical method uhplc ms ms of carbapenem in wastewater to assess the degradation of four carbapenem members meropenem doripenem biapenem and ertapenem in sewer reactors with different biofilms the degradation of target analytes was determined and compared between reactors with anaerobic aerobic biofilms and in wastewater only the conclusions are the uhplc ms ms direct injection method was developed and validated in the range of 0 5 10 μg l for four carbapenem members with lod and loq values ranging from 0 2 0 5 μg l and 0 8 1 6 μg l respectively both rising main and gravity sewer biofilms significantly enhanced the degradation of carbapenems in wastewater from 5 15 to 60 80 in 12 hours the degradation rate constant for biofilm reactors k bio 0 07 0 11 was significantly higher than the degradation rate constant for biofilm free reactor k ww 0 005 0 01 with p 0 002 0 030 for different carbapenems the degradation pattern of meropenem doripenem and biapenem was similar with biological degradation in rising main sewer reactor slightly higher than that in gravity sewer reactor however the biodegradation of ertapenem is opposite to this pattern the findings suggest that sewer conditions play an important role in the extent of antibiotic degradation during the wastewater transportation in sewers further study about the effects of other environmental or wastewater parameters is required to ensure a more

15006,many european lakes have suffered from reed die back since the 1950s previous studies have concluded that this is due to a combination of several interacting factors but possibly also a single threat with high impact might be responsible for the phenomenon in this study we investigated 14 lakes in the berlin area differing in reed development and sulphate concentration from 2000 to 2020 to unravel the decline of reed beds in some of the lakes with coal mining activities in the upper watershed we compiled a comprehensive data set thus the littoral zone of the lakes was divided into 1302 segments considering the reed ratio relative to segment area water quality parameters littoral characteristics and bank usage of the lakes which all have been monitored for 20 years we ran two way panel regressions with a within estimator to consider the spatial variation between and within the segments over time the regression results revealed a strong negative relationship between reed ratio and sulphate concentrations p 0 001 as well as tree shading p 0 001 and a strong positive relationship with brushwood fascines p 0 001 taking only sulphate into account reeds would have covered an additional area of 5 5 ha or 22 6 in 2020 total reed area 24 3 ha in the absence of increased sulphate concentrations in conclusion changes in water quality upstream the catchment cannot be ignored in the development of management plans for downstream lakes graphical abstract keywords bank infiltration biodiversity monitoring water pollution panel data restoration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction massive reed die back in european lakes has been observed since the 1950s ostendorp 1989 brix 1999 e g in germany sukopp and markstein 1989 hungary tóth 2016 italy gigante et al 2011 poland pieczyńska et al 1988 and switzerland hürlimann 1951 the reasons for the declining reed beds are multiple and individual factors have been well studied during the last decades fig 1 including stabilisation and regulation of the water levels for shipping agriculture and drinking water supply which have been identified as severe threats rea 1996 coops et al 2004 tóth 2016 due to lowered water level fluctuations in spring and low autumn water levels reed germination seedling growth and vertical clonal expansion are limited coops and hosper 2002 consequently less reeds can develop and the reed stands decline in size grazing by greylag geese anser anser l bakker et al 2018 or muskrat ondatra zibethicus l vermaat et al 2016 ship induced waves gabel et al 2017 mechanical damage ostendorp et al 1995 shadowing sender and grabowski 2016 concrete walls sukopp and markstein 1989 reduced oxygen supply due to gas system blockage by callus armstrong et al 1996 phytotoxin formation armstrong and armstrong 2001 lamers et al 2002 by organic matter accumulation under anaerobic conditions picek et al 2000 pathogenes nechwatal et al 2005 cerri et al 2017 insects and flooding events ostendorp et al 2003 as well as long term pressure by lakeside house density vermaat et al 2016 are reasons for the reed die back furthermore eutrophication of lakes also affects reed stands and has been identified as a direct and indirect factor involved in the die back for example higher nutrient levels causing a downgrade of reed stem morphology which increases the vulnerability of the individual plants has been observed klötzli 1971 sukopp and markstein 1989 also the quality of the accumulated sediments within reed stands has been identified as an indirect threat kubín and melzer 1997 picek et al 2000 but is seemingly only of temporary importance ostendorp et al 2001 reed decline has additional ecological consequences for the littoral zone that may make it less suitable for nesting by reed warblers ostendorp et al 1995 nemeth and dvorak 2022 major attempts have been made to restore reed stands to improve their freshwater ecosystem functions bring back habitats for sea birds decrease shoreline erosion and reduce high nutrient loads tools like brushwood facines schoonees et al 2019 and breakwater dams are common countermeasures introduced to protect residual and replanted reed plants stabilise shoreline morphology and prevent sediment erosion by wave dissipation structures ostendorp et al 1995 horiuchi et al 2011 the planted reed seedlings have to be protected from grazing to guarantee the expansion of the reeds by e g managing goose populations or creating unattractive surroundings to the birds bakker et al 2018 mechanical stress has to be reduced for restoration to be successful however restoration success has often been limited and contradicting results have been obtained specifically regarding the effect of eutrophication on reed die back therefore also further factors or their complex interaction should be taken into account to explain the die back rea 1996 coops and hosper 2002 ostendorp et al 2001 despite the fact that different efforts have been made to stabilise and increase reed stands a decline of the reed area along the shoreline of some riverine lakes in the urban area of berlin has been documented since 2010 this despite beginning recovery after a long period of die back in parallel with this an abrupt rise of sulphate concentration in the river spree has been observed for more than a decade this is due to abandonment of large coal mining pits in the upper catchment roesel and zak 2022 it is important to note that rising sulphate concentrations in freshwaters is not only local they have increased globally over the last decades even though a strong reduction in atmospheric sulphur deposition has occurred across large parts of north america and europe due large scale wetland drainage and nitrate pollution of ground water zak et al 2021 as well as seasonal drying kerr et al 2012 for management reasons the origin of sulphur is important to know heinrich et al 2021 in this study the influence of water quality littoral zone characteristics and anthropogenic usage on the development of the reed ratio was investigated for a 20 year period taking also increasing sulphate concentrations into account we used the particular location of the berlin district where lakes fed by the river spree are influenced by the mining area thus being exposed to sulphate pollution whereas the lakes fed by river havel and river dahme are only partly mixed with water from the river spree and thus less sulphate polluted this spatial difference and the 20 years of observation of changing reed stands water quality littoral and bank characteristics were used in panel regression analyses 2 methods and material 2 1 study site the investigation examined the reed bed of 14 lakes along four rivers in berlin germany where nine lakes are located in the western part of berlin and fed by the river havel divided into the upper havel and the lower havel where the river spree flows into the havel lake nieder neuendorfer see upper havel 1 and 2 and lake tegeler see are part of the upper havel lower havel 1 2 3 and 4 and lake wannsee are part of the lower havel five lakes are located in the south eastern part of berlin lake daemeritzsee and lake mueggelsee are fed by the river spree as well as lake seddinsee into which water is led from the river spree the last three lakes are located close by the south eastern lakes but are fed by the river dahme the river spree directly connects the lusatian mining district with the german capital berlin fig 2 all the studied sites are heavily impaired by human activities both regarding their structure and water quality status bank filtration via wells a common practice for drinking water abstraction in the berlin area since the beginning of 20th century driescher et al 1993 occurred during the observation time at seven out of 14 lakes the wells were mostly located parallel to the shoreline blue dots in fig 2 wells occur at 20 of the shoreline of the studied lakes in addition three out of the 14 lakes are polluted by high sulphate loads originating from the acid mine drainage affected river spree 2 2 empirical data description for this study we created a comprehensive data set including reed area water quality data littoral zone characteristics and information about the anthropogenic usage of the shoreline the spatial references are 1302 segments along the shoreline total length 168 km covering the potential zone of reed growth from the shoreline until 1 5 m water depth 404 4 ha in total the position of the shoreline was calculated as the mean water level of the reference year 2010 separating the lakeside littoral and the shoreside banks the shoreline was divided with exceptions into 100 meter long sections that divided the littoral zone in segments at once fig 3 data on the segments and the mean water level of 2010 were provided by berliner wasserbetriebe the city centre of berlin was excluded from the mapping because the river spree does not follow a lake definition anymore for our data set we also excluded berlin lakes with absence of information on the water quality the littoral zone or anthropogenic usage the segment areas were observed in five time periods p containing the average over five years each p1 1996 2000 p2 2001 2005 p3 2006 2010 p4 2011 2015 and p5 2016 2020 as the variable of interest reed ratio was calculated as the percentage of every segment after clipping the gis layer of reed by the gis layer of segments every segment is characterised by the below mentioned variables for each time period and did not change over time see sections 2 2 2 to 2 2 4 in total 6510 observations 1302 segments and 5 time periods for 11 time variant parameters were included in the study 2 2 1 segment vegetation we used the monitored vegetation in the littoral zone along the shoreline mapped by fietz 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 for every time period in the analysis the basis of the mapping was cir aerial photos with a spatial resolution of 1 5000 2000 2005 20 cm 2010 2020 and 10 cm 2015 taking always in august the mapped areas with common reed phragmites australis and floating leaf plants including nuphar lutea and nymphaea alba were respectively selected from the mapping and matched to the corresponding segments because the study segments covered the littoral zone only waterside growing plants were included as the variable of interest the reed ratio on each segment was calculated to account for differences in segment area size as an exploratory variable the floating leaf plant ratio for each segment was calculated in the same way in addition floating leaf plants and the sum of both vegetation types were used as dependent variables in a comparative analysis hereinafter referred to as floating leaf plant ratio and total vegetation 2 2 2 water quality the water quality of the lakes was described by the influencing variables electrical conductivity μ s cm nitrate nitrogen mg l ph total phosphorus mg l oxygen mg l sulphate mg l and water temperature c determined at 14 measuring points between 01 1996 and 12 2020 fig 2 the mean values over five years from every measuring point and for every time period p1 p5 were used for all water quality variables the segments were attributed to the closest measuring point great circle distance the monitoring data were provided by the berlin senatsverwaltung für umwelt mobilität verbraucher und klimaschutz and the landesamt für umwelt brandenburg 2 2 3 littoral zone characteristics the littoral the potential zone of reed growth was characterised by bank vegetation and the ratio of the protected area supported by brushwood fascines for every segment the ratio of trees growing directly at the shoreline was mapped from aerial orthophotos of berlin in 1999 black white 2004 2010 2015 and 2020 coloured to consider the shading effect of the trees the flight photos were taken in april 1999 and august 2004 2010 2015 2020 have a spatial resolution of 1 10000 1999 25 cm 2004 and 20 cm 2010 2015 2020 due to wave related mechanical damage of the reed stems brushwood fascines were installed to protect the reed beds this variable is defined as the ratio of the protected area to the segment area and was mapped from the same aerial orthophotos of berlin in 1999 2004 2010 2015 and 2020 as mentioned above the protected area was defined as the zone between the brushwood fascines and the shoreline 2 2 4 human usage the shore and the littoral are affected with different intensities by human activities such as recreation e g swimming and sailing buildings wells for bank filtration and other infrastructure as influencing variables we included piers and different intensities of bank usage five classes both mapped from aerial orthophotos of berlin in 1999 2004 2010 2015 and 2020 the same orthophotos were used for mapping of trees and brushwood fascines see section 2 2 3 we used only the area of piers covering the segment area the ratio of pier area to segment area was included in the study to consider different segment areas the bank usage classes were class 0 unused forest border on the shore bank class 1 slightly used mainly forest border on the shore bank with scattered private beaches and piers class 2 partly used by private beaches and piers on a paved bank with vegetation and scattered buildings nearby class 3 private use of expanded piers on paved bank partly vegetated or wide beaches adjoined private houses and gardens or roads and class 4 commercial use of a segment scaled beach or expanded sailing infrastructure complete paved bank and without bank vegetation as an time invariant variable we used the distance from the segments centroid to the nearest well for an additional analysis information on the shape of the wells was provided by berliner wasserbetriebe 2 3 regression models we ran panel regression models with reed ratio as the dependent variable and water quality parameters littoral zone characteristics including floating leaf plant ratio and anthropogenic usage parameters as explanatory variables the models were estimated with ordinary least squares ols and standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity for robustness we also used standard errors clustered at the level of lakes or lake sections table s3 the ols models used the time variation across 20 years of the dependent and explanatory variables within each segment wooldridge 2019 the models eliminated all time invariant differences between observations because we included fixed effects for segments and periods thus we explain only changes within the observations within variation we designed our fixed effects models to study the cause of changes of the reed ratio within a segment the models strictly followed the identification of this effect the effects of all time invariant factors are excluded and will not affect the regression results the within estimator ols models with segment and period fixed effects took the following form 1 r e e d i t α i δ t β s u l p h a t e i t x i t γ ϵ i t where r e e d i t describes the reed ratio in a segment i 1 1302 in a time period t 2000 2020 α i are segment fixed effects δ t are time period fixed effects the coefficient of interest the effect of mean sulphate concentration is described by β and is thus included in every model specification vector x includes the explanatory variables of water quality littoral and bank characteristics ϵ i t describes an error term due to cross sectional and temporal variation of the variables a panel regression using the within estimator is best suited to cope with such within variations wooldridge 2019 table 2 the result of the hausman test also recommended a two way panel regression with fixed effects hausman 1978 the test was used to compare the fixed effects with the random effects estimators the random effects model assumes that unobserved effects are uncorrelated with each explanatory variable the null hypothesis of the hausman test was rejected chi square 450 69 df 14 p value 0 001 therefore we chose the model with fixed effects within estimator we also estimated coefficients from random effects pooled ols and ols regressions non panel including standardised coefficients table s2 five different specifications of the panel regression were run to test the hypothesis sulphate was included as the main explanatory variable in all specifications excepting the fifth the first specification included variables from the littoral zone and anthropogenic usage the second specification considered water quality variables except electrical conductivity as this is strongly correlated with sulphate correlation coefficient 0 89 p value 0 001 and may generate collinearity problems the third specification included all independent variables describing water quality parameters littoral and bank characteristics the fourth specification included the floating leaf plant ratio finally the fifth specification excluded sulphate the distance of wells for bank filtration see section 2 1 is a time invariant variable and was not considered in the main panel regression but in separate panel regressions with subsamples the subsampling divided the panel data set into one part n 645 where the well distance is less equal than the median of 0 64 km and in a second part n 657 where the well distance is greater than the median the subsampled regressions were specified as described by eq 1 and also estimated with ols and standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity all statistical analyses were done in r version 4 2 0 run by rstudio version 1 4 1717 integrated development environment for r rstudio pbc boston ma 3 results 3 1 reed development as a general trend the reed area at the lakes in berlin increased from 2000 and onwards from 24 0 to 37 5 ha in 2010 followed by a decrease to 24 3 ha in 2020 table 1 however the reed area did not change in a similar way for all lakes the reed ratio at the lakes fed by river spree and lower havel followed the described trend whereas the reed decline at the lakes fed by river dahme was already observed after 2005 for the upper havel the reed ratio fluctuated sightly fig 4a at lake level the reed ratio ranged between on average a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 14 9 despite the different trends of reed development for the four rivers nearly all the lakes excepting lake tegeler see reed ratio increased over time and lake zeuthener see reed ratio decreased during the observation time exhibited similar trends table 1 for the panel regressions the within variation of the reed ratio at segment level was most important based on the ratio of mean coverage to segment area of 6 3 the corresponding within standard deviation of 5 3 indicated a substantial level of variation over time table 2 3 2 exploratory variables the individual location of the lakes yielded different trends of the sulphate concentration over time the mean sulphate concentrations of lakes fed by river spree river dahme and lower havel increased whereas the concentration decreased in the upper havel lakes fig 4b the difference in sulphate concentrations between the two lake types increased over time standard deviations 28 1 to 63 7 and was greatest in the last period the lakes fed by river spree showed the highest sulphate concentrations with a steep increase after 2010 the descriptive statistics show a substantial level of 25 4 mg l within variation of the mean sulphate concentration table 2 other water quality variables differed slightly between the study sites thus the study lakes were slightly alkaline and had similar water temperatures and concentrations of dissolved oxygen table s1 furthermore all the lakes were highly eutrophic excepting lake tegel due to the presence of a phosphorus elimination plant ladwig et al 2018 during the observation time total phosphorus concentrations decreased after 2005 until 2015 and increased slightly afterwards in all rivers fig 5a nitrate nitrogen concentrations decreased between the first and the second study period in all rivers and increased until 2015 except lower havel where the nitrate nitrogen concentration decreased in the last period fig 5b the within variation level for all water quality variables was suitable for running panel regressions table 2 the scale of littoral and bank characteristics also changed over time on average trees covered 60 of the segment shorelines the length of the vegetated shoreline decreased from 107 5 to 95 8 km during the observation time in total but varied between the four lake systems fig 5c however the individual tree ratio varied within the segments over time standard deviation 14 making the tree variable suitable for the panel regressions the total sum of brushwood fascines length increased over time from 16 5 2000 to 20 7 km 2020 and the protected area increased from 34 2 2000 to 39 7 ha 2020 with small differences between the four lake systems fig 5d on average 6 8 of the segment area between the shoreline and the fascines is protected the within standard deviation of 5 0 indicates an suitable variation of the variable use in the panel regressions the mean ratio of floating leaf plants for the segment area increased over time from 3 8 2000 to 10 7 2020 in total and increased also in the four lake systems fig 5e the variable with a within standard variation of 6 6 is suitable for the panel regression table 2 the study lakes have an average pier area of 52 ha corresponding to 1 1 of the segment area during the last 20 years the area of piers has increased from 50 1 2000 to 53 3 ha 2020 representing not only new piers but also a rebuilding of piers at the same place within standard deviation 0 5 table 2 the filtration wells were on average located 1 km min 0 02 km max 5 7 km median 0 64 km from the nearest segment the spatial distribution of the wells differed for the four lake systems 16 19 23 and 24 of the shoreline of the lakes of the upper havel dahme spree and lower havel were joined by parallel located wells respectively 3 3 panel regression results statistical analysis revealed the impact of sulphate on reed development table 3 taking temporal and spatial differences into account as well as other lake and bank properties fascines trees usage classes piers nitrate nitrogen total phosphorus oxygen ph temperature and floating leaf plants all time invariant variables are absorbed by fixed effects of the models e g geographical position of the segments geological bedrock water level regulation geographical orientation and shallow water zone which do not vary over time the panel regressions showed a strong negative relationship between sulphate and the reed ratio for all four specifications p 0 001 table 3 an increase of 10 mg l sulphate comes along with an on average 0 3 to 0 4 percentage points lower reed ratio compared to the fixed effects models used as our baseline the magnitude and statistical significance of the coefficients for sulphate did not change in the random effects model or in the pooled ols model that explored between instead of within variation table s2 excepting nitrogen the coefficients and r2 did not change in the fifth specification without sulphate compared to the fourth specification the regression results revealed further factors that influenced the reed ratio of the lakes in berlin thus tree coverage was negatively correlated with the reed ratio an increase of tree coverage of 10 percentage points at the shoreline led to 0 3 percentage points lower reed coverage in the average segment fascines were strongly positively correlated with the reed ratio based on the coefficient a rise of 10 percentage points of area protected by fascines entailed a 2 0 percentage points increase of reed in the segment human usage had almost no impact on the reed ratio the exception was a positive and statistically significant effect of usage class 1 slightly used the base category was class 0 non used the coefficients for usage classes 2 3 and 4 were positive most of the time but not statistically significant at the 5 level piers had a negative influence on reed but the effect was not significant for any of the specifications also other water quality variables affected the reed ratio oxygen and temperature were positively and phosphorus and ph negatively correlated with the reed ratio but not significantly so except from oxygen floating leaf plants were negatively correlated with and statistically significant for reed whereas the effect of sulphate did not change to test the robustness further estimations were run with floating leaf plants and the total ratio of vegetation as dependent variables table s4 here sulphate was also negatively correlated with the ratio of floating leaf plants and total vegetation the regression coefficients for sulphate differ across the two subsamples defined by the distance to the nearest well table 4 for subsample 1 sulphate is significantly negatively correlated with the reed ratio whereas sulphate is not significantly correlated with the reed ratio in subsample 2 sulphate negatively influences the reed ratio if the nearest well is located sufficiently close to the segment the coefficients of the variables sulphate trees and fascines had similar levels of significance and affect directions across all specifications also when using different estimators table s2 this indicates that our model provided reliable and robust results 4 discussion the presence of common reed in the littoral zone of lakes in berlin was determined by several factors including water quality intensity of human usage and the characteristics of the bank and the littoral krauss et al 2013 our findings support to the knowledge that changes in reed presence changes are a result of multiple unfavourable conditions rather than a single influencing parameter we considered multiple variables using a comprehensive data set encompassing 11 time variant parameters and ran two way panel regression models with fixed effects our discoveries demonstrated the highly significant impact of increased sulphate concentrations on reed growth in all scenario calculations for the studied lakes however we also discuss the role of factors other than sulphate furthermore we used the different spatial positions of the lakes to cover a large gradient of sulphate pollution where lakes in close proximity to the lusatian mining area were most and lakes fed by the upper havel the least affected by sulphate figs 2 and 4 confirming that the landscape north of berlin is not affected by lignite mining on the other hand lake mueggelsee which is connected to the river spree was highly impaired by mining originated sulphate from the lusatian region the original sulphate concentration of up to 2000 mg l roesel and zak 2022 decreased downstream of the mining district but when reaching berlin the sulphate concentrations were still higher than 250 mg l thereby exceeding the german drinking water limits friedland et al 2021 zak et al 2021 the river dahme and lower havel were partly affected by water from the mining district due to mixing with water from the river spree the sulphate concentrations increased in the river havel due to the spree inflow after passing the city centre due to dilution with non mining affected water from the watershed the sulphate concentrations slowly decreased downstream the lower havel to values lower than 150 mg l fig 2 the path of sulphate demonstrated its long lifetime in aquatic ecosystems thus the sulphate concentration can be used as a marker for mining activities and to demonstrate the persistent impact of mining naicker et al 2003 the negative correlation between sulphate concentrations and reed development was surprising as reed is known to be tolerant of high salt stress chambers 1997 zak et al 2021 moreover sulphate is often used as a tracer as it needs distinct environmental conditions to exhibit chemical reactions and precipitate as a stable mineral such as iron ii sulphide roesel and zak 2022 generally sulphate per se is not toxic to reed plants chambers 1997 and is stable in the presence of oxygen however under anaerobic conditions and at high sulphate concentrations formation of phytotoxic sulphide is likely to take place in the reed bed sediment armstrong et al 1996 anaerobic conditions occur in the bank sediment when high amounts of organic matter accumulate in the littoral zone of the lakes in berlin hoffmann and gunkel 2011 and rapidly degrade the fine particulate organic matter reduces the hydraulic conductivity of the sediment massmann et al 2008 and thus leads to redox conditions of the filtrate in the first infiltration decimeter of the sediment where oxygen is completely consumed filter et al 2017 high organic content and anaerobic conditions promote the activity of sulphate reducing bacteria massmann et al 2008 and provide optimal conditions for sulphate reduction iron is ubiquitous and able to rapidly bind sulphide that protects common reed for toxic sulphide concentrations under redox conditions within the bank sediments ferric iron fe iii is reduced to ferrous iron fe ii farnsworth and hering 2011 and is able to react with sulphide lamers et al 2013 however this process might be disturbed in some of the sulphate polluted lakes like lake mueggelsee due to groundwater abstraction for drinking water production via wells nearby the lake shores fig 2 groundwater abstraction changes the water flow thus the seepage of iron enriched groundwater into the lake sediments is lowered and instead iron poor and sulphate enriched surface water flows into the sediment due to bank infiltration the daily sulphate load into the sediment was increased by a factor 6 from approximately 0 8 g m2 only diffusion for flux calculations see zak et al 2006 to 5 g m2 taking a bank infiltration rate of about 2 cm day gillefalk et al 2019 and the current sulphate concentrations of 250 mg l into account at the low bank infiltration of 2 cm day it seems unlikely that a larger fraction of the sediment would become aerobic implying that sulphate reduction will likely increase as sulphate rather than organic carbon was found to be the limiting factor even in the less organic rich sediments of the river spree zak et al 2006 if iron is not available in sufficient amounts or sulphide concentrations are higher than the iron concentration sulphide cannot be completely bound by iron consequently leading to a toxic environment and reed die back hotes et al 2005 iron deficiency may also reduce the chlorophyll content in reed leaves chlorosis causing reduced reed vitality and eventually also a reed decline lamers et al 2013 the smaller reed decline in the dahme lakes despite of rising sulphate concentrations coincides with a lower number of wells data analysis implies that wells near the bank intensify the effect of sulphate enriched water in the rooted sediment layer table 4 the significance of presumed sulphide toxicity must be proven by in situ investigations of the iron sulphur cycling in lake sediments other factors than sulphate have been shown to contribute to reed development some of these are quantitatively even more important than sulphate for example trees along the shore and fascines see table s2 the negative effect of trees on reed growth is in line with the observation of previous studies shoreline and littoral vegetation can act as competitors and suppress reed growth by shading reviewed in packer et al 2017 because reed may be shade intolerant under a dense canopy such as that of trees albert et al 2013 and bushes ostendorp 1989 the positive effects of fascines has not been extensively examined but has been demonstrated for submerged plants vermaat and de bruyne 1993 and was described to be best adapted to the special situation at the havel by ostendorp 1995 in order to protect the reed plants against mechanical damage by waves our results demonstrate a significantly positive effect of brushwood fascines and with this provide yet unpublished evidence of the suitability of this shoreline protection measure however further research to identify the relevant processes is required to our knowledge the increase that we found in the floating leaf plant ratio table 1 as well as the strong negative relationship with reed table 3 and s4 in the urban lakes of berlin have hitherto gone noticed seen in the light of our results though we assume the existence of spatial concurrence between both vegetation types in the littoral zone however further research is required to provide further evidence of this it is noticeable that the phosphorus and nitrogen nitrate concentrations were not significantly correlated with the reed ratio in this study despite that eutrophication has previously been found to be an impact factor on reed die back sukopp and markstein 1989 kubín and melzer 1997 though mainly in an indirect way brix 1999 on the other hand ostendorp et al 2001 could not confirm a general influence of eutrophication on reed decline we used the regression coefficient to calculate the mean reed area loss caused by increased sulphate concentrations for a conservative calculation the sulphate coefficient 0 03 of specification 3 was used and multiplied by 45 5 mg l showing a mean sulphate increase over time leading to a reed decrease of 1 4 next the reed decreased value 1 4 was multiplied by the mean segment area 3106 m2 and divided by 100 in the last step the calculated value was multiplied by the number of segments 1302 resulting in a reed area of 5 5 ha hence under the described conditions and using the estimated coefficient an increase of reed area of 5 5 ha would grow without the increase of mean sulphate concentrations of 45 mg l considering this calculation and based on the regression coefficients of fascines 0 2 and trees 0 03 respectively 3 4 ha or 1 4 ha smaller reed area would grow without the 4 2 km installed fascines or if 11 7 km of vegetated shoreline were not decreased until 2020 overall there is a large spatial restoration potential as the area theoretically covered by reed beds would account for 404 ha i e 17 times more than the current reed coverage until a water depth of 1 50 meter krauss et al 2013 5 conclusions the decreasing reed area at freshwater lakes in berlin is the result of multiple factors including rising sulphate concentrations fascines and tree shading seems to be more relevant for the reed decline than the current rise of sulphate concentrations despite the relationship between reed ratio and each of the three factors was highly significant p 0 001 management plans to combat the reed decline even further should include mitigation measures in the upper catchment as sulphate pollution is expected to continue to rise over the next years to decades due to ongoing mining and reclamation activities future investigations need to clarify first if bank infiltration fosters iron deficiency and thus sulphide toxicity in the reed banks and second it must be elucidated how other factors not investigated in this study e g grazing explain the differences in reed development between freshwater lakes of the berlin area credit authorship contribution statement lydia k roesel conceptualization

15007,perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa a class of permanent organic pollutants is frequently detected in surface and ground water with the latter made up primarily of porous media such as soils sediments and aquifers that harbor microbial communities therefore we investigated the effects of pfoa on water ecosystems and found that under stimulation by 2 4 μm pfoa denitrifiers were significantly enriched due to their hosting antibiotic resistant genes args which were 1 45 times more abundant than the control furthermore denitrifying metabolism was enhanced by fe ii electron donation specifically 2 4 μm pfoa significantly enhanced the removal of total inorganic nitrogen by 178 6 the microbial community became predominated by denitrifying bacteria 67 8 abundance notably the nitrate reduction ferrous oxidizing nrfo bacteria dechloromonas acidovorax bradyrhizorium etc were significantly enriched the selective pressures of pfoa driving the enrichment of denitrifiers were twofold first the toxic pfoa induced denitrifying bacteria to produce args mainly including the efflux occupying 55 4 and antibiotic inactivation occupying 41 2 types which improved microbial tolerance to pfoa the risk of horizontal args transmission was elevated as the overall number of horizontally transmissible args increased by 47 1 second fe ii electrons were transported via the porin cytochrome c extracellular electrons transfer system eet promoting the expression of nitrate reductases which in turn further enhanced denitrification in summary pfoa regulated the microbial community structure and influenced microbial tn removal functions and increased the contribution of args by the denitrifier hosts but the pfoa induced production of args may pose a serious ecological threat that needs to be comprehensively investigated graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa porous media denitrifiers antibiotic resistant genes args denitrification fe ii data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa is one of the most frequently detected perfluoroalkyl substances pfas in the environment chen et al 2021b xiao et al 2015 given its advantageous properties such as hydrophobicity thermal stability and acid and base resistance pfoa is widely used in food packaging firefighting foams surfactants and other industrial applications gagliano et al 2020 wang et al 2017 however due to the high energy of the c f bond 485 kj mol l 1 and the strong electronegativity of the f atom natural processes have difficulty eliminating pfoa in fact pfoa is the final degradation product of various perfluorinated compound precursors lindstrom et al 2011 xiao et al 2018 pfoa is easily bioaccumulated in both aquatic and terrestrial organisms and can lead to many human diseases such as kidney cancer neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity li et al 2018b vieira et al 2013 xiang et al 2020 zareitalabad et al 2013 therefore pfoa was added to the stockholm convention list of persistent organic pollutants pops in 2019 unep 2019 making its use and production explicitly restricted since the start of the 21st century contamination and risks related to pfas have been widely investigated pfoa has been detected globally in soil air and water environments due to its ultra long half life and accumulation from numerous pfas precursors via transformation wang et al 2017 pfoa concentrations of 0 11 0 97 mg l 1 have been observed in natural rivers which are even higher than those in municipal wastewaters 0 09 0 92 mg l 1 han and currell 2017 yuan et al 2022 more recently with the migration of pfoa from the surface to the subsurface ug l 1 levels have also been detected in groundwater environments li et al 2020 as the main constituent part of ground water porous media such as soils sediments and aquifers are some of the most sensitive habitats affected by pfoa chen et al 2013 higgins and luthy 2006 xiao et al 2015 porous media form complex environments where solid liquid and gas media intermingle pfoa can interact with phospholipids on cell membranes and inhibit cell membrane synthesis liao et al 2010 and disrupt the balance of oxidative systems and produce excess ros causing oxidative damage and dna breakage even resulting in apoptosis liu et al 2016 these environmental selection pressures exerted by toxic pfoa can significantly alter microbial community structures one study reported that soil with 1000 mg kg 1 pfoa became significantly enriched with proteobacteria within 15 days cai et al 2020 similarly the microbial community in soil contaminated with pfoa for many years was also dominated by proteobacteria these trends occurred because the proteobacteria phospholipid bilayer readily interacts with pfoa making proteobacteria more sensitive to pfoa contamination and more likely to elicit response behavior senevirathna et al 2022 wojcik et al 2018 our previous study also found that pfoa contamination caused significant enrichment in proteobacteria during migration in porous media reaching a remarkably high abundance greater than 91 more interestingly pfoa induced a significant enrichment in antibiotic resistance genes args especially efflux args more importantly pfoa was able to induce an increase in vertically transmissible args and these vertically transferable args were mediated by human pathogenic bacteria chen et al 2022 undoubtedly posing a great threat to human health sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 in recent years studies have identified denitrifying bacteria as the primary hosts of antibiotic resistance genes dang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 denitrifying bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance genes play an important role in maintaining denitrification when exposed to environmental stress dang et al 2021 denitrification is an important component of the complex nitrogen cycle in nature it is the biochemical reduction of no3 or no2 to gaseous n molecular n2 or oxides of nitrogen by bacteria which is essential for the removal of nitrogen from natural water systems kuypers et al 2018 denitrification can be divided into heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic denitrification depending on the microbial action pang and wang 2021 as important carriers of args denitrifiers are affected by organic electron donors organic acids saccharides aromatic compounds etc inorganic electron donors hydrogen gas fe ii mn ii etc and electron transfer efficiency all of which can affect denitrification processes in the environment pang and wang 2021 yang et al 2020b pfoa as a persistent toxic pollutant can significantly alter microbial community structures and stimulate changes in microbial community metabolic functions which may have important effects on nitrogen transformation processes in the environment especially denitrification chen et al 2021a yang et al 2020a however to date few studies have reported on the effects of pfoa on denitrification in this study a porous media environment experiencing long term infusion with surface water containing trace pfoa was simulated using this experiment the effects and mechanisms of microbial community regulation and metabolic function changes on nitrogen transformation caused by the migration of pfoa through the stratum were investigated using various spectroscopic energy spectroscopic and macro transcriptomic assays this study comprehensively revealed the indirect effects of pfoa in the environment and provided a scientific and theoretical basis for an improved understanding of the ecological effects of pfoa 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in fig s1 to simulate

represents most of the water penetrated soil the ph of synthetic water was 6 5 and the synthetic water was purged with nitrogen to lower do to under 1 mg l 1 in the effluent of the column ph increased slightly to 6 7 and do remained at 1 0 mg l 1 pfoa from the μg l 1 to mg l 1 levels have been measured in water environments due to pfoa s extreme stability lindstrom et al 2011 wang et al 2017 in this work pfoa in the synthetic water was set at 2 4 μm which was in the frequently reported pfoa concentration range han et al 2017 yuan et al 2022 according to measurements reported from real water

and discussion 3 1 pfoa stimulated denitrifier enrichment 3 1 1 pfoa induced denitrifier enrichment similar to previous studies in this study the trace amounts of pfoa imposed non negligible stress on microbial communities in porous media significantly affecting community succession fig 1 it is noteworthy that 26 of the top 30 most abundant genera possessed denitrification assimilatory nitrate reduction or dissimilatory nitrate reduction functions in specific 18 genera with denitrification functions became more enriched under pfoa stress including methylophilus 13 3 vs 0 2 dechloromons 8 3 vs 0 5 delftia 3 1 vs 0 1 acinetobater 1 4 vs 0 1 etc the total abundance of denitrifiers reached 67 8 under pfoa stress indicating that pfoa induced the community to become predominated by denitrifiers this may have been because the cell membrane phospholipid components of denitrifiers belonging to proteobacteria 91 6 vs 57 3 see fig s2 were more susceptible to the effects of pfoa wojcik et al 2018 so they were able to sense and respond to pfoa stress in time which in turn led to a significant increase in their abundance in addition denitrifiers are the microbial group that adept at args production and transmission which enhances their environmental adaptability towards both antibiotics and other persistent organics li et al 2023 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2023 florfenicol could significantly enhance the abundance of args in denitrifiers wang et al 2020 sulfamethoxazole smx could also induce denitrifiers to become enriched in args li et al 2023 and promote the horizontal transmission of args zhang et al 2023 pfoa caused microbial aggregations to form on the surface of the medium see fig s3a b and the biomass per unit weight of quartz sand aggregates increased by 49 2 under the pfoa stress i e from 1 18 to 1 76 mg g 1 of sand fig s3c the aggregating microbes facilitated the formation of biofilms which improved the tolerance of microbes to pfoa and improved their survival van acker et al 2014 the formation of biofilms was further supported by the eps measurements as shown in fig s3d and s3e the content of polysaccharides and proteins per unit biomass increased by 1278 and 619 respectively these results revealed that in the face of the toxicity of pfoa microorganisms form natural protective layers by upregulating the production of eps which in turn reduces the harmful effects of pfoa and ensures sustained microbial activity soleimani et al 2013 3 1 2 nitrogen conversion and loss with the succession of communities towards enrichment with nitrogen cycling microorganisms the concentrations of ammonia 2 mg l 1 and nitrate 2 mg l 1 in the influent were significantly different than the effluent due to the metabolism of microorganisms generally the inorganic nitrogen species in the column effluents i e ammonia nitrite and nitrate were all lower with pfoa stimulation as shown in fig 2 for nh4 n pfoa resulted in a 40 decrease indicating that the regulation of the community and microbial enrichment by pfoa promoted the nitrification of ammonia nitrogen in contrast there was negligible anammox reaction in the column according to the microbial community and n conversion functional genes analyses as shown in fig s4b only 4 anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aaob were identified from the biomass and their total abundance was reduced dramatically under pfoa stress becoming almost un detectable fig s4a besides transcriptomic results showed that the anammox functional genes hzs and hdh were not obviously expressed in either of the protocols fig s4c the anammox reaction is very sensitive to no2 n and nh4 n concentrations and ratios rivett et al 2008 wu et al 2022 so the recharging water of this work was not suitable for aaob accumulation importantly while 1 2 mg l 1 nitrites accumulated in the control no nitrite could be detected in the pfoa treatment this implied that the enrichment of nitrogen cycling bacteria under the pfoa stress promoted nitrogen cycling likewise no3 was reduced more completely under pfoa stress which further indicated denitrification was enhanced based on the concentrations of nitrogenous substances in the feed water and effluent the nitrogen mass balance could be analyzed using eqs s1 s7 cai et al 2022 rittmann and mccarty 2001 as shown in fig s5 the efficiency of denitrification under pfoa stress was 4 4 times greater than that of the control and the efficiency of assimilation n presented in the column was also 1 5 times higher indicating that pfoa stimulated the activity of nitrogen cycling bacteria and subsequently enhanced nitrogen removal as a result pfoa induced a more efficient conversion of inorganic nitrogen and tin removal was enhanced by 178 6 when the reaction was running stably 15 days the promotion of denitrification by pfoa contributed to increasing consumption of organic carbon fig s6 because most of the enriched denitrifying bacteria were heterotrophs including methylophilus dechloromons and pelomonas upon reaching the steady state toc was maintained at 1 8 mg l 1 in the pfoa treatment which was significantly lower than the control 2 3 mg l 1 3 2 denitrifiers were the main arg hosts 3 2 1 pfoa caused elevated arg production to tolerate pfoa toxicity the bacteria biomass residing in the porous media adapted to carry 45 5 more args as shown in fig 3 a the increase in args was likely a response to the pfoa driven increase in microbial intracellular ros levels chen et al 2022 which increased by 31 3 as shown in fig s7 mges analysis further illustrated the effect of pfoa stress on the arg transfer pathway in this system 65 hgt arg encoding plasmids were detected the top 20 most abundant plasmids accounting for 82 3 of the total abundance are shown in fig s8 compared to the control the abundance of plasmids for hgt arg was greatly altered under pfoa stress with nc 013856 1 nc 013858 1 and nc 013856 1 significantly decreasing and nz cm002758 1 nz cm000959 1 and nc 016626 1 significantly increasing overall as shown in fig 3a pfoa resulted in a slight increase in the relative abundance of hgt args the high abundance of hrt args increased the spread of resistance genes among community members due to the ability to overcome barriers between species amarasiri et al 2020 interestingly fig 3b shows that although the absolute abundance of args increased significantly due to pfoa the types of args became less varied i e there were 113 in the control but 96 in the pfoa treatment and the number of hgt args types dropped from 47 to 36 these results illustrated that more hgt arg types were eliminated under pfoa stress but the targeted enrichment of certain hgt arg types further enhanced the effective resistance of these microorganisms to pfoa 3 2 2 host analysis of dngs and args the host analysis of genes encoding functional enzymes in the denitrification pathway and args further revealed the relationship between community structure and denitrification as shown in fig 4 the abundances of most genera 17 19 with both functional genes encoding denitrifying enzymes and antibiotic resistance genes args increased significantly under pfoa stress including dechloromonas acidovorax acinetobacter delftia etc for example dechloromonas possesses the dngs nasa napa napb nirb nird nirs norc norb and nosz and the args oxa 85 and oxa 61 which belongs to antibiotic inactivation resistance mechanism delftia possesses the dngs narg narh nasa narj nirb nird and norr and the args amrb and oxa 134 which belong to antibiotic efflux and antibiotic inactivation resistance mechanisms respectively in contrast the abundance of several microorganisms 3 5 with genes encoding denitrifying enzymes gradually decreased under pfoa stress including phenylobacterium novosphingobium and thaurea because they did not carry any args more notably the abundances of all microorganisms that did not have both genes encoding denitrifying enzymes and args 6 6 dramatically decreased under pfoa stress including mycobacterium sediminibacterium and enhydrobacter the details of dngs and args abundances from the top 30 genera are given in table s2 pfoa is considered a forever organic and exhibited negligible biodegradation during the study fig s9 lindstrom et al 2011 wang et al 2017 the results showed that denitrifiers carrying args were enriched because they were more tolerant to pfoa except for denitrifying bacteria ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob comammox nitrospira and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were barely detectable in the community however the functional genera that played major roles in nitrogen removal were the ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa nitrosopumilus and nitrososphaera whose abundances increased significantly under pfoa stress fig s4a b the transcriptome results indicated that the reduction of ammonia was mainly related to the active expression of ammonia monooxygenases amo fig s4c it appeared that more activity in the functional genera related to nitrification favored the advanced denitrification and tn removal under pfoa stress 3 3 fe ii enhanced denitrifying activity 3 3 1 verifying nitrate reduction ferrous oxidizing bacteria as shown in fig 1 a variety of nitrate reduction ferrous oxidizing bacteria nrfob became much more abundant under pfoa stimulation including azohydromonas 9 8 vs 7 8 dechloromonas 8 3 vs 0 5 acidovorax 7 2 vs 0 7 bradyrhizorium 1 0 vs 0 3 etc nrfob are microorganisms that mediate denitrification coupled with fe ii oxidation under anoxic conditions liu et al 2019 because they are not restricted to environments that have light and oxygen they are more abundant than phototrophic and microaerophilic bacteria emerson 2012 kappler and straub 2005 numerous studies have shown that nrfob can directly reduce nitrate via the denitrification pathway and that the intermediate products of denitrification nitrite and no can rapidly chemically oxidize fe ii to fe iii resulting in encrustation on the cell surface li et al 2018a nordhoff et al 2017 indeed the concentrations of fe and nitrogenous substances in the influent were similar to those in the surface water environment as can be seen in fig 5 the iron film on the cell surface in the pfoa treatment is much clearer than in the control group the tem mapping showed that the amount of fe reached 0 14 of the total cell surface elements in the pfoa group whereas no fe was detected in the control group si was the main compositional element of the unavoidable quartz sand fragments that mixed in the biomass this result directly confirmed the occurrence of abiotic fe ii oxidation by no2 under pfoa stress which significantly accelerated the removal of nitrogen from the system 3 3 2 fe ii electron donation pathways increased expression of outer membrane porin and cytochrome c cyt c improved microbial extracellular electron transfer eet for denitrification shi et al 2016 as shown in fig 6 nrfob achieved enzymatic fe ii oxidation via cyt c on the outer membrane the electrons from fe ii were directly transferred to nitrate or its intermediates through the porin cyt c eet system as evidenced by the up regulated expression of the gene encoding porin tables s3 and the one encoding cyt c tables s14 liu et al 2014 extracellular electron transfer enhanced the expression of the genes encoding nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir and nitric oxide reductase nor details in fig s10 the log2foldchange log2fc values of the majority of the functional genes such as narg narh and nari reached 4 while the log2fc of the functional genes nirs and norb reached 5 since nos is a weak competitor for electrons compared to other denitrifying functional enzymes wei et al 2022 nos was inhibited when the supply of electron equivalents was limited resulting in its encoded functional gene logfc value being reduced moreover microbes had significantly up regulated tca cycles details in table s5 under pfoa stress under pfoa stress microbes used acetate to produce more nadh as an electron donor for nitrate reduction the produced nitrite and other intermediates rapidly oxidized fe ii to fe iii in the periplasm and the fe iii was transported out of the cell by porin where it encrusted on the cell surface as seen in tem image of the iron film in fig 6 importantly the reaction between fe ii and nitrate did not occur under normoxic nor anoxic conditions even though the reaction was thermodynamically feasible li et al 2018a this further illustrated that nrfob enriched under pfoa stress played a crucial role in nitrogen removal 3 3 3 state of fe in biomass sem and xrd analysis further revealed the fugacity of fe in the porous media and the morphologies of its oxidation products fe2 was continuously injected into the system as feso4 7h2o 0 5 mg l 1 as shown in fig 7 a sem mapping revealed that fe was enriched and immobilized throughout the whole biofilm under the effects of pfoa this result fully demonstrated the critical role of nrfob under pfoa stress compared to the control group where no fe was detected xrd patterns fig 7b showed that classic goethite phases fe2o3 and feooh were formed which had been described as the final products of the oxidation of fe ii by nitrite during the reduction of heterotrophic nitrate li et al 2018a nordhoff et al 2017 based on the xps of biofilms the semi quantitative results showed an increase in the peak area percentage of fe iii under the influence of pfoa from 40 2 control to 80 6 shown in fig s11 this indicated that the pfoa stress significantly promoted the oxidation of fe ii which was attributed to the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria especially nrfob under pfoa stress the oxidation of fe ii provided more electrons for denitrification while significantly increasing the expression of denitrification functional enzymes theoretically the oxidation of 1 mol of fe ii to fe iii in the reaction of fe ii with no2 provides 1 mol of electrons for the reduction of no2 to nitrogenous gases so to completely oxidize the fe ii of 0 5 mg l 1 feso4 7h2o in solution to fe iii 0 086 mg l 1 of no2 must be reduced which has a weaker effect compared to the effect of pfoa on promoting microbial denitrification by increasing the expression of denitrifying enzymes and extracellular electron transfer the possible reaction processes for nitrate reduction ferrous oxidizing are as follows no3 toc denitrifiers no2 other intermediates fe2 no2 h2o feooh no other nitrogenous gases 3 4 pfoa microbial selective pressure mechanisms overall as shown in fig 8 the selection pressure exerted by pfoa regulated the microbial community resulting in the significant enrichment of denitrifying bacteria the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria was enabled by their production of args which increased their tolerance to pfoa moreover microorganisms produced more eps which increased their resistance to pfoa the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria enhanced the nitrogen cycle specifically the low concentration of fe ii in the environment was oxidized by nrfob and the generated electrons were transported through the porin cyt c extracellular electron transport system which enhanced the expression of reductase and intensified denitrification this showed that trace levels of pfoa could directly affect the microbial community of porous media and dramatically alter the function of the community which significantly promoted the denitrification process reduced the accumulation of nitrite and ensured the safety of groundwater quality however the large number of antibiotic resistance genes induced by trace pfoa could pose a serious threat to groundwater quality so the ecological impact of pfoa needs to be comprehensively evaluated 4 conclusions in this study in an experiment simulating the selective pressure of pfoa on the microbial community in porous media we observed for the first time that denitrifier enrichment reaching 67 8 was related to carrying args and the transfer of ferric electrons the toxic pfoa stimulation induced the production of args in denitrifiers the increase in expression of efflux and antibiotic inactivation args indicated selection for the pfoa resistance in denitrifiers the porin cyt c eet promoted electron transfer which facilitated fe ii oxidation and also enhanced the expression of the reductases nar nir and nor as well as nitrogen cycling processes especially denitrification meanwhile the enrichment of nrfob enabled the oxidation of fe ii to goethite phases fe2o3 and feooh and attachment to the cell surface therefore the alteration of the microbial community in porous media by trace pfoa levels at low fe ii concentrations enhanced denitrification by microorganisms however the resulting biological risks such as args enrichment and transmission deserve further in depth research

15008,rapid sand filters rsf are an established and widely applied technology for groundwater treatment yet the underlying interwoven biological and physical chemical reactions controlling the sequential removal of iron ammonia and manganese remain poorly understood to resolve the contribution and interactions between the individual reactions we studied two full scale drinking water treatment plant configurations namely i one dual media anthracite and quartz sand filter and ii two single media quartz sand filters in series in situ and ex situ activity tests were combined with mineral coating characterization and metagenome guided metaproteomics along the depth of each filter both plants exhibited comparable performances and process compartmentalization with most of ammonium and manganese removal occurring only after complete iron depletion the homogeneity of the media coating and genome based microbial composition within each compartment highlighted the effect of backwashing namely the complete vertical mixing of the filter media in stark contrast to this homogeneity the removal of the contaminants was strongly stratified within each compartment and decreased along the filter height this apparent and longstanding conflict was resolved by quantifying the expressed proteome at different filter heights revealing a consistent stratification of proteins catalysing ammonia oxidation and protein based relative abundances of nitrifying genera up to 2 orders of magnitude difference between top and bottom samples this implies that microorganisms adapt their protein pool to the available nutrient load at a faster rate than the backwash mixing frequency ultimately these results show the unique and complementary potential of metaproteomics to understand metabolic adaptations and interactions in highly dynamic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater sand filter metaproteomics manganese ammonium iron

karapanagioti 2019 de vet 2011 rapid sand filters rsfs preceded by an aeration step are the most commonly applied technology for groundwater treatment the main groundwater contaminants soluble iron fe2 ammonium nh4 and manganese mn2 are sequentially removed in a combination of interdependent biological and physical chemical reactions bourgine et al 1994 while the latter have been the subject of decades of research our understanding of the microbiology involved in the removal of groundwater contaminants is still limited according to recent research fe2 is oxidized through a combination of chemical and biological processes van beek et al 2012 mn2 is mainly removed through chemical autocatalytic oxidation and to some extent biologically breda et al 2019 and nh4 removal is exclusively biological tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 however not only the impact of microbial activity on the removal processes and their stratification along the height of rsfs is largely unknown but also the individual physiologies of the involved microorganisms remain elusive gülay et al 2016 deepening our knowledge of the underlying microbiology is paramount to improve current rsf operation and to design and implement novel resource efficient systems the first characterization of nitrifying biomass stratification in rsfs dates back to the beginning of this century kihn et al 2000 in their pioneering work kihn and colleagues observed an uneven distribution of nitrifying activity along a full scale rsf using ex situ batch incubations subsequently molecular methods such as fluorescence in situ hybridization lydmark et al 2006 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing qin et al 2007 and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis w de vet et al 2009 have been used to investigate the diversity of nitrifying bacteria and to estimate the relative abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and archaea furthermore quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr has been applied to determine the distribution of nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms in rsfs bai et al 2013 linking absolute microbial abundances to in situ ammonium removal capacity tatari et al 2016 2017 recently shotgun metagenomics has established itself as the predominant approach for the characterization of the composition and functional potential of complex microbiomes and led to remarkable discoveries in rsfs such as the complete oxidation of ammonia by a single organism comammox palomo et al 2016 pinto et al 2016 or the metabolic coupling between methane and ammonia oxidizing communities poghosyan et al 2020 on the contrary information about biological iron and manganese oxidation in rsfs is scarce primarily due to our limited understanding of the underlying metabolic pathways ilbert and bonnefoy 2013 romano et al 2017 in spite of this the presence and importance of iron and manganese oxidizing organisms in rsfs has repeatedly been shown by culture dependent burger et al 2008 nitzsche et al 2015 qin et al 2009 yang et al 2014 and culture independent studies bruins et al 2017 gülay et al 2018 marcus et al 2017 yang et al 2020 ex situ batch incubations breda et al 2019 and metagenomics hu et al 2020 palomo et al 2016 however mechanistic insights linking filter performance with actual microbial activities have not been established to date recent technical advancements made the characterization of the entire pool of proteins expressed in complex communities feasible van den bossche et al 2021 wilmes and bond 2004 proteins are the biological entities catalyzing metabolic reactions thus beyond genome based approaches their identification and quantification allow for the simultaneous resolution of the identity and actual metabolic function of core community members kleiner 2019 protein abundances also provide a more accurate estimation of the relative biomass contribution of different populations in a community kleikamp et al 2021 kleiner et al 2017 over the past decades metaproteomics has been successfully applied to characterize microbiomes from different environments including wastewater kleikamp et al 2022 and freshwater hanson and madsen 2015 ecosystems moreover differential protein expression has been used to characterize microbiomes physiological responses to rapid environmental changes chirania et al 2022 wilmes et al 2015 making metaproteomics particularly relevant to study dynamic environments such as rsf systems rsfs are regularly backwashed to remove particles that have been trapped during operation as a result biomass colonized filter media grains are displaced along the filter height and exposed to different substrate loads at every cycle ramsay et al 2021 consistently metagenome based studies commonly report even distributions of core taxa along filter heights bai et al 2013 tatari et al 2017 and conventional rsfs models consider them as homogeneous systems uhl and gimbel 2000 in contrast and irrespective of the backwash contaminant removal stratification along the filter is commonly reported gude et al 2016 tatari et al 2016 within this framework we hypothesize that genetically homogeneous rsfs microbial communities hold the ability to rapidly modify their pool of expressed proteins to metabolically respond to the environmental conditions encountered at a given filter height to this end we quantified the in situ removal of iron manganese and ammonium and resolved the taxonomy and function of the microbial communities along the filter height of two full scale rsf plants one dual media anthracite and sand single filter system and one comprising two single media sand filters in series 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection filter media and water samples were collected from two

for diamond annotations the lineage of the lowest common ancestor was determined from the top 10 sequence alignments comparison of the relative abundance of proteins between samples was performed using relative spectral counts i e normalized spectral counts defined as spectral counts per protein divided by the molecular weight divided by the sum of spectral counts of all proteins of all samples since protein extraction was performed from filter media of equal mass 150 mg per sample the protein abundance of sample sf t was multiplied upfront by 0 76 to correct for the density difference between anthracite 1 3 g cm3 and quartz sand 1 7 g cm3 for sake of simplicity further corrections for differences in nutrient loads between systems resulting from different superficial velocities and filter volumes table 1 were omitted as they did not yield significantly different results to identify the functional guilds of interest all proteins were taxonomically classified using their best hit in the ncbi and kegg database and subsequently grouped at genus level and the resulting genera were manually classified based on their most probable energy source iron nitrogen or others based on the literature table s3 similarly the contribution of a specific protein was estimated by summing up the relative abundances of all proteins with the same annotation raw data is attached in table s5 3 results 3 1 in situ oxidation of fe2 nh4 mn2 display similar compartmentalization in both configurations the concentration profiles of ammonium iron and manganese along the studied treatment processes are shown in fig 2 a and 2b iron was completely removed 0 04 mg fe2 l in the top layer of the single filter system i e anthracite layer sf t and in the first filter of the double filter system df1 consistently manganese consumption only started after iron depletion in both systems namely in sf m and df2 t and was complete 0 002 mg mn2 l at the end of each treatment process in analogy most ammonium was removed after iron depletion with 30 removal in sf t and df1 the observed process compartmentalization was also reflected in each filter section in the total mass of iron and manganese oxides the end products of fe2 and mn2 oxidation van beek et al 2012 fig 2c d the coating in sf t and df1 mainly consisted of iron 118 8 mgfe gmedia while the coating in sf m sf b and df2 mainly consisted of manganese 33 6 mgmn gmedia in sf anthracite and quartz sand remained clearly separated after over one year of operation despite frequent backwashing cycles nevertheless trace amounts of anthracite particles were found in the lower filter sections and might explain the slightly higher iron coating content in sf m and sf b as compared to df2 fig 2c d overall concentration profiles and coating composition results revealed similar compartmentalization of removal processes in the two dwtps irrespective of dual media single filter or single media double filter configurations 3 2 ex situ nh4 and mn2 removal mechanisms and rates reflect in situ compartmentalization 3 2 1 manganese is chemically oxidized or adsorbed depending on filter media coating the manganese removal capacity of the filter media in the different sections was quantified in batch activity tests fig 3 a and 3c complete mn2 removal was observed with manganese coated media from the later sections of both treatments i e sf m sf b and df2 contrastingly it remained incomplete with iron coated media from the first treatment sections i e sf t and df1 to further characterize the removal mechanism desorption experiments were performed by submerging drained media in demineralized water eley and nicholson 1993 mn2 desorption was observed exclusively with iron rich media fig 3b and 3d suggesting that mn2 is adsorbed by iron oxides bibak 1994 while it is oxidized on manganese oxide coated particles first order oxidation rate constants were calculated for manganese oxidizing media fig 3e as manganese oxidation is known to occur mainly physicochemically and to linearly depend on mn2 concentration breda et al 2019 katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 removal rate constants were similar in both systems 0 010 0 013 min 1 in sf m and sf b 0 014 0 016 min 1 in df2 consistent with the comparable total amounts of manganese oxide coating the catalyst of manganese oxidation breda et al 2019 moreover the rate constants were comparable in all sections devoid of iron oxides despite decreasing manganese concentrations along the filter height fig 2 likely this is the result of media mixing during frequent backwash events 3 2 2 ammonia oxidation is biological compartmentalized and stratified within each compartment the maximum volumetric ammonia oxidation rates along the filter heights were tested ex situ in batch experiments fig 4 a the biological nature of ammonia oxidation was validated with penicillin amended batch tests fig 4b consistent with the measured ammonium concentration profiles along the two treatments fig 2a and 2b the maximum ammonium removal rates were significantly lower in the sections where iron is present 4 5 4 7 g nh4 mmedia 3 h sf t df1 t and df1 m compared to the downstream sections where iron was depleted 15 62 g nh4 mmedia 3 h sf m sf b and throughout df2 moreover in contrast to the relatively uniform chemical manganese oxidation rate constants fig 3e the biological ammonium removal rates displayed a decreasing trend likely reflecting the decreasing substrate availability along the filter height fig 4a 3 3 taxonomic and functional analysis bridge plant operation with microbial physiology 3 3 1 metagenomic based microbial composition reflects process compartmentalization to resolve the phylum level taxonomic profile of the microbial community in the rapid sand filters we sequenced the metagenome of each section the metagenome was subsequently also used as a reference database for metaproteomics see next section the analysis yielded an average of 7 106 3 1 106 paired end reads per sample after quality filtering table s1 we used de novo assembly to process the trimmed reads resulting in 1 105 5 8 104 contigs 0 5 kb with an average n50 of 1118 215 bases notably samples from the lower sections of each filter sf m sf b and df2 b produced the shortest contigs with an average length of less than 1 kb we also predicted an average of 1 8 106 1 106 coding sequences per sample on the assembled contigs bacteria accounted for 91 2 1 9 of the total contigs in all samples while archaea accounted for 1 and the remainder remained unclassified 75 4 3 7 of the bacterial contigs were classified at phylum level fig 5 proteobacteria 45 7 12 1 and nitrospirae 18 8 10 8 dominated all sections followed by planctomycetes and acidobacteria that were present in all sections except for sf t verrucomicrobia and bacteroidetes were found in sf t and df1 and actinobacteria only in df1 importantly contigs associated with the nitrosomonadaceae and nitrospiraceae families fig s2 were more abundant in the upper parts of the filters where the actual removal of ammonium occurred in analogy contigs assigned to phyla or families known to contribute to iron oxidation were present in all compartments but were mainly present in the anthracite layer of sf where iron removal occurs overall the composition of the microbial communities reflected the observed activity compartmentalization figs 2 and 4 and this was especially evident in the dual filter system featuring a uniform community composition within each filter i e df1 and df2 despite the potential mixing effect of backwash an analogous compartmentalization was also observed between the anthracite sf t and sand layers sf m sf b in sf 3 3 2 differential protein abundance explains biological activity stratification the proteome of each section was quantified to estimate the relative contribution of known nitrogen and iron metabolizing guilds to the total biomass as well as the distribution of core nitrogen iron and manganese transforming enzymes per sample we obtained on average 176 79 individual protein groups that contained at least two unique peptides and false discover rate fdr 1 table s4 the guilds of interest were identified by taxonomically grouping all proteins at genus level and subsequently classifying the resulting genera based on their most probable energy source i e iron nitrogen or others fig 6 and table s3 based on the reported physiologies of the respective genus the relative contribution of individual proteins of interest was estimated by grouping all proteins with the same ko number and summing up all the corresponding relative abundances the protein based quantification of nitrogen metabolizing guilds revealed a clear increase in their relative abundance in the lower sections of sf and in df2 with a marked stratification in df2 fig 6 in analogy with the ex situ activities fig 4a the genes of core nitrogen metabolisms nitrification denitrification and dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonium dnra were present in all samples figure 7a table s2 and the abundance of the corresponding proteins was higher in the downstream sections of both systems specifically the key proteins for nitrification ammonia monooxygenase amoabc and nitrite oxidoreductase nxrab were present in all samples conversely hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao was found at much lower abundances and only in some sections while its coding gene hao was ubiquitously present in terms of denitrification nitrite reductase nirk or nirs was the only detected protein even if most genes i e nitrate reductase narghi nitric oxide reductase norbc and nitrous oxide reductase nosz were found in the metagenome of all sections in analogy dnra genes were found in most metagenomes but none of the corresponding proteins were detected data not shown table s2 consistent with the iron concentration profiles and the coating composition along sf fig 2 putative iron oxidizers were most abundant in the first section of sf sf t fig 6 in turn surprisingly low abundance of iron oxidizers was found in df1 despite all iron being removed in this filter this observation coincides with low overall biomass abundances in df1 t and df1 m calculated as the sum of normalized spectral counts of each section divided by the sum of spectral counts of all samples combined as compared to the other filters fig s3 genes encoding for putative iron oxidizing proteins cyc2 cyc1 mtoabc based on fegenie garber et al 2020 were present in all sections yet the corresponding proteins were only found in sf and df2 fig 7 b other putative iron oxidizing genes i e foxabc foxeyz and pioabc garber et al 2020 were not detected in any sample lastly putative manganese oxidizing genes were spread across all samples with no evident correlation with filter operation but no expressed proteins were detected 4 discussion two full scale drinking water treatment plants were chosen to unravel the interaction between physicochemical and biological processes and their distribution along the height of rapid sand filters rsfs while treating groundwater with similar compositions the first plant employed a single filter with an anthracite layer on top of a quartz sand core and the second comprised a double filter configuration containing quartz sand only in situ and ex situ quantification of iron manganese and ammonium removals were combined with the characterization of the corresponding filter media coating genomic and proteomic profiling along the filter height was used to compare the metabolic potential i e genes encoding for certain proteins with the actual metabolism i e expressed proteins of the underlying microbial communities 4 1 backwash driven filter media mixing results in compartments with homogeneous coating and genetic fingerprints both sand filtration systems exhibited highly comparable operational performances and harboured microbial communities with surprisingly similar taxonomic and functional profiles iron was removed in the first sections being it the anthracite top layer in the single filter system or the first filter in the double filter configuration while ammonium and manganese removal occurred primarily in the downstream sections fig 2 spatial separation between iron and manganese removal has often been reported in rapid sand filters bourgine et al 1994 gouzinis et al 1998 and it is commonly attributed to the different ph oxidation reduction potentials required for their oxidation and precipitation pacini et al 2005 also the mineral coating composition is often used as a proxy to localize where removals occur during the lifespan of a filter gülay et al 2014 consistently we observed the process compartmentalization clearly reflected in the coating composition of the filter media of both studied systems iron and manganese oxides dominated the first and the downstream sections of each system respectively fig 2 with coating amounts comparable to other dwtps breda et al 2019 moreover both the manganese coating mass and the removal rate constants were rather constant in all sections devoid of iron fig 3 as the physicochemical oxidation of manganese is directly proportional to the available concentration of manganese breda et al 2019 katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 manganese oxide coating was expected to decrease along the filter height in contrast we observed homogeneity of coating thickness within the manganese removing compartments of both filter systems which is likely the result of filter media mixing during backwash ramsay et al 2021 the observed compartmentalization of in situ removal rates and metal oxide coating types was also supported by the taxonomic classification of the shotgun metagenomics derived contigs fig 5 and by the distribution of genes encoding for proteins involved in the oxidation of iron ammonium and manganese fig 7 the relative abundance of families commonly associated to the oxidation of iron gallionellaceae gülay et al 2018 and nitrogen nitrosomonadaceae and nitrospiraceae fowler et al 2018b in rsfs were higher in the top and downstream sections of each dwtp respectively fig s1 moreover their distribution within each compartment was relatively homogeneous fig 5 suggesting that microbial growth on the available substrates in each section is slower compared to the frequency of backwash filter media mixing similar spatial separation between iron and ammonium removal bourgine et al 1994 w de vet et al 2009 sharma et al 2005 but low heterogeneity in genome based microbial community compositions have been observed along the height of different filters previously bai et al 2013 tatari et al 2017 w de vet et al 2009 ascribed this phenomenon to the accumulation of iron hydroxide flocks in the filter media and phosphate de vet et al 2012 or copper wagner et al 2016 limitation have also been shown to hinder nitrification in rsfs while the direct impact of iron oxides needs further investigation our work allows to rule out the impact of nutrient limitations in the investigated dwtps as full nitrification was not suppressed but simply spatially delayed taken together these results provide solid evidence that irrespective of treatment configuration being it a dual media single filter or single media double filter setup processes compartmentalize along filter heights the fact that anthracite and quartz sand remained clearly separated in the single filter after over one year of operation also proves the effectiveness of dual media filtration in spatially separating processes and its equivalence to two filters in series moreover the homogeneity of media coating and genome based microbial community composition within each compartment highlights the process wise relevance of backwashing filter media mixing 4 2 protein abundance profiles reflect biological activity stratification and substrate gradients in stark contrast to the clear intra compartment homogeneity in situ iron ammonium and manganese concentration profiles fig 2 and ex situ biological ammonium oxidation rates displayed a strongly stratified profile within the different filter compartments fig 4 to investigate the discrepancy between the stratified activities and the homogeneous metagenome based distribution of iron ammonia and manganese oxidizing genes fig 7 we employed shotgun metaproteomics to quantify the relative abundance of the encoded proteins along the filter heights as proxy for in situ biological activity stratification patterns in ex situ and in situ ammonia oxidation rates similar to the ones observed in sf and df have been reported in sand filters treating water with tatari et al 2013 2016 and without lee et al 2014 iron and have been attributed to the progressive decrease in ammonium concentration along the filter height w de vet rietveld et al 2009 we detected higher protein based relative abundances of putative nitrifying microorganisms in the downstream sections where most ammonia oxidation occurs and we even observed a clear stratification in df2 where all three investigated filter sections were devoid of iron fig 6 importantly the same decreasing trend could also be observed in the abundance of the core enzymes of nitrification i e ammonia monooxygenase amoabc nitrite oxidoreductase nxrab and nitrifier assigned nitrite reductase nirk used here as proxy for the actual nitrifying activity of the microbial community fig 7 in analogy the protein based relative abundance of putative iron oxidizing bacteria was the highest in the anthracite layer of sf fig 6 the only section where contigs of the gallionellaceae family the most common iron oxidizing bacteria de vet et al 2011 were found in terms of specific enzymes the only detected fe oxidizing protein with a proven function was the c type cytochrome cyc2 castelle et al 2008 a protein reported to be conserved in most neutrophilic iron oxidizers mcallister et al 2020 no other iron oxidizing protein was detected and likely due to the still limited biochemical characterization of this process only few of the known iron oxidizing genes reviewed by garber et al 2020 were found the surprisingly low relative abundance of proteins assigned to putative iron oxidizers in df1 fig 6 could in principle suggest a dominance of abiotic processes controlling iron oxidation in this filter however the overall protein recovery in df1 was significantly lower than in all other sections this could possibly be ascribed to iron oxides hindering protein extraction as seen by barco edwards 2014 yet this was not encountered in the iron removing sf t section thus the reason for the low protein yield in df1 as well as the extend of contribution of biological iron oxidation to overall iron removal deserve further investigation ultimately the absence of proteins involved in manganese oxidation despite the presence of the corresponding genes suggests an abiotic dominated process in strong agreement with the homogeneously distributed first order rate constants fig 3 in conclusion the quantification of expressed proteins allowed us to resolve the often reported dichotomy between on the one hand the intra compartment homogeneity of the mineral coating and genome based microbial community composition and on the other the marked stratification of the concentration profiles and biological activities we hypothesize that backwashing results in mixing and homogenization of the filter media and thereby exposes the attached microorganisms to a different substrate load in response microorganisms adjust their metabolic fluxes by adapting their protein pool at a faster rate than the mixing frequency conversely the actual microbial growth between mixing is minimal and does not result in detectable changes at the genome level beyond rapid sand filters these results prove the potential of metagenome guided metaproteomics as a powerful tool to understand metabolic interactions in highly dynamic ecosystems 5 conclusions in this work we compared two full scale drinking water treatment plants to resolve the interaction between the physicochemical and biological processes controlling ammonium iron and manganese removal the first plant employed a dual bed anthracite and quartz sand single filter the second two single bed quartz sand filters in series both plants treated groundwater with similar chemical composition the combination of biological activity measurements mineral coating characterization and multi omics profiling led to the following conclusions both systems exhibited comparable performances and clear process compartmentalization with iron being fully removed in the first sections and ammonium and manganese primarily in the downstream ones the mineral composition of the media coating reflected the compartmentalization of processes i e iron and manganese oxides dominated the first and downstream sections of each system respectively the homogeneity of media coating and genome based composition of the microbial communities within each compartment highlighted the process wise relevance of backwashing filter media mixing only protein abundance profiles reflected the intra compartment removal stratification strongly highlighting the potential of metaproteomic approaches for studying highly dynamic ecosystems dual media single filters and series of single media filters are equivalent from an operational and ecological perspective and anthracite and sand remain separated despite frequent backwashing ultimately the combination of in situ and ex situ physical chemical and biological

15009,clean soil is a potential capping material for controlling internal nutrient loading and helping the recovery of macrophytes in eutrophic lakes but the long term effects and underlying mechanisms of clean soil capping under in situ conditions remain poorly understood in this study a three year field capping enclosure experiment combining intact sediment core incubation in situ porewater sampling isotherm adsorption experiments and analysis of sediment nitrogen n and phosphorus p fractions was conducted to assess the long term performance of clean soil capping on internal loading in lake taihu our results indicate that clean soil has excellent p adsorption and retention capacity as an ecologically safe capping material and can effectively mitigate nh4 n and srp soluble reactive p fluxes at the sediment water interface swi and porewater srp concentration for one year after capping the mean nh4 n and srp fluxes of capping sediment were 34 86 mg m 2 h 1 and 1 58 mg m 2 h 1 compared 82 99 mg m 2 h 1 and 6 29 mg m 2 h 1 for control sediment clean soil controls internal nh4 n release through cation mainly al3 exchange mechanisms while for srp clean soil can not only react with srp due to its high al and fe content but also stimulate the migration of active ca2 to the capping layer thus precipitating as ca bound p ca p clean soil capping also contributed to the restoration of macrophytes during the growing season however the effect of controlling internal nutrient loading only lasted for one year under in situ conditions after which the sediment properties returned to pre capping conditions our results highlight that clean ca poor soil is a promising capping material and further research is needed to extend the longevity of this geoengineering technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eutrophication internal nutrient loading capping ca poor clean soil sediment water interface shallow lakes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction eutrophication of lakes arising from excessive nitrogen n and phosphorus p input leads to harmful algal blooms and retrogressive lake evolution bullerjahn et al 2016 the algae compete for light with submerged vegetation causing a shift from a macrophyte dominated lake to algae dominated this leads to degradation of the physical and chemical environment beyond the point where self recovery is possible with the lake becoming green turbid and foul smelling and potentially threatening drinking water sources guo 2007 scheffer and nes 2007 geo engineering solutions typically focus on controlling the input of external nutrients however even once these are reduced or stopped there can be persistent release of internal n and p loads that may continue to cause eutrophication for years or even decades spears et al 2014 watson et al 2016 research has shown that both n and p can be limiting nutrients and hence controlling both is the most effective way to limit eutrophication cotner 2017 paerl et al 2016 in situ capping of lake bed sediment is considered a cost effective technology for effectively isolating sediment nutrients and preventing or severely reducing their release gu et al 2017 lurling et al 2016 capping materials can include artificially chemically modified adsorbents such as lanthanum modified bentonite phoslock copetti et al 2016 iron modified zeolite zhan et al 2019 and hydrous aluminum oxide li et al 2017 however depending on the ph of the lake these can lead to undesired chemical releases including of toxic trivalent aluminum ions al3 at ph 6 or release of lanthanum peterson et al 1976 figueiredo et al 2022 capping materials that cause conditions to become more alkaline can lead to the conversion of nh4 n into nh3 which is toxic to biota balancing the available active ions in a chemically modified capping layer with the available nutrients that need locking up e g srp is difficult but important because excess capping material capacity will lead to potential toxicity from the al la and nh3 gibbs and hickey 2018 iron modified capping materials can be effective but they tend to form sediment fe p which is easily dissolved and released under seasonal hypoxia yang et al 2020 the use of natural clean soil as a capping material can avoid these potential toxic chemical side effects reducing both internal nutrient release and sediment resuspension with excellent ecological safety pan et al 2012a zhong et al 2022 evaluation of the efficiencies of capping materials for preventing nutrient release are generally conducted under laboratory conditions and or with short term small scale field trials both approaches are limited because natural lakes are subject to seasonal and episodic hydrodynamic and temperature fluctuations which in turn alter the sediment stability and lake biogeochemistry significantly longer term field testing is essential to thoroughly test the efficacy of capping approaches to control internal loading shallow lakes are characterized by frequent hydrodynamic disturbances that lead to resuspension and deposition of bed sediments and the deposition of nutrient rich suspended particular matter spm xu et al 2017 this presents a challenge for using capping layers to control internal release of nutrients because these caps themselves can be remobilized liu et al 2019 2016 re suspension events create fresh sediment water interfaces that can be highly reactive leading to a pulse of nutrients being released at the same time the material that is removed becomes spm mainly comprised of inorganic metal enriched particles and organic matter with large reactive surface area for binding any dissolved n and p these particles and any nutrients they have scavenged then settle out of the water column to be re deposited on top of the newly formed sediment water interface ultimately burying it again huser et al 2016 yu et al 2017 lakes that are subject to significant input of external spm will have the potential for this particulate material to remove nutrients from the water column into the bed sediment where they may later become released once buried and conditions change the long term effectiveness of sediment capping under in situ lake environments is poorly understood lin et al 2019 hence in this study a three year experimental monitoring approach was adopted with in situ control enclosures uncapped compared against enclosures where the sediment was capped with clean soil nutrient fluxes porewater nutrient profiles and nutrient fraction transformations were monitored to understand nutrient dynamics and the impact of capping the aim was to understand the impact of long term in situ capping with clean soil on nutrient release and hence to provide a reference point for this approach to the management of waterbody eutrophication 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and material description the field enclosure experiment was conducted in shiba bay fig 1 in the northern part of lake taihu china lake taihu is situated on the yanqtze delta in a highly industrialized and economically developed area of eastern china the lake is relatively shallow 1 5 m impacted by the southeast monsoon and prone to annual cyanobacterial blooms severe algal deposition and water quality problems which have led to the severe accumulation of internal nutrient loading qin et al 2007 the clean soil material used for capping was collected on the shore of shiba bay at wuxi city air dried and passed through a 40 mesh 380 μm screen before being applied table 1 shows its detailed composition notably clean soil has a lower ca content than the native lake sediments 2 2 field enclosure experiment design and sampling fig 1 shows the location of the field enclosures and the sampling sites within the enclosures a 70 000 m2 treatment and a 50 000 m2 control enclosure were constructed with polyvinyl chloride pvc aiming to prevent material exchange with the external water body in the treatment enclosure several sub enclosures were established including clean sand ca poor soil chitosan modified soil capping etc for ca poor soil capping treatment pre processed clean soil for capping was sprayed into one enclosure water body and left to sink to the surface of the sediment producing a capping layer of 5 cm to 10 cm thickness fig s1 this capping layer depth was based on our previous experimental work to prevent resuspension pan et al 2012a 2019 which suggested a minimum of 1 cm and the aim to allow macrophyte growth which requires 5 10 cm for establishment and anchoring of roots the control enclosure without capping was located adjacent to the capping enclosure capping was undertaken in january 2010 in situ porewater samples were collected 450d 360d 150d and 90d prior to capping and both porewater samples and intact sediment cores were collected 60 d and 30 d pre capping as well as 30d 60d 90d 180d 270d 360d 480d 570d and 660d post capping the in situ porewater equilibration sampling devices peepers were placed through the swi by fixing to bamboo poles fig s1 and left to equilibrate for 15 d before being retrieved intact sediment cores were sampled using a gravity core sampler 90 mm diameter 60 cm length rigo co ltd japan all porewater samples and sediment cores were transported to the laboratory within 6 h for subsequent experiments incubation experiments on intact sediment cores were used to measure fluxes of nh4 n and srp at the swi under in situ temperature and do conditions details of the sediment core incubations and in situ peeper experiments are given in the supplementary material additionally triplicate sediment cores were also collected for the analysis of sediment oxygen demand

experiments the top 0 2 cm of the sediment cores were sliced for surface sediment properties analysis fresh sediment subsamples were used to analyze the total microbial activity of sediments according to the method described by schnürer and rosswall 1982 then three surface sediment samples were pooled and homogenized to obtain a representative sample for further analysis the fresh surface sediment was lyophilized under a vacuum and ground then passed through 0 150 mm sieves and stored at 4 c until subsequent analysis the total nitrogen tn content of surface sediment was analyzed by the alkaline potassium persulfate oxidation method chinese epa 2002 sediment dissolved inorganic nitrogen din including nh4 n no3 n and no2 n was extracted by 2 mol l kcl and analyzed by uv spectrophotometer shannon et al 2011 acid microwave digestion was used to determine al fe ca mn ni zn cu and cr by icp aes rukun 1999 sediment organic matter content was measured as loss of ignition loi and determined

al p organic p org p other inorganic p ca p and residual p res p sediment total p was calculated as the sum of above fractions further details of the extraction process are given in fig s2 in the supplementary materials 2 4 phosphate adsorption isotherm experiments phosphate adsorption isotherms were determined using the method and calculation procedures in pan et al 2002 2013 and yu et al 2017 briefly 0 5 g of the processed surface sediment was added to 40 ml of the solution and mixed in 50 ml polyethylene tube the p concentration gradient of the solutions was set to 0 0 05 0 2 0 5 1 2 5 and 10 mg l the mixture was incubated for 48 h in a constant temperature shaker at 180 rpm and 25 c after the incubation the supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 5000 rpm and filtered through a gf c membrane for analysis finally the maximal adsorption capacity qmax mg g and zero equilibrium p concentration epc0 mg l were calculated by the non linear form of the langmuir equation to characterize the p adsorption capacity of surface sediments 2 5 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova with tukey s post hoc test was used to identify the significant differences in nutrient fluxes porewater nutrient concentrations and sediment properties between control and capping treatment pearson s correlation analysis was used to examine the relationships between nutrient fluxes and environmental variables significant difference was set at the p 0 05 level statistical analysis was performed using spss 25 0 ibm new york usa 3 results 3 1 characteristics of clean soil and surface sediment the physicochemical characteristics of the clean soil and surface sediment are shown in table 1 and fig 2 the results show that the clean soil is characterized by lower organic matter loi tp and tn and ca content with slightly higher al and fe content than the surface sediment table 1 fig 2 this plays a role in systematic differences measured between the capping sediment and uncapped control sediment 30 days post capping where the average values of the former are 95 loi 46 tp 52 tn 31 ca 110 al and 130 fe of those of the latter furthermore lower mn ni zn cu and zr contents were measured in the clean soil indicating its suitability as an ecologically safe capping material when the ca poor soil was introduced into the waterbody the contents of tp and ca in the capping sediment increased rapidly within 60d after capping from 344 mg kg 1and 2 02 mg g 1 to 644 mg kg 1 and 5 13 mg g 1 respectively table 1 the sediment oxygen demand sod of both capping and control treatment showed significant seasonal variability within one year of capping fig s3 the highest sod rates appeared in summer 180d and capping and control treatment only showed significant differences in summer the total microbial activity of the control sediment showed significant seasonal variation fig s4 and was highest in summer 180d while the capping sediments did not show significant seasonal variation consequently a significant difference between microbial activity in the capping and control treatments was only found in summer 3 2 fraction of n and p in capping and control sediments the variation of din of the surface sediment in control and capping sediments is shown in fig 2 sediment nh4 n content decreased significantly after capping reaching 57 of control sediment values 30d post capping and then increased before further fluctuation sediment tn also decreased post capping but then increased to levels similar to the control no significant difference was observed in no3 n and no2 n between control and capping sediment the variation of different p fractions in control and capping sediments were displayed in figs 3 and s5 the dominant surface sediment p fractions were fe p al p and ca p prior to capping averaging 27 20 24 55 and 22 49 respectively the capped sediments then evolved such that al p fe p and res p became the dominant fractions averaging 31 44 21 79 and 15 70 respectively furthermore beyond 30d after capping the inert p the sum of al p ca p and res p in the capping sediment increased significantly compared with the control sediment averaging 62 60 of tp fig s5 sediment ca p content increased from 2 00 mg kg at 30d post capping to 104 29 mg kg at 660d post capping a 50 fold increase respectively fig 3 positive correlations p 0 05 were found between sediment ca p tp and ca content between fe al and res p and also between al p and nh4 n and nh4 n and tn fig s6 significant negative correlations p 0 05 were found between res p fe and ca p content and between fe al and no3 n content except for between res p and fe and fe and al content in the sediment 3 3 phosphate adsorption capacity of capping and control sediments a langmuir model was used to fit the equilibrium adsorption data of srp on the surface sediment and clean capping soil pan et al 2002 results are shown in fig 4 and detailed parameters are listed in table s1 epc0 of the capping sediments was significantly lower than that of the control sediment furthermore the qmax values for the control and capping sediment were 0 2 mg g to 0 31 mg g and 0 24 mg g to 0 35 mg g respectively and the clean soil was 0 36 mg g kp values for retention capacity of solid phase for srp were 0 03 l g to 0 54 l g and 0 43 l g to 4 27 l g for the control and capping sediment respectively and the clean soil was 6 75 l g all the above parameters show that the capping sediment was characterized by greater p adsorption and retention capacity than the control sediment except at the end of the 660 day experiment 3 4 nutrients porewater concentrations and fluxes across the swi the temporal variation of control and capping sediment porewater nutrient concentrations with sediment depth are shown in figs 5 and 6 for nh4 n the pre capping sediments show a good degree of homogeneity with similar profiles of low overlying water concentrations and then increasing concentrations with depth below the swi reaching a stable value at about 10 cm with steeper gradients during the warmer sampling periods post capping nh4 n profiles remain largely unchanged in both control and capped systems which show no significant differences for srp the pre capping profiles show similar sharp increases in concentration immediately below the swi and generally peaked at about 2 cm to 5 cm with variations reflecting temperatures of sampling periods post capping profiles show clear differences between the control sites and the capped sites capping caused burial of previous srp peaks and then a homogenization of profiles at lower levels of srp which took a long period 1 year to re establish diffusive gradients fig 7 shows nh4 n fluxes across the swi in the control sediment varied from 3 08 1 03 mg m 2 h 1 to 300 68 53 95 mg m 2 h 1 peaking at 180d post capping in summer capped sediments exhibited similar temporal patterns varying from 4 16 1 31 mg m 2 h 1 to 107 57 40 mg m 2 h 1 with a peak at 180d and second smaller peak 23 82 12 11 mg m 2 h 1 at 570d in summer all measurements showed nh4 n efflux from the sediment to the overlying water capping significantly p 0 05 reduced nh4 n efflux for one year compared to control sediments but this effect disappeared thereafter srp fluxes of control sediment fig 7 show similar temporal trends to nh4 n fluxes varying from 0 24 0 04 mg m 2 h 1 to 26 97 1 91 mg m 2 h 1 with a first peak at 180d post capping and second smaller peak 9 93 4 10 mg m 2 h 1 at 570d post capping in summer srp fluxes in the capped sediment switched from effluxes to influxes from 90d reaching a maximum influx of 4 94 2 17 mg m 2 h 1 at 180d post capping before then switching back to effluxes with a peak of 9 05 2 94 mg m 2 h 1 at 570d fluxes were therefore significantly p 0 05 different to controls for the first year but this difference disappeared during the second year notably a significant p 0 05 positive correlation was obtained between srp flux and sediment fe p content fig s6 4 discussion 4 1 clean soil capping controls nh4 n and srp fluxes at the swi in this study fig 7 shows that clean soil capping produces an average of 31 reduction of internal nh4 n fluxes from the sediment for one year simultaneously capping caused srp fluxes to switch from efflux to influx for one year after capping with the source sink transition between overlying water and sediment overall clean soil capping effectively controlled internal nh4 n and srp release for up to one year but not thereafter the diffusion of n and p from sediment to overlying water mainly depends on the concentration gradient at the swi higher nh4 n fluxes across the swi consistent with higher porewater nh4 n concentrations were measured in warm seasons fig 7 where the elevated temperature enhanced rates of microbial activity fig s4 increasing the mineralization of organic matter depleting dissolved oxygen and enhancing anaerobic conditions with sediment depth fig s3 ding et al 2018 a combination of enhanced degradation of organic matter and reduced nitrification caused increased accumulation of nh4 n leading to steeper pore water gradients and enhanced efflux beutel 2006 zhong et al 2021 reduced nh4 n effluxes in the capping sediment compared to the control were likely due to the clean soil providing additional cation exchange capacity that led to sorption of nh4 n when diffusing across the capping layer this ultimately reduced the nh4 n concentration of the overlying water leyva ramos et al 2008 pan et al 2012b zhan et al 2019 in parallel clean soil capping resulted in a reduction in porewater srp concentration and a switch from srp effluxes to influxes this result is attributed to the immobilization of srp by the clean soil prior to capping srp was being liberated at depth due to anaerobic conditions most likely through a combination of release from degrading organic matter and release from iron oxyhydroxides during microbial iron reduction tammeorg et al 2020 addition of clean soil caused a reduction in srp generation at depth and led to the sediment becoming a sink for p thus the srp concentration of the overlying water was effectively reduced pan et al 2012b pan et al 2019 this is most likely due to oxygenated soil containing abundant iron oxides and other reactive surface sites causing simultaneous retardation of anerobic microbial activity and sorption of srp hinsinger 2001 moore et al 1994 the increased srp influx during warmer sampling periods is likely due to enhanced microbial degradation during those periods producing more srp available to be locked up by the sediment iron oxides fig 7 s3 and the lack of accumulation of srp in the pore water suggests there are sufficient iron oxides in the sediment to immediately adsorb any srp produced this is further supported by the good srp sorption and retention capacity of the clean soil fig 4 table s1 the above processes explain why srp fluxes were significantly positively correlated with sediment fe p content with smaller srp influx at higher fe p content moreover porewater srp concentrations of capping sediment within 10 cm reduced to range from 0 0005 mg l 1 to 0 40 mg l 1 compared to 0 04 mg l 1 to 1 84 mg l 1 in control sediment indicating the presence of a static layer directly below the swi after the clean soil capping which has been confirmed to play a key role in controlling internal p desorption and mobilization from the sediment to overlying water across the swi wang et al 2017 temporally the internal nh4 n and srp fluxes recovered after one year of capping our results suggest a continuous process of transformation from clean soil to native sediment leading to the return of physicochemical properties towards those of the initial sediment table 1 recovered nh4 n fluxes may attributed to nh4 n being able to transfer across the capping layer unhindered as any cation capacity to absorb it was used up meanwhile a switch of srp influxes to effluxes was detected corresponding with steeper srp concentration gradient at the swi fig 6 which supported the internal srp release wen et al 2020 this was further supported by a weakening of the srp sorption and retention capacity effect of the clean soil fig 4 4 2 underlying mechanisms of clean soil capping to control porewater nh4 n and srp concentrations our results show that clean soil can effectively control porewater srp concentration but not nh4 n concentrations figs 5 and 6 porewater nh4 n concentration is significantly negatively correlated with the sediment al ion content fig s6 thus we deduced that cation exchange between the exchangeable cations in the clean soil al ion and nh4 n in porewater is an important mechanism for the adsorptive removal of nh4 n from the porewater and controls its released from the clean soil sediment caps alshameri et al 2014 lin et al 2013 2014 this is supported by the fact that the clean soil has a higher al and fe content than the sediment and that this reduces with time table 1 finally sediment nh4 n shares the same temporal variation with sediment tn and is also positively correlated with sediment al p content fig s6 this supports the hypothesis that nh4 n is adsorbed by the clean soil this process could release al3 then promoting the reaction of al3 and srp in porewater to form al p fig 8 moreover the aerobic environment caused by clean soil capping could promote sediment microbial activity particularly nitrifying bacteria thus nh4 n is decreased in short term pan et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 however the presence of a large amount of organic n in the sediment fig 2 can quickly replenish the porewater nh4 n concentration which explains why the clean soil capping has limited impact on porewater nh4 n concentrations but can significantly reduce the nh4 n fluxes at the swi vertically the nh4 n concentration in porewater increased with depth in the sediment and reached a maximum stable value at 10 cm which is consistent with our previous study zhong et al 2018 the highly anaerobic conditions at depth are conducive to the accumulation of nh4 n roberts et al 2012 while nitrification is inhibited and denitrification was promoted thus promoting the desorption of no2 n an intermediate product of denitrification from the sediment explaining the negative correlation of sediment no2 n and porewater nh4 n zhong et al 2010a 2010b the possible explanation for the negative correlation with sediment res p content was that capping leads to an increase in ph which promotes the desorption and release of res p zhou et al 2019 fig 6 shows that clean soil capping is effective at controlling porewater srp this can be attributed to the higher fe content of the clean soil table 1 previous studies have confirmed that the ligand exchange of fe oxide hydroxide with srp to form an inner sphere p o fe link plays an important role in srp uptake ajmal et al 2018 cao et al 2016 furthermore since srp and nh4 n coexist in the porewater it is possible that the al3 can be desorbed from the clean soil via cation exchange between al3 on the clean soil and porewater nh4 n allowing it to then react with srp to form al p fig 8 therefore clean soil capping has a better srp adsorption capacity to control internal p release due in part to a combination of the high fe and al present this can be further supported by the significant positive correlation between the sediment fe and al content and sediment res p fig s6 indicating that the presence of fe and al can promote the formation of inert p which is consistent with the result that lower srp concentration was observed in the porewater zhan et al 2019 notably sediment ca content increased from 1 99 mg g to 5 32 mg g over the whole experiment table 1 and the migration of ca could accelerate the chemical precipitation of porewater srp with ca2 to form ca p thereby transforming the porewater srp to sediment inert p lin et al 2011 therefore we conclude that the control mechanism of porewater srp by clean soil capping was likely a combination of srp adsorption due to the higher fe and al content and the co precipitation of ca2 with porewater srp fig 8 clean soil capping can effectively reduce srp concentrations in porewater within one year which was also confirmed by our previous short term work pan et al 2019 however the porewater srp concentrations recovered gradually after one year post capping due to a combination of increased sediment p loading and the weakened p adsorption and retention capacity fig 4 wen et al 2020 4 3 variation of p fractions in surface sediments after capping sediment p release potential is determined by various p fractions in sediment and their relative abundance liu et al 2022 rydin 2000 the upper 2 cm of the control and capping sediment contained different p fractions fig 3 sediment total p tp is the sum of different p fractions fig 3 shows that the tp of capping sediment increased significantly and approached that in the control sediment within the first year after capping while the tp content of control sediment maintained high values throughout this is associated with the isotherm parameters determined by the langmuir equation the qmax and kp decrease from 0 36 mg g 1 to 0 32 mg g 1 and 6 75 l g 1 to 0 43 l g 1 within one year table s1 suggesting the reduced p adsorption and retention capacity of capping sediment mainly due to the reducing difference in the tp content compared to the control sediment lai and lam 2009 wen et al 2020 the variations of different p fractions in the capping sediment were significant previous studies have confirmed that mobile p the sum of nh4cl p fe p and org p is considered algal available and hence a potential internal p loading while inert p the sum of al p ca p and res p is considered a pool of permanent burial p which is hard to release rydin 2000 our results showed that clean soil capping can significantly reduce the mobile p content in the surface sediments figs 3 and s5 nh4cl p corresponds to immediately algal available p which is adsorbed to the surface of sediment particles sun et al 2009 an apparent reduction of nh4cl p in capping sediment was observed reducing from 3 97 mg kg 1 to 1 43 mg kg 1 compared to the control fig 3 suggesting that clean soil capping can effectively control labile p this apparent decrease is attributed to the introduction of clean soil characterized by excellent p adsorption capacity that removes labile p by physical adsorption to soil particulates zhou et al 2019 this phenomenon is further supported by reduced porewater srp concentration within the clean soil capping layer fe p is redox sensitive p which easily released under anaerobic conditions and transformed to potential algal available p chen et al 2015 figs 3 and s5 show a decrease of mobile p in the capping sediment mainly originated from fe p accounting for 128 7 of decreased mobile p and 92 of tp the clean soil characterized by a high fe that promotes the reaction of fe3 with srp to form fe p under aerobic conditions during the cold season and the lack of ca p together then results in the increased ratio of mobile p to tp in the early period after capping microbial activity and sod were promoted by increased temperatures figs s3 s4 leading to anaerobic conditions within the sediment during warm seasons with fe p readily released due to the reduction of fe3 to fe2 wang et al 2016 org p increased slightly early in the experiment but decreased during the warm season accompanied by dissolution of fe p in the uncapped sediment however the opposite variation was observed in capping sediment this indicates different p release mechanisms between control and capping sediment the control sediment being mainly controlled by coupled release of fe p and org p while the capping sediment is dominated by the traditional fe p release process demonstrating the shift of internal p release processes after capping liu et al 2022 sun et al 2022 notably there is a negative correlation between sediment fe and ca p content which gives the likely explanation of competitive adsorption on p by stronger reactive ca2 and fe3 promoting the shift of fe p to ca p a similar phenomenon to that reported by zhou et al 2019 our results show that inert p increased sharply within one year of capping fig 3 which is mainly attributed to the increase of ca p and al p this result indicated that capping is beneficial for the formation of inert p fractions in the sediment li et al 2019 yin et al 2021 which is further supported by the lower porewater srp concentration observed in the capping sediment fig 6 al p is often analyzed together with fe p and while al p is actually more difficult to re release than fe p our result found that sediment al p was positively correlated with sediment nh4 n implying that the released al3 is from cation exchange between sediment al3 and nh4 n in porewater thus promoting the formation of al p rönicke et al 2021 rydin 2000 furthermore the al p content reduced while the ca p content increased after 60d post capping which may be attributed to the actively competitive adsorption of p by ca2 over al3 yin et al 2021 ca p is regarded as permanently buried p and a significant positive correlation was found between sediment ca p and ca content consistent with our result that ca p accounts for 64 07 of the increased tp during the experiment in this study ca poor soil exhibited a similar excellent internal p control ability to ca modified material zhou et al 2019 the underlying mechanism is likely the formation of a ca2 concentration gradient between the ca poor capping layer and native surface sediment which promotes the migration of active ca2 to the capping layer and thus reacts with srp to form a precipitate of ca p compounds fig 8 the above mentioned shift in the release mechanism of coupled fe p and org p to fe p suggests the transformation of algae dominated status to macrophyte dominated status liu et al 2022 thus the precipitation of ca and srp by calcite crusts on the surface of submerged macrophytes might play an important role in increased sediment ca p blindow 1992 sand jensen et al 2021 furthermore the reduced sediment res p suggests the enhanced alkaline environment which would allow ca2 to become the primary srp binding reactant over fe and al and also explains the negative correlation of sediment ca p and res p content wu et al 2022 4 4 implication for the development of ca poor capping material and practical capping geoengineering in this study the large scale field experiment is close to a practical geoengineering project and hence understanding the long term performance is important for decision making in eutrophication management the experimental results indicate that clean soil capping could effectively mitigate internal n and p release from sediment simultaneously for one year fig 7 furthermore clean soil is a natural ecologically safe material that helps to change the algae dominated status of a lake to macrophyte dominated status pan et al 2012a in this study the recovery of submerged macrophytes was observed during the growing season our results indicate that ca poor soil can be used in geoengineering to control internal nutrient loading and provide a better habitat for macrophytes the dominant macrophytes observed were naturally occurring p malaianus and p crispus and their recovery was accompanied by reduced chl α concentrations fig s7 pan et al 2012b previous studies on capping materials have focused on calcium rich material such as heat modified ca rich attapulgite gan et al 2009 natural modified zeolite zhan et al 2019 illite gu et al 2019 and confirmed these have better capacity to control sediment internal p loading and promote the transformation of mobile p to inert p hinsinger 2001 therefore use of clean soil characterized by lower ca content was contrary to the widely accepted view interestingly we found that when ca poor soil is introduced into the water body the ca rich water body will automatically supplement the ca content to the capping layer thus achieving a similar effect to that of ca rich materials this finding leads us to consider the development of ca poor and environment friendly materials for geoengineering the time limited effectiveness of geoengineering in controlling internal nutrient loading continues to plague the successful application of projects we found that n and p fluxes accompanied with surface sediment physicochemical properties recovered one year post capping fig 7 table 1 when the clean soil was introduced into the water body the clean soil gradually transformed to native sediment under the in situ lake conditions for example the ca rich water body will continually supply ca to the ca poor soil thus causing changes in the p forms and ca p shifting process fig 3 in addition considering the background of persistent external inputs the external input spm has high nutrient and organic matter content could continuously deposit upon the capping layer promoting the return of the physicochemical properties of new born swi to the pre capping status wen et al 2020 furthermore surface sediment is prone to resuspension under hydrodynamic disturbance which promotes the potential for deposition of contaminated sediment from uncapped areas to those with capping moreover bioturbation will not only reorganize the sediment vertically to allow the capping material to react with deep sediment xu et al 2017 yin et al 2021 but also can accelerate the mixing of the deposited spm and capping material promoting the sedimentation process of the capping material overall we found that the change in the color of surface sediment clean soil was slow as it transformed from ca poor soil to native sediment after capping fig s8 however the change in the contents of ca and ca p in the surface sediments clean soil was rapid table 1 fig 3 this result suggested that the active migration of substances such as ca and p in the water body rather than sediment disturbance processes and external spm input dominated the recovery of sediment properties and internal loading clean soil as a natural material can effectively control internal loading of nutrients for only one year and promote macrophyte restoration for a longer period the results of our long term enclosure experiment cause us to worry about the long term effects of other functional geoengineering materials future research should focus on the long term effects of functional materials under field condition and how to use management measures to extend the long term effects of geoengineering technology 5 conclusion a three year field enclosure experiment was carried out to investigate the long term performance and underlying mechanism of clean soil capping on internal nutrient loading mitigation clean soil capping can not only reduce internal n and p fluxes and porewater srp concentration for one year but also promote the restoration of macrophytes in a eutrophic lake clean soil characterized with high al and fe content can prevent internal nh4 n release through cation exchange and also has excellent p adsorption and retention capacity furthermore ca poor clean soil has performed better in the control of internal p release via not only high cation capacity to react with srp in the short term but also via stimulating the migration of active ca2 to precipitate with srp thus promoting the burial of internal p in long term however under the in situ conditions of lake taihu the properties of capping sediment will gradually recover to the state of the native sediment ultimately resulting in weakened effectiveness after one year post capping our field enclosure experiment demonstrated that the clean ca poor soil is a promising capping material to control the internal nutrient loading and help the recovery of macrophytes and future research efforts should be exerted to extend the longevity of this
