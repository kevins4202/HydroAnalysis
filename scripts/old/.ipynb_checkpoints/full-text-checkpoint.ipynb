university p o  box 80 021 3508 ta utrecht the netherlands  department of earth sciences utrecht university p o  box 80 021 3508 ta utrecht the netherlands although the fluid invasion process impacts the transport and dispersion of chemicals and contaminants in the resident phase of natural manufactured and biological unsaturated porous media these effects remain poorly understood  in this study we investigate the role of hydrodynamic dispersion in different invasion patterns within the resident phase  while nonidealities in pore structures contribute to mechanical dispersion our findings demonstrate that the interface front s morphology and the invading phase s distribution significantly influence mechanical dispersion within the resident phase  our results show that the complex distribution of the invading phase under unstable displacement greatly affects mechanical dispersion measures such as velocity distribution variance and mean square displacement obtained through particle tracking  the interface also alters hydrodynamic dispersion measures such as the local peclet number and generates extensive diffusion dominated regions across the domain  this ultimately leads to solute trapping between pores that cannot reach the outlet  however under stable invasion mechanical and hydrodynamic dispersion do not deviate significantly from the reference saturated condition  in this scenario dispersion anomalies occur within a short distance ahead of the moving interface beyond which variations become similar to the reference media  keywords transport in porous

of dispersion involving contaminants dissolved minerals pesticides fertilizers dissolved gasses and organic substances in the field of hydrogeology has gained significant attention due to the increased environmental concerns bear 2018; liu et al  2021; yan et al  2020  additionally advancements in numerical methods and experimental facilities have greatly contributed to the development of this knowledge blunt et al  2013; jahanbakhsh et al  2020  at its core hydrodynamic dispersion occurs in a porous medium due to two processes: molecular diffusion which is the mixing caused by random molecular brownian motion and mechanical dispersion which results from variations in velocity causing mass to disperse as velocity changes dentz et al  2016; domenico and scbwartz 1982; fetter et al  1992  these two physical processes become more complex in a porous media due to intricate pore structures and pore space tortuosity leading to smaller values for molecular diffusion compared to non porous media  moreover mechanical dispersion in porous media can be intensified by alterations in transport direction and flow rates caused by nonidealities in the porous medium fetter 1992; patrick a  domenico 1998  less studies have explored dispersion under unsaturated conditions gong and piri 2020; jiménez martínez et al  2020; mohammadmoradi et al  2018 relative to saturated conditions dentz et al  2018 2016; puyguiraud et al  2021 2019  significant advances in mathematical models computational methods and experimental equipment have resulted in more accurate ways to understanding the underlying physics of this phenomena  blunt et al  blunt et al  2013 and wildenschild et al  wildenschild et al  2002 have reviewed possible imaging and numerical techniques for simulating single and multiphase flow and transport  simultaneously with studying dispersion in saturated media in recent years dentz et al  2011; kang et al  2014; souzy et al  2020 there has been a surge of interest in research on dispersion and its dependence on the saturation of the media in unsaturated porous media  in an early study examining dispersion under unsaturated conditions sahimi et al  1986 explored both longitudinal and transverse dispersion across phases by analyzing the statistical distribution of two phase flow in a simple cube network of random radius pores  their main finding was that the dispersivities were dependent on the phase distributions saturation and saturation history  bekri 2002 used the immiscible lattice boltzmann and random walk methods to investigate the effect of peclet number and water saturation on the dispersion in two phase flow in a reconstructed porous media  by utilizing peclet number and water saturation they established general correlations and identified asymptotic values for the longitudinal dispersion coefficient over extended timeframes  later studies hasan et al  2019; jimenez martinez 2017; jimenez martinez et al  2015; karadimitriou et al  2017 have been conducted to demonstrate an increase of solute mixing in invading phase with a decrease of water content which was caused by an increase of flow velocity variation for various pathways  however raoof and hassanizadeh 2013 revealed that the dispersity reaches a maximum value and then decreases with further decrease in saturation using pore scale modeling  additionally many attempts have been made using direct numerical modeling to explore solute transport through various steady state fluid flow configurations aziz et al  2018; hasan et al  2020; jimenez martinez 2017; jiménez martínez et al  2020  almost all studies that explore two phase conditions have focused on the dispersion of solute within the invading phase  furthermore these studies have not addressed dispersion under fully transient two phase flow missing the dynamic behavior of the system aziz et al  2018; gong and piri 2020  invasion of the fluid phases and associated movement of interfaces cause significant changes in the flow velocity field flow paths and tortuosity of the streamlines which controls transport of solute and colloids ahead of the interfaces  the impact of interface dynamics in different invasion regimes on resident phase dispersion has not yet been investigated  prior studies bekri 2002; sahimi et al  1986 do not clearly explain how interface movement alters mechanical and hydrodynamic dispersion and the associated length scales  the absence of dynamic behavior in the interface front across various invasion regimes leaves the areas of the resident phase affected by the invading phase front and the depth of this impact uncertain  gaining insight into the pore scale specifics of a real sand pack sample such as the effects of grain heterogeneity will aid in determining the essential parameters for continuum modeling  as a result a pore scale examination of the invasion process is necessary for a comprehensive investigation of resident phase dispersion  in this study we simulate the dynamics of different invasion regimes to examine the resulting changes in the flow field and solute transport within the resident phase  the primary objective of this study is to assess the influence of the invading phase on the hydrodynamic dispersion of the resident phase  by comparing the region ahead of the interface during the invasion process to saturated cases as a reference we explore the underlying physics of pore scale variations not previously addressed in the literature  several simulations were conducted to perform a systematic study and quantitatively measure the impact of two phase regime effect  the outcomes were then compared with the results obtained under saturated conditions for the same flow velocity serving as a reference case  to examine the influence of various invasion patterns the advection effects and advection diffusion effects were explored separately  the study is divided into three main sections: section 2 presents an overview of the methods utilized to obtain the flow field and solute spreading  section 3 discusses the results and their implications while section 4 provides the conclusions drawn from this study  2 methodology to investigate how the invasion process affects dispersion in the resident phase it is necessary to examine fluid flow and solute transport in both fully saturated and unsaturated media at the pore scale  there are two commonly used methods for simulating pore scale flow: network modeling and direct numerical modeling  pore network modeling simplifies the complexity of pore structures into interconnected simple pores which can result in a loss of detailed information blunt et al  2013; shams et al  2018  to obtain a detailed understanding of the flow field this study uses direct numerical modeling  in the following section we describe the governing equations computational procedure and properties of the computational domain used in this work  2 1 computational domain a two dimensional representation of the computed tomography image of a natural sample of granular sand pack from the previous published work vries et al  2022 is used to perform the direct numerical simulation as shown in fig  1   the computational domain and the generated numerical grid are kept identical throughout this study  presence of a large number of grains in each principal direction provide a large enough domain for our simulations  table 1 provides properties of the computational domain  numerical discretization of the domain is performed using the openfoam utility snappyhexmesh which is capable of producing high quality grids within narrower pore throats and non smooth edges from complex porous media geometry  to study grid independency of results we have performed simulation for different grid resolutions in a sub section of the whole domain resulting in the final number of grids in the table 1 which provides a minimum of ten numerical cells in the narrowest pore throats  2 2 governing equations and numerical methods of saturated simulation conservation of mass and momentum for isothermal and incompressible flow of newtonian fluid is governed by the navier stokes equations as: 1 ∇ · u = 0 2 ∂ ρ u ∂ t + ∇ ·  ρ u u  = − ∇ p + ∇ ·  2 μ e  + f b where u denotes the fluid velocity p the static pressure ρ fluid density and μ fluid dynamic viscosity  f b accounts for all body forces and e = 1 2  ∇ u + ∇ u t  is the rate of strain tensor white 1991  in order to solve the advection diffusion of a passive tracer within the carrier flow eq  3 has been used  3 ∂ c ∂ t + u · ∇ c − ∇ ·  d m ∇ c  = 0 where c denotes concentration of solute and dm is molecular diffusion coefficient  the numerical solution of saturated governing equations was performed using the openfoam open source toolbox jasak 1996  the steady state form of navier stokes eqs  1 and 2 was used to obtain the velocity field at the saturated medium using simplefoam solver  next eq  3 is solved to obtain the transient evolution of solute transport within the steady state flow domain using the scalartransportfoam solver  the advective term was interpolated using the upwind approach which is a first order and explicit method  the diffusive term was discretized using a second order scheme known as gaussian linear corrected scheme and the time derivative was discretized using the euler scheme  because of the sharp gradient of concentration between stagnant and flowing regions the transport matrix was solved using smoothsolver with a small relative tolerance of 10−16 aziz et al  2018  2 3 governing equations and numerical methods for invasion process fundamentally calculating the velocity field in immiscible two phase flow involves solving two separate navier stokes equations   one for each primary phase  a common boundary condition is employed to monitor the interface and depict the development of the two phase system  however this approach necessitates solving the moving boundary problems for each phase which is challenging and extremely time intensive particularly for porous media problems involving intricate pore structures  a more effective alternative for addressing the immiscible two phase flow is the whole domain formulation hirt and nichols 1981  this method treats the two phase system as a single phase system with location dependent properties and replaces the jump condition with an extra force that only operates at the interface  the phase function fx characterizes the spatial distribution of both phases and is defined as follows: 4 f  x  = { 1 with in the wett ing phase   0 with in the non − wett ing phase the interface is represented by the surface of discontinuity of the phase function and it is indicated by the delta function concentrated on the two phase interface and space dependent properties are described by the following equations  5 ρ  x  = f  x  ρ w +  1 − f  x   ρ n w 6 μ  x  = f  x  μ w +  1 − f  x   μ n w ρ x  and μ x  are the density and the dynamic viscosity respectively considering the bulk fluid properties are assumed constant  consequently the immiscible two phase flow is governed by only one set of navier stokes equations which is written as 7 ∂ ρ u ∂ t + ∇ ·  ρ u u  = − ∇ p + ∇ ·  2 μ e  + f b + f s with an extra term f s which represents surface tension forces which is nonzero only at the phase interfaces and describes the effect of the laplace pressure in whole domain approach  as numerical diffusion would smear the interface due to space truncation error a standard finite difference discretization cannot be used deshpande et al  2012  the numerical solution of governing equations of immiscible two phase flow was performed using the openfoam open source toolbox  contrary to the conventional volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 an efficient approach for keeping a sharp interface is applied in interfoam solver in openfoam deshpande et al  2012; henrik rusche 2002 as a nonlinear convective term to overcome the diffusion of the interface which is accomplished by computing the compression velocity with the multidimensional universal limiter with explicit solution mules deshpande et al  2012  to obtain solute transport within the resident phase an advection diffusion eq  3 equation is solved using phasescalartransport as a function object in openfoam toolbox  a flowchart for the two main stages of solute transport in the invasion process is shown in fig  2   the distribution of the immiscible phases is solved first followed by the solute transport process within the resident phase in each time step  2 4 numerical conditions both the top and bottom boundaries of the domain are treated as no flow boundaries  the right boundary maintains a constant pressure and for solute transport simulations a zero solute concentration gradient in the normal direction is assumed  the left or inlet boundary has a set injection velocity and a consistent dimensionless solute concentration for solute transport  initially the domain is completely saturated with the wetting phase and a contact angle of 45° is presumed  the non wetting phase is introduced at a stable flow rate on the domain s inlet face  various simulation scenarios with differing capillary numbers and viscosity ratios were executed  the findings indicate that the new capillary and viscosity ratios did not have a significant impact on the analysis  2 5 validation of the numerical method to ensure reliable simulation results and analysis we evaluated the employed numerical schemes for immiscible two phase flow in invasion processes against experimental data  to verify our model we utilized micromodel experiments conducted by yin et al  2018 which involved exploring two phase flow displacement in a porous medium  by comparing our simulation results with the experimental observations we were able to validate our model and ensure its accuracy  table 3 provides a summary of our model validation approach which involved applying similar geometries and conditions  specifically we investigated the displacement of a resident phase water by a non wetting phase a flourinert solution over time in a porous domain  we obtained the inlet boundary condition for our numerical simulation by analyzing the variable inlet flowrate in the yin et al  experiment from the original images  in the numerical simulation we assumed a relative zero pressure for the outlet boundary condition due to the experimental conditions  the comparison of phase distributions during the invasion process as shown in fig  3  exhibits excellent agreement with the experimental observations  it is worth noting that the validation of openfoam formulations has been the subject of various studies involving diverse porous media for simulating immiscible two phase flow deshpande et al  2012; ferrari et al  2015; ferrari and lunati 2013  3 results we aim to investigate how the invasion process affects the flow field and solute spreading within the resident phase  previous studies by lenormand et al  1988 have highlighted the distinct invasion patterns that emerge based on the capillary number and viscosity ratio m of the two phases  to conduct a thorough analysis under various flow regimes we conducted three simulations: a saturated medium as the reference case along with stable and unstable invasion simulations  table 2 presents the conditions and properties of these simulations  because the simulation of different capillary numbers and viscosity ratios used in this study had no effect on the analysis the findings of a single set of capillary numbers and viscosity ratios are presented here  during a stable invasion process which occurs under high capillary numbers and high viscosity ratios the front of the invading phase advances uniformly with minor irregularities typically only a few grains in size as depicted in fig  4   however a decrease in capillary number or viscosity ratio results in an unstable invasion which is characterized by the development of growing fingers within the medium  these fingers can move either in the direction of the main flow or in the normal direction to it referred to as viscous fingering and capillary fingering respectively an et al  2020; tsuji et al  2016  in this study we consider both types of fingerings as unstable invasions and simulate viscous fingering as an example of an unstable invasion  to ensure a fair comparison of different invasions against the reference case properties must be utilized that maintain the same velocity despite variations in capillary numbers  the study findings are divided into two sections  the first section focuses on the effect of invasion on mechanical dispersion while the second section examines the impact of invasion on hydrodynamic dispersion in the resident phase  through this approach both aspects of the invasion s impact on dispersion are explored and discussed  3 1 mechanical dispersion the presence of nonidealities in pore structures such as variations in grain size distribution morphology and topology pore and grain arrangements can lead to velocity fluctuations and increase mechanical dispersion  although the pore system parameters remain consistent across all models in this study variations in flow regime result in diverse flowlines local velocity distributions and ultimately discrepancies in mechanical dispersion  the next section examines and compares the degree of mechanical dispersion in the resident phase with the reference case  3 1 1 velocity variations fig  5 a displays the velocity distribution within the resident phase during stable invasion stb over normalized time values of 0 08 0 20 0 32 and 0 44 compared to the reference case of flow under saturated conditions sat  the corresponding invading phase distribution profiles during stable invasion are also shown  although the fraction of velocities with negative values increases over time due to small irregularities there is no significant difference between the four stable displacements and the reference case for velocity distributions  a rather uniform interface characterized by a stable invasion serves as a relatively uniform boundary condition driving the flow results in a minor disruption specifically less than 2 5 percent in the velocity field of the resident phase  in fig  5b the velocity distribution under unstable invasion event unstb is shown indicating an increase in the generation of velocities with near zero and even negative values due to the generation of fingers and their impact on the velocity field within the resident phase  the velocity distribution tends towards lower and even negative values resulting in transverse movement of fluid streamline in the medium and larger residence times for fluid particles in the domain  contrary to the stable invasion scenario fig  5b demonstrates a noticeable shift in velocity distribution for the unstable invasion instance exhibiting a change of approximately 25% when compared to the reference case  to assess the impact of the invasion process we calculated the variance of velocity values in the resident phase as illustrated in fig  6   under stable invasion the magnitude of velocity variance fluctuates around that of the reference case with less than a 1% difference between the two cases  conversely during unstable invasion we observed a rapid decline in velocity variance due to the emergence of finger structures within the resident phase  in an unstable invasion the variance values approach zero at the last time step as depicted in fig  6 with nearly 98 percent of the velocity values falling into bins close to zero  the interquartile range which serves as a statistical indicator of local velocity distribution demonstrates a comparable pattern of reduced mechanical dispersion throughout the unstable invasion process as illustrated in fig  6  3 1 2 associated length scales of the invasion in the preceding section we investigated the effects of stable and unstable invasions on velocity variations in the resident phase over time as a measure of mechanical dispersion  however that analysis did not account for the positions and spatial distribution effects within the resident phase and instead examined the deviation of the velocity distribution from the reference case across the entire domain  in this section we aim to explore the length scale of interface induced velocity variations ahead of the interface during stable invasion  we calculated the velocity variations within the resident phase as a function of longitudinal distance from the interface  fig  7 shows the velocity variations over distance for different times  we found that the majority of velocity variations occur within a short distance equivalent to a few grain sizes from the interface  as a result there exists a clear characteristic length for interface induced velocity variations and over larger distances the velocity field converges to that of a saturated media indicating that the impact of interface induced variations diminishes  in fig  7 the orange dashed line illustrates the position of the interface tip where the left side primarily signifies the invading phase and the right side mainly denotes the resident phase  the green solid circles in fig  7 represent the point by point velocity deviation values from the reference case across the entire domain  this figure reveals that significant velocity deviations are mostly focused near the interface front rather than being dispersed throughout the entire resident phase  in other words there is a notable disparity between the orange and blue dashed lines  as demonstrated in fig  7 the blue dashed line is consistently around 2 mm beyond the interface tip for all time steps  the corresponding length scale or the gap between the orange and blue dashed lines which is roughly 2 mm is on the order of a few grain diameters based on the average grain diameter value found in table 2  due to the significant irregularity in the interface it is challenging to determine a distinct length scale for the effect of the invading phase on the resident phase  in simpler terms the highly irregular shape of the interface front during unstable invasion makes it difficult to establish a well defined parameter such as the maximum velocity variation within a related length as was done in the stable invasion analysis  consequently this examination is only applicable to the stable invasion process  3 1 3 lagrangian particle tracking the quantification of mechanical dispersion in porous media can be accomplished through lagrangian particle tracking  to this end we have initialized 25 thousand non diffusive point particles close to the entrance of the resident phase at the onset of the invasion process  by tracking the transient location of each particle we have calculated the longitudinal and transverse mean square displacement msd as a measure of mechanical dispersion while disregarding the effect of diffusion bijeljic et al  2004; bijeljic and blunt 2007  fig  8 a displays the trajectories of the particles and fig  8b presents the longitudinal and transverse msd for all simulated scenarios  our findings indicate that the spreading of particles within the resident phase is similar under stable invasion and reference conditions but deviates in unstable invasion scenarios  while high velocity regions are scarce in unstable invasion low velocity regions are abundant throughout the pore space leading to a reduction in the msd magnitude over time and hence a decrease in mechanical dispersion  the zones with dashed lines in fig  8a highlight the areas where the particle velocity is comparatively high in stable invasion  3 2 solute transport in section 3 1 we investigated and discussed the impact of the invasion process on the advection component of hydrodynamic dispersion specifically mechanical dispersion  in the subsequent section we will examine the impact of the diffusion process  to accomplish this we present and analyze the results of a local peclet distribution analysis and solute transport simulation  3 2 1 local peclet number distribution the porous medium is composed of a large number of interconnected pores each of which can be analyzed separately to determine its local peclet number defined as p e l o c a l = u d   d m  where u is the mean cross sectional velocity within the pore d is the diameter of the pore and dm is the molecular diffusion coefficient  low peclet number values indicate diffusion dominated transport while high values indicate advection dominated transport  transitional values result in a mixture of the two dentz et al  2018  as shown in fig  9  the invasion process can influence the value of individual peclet numbers and their distribution within the resident phase depending on the type of invasion regime  the distribution of local peclet numbers changes as the interface advances across the medium producing variations in hydrodynamic dispersion despite the fact that the macroscopic peclet number p e   = v d   d m  remains constant throughout all invasion cases where v is the average velocity d is the average grain diameter and dm is the molecular diffusion coefficient  the local peclet number distributions in fig  9 show similarities at early stages of invasion but deviate from each other at later stages as time progresses  unstable invasions tend to result in smaller local peclet numbers due to the evolution of complex fingers and the formation of stagnant regions resulting in a diffusion dominated transport mechanism  conversely stable invasions maintain a relatively constant distribution over time  in order to quantitatively evaluate the differences in local peclet distributions we present skewness and kurtosis values as indicators of distribution symmetry and tail behavior for each time step in fig  9  skewness values can fluctuate by as much as 70% during unsaturated invasion while they only change by around 20% in stable invasion scenarios  the deviation of kurtosis values from the mean in stable invasion is approximately 37% whereas in other cases kurtosis values can deviate from the average by as much as 150%  the local peclet number distributions exhibit greater similarities during the early stages of invasion  however as time progresses the distributions deviate from each other  unstable invasions lead to smaller local peclet numbers due to the formation of stagnant regions and the evolution of complex fingers  as a result diffusion dominates the majority of pore spaces in unstable invasions  conversely stable invasions maintain a relatively constant distribution over time  the 2d profiles in each plot illustrate the invasion progress under stable conditions at each time step  the value of skewness and kurtosis are presented in each time step to compare the symmetry and the tail of distribution respectively  the terms stb and unstb stand for stable invasion and unstable invasion respectively  3 2 2 solute transport simulation to examine how the invasion process affects the spreading of solute in the resident phase we injected a pulse of solute that was initially distributed over a vertical strip within the pore spaces  we then conducted simulations to observe the transient solute spreading under different invasion regimes  the simulation results for the reference case stable invasion and unstable invasion are presented in fig  10   notably solute spreading in the resident phase was significantly different under unstable invasion compared to the reference case whereas in the case of stable invasion the concentration distribution was relatively similar to the reference case  the reason for this is that the invading phase did not significantly impact the resident phase under stable invasion leading to minimal changes in the flow field and comparable advection and diffusion processes as illustrated in fig  10  fig  11 compares the longitudinal msd calculated with particle tracking to the longitudinal msd calculated with solute transport simulation which show the same trend particularly at the end times  the early difference in fig  11 is caused by different solute and particle configurations at the beginning of the msd calculation  in addition to examining the spatial distribution of concentrations see fig  10 comparisons between simulations can also be made by analyzing the outflow from different domains such as concentration breakthrough curves btcs  fig  12 shows a comparison of the btcs of concentrations measured at the outlet face of the sample under stable and unstable invasions as well as the reference case  our results indicate that during unstable invasion a significant portion of the solute is confined within the resident phase resulting in only a small amount of solute reaching the outlet  this confinement causes the concentration values to be significantly smaller than those obtained under stable invasion and the reference case  although the distribution of solute under stable invasion is similar to the reference case there are considerable differences between the two  these differences are mainly due to solute confinement within trapped pores in the resident phase  as the invading phase advances a percentage of the resident phase becomes trapped between the grains resulting in the confined solute not reaching the outlet  to further analyze our findings we calculated the total area of the domain covered by concentration values ranging from 0 1 to 1  the evolution of this area in different regimes reveals that solute spreading is smaller in stable invasion than in the reference case but considerably larger values are observed for unstable invasion due to solute confinement within trapped regions in the resident phase  in all scenarios the total area increases due to hydrodynamic dispersion although the slope varies  during unstable invasion as a large amount of solute remains stationary and confined within the pore spaces the plot of the total area reached a relatively horizontal slope over time  4 conclusion in this study we employed a validated openfoam code to investigate the influence of two phase flow invasion processes on hydrodynamic dispersion within the resident phase  a systematic investigation was conducted by performing multiple simulations and quantitatively assessing the invasion effects  results were compared to those obtained under saturated conditions at the same flow velocity which served as a reference case  although a single pore structure was utilized for simulations variations in flow regime led to different invasion patterns resulting in diverse flow lines local velocity distributions and ultimately mechanical dispersion  a relatively uniform invasion front and interface during stable invasion induced minor variations in the resident phase velocity field compared to the reference case  in contrast unstable invasion led to significant velocity fluctuations within the resident phase with values often falling within lower or even negative ranges causing transverse fluid particle movement within the medium  a sharp decline in velocity variations as determined by interquartile range and variance parameters was supported by results from lagrangian tracking of fluid particles  examination of spatial distributions revealed the associated length scale for interface induced velocity variations with major deviations occurring a few grain sizes ahead of the interface  beyond this point deviations diminished and local velocities resembled those of the saturated reference case  the pore space was segmented into pore elements and the distribution of local péclet numbers within these pores served as a metric for hydrodynamic dispersion throughout the entire resident phase  our findings indicated that the local péclet number distribution tended towards lower or even zero value ranges resulting in an increased prevalence of diffusion dominated pores during unstable invasion  solute transport simulations and concentration breakthrough curves validated this observation  under unstable invasion the concentration breakthrough curve revealed the arrival of only a small solute fraction as the majority of mass remained behind the invading front  in the case of stable invasion solute distribution resembled that of the reference case but concentration values were reduced due to solute confinement within trapped pores in the resident phase  these results demonstrated that unstable invasion strongly impacts dispersion mechanisms whereas the influence of stable invasion is confined to a small length scale with deviations gradually diminishing beyond this range  declaration of competing
